(Impression Of Youth)

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,990
For beginners, observation is the first and most important lesson

3
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,480
when learning the techniques of sketching.

4
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:43,580
Pardon me.

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,950
In order to make the painting's expression

6
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,100
reveal clearer light-and-shadow relationship

7
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,660
through careful observation,

8
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,690
we usually highlight the object

9
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,480
by projecting light onto it.

10
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,470
Right, so on a bright surface,

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,860
there will be a brightest spot,

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,260
which is called a specular highlight.

13
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,120
Alright.

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,660
That's all for today.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,410
Class is over.

16
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,720
Xu Luhui.

17
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,220
Please stay a bit after class.

18
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,520
Did he throw something of the teacher's into the sea again?

19
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,289
Let's go.

20
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,509
Luhui, let's talk.

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,670
You're still growing.

22
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,130
How can you skip dinner?

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,530
How should I explain to our deceased parents if you behave like this?

24
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,030
Okay, I got it.

25
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,220
You've even played the parents card.

26
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,470
I'll eat.

27
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,720
Sit.

28
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,710
I know you're a good boy, Luhui.

29
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,370
Look at you.

30
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,390
You haven't been eating properly these past few days.

31
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,430
I specially prepared

32
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,790
all your favorite dishes today.

33
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,930
Come on. Eat.

34
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,290
I no longer like this dish.

35
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,790
It's okay. I'll eat it.

36
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,390
Eat this, and this.

37
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,900
Eat more.

38
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,910
If those two go on like this,

39
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,990
even I will feel suffocated.

40
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,650
Here.

41
00:02:59,210 --> 00:02:59,800
Thank you.

42
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,150
Yu Xing must be very sad

43
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,780
and conflicted now.

44
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,710
How do you think we should help them?

45
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,710
What can we possibly do?

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,730
In a relationship,

47
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,210
you have to face the problems and solve them yourself.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,470
Life is so hard.

49
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,810
Yes.

50
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,530
But I always believe that

51
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,140
all arrangements

52
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,530
are for the best.

53
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,570
So,

54
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,980
stop obsessing over it.

55
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,570
Hello?

56
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,520
Yes. Yes.

57
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,280
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,380
I'll ask Mr. Yu to reply to you as soon as possible.

59
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,550
I'm really sorry.

60
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,210
Thank you.

61
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:11,780
Bye-bye.

62
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,110
Yu Xing, you're such a fool.

63
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,420
Are you giving up your dream just for this relationship?

64
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,170
Luhui, do you want some watermelon?

65
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,670
This watermelon is really sweet, Luhui.

66
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,070
Luhui.

67
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,510
I'm the one who's been ignoring him.

68
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,530
Why am I in so much pain?

69
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,560
Luhui.

70
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,700
You must be really upset because of Luhui.

71
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,390
It's also the first time I've seen him

72
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,530
throw a tantrum for so long.

73
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,900
Have you made up your mind to go to New York?

74
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,110
Every time I think of Luhui's smile

75
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,110
and everything we've been through together,

76
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,110
I feel so reluctant to let go.

77
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,190
Have you ever thought about

78
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,610
what this opportunity means

79
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,230
to you?

80
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,950
My dad is a curator.

81
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,610
When I was little,

82
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,800
in order not to let him down,

83
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,850
I tried my best to draw,

84
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,840
just to get

85
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,850
Dad's attention on me

86
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,890
for a few more minutes.

87
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,270
To make Dad happy,

88
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,480
I became a drawing machine.

89
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,610
All I knew was to

90
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,360
keep drawing every day.

91
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,560
Although my drawing skills got better and better,

92
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:11,990
the more I drew,

93
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,260
(Emerging Fine Art Painting Award)
the more I drew,

94
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,270
(Emerging Fine Art Painting Award)

95
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,240
the more I couldn't feel the joy of drawing.
(Emerging Fine Art Painting Award)

96
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,810
the more I couldn't feel the joy of drawing.

97
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,270
Until one day,

98
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,620
I went to an artist's exhibition.

99
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,270
In those paintings,

100
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,770
I felt the vitality of painting again.

101
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,770
From that moment on,

102
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,720
working with that artist

103
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,350
became the dream of my life.

104
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,330
Yue started to collect my paintings every year

105
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,770
and send them to that artist.

106
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,270
I didn't hear back from him

107
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,490
until this year.

108
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,770
So?

109
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,270
He didn't get the reply until this year,

110
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,770
so he could just easily give up our relationship?

111
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,270
What am I to him anyway?

112
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:58,770
Let me ask you.

113
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,770
Is going to Taipei to study fine arts

114
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,270
your dream?

115
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:03,950
Yes.

116
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,040
And do you remember what I told you?

117
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,020
You should pursue your dream while you're still young.

118
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,020
If drawing is something you truly enjoy,

119
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,600
then give it your all.

120
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,600
Do you think I'm not sad about you leaving here

121
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,870
for Taipei for your studies?

122
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,770
I feel sad too,

123
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,270
and I'm worried

124
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,299
that you may get bullied because you're alone there,

125
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,270
and that you can't take good care of yourself

126
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,270
without me around.

127
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,870
But did I force you to stay

128
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,870
and throw a tantrum at you

129
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,770
for my own selfish reasons?

130
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,520
Do you know how sad Yu Xing has been

131
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,200
these past days because you ignored him?

132
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,670
Seeing him like that, even I feel sorry for him.

133
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,130
He cares so much about you,

134
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,390
and he's so sad because of you.

135
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:08,920
How much longer are you going to keep sulking with him?

136
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,700
Besides, he's going back to Taipei the day after tomorrow, right?

137
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,950
Actually, I envy you,

138
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,150
because you have your own dream.

139
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,140
That day, Bingchen asked me

140
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,300
what my dream was.

141
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,860
I thought about it for a long time, but I didn't know what to say.

142
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,950
Now, you've finally

143
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,450
got the ticket to your dream.

144
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,350
I think you should go realize your dream.

145
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,350
Why am I not happy

146
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,590
now that I've finally got the ticket to my dream?

147
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,040
I know what you want to say to me.

148
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,910
Give me some more time.

149
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,440
I'll make a decision as soon as possible.

150
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,920
Can you really make a decision?

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,330
I've known you for a long time.

152
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,340
You're always like this.

153
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,870
Whenever you encounter something that needs to be resolved,

154
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,000
you'll hesitate and stop moving forward.

155
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,910
If I hadn't pushed you forward,

156
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,150
would you have come this far?

157
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,290
I'm not here to force you to make a decision.

158
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,290
I'm here to tell you

159
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,270
that my application to study abroad has been approved.

160
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,790
I'm going abroad next month.

161
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,790
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

162
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,350
With your current state,

163
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,020
would you have taken it to heart even if I told you?

164
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,210
You didn't tell me. How do you know I wouldn't?

165
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,280
I know there won't be a place for me

166
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,550
by your side anymore.

167
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,600
So, today,

168
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,100
I'm here to say goodbye to my first love.

169
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,770
From now on,

170
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,570
you'll have to face your life and make decisions by yourself.

171
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,160
Don't keep relying on the people around you

172
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,100
to push you forward, okay?

173
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,100
I know.

174
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,370
Yue.

175
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,750
Thank you.

176
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,250
Take care.

Got it?

180
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,260
And the most important thing,

the three sides of sketching,

182

light, shadow, and midtone.

183
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,020
Remember to review it after you go back, okay?

184
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,860
Alright. That's all for today.

185
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,510
There's one more thing I want to tell you.

186
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,800
This is my last class

187
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,050
as your substitute art teacher.

188
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,570
I'm really happy

189
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,700
to have spent this time with you,

190
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,610
and to have met all of you.

191
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:20,680
That's a wrap then.

192
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,570
Class dismissed.

193
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,210
Thank you, Teacher.

194
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,070
Bye-bye.

195
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,460
I'm not just infatuated.

196
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,590
My feelings for you are genuine.

197
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,790
I really love you.

198
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,910
Please don't ignore me, okay?

199
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,780
You should go.

200
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,690
What did you say?

201
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,110
I said,

202
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,610
if working there is your dream,

203
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,360
then go.

204
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,860
Don't worry about me.

205
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,620
Why are you...

206
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,800
Although I really want you to stay,

207
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,540
I can't keep you here

208
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,880
just because of my personal feelings.

209
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,920
Just like how Luxi encouraged me back then.

210
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,260
I know.

211
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,110
I know you must be struggling and feeling conflicted,

212
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,750
just like how I feel because I'll have to leave here

213
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,600
and leave Luxi to study in Taipei.

214
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,490
But you don't have to worry about me.

215
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,420
Don't you know who I am?

216
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,550
I'm Xu Luhui.

217
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:24,780
Go.

218
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,280
Go!

219
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,360
Go!

220
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,070
Go!

221
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,560
Go! Don't look back!

222
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,070
Please, I'm begging you. Go!

223
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,890
If you look back again,

224
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,740
I won't bear to leave you.

225
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,130
Mr. Yu Xing. Mr. Yu Xing.

226
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,520
Your private vehicle has arrived.

227
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,400
Xu Luhui, good for you!

228
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,950
You did really well!

229
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,530
Yu Xing, stop waiting.

230
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,060
Otherwise, you won't be able to make it back to Taipei in time.

231
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,240
Besides, don't you have to go back

232
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,190
to submit your graduation project today?

233
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,300
But Luhui...

234
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,099
Don't worry. I'll take good care of him.

235
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,120
Mr. Yu Xing. Mr. Yu Xing.

236
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,870
Your private vehicle has arrived.

237
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,980
Mr. Yu Xing! Mr. Yu Xing!

238
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,300
Mr. Yu Xing.

239
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,010
Luhui.

240
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,880
Luxi, I'm sorry. I...

241
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,970
I'm just glad you're back.

242
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,660
You've done a great job.

243
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,190
You're brave.

244
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,720
I'll always be proud of you.

245
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,860
If you could have talked to our parents

246
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,600
one last time before they passed away,

247
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,980
what would you have said?

248
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,200
I'd have bidden farewell

249
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,360
properly to them.

250
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,310
Me too.

251
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,320
I would have said

252
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,890
goodbye to them

253
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,850
with a smile.

254
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,620
Go.

255
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,100
Don't wait until it's too late to regret it.

256
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,830
Go and say goodbye properly.

257
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,220
Yu Xing!

258
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,630
Goodbye!

259
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,180
Thank you for having come into my life!

260
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,920
Congratulations, you've graduated.

261
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,680
Thank you, Professor.

262
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,200
Do you like it yourself?

263
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,090
I do.

264
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,020
For outdoor light sketching,

265
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:55,270
we may think

266
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,170
what we are capturing is the light and shadow of the moment,

267
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,670
but by the time we put pen to paper,

268
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,770
the sunlight has already changed countless times.

269
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,110
What we capture

270
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,650
is the light and shadow

271
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,920
that remain in our own hearts.

272
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,900
We paint it layer by layer

273
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,270
based on the impressions in our heart,

274
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,750
letting the fleeting impressions

275
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,560
become eternal

276
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,170
on paper.

277
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,510
My dream... Is not to work in New York.

278
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,650
My dream is you!

279
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,470
(Two years later)

280
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,770
I want to thank the person
(Two years later)

281
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,460
(Two years later)

282
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,740
who has experienced all this with me.
(Two years later)

283
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,320
who has experienced all this with me.

284
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,770
Without his contributions,

285
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,560
there wouldn't be this solo exhibition today.

286
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,920
Through this exhibition,

287
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,010
I hope everyone

288
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,070
can feel this youthful thrill,

289
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,230
and can pursue their dreams bravely.

290
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,090
Look here.

291
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,290
Xu Luhui is here.

292
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,120
Xu Luhui. Xu Luhui.

293
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,660
Can you tell us

294
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,430
what your inspiration for this painting is?

295
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,930
When I was creating this painting,

296
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,180
I just went through a very profound emotional experience.

297
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,180
The first flutter of my heart,

298
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,260
the first deep understanding of myself,

299
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,680
and the first time seeing myself through someone else's eyes.

300
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,180
For me,

301
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,820
this painting is a way

302
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,750
to commemorate my lost youth.

303
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,820
Although my youth has passed,

304
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,500
I made it eternal with this painting.

305
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,040
(Curator: Yu Xing)

306
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:43,610
I'm sorry.

307
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,940
There are no seats available right now.

308
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,310
You might have to wait at the door for a bit.

309
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,990
We'll arrange a table for you as soon as one becomes available.

310
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,580
Okay.

311
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,000
Table 1.

312
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,900
Okay.

313
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,950
Here's your coffee.

314
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,500
Thank you.

315
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,640
Excuse me.

316
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,030
We haven't got our coffee yet.

317
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,300
Coming right up.

318
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,400
Bingchen, hurry up.

319
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,250
Table 4 has been waiting for their coffee for a while.

320
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,910
Got it. Don't be anxious.

321
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,810
How many things are you going to break?

322
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,660
At least not your heart.

323
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,090
Why do you suddenly behave like this?

324
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,720
Don't rush.

325
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,910
You said you wanted Homelike Homestay

326
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,270
to give guests

327
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:46,540
a feeling of coming home.

328
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,540
And for Lanxin Cafe,

329
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,240
I want it to give customers

330
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,040
a sense of healing.

331
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,700
So,

332
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,690
let's take our time,

333
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,150
okay?

334
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,440
But you're really too slow.

335
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,800
Okay, I'll speed up.

336
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,390
Boss, is my coffee ready?

337
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,420
Take our time.

338
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,800
I'm sorry.

339
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,080
We're making it.

340
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,080
Please wait a moment.

341
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,560
Okay, thank you.

342
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,510
Look at this sun.

343
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:33,020
You used to...

344
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,170
Yu Xing. Luhui.

345
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,270
Stop reminiscing there.

346
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,320
Come in and help.

347
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,990
Coming.

348
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,250
Xu Luhui.

349
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,770
Yes.

350
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,560
Why do you like painting?

351
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,260
Because I like to capture

352
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,650
many things, many feelings,

353
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,330
and many people and things I love

354
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,650
through drawing,

355
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,650
and share all of this with those who see my paintings.
