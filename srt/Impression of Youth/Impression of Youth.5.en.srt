00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,990
(Impression Of Youth)

2
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,870
A twin bed room?

3
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,620
Alright. I've registered it for you.

4
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,460
By that time, just take your ID card

5
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,850
and check in with it.

6
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,150
Okay. Thank you.

7
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,470
Brother, I'm back.

8
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,220
You're back.

9
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,830
I'll go back to my room for a rest first.

10
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,460
Brother, how does it feel to like someone?

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,320
How did Xu Luhui find that I like Bingchen?

12
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,280
Why did you suddenly ask me this question?

13
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:19,610
I just want to know it.

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,860
Xu Luxi,

15
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,350
do you not want to tell me?

16
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,220
Oh no.

17
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,539
He found out about it.

18
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,810
Luhui, listen to me first.

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,140
I'm also not sure

20
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,610
whether this is liking someone or not.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,280
But I just want to know him better.

22
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,070
I'll think about him all this time.

23
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,180
And I want to be closer to him.

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,650
Yes!

25
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,240
And then,

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,830
sometimes, I don't dare to look at him.

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,450
Yes.

28
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,450
I'll be afraid of being seen through when he and I

29
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,730
look at each other.

30
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,830
I'll be afraid that he doesn't like me

31
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,919
and has no feelings for me at all.

32
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,740
So I'll want to pretend that

33
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,080
I don't care.

34
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,830
That's right.

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,910
Brother.

36
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,440
Do you think I should confess my love or not?

37
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,360
Why would you confess your love?

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,640
Because I like him.

39
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,210
You like Bingchen, too?

40
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,150
I like Yu Xing.

41
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,960
Yu Xing?

42
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,750
Keep your voice down.

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,410
So you're saying that you like Yu Xing?

44
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,410
Yes.

45
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,180
Wait.

46
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,630
So,

47
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,010
just now, you were implying that you like...

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Yes, I like Bingchen.

49
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,360
Does he know that?

50
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,020
Give him some more time.

51
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,460
After all, it's not that easy to get over the pain

52
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,930
of losing his beloved one.

53
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,200
But I think you should let Yu Xing know

54
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,700
your feelings for him.

55
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:06,990
But...

56
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:11,130
Yu Xing will go back soon.

57
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,890
Don't you also want to study in Taipei?

58
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,960
I don't think if Yu Xing leaves here,

59
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,790
it will become a problem between you two.

60
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,660
I think...

61
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:24,160
whether Yu Xing is leaving or not,

62
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,660
both of us should seize the moment

63
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,510
and express our love bravely.

64
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,260
Don't wait till we regret it

65
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,740
when it's too late.

66
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,860
Come on.

67
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,210
We can strengthen the dark side.

68
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,460
Yes.

69
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,410
Can you see the backlight part

70
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,910
of that plaster statue now?

71
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,480
Yes. Strengthen that part there.

72
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,100
Okay.

73
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,460
You're drawing well.

74
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,450
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

75
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,500
Thank you, guys.

76
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,600
Because of you guys, the construction

77
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,910
of Lanxin Cafe was completed on time.

78
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,660
Eat and drink as much as you can today.

79
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,160
I'll buy more if it's not enough.

80
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,159
Then I'll grill the food first. You guys just eat now.

81
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,220
-Eat more.
-No problem.

82
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,170
Go ahead.

83
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:34,960
I'll help you grill the food.

84
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:36,340
Come on.

85
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,380
When are you going to hold the opening ceremony?

86
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,390
I'll probably hold it on the first weekend of next month.

87
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,220
If you need any help at the opening ceremony,

88
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,130
just let us know.

89
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,190
Thank you.

90
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,580
You fed too much food to it.

91
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,840
Yu Sheng has gained weight.

92
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,100
Luhui.

93
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,790
There are still more than

94
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,310
ten days before I go back.

95
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,310
Are there any other drawing skills you want to learn?

96
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,560
There are still many skills I want to learn.

97
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,330
But I'm worried that these ten days or so won't be long enough.

98
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,270
Don't worry.

99
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,400
I saw the pictures you drew.

100
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,800
You really have a great gift for drawing.

101
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,210
Now you just need to

102
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,120
have a bit confidence in yourself.

103
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,430
Do I look like I'm worried?

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,820
Come on. Who am I? I'm Xu Luhui.

105
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,740
Alright. Xu Luhui, let's have a drink.

106
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,310
Well, Bingchen,

107
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,140
it seems that we're running out of beer.

108
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,230
Let's go buy some beer.

109
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,210
Beer? Isn't there more over there?

110
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,730
Hurry up. The grocery store will be closed soon.

111
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,470
Hurry up. Let's go.

112
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,670
Luxi.

113
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,260
Isn't there still some beer?

114
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,170
Why are we in such a hurry to come out and buy it?

115
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,350
Haven't you noticed that

116
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,120
there's something

117
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,900
between them?

118
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,770
Something?

119
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,710
What is it?

120
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,909
Luhui likes Yu Xing.

121
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,680
They were

122
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,570
flirting with each other just now.

123
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,930
That was why I took you out with the excuse

124
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,300
of buying beer

125
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,140
so that they could have a good chat.

126
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,240
Actually that day,

127
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,050
when Luhui told me that he liked Yu Xing,

128
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,570
he asked me whether he should confess his love.

129
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,520
I told him that both of us should seize the moment

130
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,320
and express our love bravely.

131
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,910
Don't wait till we regret it when it's too late.

132
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,540
It felt like

133
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
I was saying these words to myself, too.

134
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,110
I know it takes some time to forget

135
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,210
the beloved one you've lost.

136
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,490
But have you ever thought about

137
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,270
when you'll be ready

138
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,860
to accept a new relationship?

139
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,450
Do you want to drink it?

140
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,520
I'll fetch it for you.

141
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,850
Wait!

142
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,010
You said that in order to draw figure paintings,

143
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,010
we should observe carefully first.

144
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,409
We should touch and feel it, too.

145
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,850
Now touch my face.

146
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,170
Feel the texture of my skin.

147
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,270
Then can you sense

148
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,700
my feelings for you?

149
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,410
If you want to say no to me,

150
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,910
I won't listen to it.

151
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,910
I just want you to know my feelings.

152
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,910
You don't have to respond to me.

153
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,880
The feelings reflected in your paintings are so strong.

154
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,470
How could I not feel them?

155
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,450
What about you?

156
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,840
Have you sensed

157
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,870
the feelings reflected in my paintings?

158
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,160
Bingchen, I'm really happy that

159
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,930
you can accept me.

160
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
I can accept you?

161
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,220
No.

162
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,170
I mean,

163
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,580
you can open your heart and let me help you.

164
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,790
I'm really happy.

165
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,730
After all, it's been two years since Lanxin passed away.

166
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,160
Moreover, what you said to me that day

167
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,540
made me think a lot.

168
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,870
We have to move on in life.

169
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,280
Let bygones be bygones.

170
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,530
Learn to cherish the current moment

171
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,250
and live every day seriously.

172
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,580
Since Lanxin passed away,

173
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,240
I've been living in the regret of losing her.

174
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,260
But no matter how regretful I am,

175
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,280
I still can't make her come back to life.

176
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,910
So from that day on,

177
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,790
I've always remembered what you said.

178
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,500
Every day, I told myself to

179
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,420
cherish the current moment

180
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,560
and live every day seriously.

181
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,570
It's right for you to think like that.

182
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,770
If Lanxin in Heaven

183
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,270
knows that you're so serious

184
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,270
and live every day so well,

185
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,680
she will be very happy.

186
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:14,020
She will be very happy.

187
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,360
Very happy. Happy.

188
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,420
Very happy.

189
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,760
Luxi.

190
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,000
Luxi.

191
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,710
Luxi.

192
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,350
What am I thinking?

193
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,130
Sir!

194
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,820
One more bottle.

195
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,560
He's drunk.

196
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,770
That was just an accident.

197
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,140
Just cry if you want.

198
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,790
You should smile more.

199
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,450
You look good when you smile.

200
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,940
Bingchen.

201
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,230
Lanxin.

202
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,040
We've promised each other that

203
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,609
after retirement,

204
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,940
we'll go back to your home

205
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,800
and run a cafe in a place

206
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,210
where we can see the sea.

207
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,589
Let's hang in there together, okay?

208
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,560
I'm sorry, Bingchen.

209
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,280
I might have to break my promise.

210
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,080
Lanxin, both of us will be fine.

211
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,630
I'm sure we can do it.

212
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,850
Bingchen.

213
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,510
You still have a long life.

214
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,660
You have to seize the moment

215
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,660
and cherish everything around you.

216
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,940
Do one last thing for me.

217
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,460
Sprinkle my ashes on the beach of my hometown.

218
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,330
Then,

219
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,080
let's promise each other to...

220
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,190
let it go as soon as

221
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,740
it's dawn tomorrow.

222
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,490
Forget me.

223
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,590
Forget me, okay?

224
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,220
Remember to smile more.

225
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,460
Lanxin.

226
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,560
Was it you who brought him to me?

227
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,890
Have you finished taking a shower?

228
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,140
I want to go to the toilet.

229
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:08,940
I'm still taking a shower.

230
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,140
Just come in directly.

231
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,120
I've just finished taking a shower.

232
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,180
I thought you were here to see me.

233
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,740
No.

234
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,560
(Homelike)

235
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,280
Xu Luhui, it's time to get up.

236
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,310
Why do we have to get up so early?

237
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,180
I want to go to the Secret Beach.

238
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,900
I suddenly got some inspiration. Get up now.

239
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,510
Can't we go tomorrow?

240
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,540
No! Get up!

241
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:25,780
No. I want to sleep.

242
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,010
Get up! Will you get up or not?

243
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,260
Will you get up or not?

244
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,160
Let go of me first!

245
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,800
-Okay. Okay. I beg you.
-Will you get up or not?

246
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,790
Xu Luhui.

247
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:06,430
What?

248
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,610
Let me ask you.

249
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,800
What would you think about when you're drawing?

250
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,940
What would I think about?

251
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,470
Nothing.

252
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,640
Woudn't you think about anything?

253
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:17,890
No, I wouldn't.

254
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,890
Then what am I supposed to think about?

255
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,780
For example,

256
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,530
how to apply the first stroke

257
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,400
or how to design the composition.

258
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,470
I've never learned those things.

259
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,680
I just rely on my feelings.

260
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,520
You rely on your feelings?

261
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,660
I only draw things that I have feelings for.

262
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,680
Only after I have feelings will I start drawing.

263
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,870
I'll draw whatever I want.

264
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,500
What are you doing?

265
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,440
Just like this now.

266
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,550
Do you have any feelings?

267
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,800
So kids nowadays are so good at flirting?

268
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,470
Hug me tightly.

269
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,680
Let's go!

270
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,470
Let me ask you.

271
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,400
Why do you like drawing?

272
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,750
Yu Xing, what are you drawing?

273
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,460
I'm drawing about making a pinky promise.

274
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,000
Why are you drawing about making a pinky promise?

275
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,010
I'm drawing about the promise.

276
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,630
In this way, I won't forget it.

277
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,190
In the past,

278
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,690
I wanted to draw,

279
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,560
because I would like to draw about

280
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,530
the most beautiful promise

281
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,150
and make everything

282
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,890
stay at

283
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,580
its most beautiful moment.

284
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,430
But later,

285
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,800
I found that no matter how hard I tried to draw,

286
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,000
I just couldn't find the joy of drawing.

287
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,490
Just feel your heart

288
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,000
and the emotions in it.

289
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,390
Try to express your emotions

290
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,120
with your paintbrush gradually.

291
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,860
Feel my own emotions in my heart.

292
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,920
Bingchen. Bingchen.

293
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,980
Let me massage it for you.

294
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,210
I'm sorry. I was drunk yesterday.

295
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,720
Thank you

296
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,610
for staying with me all night.

297
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,430
It's okay.

298
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,960
Didn't you say that friends should help each other?

299
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,070
Let's go. I'll treat you to breakfast.

300
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,520
Okay.

301
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,280
Xu Luhui!

302
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,310
So you've finished drawing?

303
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,850
That's all for today.

304
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,040
Let's go play with water.

305
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,030
You're so proactive today.

306
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,800
It seems that

307
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,560
everything is too wonderful.

308
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,070
It would be great if everything could

309
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,750
stay at this moment.

310
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:58,480
(Yue)

311
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,680
Tell me when you arrive in Taipei.

312
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,550
Yu Xing will gain the upper hand over you.

313
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:08,820
(Xu Luhui)
Yu Xing will gain the upper hand over you.

314
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,110
(Xu Luhui)

315
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,430
Who is Yue?
(Xu Luhui)

316
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,370
Who is Yue?

317
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,350
Can she stay here tonight?

318
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,150
What about me?

319
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,660
What am I to you?

320
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,770
You big fool!

321
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,080
You will find a new goal

322
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,680
in your life gradually.

323
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,270
And don't worry. You still have me.

324
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,000
That's strange.

325
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,930
Why is it transferred to his voice mail suddenly?

326
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Luhui is missing.
