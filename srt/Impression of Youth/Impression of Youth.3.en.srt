00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,850
(Impression Of Youth)

2
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,400
To this day, I still remember

3
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,400
how sweet that watermelon was,

4
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,900
and how happy I was.

5
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,770
Stop bothering me.

6
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,260
I won't agree to that.

7
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,810
Mr. Yu, dinner is ready.

8
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,820
Time to eat.

9
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,080
Okay.

10
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,700
Hurry up and eat.

11
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,400
Luxi, what's the special occasion today?

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Why did you make so many dishes?

13
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,500
Because I want to celebrate...

14
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,340
Celebrate... Celebrate...

15
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,270
Celebrate the fact that you finally found a drawing teacher.

16
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:23,460
Of course it's worth a feast.

17
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,150
What are you waiting for?

18
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,460
Come on, propose a toast to your teacher.

19
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,520
Okay.

20
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,310
Thank you, Teacher.

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,330
I didn't agree to teach him.

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,340
What's wrong? Can't sleep?

23
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,740
Perhaps I need more time to adjust.

24
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,579
Have a beer. It'll help you sleep.

25
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,180
Thank you.

26
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,970
As for Luhui...

27
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,250
Has he been fond of drawing since childhood?

28
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:45,890
Yes.

29
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,000
Although he always seems inattentive

30
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,680
and childish,

31
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,829
Luhui's actually very delicate inside.

32
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,490
He's a sentimental boy.

33
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,890
He was only ten years old

34
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,600
when our parents passed away.

35
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,630
I didn't expect the 20-year-old me back then

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,500
to actually cry harder than him.

37
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,040
Seeing me cry so hard,

38
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,040
he drew all the happy scenes

39
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,850
we had with our parents for me.

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,040
No matter what happens,

41
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,540
he always has a smile on his face.

42
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,220
He always acts like he doesn't care

43
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,250
and he's happy all the time.

44
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,630
But I know it's just because

45
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,290
he doesn't want me to worry.

46
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,290
He's such a warm and sensible boy.

47
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,690
Remember, compared to showing off your skills,

48
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,390
drawing is more about emotions.

49
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,600
You need to have your own feelings and opinions.

50
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,840
Only in this way can your paintings move others.

51
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,940
Don't worry about Luhui taking the Fine Arts Department entrance exam.

52
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,450
I think I'll be here

53
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,890
for another 28 days or so,

54
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,850
which should be enough time for me to teach him

55
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,980
a few tricks to cope with the exam.

56
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,390
Thank you so much, Mr. Yu.

57
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,410
You... You're welcome.

58
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,279
Just call me Yu Xing.

59
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,390
Yu Xing.

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,890
I'll leave Luhui to you.

61
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,310
No problem.

62
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,190
Xu Luhui, time to get up.

63
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,610
Get up.

64
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,650
Xu Luhui, get up!

65
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,020
Xu Luhui!

66
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,410
Xu Luhui, get up!

67
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,730
Xu Luhui, get up!

68
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,480
Bro, it's not even dawn yet.

69
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,560
Why do you have to wake me up so early?

70
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,780
It's not April Fool's Day.

71
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,360
Xu Luhui, don't go back to sleep.

72
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,159
Get up.

73
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,220
Bro, do you know

74
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,050
how important it is for a teenager in puberty

75
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,820
to get enough sleep?

76
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,120
You're keeping me from getting taller.

77
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,620
Come on, get some sleep too.

78
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,900
Get up, Xu Luhui!

79
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,100
Xu Luhui, get up!

80
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,370
I always sleep naked.

81
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,530
You didn't see anything, did you?

82
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,770
Didn't you say you wanted to learn to draw?

83
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,500
Come on, get dressed

84
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,070
and go sketching with me. Hurry up.

85
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,810
Here?

86
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,300
Not good.

87
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,350
Not good?

88
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,690
Next place.

89
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,380
What about here?

90
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,620
Not good.

91
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,690
What about here?

92
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,480
Not good, either.

93
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,950
I'm exhausted.

94
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,140
You're so picky. We're out of places to choose.

95
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,290
But the places you chose

96
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,490
are just all ugly.

97
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,770
So can you be more specific about

98
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,590
what kind of place you want exactly?

99
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,190
I just want...

100
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,100
I just want that kind of...

101
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,130
What kind?

102
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,950
That kind of place with a vibe.

103
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,440
I don't know how to explain it to you.

104
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,500
What do you think?

105
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,480
Do you have any new ideas?

106
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,860
Of course.

107
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,940
But... Why should I tell you?

108
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,440
Brat.

109
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,780
Do you still want to learn to draw or not?

110
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,220
All right. I'm exhausted.

111
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,440
I'd like to go back to bed soon.

112
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,610
But you can't tell anyone.

113
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,940
I didn't even tell Luxi about this place.

114
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,440
Don't worry.

115
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,260
I won't tell anyone.

116
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,740
Also... Buy me watermelon.

117
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,790
Brat.

118
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,590
How dare you blackmail me?

119
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,289
Fine, then don't go.

120
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,470
All right.

121
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,220
I'll buy you watermelon.

122
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,810
Let's go.

123
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,530
Sit tight.

124
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,260
Let's go.

125
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,320
This place is really beautiful.

126
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,490
How is it? Not bad, right?

127
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,940
You're the only one who's been here.

128
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:08,880
Great.

129
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,030
From now on, we'll come here for drawing

130
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,190
every day early in the morning.

131
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,890
Why does it have to be early in the morning?

132
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,130
Why can't we come at dusk?

133
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,960
What's wrong with dusk?

134
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,650
I just want to draw the beach at sunrise.

135
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:20,790
Sunrise

136
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,890
gives people hope, making you feel everything is brand new.

137
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,950
Besides, this is the essence of impressionism.

138
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,550
As a student who's about to take the Fine Arts Department entrance exam,

139
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,070
how can you not study hard?

140
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,220
All right. Got it.

141
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,830
Teacher.

142
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,210
Don't forget about the watermelon.

143
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,850
I won't.

144
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,850
I'm going to play in the water.

145
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,800
Luhui...

146
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,160
So cold.

147
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,740
So cold.

148
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,330
Luhui.

149
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,280
Luhui!

150
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,370
Xu Luhui!

151
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,220
Xu Luhui!

152
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,560
Come play in the water.

153
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:10,630
Wait...

154
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:45,940
Don't you think

155
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,120
the new substitute teacher is really serious?

156
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,120
Right.

157
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,540
The previous teacher never cared

158
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,800
whether we slept or played with our phones in class.

159
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,300
It's all different now.

160
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,110
He doesn't even allow us to have

161
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,770
any fun in class.

162
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,400
Look.

163
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,040
Even Luhui is catching up on his sleep

164
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,890
during lunch break.

165
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,940
Now I can only fill the emptiness in my heart

166
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,740
with this snack.

167
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:10,740
Right?

168
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,240
Hey, you two.

169
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,310
Act more like seniors, okay?

170
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,750
Do you want to get into college or not?

171
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,070
Next time I hear you

172
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,070
talk behind the teacher's back again,

173
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,350
I'll punish you harder than a smack on the head.

174
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,960
What was that about? Did he eat too much watermelon?

175
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,830
Acting so abnormally. Did he wake up on the wrong side of the bench?

176
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,390
Wait...

177
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,840
Get lost!

178
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,980
I just accidentally kicked

179
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,340
the jar with coffee beans in it.

180
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,070
Why did he get so mad?

181
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,460
What's wrong?

182
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,040
In a bad mood?

183
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,380
Let me ask you.

184
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,010
If I accidentally kicked

185
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,400
the wine you put on the floor,

186
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,670
would you lose your temper?

187
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,180
You didn't do it on purpose.

188
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,080
Why should I be mad at you?

189
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,090
I'd just pick it up.

190
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,330
Exactly.

191
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,440
I really don't understand.

192
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,950
By the way, your new neighbor is not bad, right?

193
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,320
I guess he's your type.

194
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,190
How did you know?

195
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,930
Come on. I've known you for too long.

196
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,340
I know your taste.

197
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,730
I'm not talking about that.

198
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,880
I was asking you

199
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,480
how you knew we had a new neighbor.

200
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,500
Come on. Everyone knows it, okay?

201
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,880
The house next to yours used to belong to Mr. Jin.

202
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,120
His wife was Mr. Jin's daughter.

203
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,390
But to be honest,

204
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,340
he's quite pitiful.

205
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,470
Why?

206
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,880
He had just gotten married with his wife

207
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,000
when he found out she was seriously ill.

208
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,000
In the end, she passed away.

209
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,810
I think it's been about two years.

210
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,410
Mr. Jin left last year.

211
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,870
I guess that's why

212
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,130
he came back to open a cafe.

213
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,910
By the way, give me your phone.

214
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,790
Lanxin Cafe?

215
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,990
This is his cafe.

216
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,690
We all shared his Instagram posts

217
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,540
in order to help him.

218
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,400
You don't mind, do you?

219
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,080
Am I that petty?

220
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,140
Your cocktail is ready.

221
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,750
Lanxin, we're back.

222
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,200
To the place you were most familiar with...

223
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,940
You used to say

224
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,550
you wanted to open a cafe after retirement.

225
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,410
I'm trying to fulfill this promise.

226
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,910
Lanxin Cafe under renovation.

227
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,420
We used to sit here and watch the sea a lot.

228
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,380
The sea is as beautiful as ever.

229
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,680
It's just...

230
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,700
The opening day of the cafe will be your birthday,

231
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,100
as the last birthday present to you...

232
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,630
What's wrong? Let me help you up.

233
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,430
No wonder he was so mad.

234
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,990
Welcome.

235
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,820
Sit wherever you want.

236
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,700
What do you want to drink today?

237
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:36,790
Beer.

238
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,360
Hello.

239
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,610
Yesterday...

240
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:54,550
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,220
Mr. Xu!

242
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,860
Please wait.

243
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,100
No need to be so formal.

244
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,350
Just call me Luxi.

245
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,360
What's wrong?

246
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,470
Did you forget to bring money?

247
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,440
No.

248
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,750
I should be the one apologizing.

249
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,470
You just wanted to help me the other day.

250
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,750
I overreacted.

251
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,280
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,060
It's okay.

253
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,950
We're neighbors.

254
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,650
I didn't take what happened that day to heart.

255
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,460
By the way,

256
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,710
did you go to the doctor after you fell?

257
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,310
You know what?

258
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,430
There's a great masseur around here.

259
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,480
My waist used to hurt a lot.

260
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,850
My brother fell down a lot, too.

261
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,000
We always went to see him.

262
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,660
Yu Xing, look! A castle!

263
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,090
-Doesn't it look great?
-What the hell is that?

264
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,620
What?

265
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,810
Alright then. I'll try again.

266
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,980
Look! Hermit crabs!

267
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,660
What are you doing?

268
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,390
Aren't they cute?

269
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,810
Go away, you brat.

270
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,530
One for you, one for me.

271
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,330
Go away. Don't come any closer.

272
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,390
Take it.

273
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,440
Go away!

274
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,570
Take it.

275
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,330
Look.

276
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,610
The sea, the sky, and the sun. Right?

277
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,830
Sketch it this way.

278
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,040
And slowly, it...

279
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,120
What are you doing?

280
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,330
I'm sorry.

281
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,170
You fell asleep?

282
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,750
You could actually sleep standing up. Quite impressive.

283
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,450
Sorry.

284
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,580
Let's compete.

285
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,360
Bring it on.

286
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:26,900
I'll go first.

287
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,550
Your turn.

288
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,940
So bad.

289
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,180
Mine went farther than yours, okay?

290
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,200
One more time.

291
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,140
Come on.

292
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,990
My snack is so tasty.

293
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:42,980
I want to try.

294
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,810
Throw it into my mouth.

295
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,800
Can't you eat it yourself?

296
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,200
Give it to me then. Let's switch.

297
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,890
Take it.

298
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,350
I don't want this.

299
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,600
It's already gone, yet you gave it to me.

300
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,100
What is this?

301
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,100
This feels so good.

302
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:58,720
It's quite delicious,

303
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,110
but I like the previous one better.

304
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,180
I think this is the best.

305
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,050
One more pack.

306
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,770
Come on, students. Class begins.

307
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,440
Put away your phones.

308
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,970
Wake up those who are asleep.

309
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,260
Luhui, wake up.

310
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:23,990
Luhui.

311
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,420
Luhui.

312
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,620
And slowly, it...

313
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,370
Wait.

314
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,280
Let him sleep.

315
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,270
He doesn't look well.

316
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,410
All right, stop talking.

317
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,370
Focus on the class.

318
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,380
Hello, Bingchen.

319
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,540
What's wrong?

320
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,360
Why do you look so down?

321
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,510
It's nothing.

322
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,690
Don't worry.

323
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,050
It's a holiday the day after tomorrow.

324
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,390
I'll find help for you.

325
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,930
The painting will be finished in no time.

326
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,600
It's okay.

327
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,460
I can handle it myself.

328
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,960
Don't bother.

329
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,420
It's my pleasure.

330
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:30,010
No trouble at all.

331
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,790
Besides,

332
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,970
you have to get it done before your wife's birthday, right?

333
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,270
If you do it yourself,

334
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,590
the cafe may not be able to open until the Lantern Festival next year.

335
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:48,570
Okay then.

336
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,520
Sorry for the trouble.

337
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,230
I've said it's no trouble at all.

338
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,010
By the way,

339
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,490
you must haven't eaten yet, have you?

340
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,490
If you don't mind, let's eat together.

341
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,310
Here you go.

342
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,520
Thank you.

343
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,580
You're welcome.

344
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,790
Let's eat, or it'll get cold.

345
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,790
Okay, that's all for today.

346
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,810
Class is over.

347
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,610
Let's go play basketball.

348
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,160
Look! Hermit crabs!

349
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:41,920
What are you doing?

350
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,690
Aren't they cute?

351
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,090
Go away, you brat.

352
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:44,820
One for you, one for me.

353
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,890
Go away. Don't come any closer.

354
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,310
So bad.

355
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,510
Mine went farther than yours, okay?

356
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,410
One more time. Come on.

357
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,520
Look, it's so close.

358
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,490
It's over there, okay?

359
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,620
Luhui.

360
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,070
Luhui, wake up.

361
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,920
Watermelon!

362
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,400
Wait, wait.

363
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,900
This is not for you to eat now.

364
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,760
I can see it, but I can't eat it.

365
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,480
It's too torturing, don't you think?

366
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,760
This is your homework today.

367
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,070
I'll start you off with a sketch today.

368
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,910
Okay, Teacher.

369
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,730
Before you start sketching,

370
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,390
you have to learn to observe carefully first.

371
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,340
Observe carefully before you draw.

372
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,730
Come on, tell me what you see.

373
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,330
A watermelon.

374
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,050
No.

375
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,280
What I want you to observe is its shape

376
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,480
and its light and shadows.

377
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,480
Look carefully at this watermelon.

378
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,490
It's actually not round,

379
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,820
but a bit oval, right?

380
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,220
I know that.

381
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,090
Then have you heard about

382
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,780
the three sides and five values in sketching?

383
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:56,920
No.

384
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,560
Let me fill you in quickly.

385
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,380
I'll show you something I drew before first.

386
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,810
Simply put,

387
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,580
the three sides are light side,

388
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,210
mid-tone, and shadow side.

389
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,910
As for the five values, it's to further divide the light side into

390
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,420
reflected light and highlight areas on the basis of the three sides.

391
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,430
Well, as for some objects...

392
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:57,990
Luhui!

393
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,670
Yes.

394
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,410
No, I mean I understand.

395
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,580
Anyway,

396
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,920
sketching is about different shades

397
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,280
of light and darkness caused by the illumination

398
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,770
on three-dimensional objects.

399
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,180
Try doing a sketch first.

400
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,230
I'll see how I should arrange future classes

401
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,930
based on your situation.

402
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,820
Okay.

403
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,550
Wait.

404
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:52,370
All right.

405
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,750
Take your time to get used to it.

406
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,220
Okay.

407
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,630
Learn to cherish the present,

408
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,270
and live each day to the fullest.

409
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,620
Since we know each other's stories,

410
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,500
we'll be friends from now on.

411
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,400
You two...

412
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,550
Are weird.

413
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,520
No.

414
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,960
Now, look into my eyes

415
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,180
and observe me carefully.

416
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,380
Can I... Touch you?

417
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,370
Then

418
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,450
express all those feelings freely

419
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,350
through sketches.
