1
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,060
(Impression Of Youth)

2
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:33,690
That place was really good.

3
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,510
Let's go there again next time.

4
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,020
Sure.

5
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,070
Why is it so messy here?

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,490
Bingchen, wait here for a moment.

7
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,030
I'll go ask Xu Luhui to come and clean it up with us.

8
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,490
It's okay.

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,460
Let me do it.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,140
I said I'd thank you properly,

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,590
but I'm still keeping you busy.

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,120
Let me help you,

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,140
or I won't feel at ease.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,100
Thank you.

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,330
Xu Luhui, where are you going so early?

16
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,090
Are you going to the beach to play in the water again?

17
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,240
Sorry, I...

18
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,080
Have you had breakfast?

19
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,630
Do you want me to prepare your favorite

20
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,160
watermelon toast and watermelon milk?

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,250
No, I have no appetite.

22
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,940
I'll take a shower and get ready for class.

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,820
What's wrong with him?

24
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,039
His confession of love failed?

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,009
Even if you have no appetite,

26
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,140
at least have some watermelon milk.

27
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:03,750
Thank you.

28
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,639
Oh no.

29
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,670
He didn't even react to his favorite watermelon milk.

30
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,570
Luhui, well...

31
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,760
Don't you want to go to college in Taipei?

32
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,670
I'm sure your college life

33
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,260
will be more colorful.

34
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,640
Besides, there will be lots of high-quality guys in Taipei.

35
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,390
So don't

36
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,670
let one failure dampen your spirits.

37
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,600
I will always support you.

38
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,850
Xu Luxi, what are you talking about?

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,790
I don't understand.

40
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,300
You...

41
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,280
Didn't your confession of love go wrong?

42
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,320
No. It went great.

43
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,600
Then why are you pulling a long face?

44
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,450
And why didn't Yu Xing

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,230
come back with you?

46
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,070
Well...

47
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,130
Let me help you with that.

48
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,460
Okay.

49
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,020
Yu Xing, you're finally picking up your phone.

50
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,110
What happened?

51
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,490
Yu Sheng hasn't eaten anything since yesterday.

52
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,740
It doesn't look well.

53
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,160
It even vomited this morning.

54
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,380
I was about to take it to see the doctor.

55
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,700
How could this be?

56
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,829
You know what? I have no class today.

57
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,560
I'll come back right away.

58
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,420
Okay.

59
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,110
Tell me if anything happens.

60
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,560
Okay. Bye. Bye.

61
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,090
What happened?

62
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,340
It's Yu Sheng.

63
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,250
My... My cat.

64
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,600
It's seriously ill.

65
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,850
I need to hurry back.

66
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,580
Luhui, could you please

67
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,490
take me to the station?

68
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,590
No problem. I'll take you.

69
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,850
Between us, there's no trouble at all.

70
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,000
Your business is my business.

71
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,290
But your clothes are soaked.

72
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,170
You'll catch a cold on the bus if you don't get changed.

73
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,590
But if I go back to get changed,

74
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,920
I won't be able to catch the first bus.

75
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,320
I have a spare uniform in my bag

76
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,930
in case my brother catches me playing in the water.

77
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,610
Time is running out. Change into it.

78
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,590
-Okay.
-Okay.

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,700
Thank you.

80
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,690
Yu Xing, helmet!

81
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,230
I'm off. Be careful.

82
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,810
You too. Tell me when you get to Taipei.

83
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,630
You've only been apart for less than an hour, and you're already like this.

84
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,490
I think

85
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,810
Yu Xing's definitely going to have you on the ropes from now on.

86
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,330
How is that possible?

87
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,100
Who am I? I'm Xu Luhui, okay?

88
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,820
You'd better be.

89
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,850
When you're out there, don't tell anyone

90
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,510
you're my younger brother.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,730
How embarrassing.

92
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,910
Why are you like this, Luxi?

93
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,360
I'll control myself.

94
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,520
I won't embarrass you.

95
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,750
All right, get changed and go to class.

96
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,920
Yes, Sir.

97
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,550
Is Luhui alright?

98
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,680
Don't even get me started.

99
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,260
Is there anything I can do to help?

100
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,000
Like what?

101
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,659
Take him for a walk,

102
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,640
or see what he likes to eat.

103
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,700
We can go buy it for him together.

104
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,020
No, you misunderstood.

105
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,810
I just feel helpless for

106
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,740
that useless brat, Luhui.

107
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,440
I see.

108
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,040
Yes.

109
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,350
It's the Kenya coffee I like.

110
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,150
Bingchen.

111
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,490
Bingchen!

112
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,560
Bingchen!

113
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,710
Sorry.

114
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,350
Are you thinking about Lanxin again?

115
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,810
The signal bars are full.

116
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,260
It's been so long. Why hasn't he arrived?

117
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,860
Who hasn't arrived?

118
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,920
Are you meeting someone here?

119
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,130
Is it a girl?

120
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,110
Why didn't you tell us first?

121
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,940
I didn't do my hair today.

122
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,300
What's wrong with him?

123
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,970
Why are you so down today?

124
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,510
Are you sick?

125
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,480
I think I'm really sick.

126
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,090
I think I have lovesickness.

127
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,200
School is a real bore

128
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,450
without you.

129
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,530
Weird.

130
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,960
Why is he so happy

131
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,760
reading the text you sent him?

132
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,150
I don't know. I just told him

133
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,020
that we'd leave first.

134
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,250
Could it be...

135
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,850
We're leaving!

136
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,000
Yu Sheng. It's all right.

137
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,810
Be good. Take the medicine and go to sleep.

138
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,210
What did the doctor say?

139
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,390
The doctor said he might have caught a cold.

140
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,900
It's just a cold. No big deal.

141
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,950
Listen.

142
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,720
When you were not around,

143
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,120
Yu Sheng kept looking at the door.

144
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
It must have been waiting for you.

145
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:12,680
Why are you wearing a uniform?

146
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,580
(Xu Luhui)
Why are you wearing a uniform?

147
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,580
My clothes were dirty,

148
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,070
and I was in a hurry to come back,

149
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,600
so I borrowed it from my student.

150
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,760
Didn't you say you had no class today?

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,450
I have class tomorrow afternoon.

152
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,430
I'll take the first bus back tomorrow morning.

153
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,450
If there's nothing else,

154
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,610
go back and rest early.

155
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,110
Got it.

156
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,650
Yu Sheng, your dad is back.

157
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,740
This nanny here will leave now.

158
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,450
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,730
All I could think about was to see Yu Sheng as soon as possible.

160
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,260
So I...

161
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,000
Even if you want me to think about you all the time,

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,890
you didn't have to be like that.

163
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,420
You missed me so soon?

164
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,150
Did I not work hard enough yesterday?

165
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,810
Guess I have to work harder when I come back.

166
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,650
Don't talk nonsense.

167
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,860
I only missed you

168
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,510
because I wanted to make sure that you'd return to Taipei safely.

169
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,930
Given how reckless you were this morning,

170
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,230
it's hard for me to feel at ease, okay?

171
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,690
All right.

172
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,760
I'm sorry for making you worry.

173
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,150
By the way, is the cat okay?

174
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,680
This is Yu Sheng.

175
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,450
Hello.

176
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,270
I found it in the school studio

177
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,640
last summer.

178
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,430
When I found it,

179
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,350
it's got paint all over its face, you know?

180
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,350
Just like what you looked like

181
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,010
when you were drawing the wall that day.

182
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,180
It was really cute.

183
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,040
Okay, so now you're treating me

184
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,060
as a stray cat.

185
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,610
No, that's not what I meant.

186
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,680
Don't get me wrong.

187
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,670
That's exactly what you meant.

188
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,980
No one's going to take you to draw when you come back.

189
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,790
Don't be like this.

190
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,370
You know that's not what I meant.

191
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,400
It's my fault, okay?

192
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,420
I apologize.

193
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,740
Don't ignore me.

194
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,520
I can't live without you.

195
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,020
And you know that's not what I meant.

196
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,810
Right? Look how cute Yu Sheng is.

197
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,140
I said you look like Yu Sheng

198
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,630
to imply that you're cute.

199
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,700
Look. Don't be angry.

200
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,520
All right.

201
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,270
Smile.

202
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,430
Are you okay?

203
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,290
What happened?

204
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,930
Let me help you up.

205
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,120
You must haven't eaten yet, have you?

206
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,120
I made some home-cooked dishes.

207
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,830
If you don't mind, let's eat together.

208
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,810
Here you go.

209
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,200
We have to move on in life.

210
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,520
Let bygones be bygones.

211
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,820
Learn to cherish the present,

212
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,790
and live every day to the fullest.

213
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,270
I'm happy.

214
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,790
So happy.

215
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,940
Very happy.

216
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,010
Yue, you came at the right time.

217
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,590
Yu Sheng just vomited again.

218
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,170
I want to take it to the doctor again.

219
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,940
Okay, wait for me downstairs.

220
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,510
I'll get the car.

221
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,870
Okay. Wait.

222
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,460
Yue, hold this for me.

223
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,260
I forgot my wallet. Wait for me.

224
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,210
Hurry up.

225
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:54,730
Okay.

226
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,860
(Luhui
2 messages)

227
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,620
Here. I made breakfast for the customers this morning.

228
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,830
I made an extra portion for you.

229
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,080
Thanks.

230
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,180
What's wrong?

231
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,720
That brat Luhui made so much noise last night.

232
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,710
What did he do?

233
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,540
That brat actually

234
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,690
video-called Yu Xing all night.

235
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,690
I couldn't sleep at all because of the noise.

236
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,580
As expected from a boy crazy in love.

237
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,090
By the way, why did you call me yesterday?

238
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,050
It was nothing. I pressed it by accident.

239
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,010
That's good.

240
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,280
I left my phone charging at the counter yesterday

241
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,390
and forgot to bring it upstairs.

242
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,740
I only saw it this morning. Sorry.

243
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:48,970
Why should you be sorry?

244
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,520
It wasn't anything important.

245
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,200
I'll make you some coffee.

246
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,230
He said he pressed it by accident,

247
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,430
but then he said it wasn't anything important.

248
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,620
Does Bingchen have something on his mind?

249
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,130
Good morning. Are you up?

250
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,030
There's a summer festival tonight.

251
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,820
There'll be fireworks. Let's go together.

252
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,510
Have you arrived at the homestay?

253
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,260
Why hasn't he read any of my messages?

254
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,870
He should already be on the bus at this hour.

255
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,690
What's wrong with him this time?

256
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,520
Maybe he got stuck again.

257
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,430
Bingchen, promise me.

258
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,400
After I leave,

259
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,520
don't be sad

260
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,190
for too long.

261
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,630
Because

262
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,770
I'm lucky enough

263
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,120
to have met you

264
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,260
and be your wife in this life.

265
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,260
I feel so happy

266
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,910
to have you by my side

267
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,510
in my last days.

268
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,280
So please forgive me for being selfish.

269
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,730
I can't leave this share of happiness to you,

270
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,380
but I hope that after I leave,

271
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,290
you can find your own happiness.

272
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,330
Let it go.

273
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,100
I know you can do it.

274
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,050
I know that

275
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,200
even without me,

276
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,410
you can have a good life.

277
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,550
Even if I'm gone,

278
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,390
someone will definitely...

279
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,060
Definitely enter

280
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,450
your life,

281
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,870
keep you company,

282
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,110
and take care of you

283
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:16,860
for me.

284
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,620
Lanxin.

285
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,360
I finally fulfilled

286
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,150
my last promise to you.

287
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,400
Receiving a message at this hour.

288
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,800
It must be Xu Luhui. He must have forgotten something again

289
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,780
and asked me to bring it to him.

290
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,350
(Bingchen)
(Can you go to a place with me?)

291
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,350
Can you go to a place with me?
(Bingchen)
(Can you go to a place with me?)

292
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,060
(Bingchen)
(Can you go to a place with me?)

293
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:30,830
Lanxin.

294
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,490
I've done everything I promised you.

295
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,550
You can rest in peace now.

296
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,170
Look.

297
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,220
It flew onto my hand.

298
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,560
Let's call it Chenchen.

299
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:48,820
Look.

300
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:57,560
Lanxin.

301
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,660
I'll keep your happiest smile

302
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,440
deep in my heart.

303
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,880
Lanxin, don't worry.

304
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,370
I'll be there for Bingchen.

305
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,330
Thank you for sending Lanxin off with me for the last time.

306
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,630
There's no need to say thank you between us.

307
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,340
Besides,

308
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,310
I'm very happy to be here to see Lanxin off for the last time.

309
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,050
Why isn't it Yu Xing?

310
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,300
Everyone,

311
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,120
Mr. Yu has something important to do today,

312
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,720
so he can't make it back for class.

313
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,780
Study on your own first.

314
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,790
Mr. Yu will find time

315
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:22,850
to make up for the class later.

316
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,310
If you want to talk

317
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,340
or you don't want to be alone,

318
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,900
you can come to the homestay anytime.

319
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,160
Thank you.

320
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,640
The construction of Lanxin Cafe is finished.

321
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,260
I think it's time for me to think

322
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,230
about my plan for the future.

323
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,260
There's no hurry.

324
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,140
Take some time off,

325
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,160
or go out for a walk.

326
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,280
Sometimes, life doesn't need too much planning.

327
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,380
Life will find its way out itself.

328
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,600
I think while living,

329
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,410
you will also find

330
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,070
your new pursuit in life gradually.

331
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,200
And don't worry.

332
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,100
You have me...

333
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,020
And your other friends.

334
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,030
I know.

335
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:38,980
Where is he rushing to?

336
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,350
I don't know.

337
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,660
To buy watermelon, I guess.

338
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,090
Why do you have a popsicle?

339
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,230
Do you want a bite?

340
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,240
No.

341
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,230
Your call will be forwarded to voice mail.

342
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,930
Yu Xing.

343
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,700
I'm Luxi, not Yu Xing.

344
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,930
Luxi, what's up?

345
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,450
On your way home later, go to Aunt Ahao's

346
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,490
and buy some pumpkin.

347
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,120
I want to make pumpkin porridge.

348
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,350
Okay, got it.

349
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,100
Has Yu Xing come back?

350
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,340
Not yet.

351
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,870
Don't run about whenever Yu Xing's not around.

352
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,720
Come back as soon as you've bought the pumpkin.

353
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,270
Okay, got it.

354
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,820
Did you just disappear?

355
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,560
I'm so worried.

356
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,000
Luxi, is Yu Xing back?

357
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,240
No.

358
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,020
But there was a phone call coming in just now.

359
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,210
Xu Luxi.

360
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,960
Can't you make it clear at once?

361
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,010
You're putting me on an emotional rollercoaster here.

362
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,750
Alright.

363
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,270
A girl named Yue just called.

364
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,220
She said Yu Xing would be back later

365
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,950
and asked if we could send a car to pick him up.

366
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,660
Okay, I got it.

367
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,230
I'm going out for a walk.

368
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,740
Remember to come back for dinner.

369
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,020
Okay.

370
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,000
Didn't you say you'd be back today?

371
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,000
You didn't even tell me that you weren't coming back.

372
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,560
You haven't texted me all day.

373
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,020
You've been ignoring my messages, too.

374
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,570
Who is Yue?

375
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,770
Have you been with that girl all day

376
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,040
when you were out of touch?

377
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,000
What was so important that you stayed with her all day

378
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,580
and didn't come back for class?

379
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,870
What about me?

380
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,280
What am I to you?

381
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,920
I've told the homestay

382
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,940
that you'll be a bit late.

383
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,020
I also asked them if they could pick you up at the station.

384
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,050
This way, Luxi would tell Luhui about it.

385
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,720
I'll go back first.

386
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,420
I'll explain to him face to face.

387
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:57,880
Yue.

388
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,550
Yu Sheng will be hospitalized for the next couple of days.

389
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,890
Can you go check on it for me

390
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,450
when you have time?

391
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,570
Don't worry.

392
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,000
I'll go even if you don't ask me to.

393
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,040
Oh no.

394
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,490
I missed the last bus.

395
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,450
Why don't you take the first bus tomorrow morning?

396
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,360
You should be able to...

397
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:18,920
No!

398
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,640
No?

399
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,460
Yue.

400
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,000
Can you...

401
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,510
No.

402
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,940
You rejected me even before I finished.

403
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,850
We've known each other for seven years and eight months.

404
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,510
Do you think I don't know

405
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,580
what you want to say?

406
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,950
Please.

407
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,810
Only you can help me now.

408
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,180
Please.

409
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,220
I'm begging you.

410
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,750
You... You said it yourself that

411
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,650
we've known each other for seven years and eight months.

412
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,550
Please help me one more time.

413
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,530
Please.

414
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,590
Please.

415
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,650
Please help me one more time.

416
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,480
Please, I'm begging you.

417
00:24:58,050 --> 00:24:59,390
Please, Yue.

418
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,570
Only you can help me.

419
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,310
Alright.

420
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,090
I knew you were the kindest.

421
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,660
You really are my strongest support.

422
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,010
Don't try to be sweet. Let's go.

423
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:08,810
Okay.

424
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,140
Yes! Let's go!

425
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,690
They say if you pile up wishing stones,

426
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,780
your wishes will come true.

427
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,810
I've piled so many stones up.

428
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,920
Why hasn't Yu Xing showed up yet?

429
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,890
Xu Luhui! You fool!

430
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,980
(Luxi)

431
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,390
(Homelike)

432
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,450
Look at Xu Luhui.
(Homelike)

433
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:57,760
(Homelike)

434
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,250
I told him not to stay out too late.
(Homelike)

435
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:00,850
It's already this hour.

436
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,450
That's weird.

437
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:09,350
Why did it go straight to the voice mail?

438
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,680
Don't worry.

439
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,870
He's already 18. He's not a child anymore.

440
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,210
And he might be worried about Yu Xing

441
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,350
and be in a bad mood.

442
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,010
Let him hang out for a while.

443
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,830
He'll be back soon.

444
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,730
Yu Xing, you're finally back.

445
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,720
Do you know that Luhui...

446
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,290
This is...

447
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,390
Hello, I called today.

448
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,340
My name is Yue.

449
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,500
Sorry, Luxi.

450
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,560
I missed the last bus,

451
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,370
so I asked Yue to drive me back.

452
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,380
But it's getting late,

453
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,830
so I don't feel comfortable

454
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,220
letting her drive back alone.

455
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,790
Can she stay here tonight?

456
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,610
Yu Xing, I do want to help,

457
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,750
but the homestay is full today.

458
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,080
Yue, you can sleep in my room.

459
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,150
What about you?

460
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,790
Don't worry about me.

461
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,890
I know them very well.

462
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,880
There will be a place for me to sleep.

463
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,020
Okay then.

464
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,770
I've cleaned up your room

465
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,130
and changed the bedding.

466
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,310
Thank you. We'll go inside then.

467
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,590
Luhui is missing.

468
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,130
Is she...

469
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,430
Your secret girlfriend in Taipei?

470
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,090
Why don't you date me?

471
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,220
Are you telling me the person you like

472
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,080
is a boy you've known for less than a month,

473
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,310
and he's your student?

474
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,560
Did you get drunk and kiss Bingchen?

475
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,030
Or should I drink one more time

476
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:41,960
and kiss him again?

477
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,610
Luhui.

478
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,660
What are you drawing?

479
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,660
Good stuff is meant to be shared with good friends.

480
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,360
Let me draw a dot.

481
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,040
Move your hands.

482
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,090
I've learned how to ride a scooter now.

483
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,110
I can give you rides from now on.

484
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,160
Seal. It's a deal.
