00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,040
(Impression Of Youth)

2
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,110
Luxi.

3
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,250
Actually, I don't mind

4
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,710
what happened that day.

5
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,340
So just don't feel embarrassed.

6
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,330
Got it.

7
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,160
Come on. Get drunk today.

8
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,020
Didn't you say that

9
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,800
you looked forward to our first date very much?

10
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,380
Then why do you look so upset?

11
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,380
As this is our first date,

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,880
I just don't understand

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,039
why you brought two irrelevant people.

14
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:26,880
Xu Luhui.

15
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,740
How could you call us two irrelevant people?

16
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,240
Alright.

17
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,380
Since the situation is like this,

18
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:47,080
let's have a double date.

19
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:47,789
Let's go.

20
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,370
Let's go.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,509
Let's go.

22
00:01:58,009 --> 00:01:58,740
Let's go.

23
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,880
So we'll have a date?

24
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,400
Take a photo of me!

25
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,460
Let's take a photo, too.

26
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,680
Come on.

27
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,790
Luxi! Bingchen! Let's take a photo together!

28
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,530
-Hurry up!
-Let's take a photo together!

29
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,950
The four of us can do it together. Come on.

30
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,860
Hurry up. Let's take a selfie.

31
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,070
Come on. Let's take a selfie.

32
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,780
-One, two, three. One, two, three.
-Alright. Come on.

33
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,540
Cheer up.

34
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,680
Let me take a sip of your drink.

35
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,870
-There's a wishing box. Look. Let's go.
-Let's go.

36
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,570
Well...

37
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,290
After you went home that day,

38
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,290
I ate up that remaining ice lolly.

39
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,860
It's okay.

40
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,670
It's good that you ate it all.

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,810
I think you're right.

42
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,200
The ice lolly really tastes better

43
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,160
when two people eat it together.

44
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,540
Let's eat ice lollies together again next time.

45
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,380
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

46
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,310
Have a seat first.

47
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,980
Then later, let's...

48
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,720
Ineed, ice cream tastes better when two people

49
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,659
eat it together.

50
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,660
Let's go for a walk.

51
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,930
Let's go.

52
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,100
(Peace and Happiness)

53
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,100
(I like you)

54
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,000
What are you writing?

55
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,610
What?

56
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,790
I want to see it.

57
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,450
Then let me see yours first.

58
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:59,980
No! No!

59
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:01,480
Let me see it.

60
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,640
Let me see yours first.

61
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,220
Enjoy your date.

62
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,460
Don't worry about us.

63
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:32,630
Taste it.

64
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
It's very delicious.

65
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,730
There's grilled squid.

66
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,600
Let's go eat grilled squid.

67
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,560
Okay.

68
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,140
Come on.

69
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,550
Look here.

70
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:55,870
Yu Xing.

71
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,990
How were your brother and Bingchen

72
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,910
after that?

73
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,490
He only sent a message and told us to enjoy our date.

74
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,440
No need to worry about them.

75
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,870
You've appreciated that photo more than ten times.

76
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,740
Aren't you tired of it?

77
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,790
Of course not.

78
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,330
I wouldn't get tired of it even if I had appreciated it 100 times.

79
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,250
I'm right in front of you.

80
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,150
What do you mean by watching the photo all this time

81
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:27,970
without looking at me?

82
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,380
Why are you jealous of a photo? How childish.

83
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,290
Who do you think is childish?

84
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,830
You.

85
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:32,420
Who do you think is childish?

86
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,820
You, Yu Xing.

87
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,350
Say it again. Who is childish?

88
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,490
Who is childish? You...

89
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,220
It makes me feel itchy.

90
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,390
-Who?
-It makes me feel itchy.

91
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,159
Stop it!

92
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,220
You don't want to tell me?

93
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,010
It makes me feel itchy.

94
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,659
Let me apply some medicine for you.

95
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,409
It might hurt a bit.

96
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,370
I'm sorry.

97
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,030
It's all my fault.

98
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,000
I didn't notice that there was a pit over there.

99
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,130
In order to save me, you got hurt.

100
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,360
Silly boy, don't be sad.

101
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,360
A man with a scar is a real man.

102
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,120
Stop it. Let me stick it to your wound first.

103
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,490
Don't feel guilty.

104
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,120
It's good to have a scar.

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
Let's just consider it

106
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,490
as the mark of our first trip.

107
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,289
In this way, I won't forget

108
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,830
today's joy and happy memories

109
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,100
for the rest of my life.

110
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,200
You know what?

111
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,900
After my parents passed away,

112
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,600
I've supported this family alone

113
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,100
and raised Luhui alone.

114
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,010
Today, it's my first time having the feeling

115
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,100
of being looked after and cared for.

116
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm very touched. Thank you.

117
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:21,960
I'm the one who should say thank you.

118
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,320
Thank you for your warmth.

119
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,520
Thank you for your concern.

120
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,740
Since Lanxin passed away,

121
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,170
it has been my first time feeling that I'm not alone.

122
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,130
It's the first time someone being so nervous when I'm injured.

123
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,990
It's the first time someone caring if I've eaten.

124
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,930
This person feared that I hadn't eaten yet,

125
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,690
so he prepared a meal box for me.

126
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,200
It's my first time feeling that

127
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,440
someone is still concerned about me

128
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,690
and cares about me.

129
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,900
It has made me want to protect this person.

130
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,900
You want to protect him?

131
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,920
From now on, we won't be alone.

132
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,370
I'll be here to take care of you

133
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,360
and protect you.

134
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,190
Promise me that

135
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,790
no matter what happens,

136
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,790
no matter what problems you have,

137
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,010
and whether you're happy,

138
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,040
sad,

139
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,360
hurt,

140
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,230
or confused,

141
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,910
you have to let me know.

142
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,800
I'll stay by your side to face it

143
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,360
and solve it with you.

144
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,840
Okay?

145
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,090
Xu Luxi, I can't believe that you didn't come back all night.

146
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,180
How inappropriate!

147
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,550
I'm a mature adult

148
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,670
who already grew up a long time ago.

149
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,910
Stop acting like an adult there.

150
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,050
But look at you.

151
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,400
Don't forget your duty when you're in love.

152
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,580
Are you carefully preparing for

153
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,480
the college entrance exam or not?

154
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,860
Bingchen!

155
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,180
Xu Luhui!

156
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,220
I'll teach you a lesson after school today!

157
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,340
Yue sent you a letter.

158
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,610
Why didn't she tell me herself?

159
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,180
Do you think she could tell you

160
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,670
in that situation yesterday?

161
00:13:59,170 --> 00:13:59,910
You're right.

162
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,500
Thank you.

163
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,600
I saw the news that day.

164
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,170
The painter you like

165
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,130
has started to expand his business

166
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,800
to other regions in Asia these years,

167
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,440
such as Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai.

168
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,940
There are his exhibitions in those places.

169
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,830
He wants to train potential artists next.

170
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,730
He has a plan to recruit new artists.

171
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,680
If we can work with him,

172
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,820
it'll be great, right?

173
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,960
What should we do

174
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,810
to work in their gallery?

175
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,810
I don't know.

176
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,150
We can focus on their recruiting information

177
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,670
or send our photographic works to them

178
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,070
to recommend ourselves,

179
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:02,810
and it might be effective, huh?

180
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,340
Okay. Then I need to create more works.

181
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:19,430
(Admission Notice)

182
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,850
Should I go?

183
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,220
If I decide to go,

184
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,990
how should I tell Luhui?

185
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,890
Have you arrived at school?

186
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,720
I miss you.

187
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,370
Well, humans' skin is not only pure...

188
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,690
Alright, everyone. That's all for today's lesson.

189
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,360
Class is over.

190
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,930
I've noticed that you seem a little weird.

191
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,950
I'm not.

192
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,890
It's for you.

193
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,910
How is it? Do you like it?

194
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,180
You've improved a lot.

195
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,480
With your current skills,

196
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,310
as long as you don't make any mistakes on the exam day,

197
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:10,140
it won't be a big problem if you want to apply for

198
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,460
the Fine Arts Department of Taipei University.

199
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,310
Of course. Who am I? I'm Xu Luhui.

200
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,050
What are you doing?

201
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,800
Why are you avoiding me?

202
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,359
Well, we're at school. Control yourself.

203
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,560
Does it really matter?

204
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,829
I even want the whole school to know that you're mine.

205
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,410
Then why don't you borrow a microphone

206
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:25,980
from the community manager

207
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,390
to tell everyone through the broadcast?

208
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,490
That's a good idea.

209
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,720
Why didn't I think of it?

210
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,850
I'm just saying it. So you're serious about it?

211
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,850
Please. I really want to do this.

212
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,490
Please. Please. Please.

213
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,420
Please.

214
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,610
Stop it.

215
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,800
Come on. Let's go eat watermelon.

216
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,870
Let's eat watermelon? Won't you tutor me today?

217
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,750
You're able to draw well now.

218
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,750
You don't need me to tutor you anymore.

219
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,880
What's more,

220
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,130
now you just need to spend more time

221
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,070
practising it by yourself.

222
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,840
That means we can have more time to have dates.

223
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,790
Yes!

224
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,470
Let's have a date! Let's have a date!

225
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,680
Let's eat watermelon! Let's eat watermelon!

226
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,940
Let's have a date! Let's have a date!

227
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,900
Just look at me.

228
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,500
Xu Luhui, you're quite slovenly.

229
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,980
Your saliva is all over my face.

230
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,100
What's wrong with my saliva?

231
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,240
You've eaten it before, haven't you?

232
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,000
Is there something bothering you?

233
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,610
Is there?

234
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,370
Yes.

235
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,440
You've been either absent-minded

236
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,330
or looking at me with a weird expression all day long.

237
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:52,740
What's wrong with you?

238
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,420
Luhui.

239
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,640
Let me ask you.

240
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,640
If...

241
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,640
If I leave here...

242
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,750
So that's what you wanted to ask?

243
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,690
I thought you were going to tell me something very important.

244
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,000
I've already thought it through.

245
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,690
Next week, when the course is over, you'll go back to Taipei.

246
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,710
Then I'll go to college in Taipei soon.

247
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,930
So I've calculated the time.

248
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,190
I don't think we'll be separated for too long.

249
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,690
Don't worry.

250
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,830
What if I tell you that leaving here

251
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,440
doesn't mean going back to Taipei?

252
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,100
Then what does it mean?

253
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,140
There's a job.

254
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,610
It's a job that I've longed for

255
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,130
all this time.

256
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,120
But it requires me to leave Taiwan.

257
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,430
Leaving Taiwai? Where will you go?

258
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,220
New York.

259
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,000
New York?

260
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,620
Luhui, calm down.

261
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,830
I... I mean if.

262
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,300
I haven't decided yet.

263
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,060
I just want to discuss it with you

264
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,190
before making a decision.

265
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,540
So you really haven't decided to go?

266
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,260
If you hadn't decided to go,

267
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,110
you wouldn't have asked me in this way.

268
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,680
Are you serious about your feelings for me?

269
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,470
Yes, I...

270
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,220
Or are you just like what Yue said?

271
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,190
Are your feelings for me just temporary?

272
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,440
Are you sure he is the one you want?

273
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,080
You're going back next week.

274
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,780
Have you ever thought whether your feelings for him are serious

275
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,020
or just due to temporary affection?

276
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,780
Xu Luhui, what are you doing?

277
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,060
Go to class now.

278
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,520
Hurry up!

279
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,180
This is my first time...

280
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,360
my first time liking someone so much.

281
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,290
The sweetness of being with you

282
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,280
is stronger than the watermelon's sweetness in that painting.

283
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,290
But how can you play with my feelings like this?

284
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,930
I'm really disappointed in you!

285
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,580
Luhui!

286
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,660
Luhui!

287
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:57,950
Yu Xing.

288
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,010
What happened between you and Luhui?

289
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,930
He locked himself in his room as soon as he came back.

290
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,920
He didn't even eat.

291
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,690
Well...

292
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,170
Well...

293
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,850
Luhui is childish sometimes.

294
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,090
You need to tolerate him more.

295
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,620
Okay. I got it.

296
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,210
Now I'm going to get his favorite

297
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,170
watermelon milk.

298
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,640
Or do you want to help me get it for him?

299
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,860
You can take this chance to pacify him.

300
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,050
Luhui, you haven't eaten anything all day.

301
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,260
Luxi brought your favorite watermelon milk.

302
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,750
Just drink a bit of it, okay?

303
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,520
Luhui!

304
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,800
Luhui!

305
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,100
Watermelon milk.

306
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,210
Bingchen, I ordered some beer just now.

307
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,800
Why is it watermelon milk now?

308
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,690
It's better to drink alcohol

309
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,760
as less as possible.

310
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,640
Especially when you're in a bad mood,

311
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,640
you shouldn't drink alcohol.

312
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,140
I think you ate too much of Xu Luxi's saliva.

313
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,910
Why are you talking more and more like my brother?

314
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:28,910
Now do you want to talk to me

315
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,890
about what happened?

316
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,300
Luxi.

317
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,300
Luhui is not in his room.

318
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,500
Where did he go?

319
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,160
It's so late now.

320
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,210
He's in Bingchen's house.

321
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,340
It looks like he's really in a bad mood.

322
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,920
No matter how sad he was,

323
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,730
he would never be like this.

324
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,100
I'm sorry.

325
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,500
It's okay. Why are you apologizing?

326
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,860
Now he's experiencing...

327
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,530
the rebellious phase.

328
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:23,990
He'll be fine after he gets over the bad mood.

329
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,900
Go have a rest now.

330
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,110
Talk to him properly tomorrow.

331
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,810
So, has Yu Xing ever told you that

332
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,620
his feelings for you are just temporary?

333
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,930
Did he explicitly tell you that

334
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,080
he would go to New York?

335
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,440
In that case, I don't think...

336
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,180
you have to be so angry.

337
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,540
Bingchen, I'm your brother-in-law.

338
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,090
How can you speak up for an outsider?

339
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,430
I'm not trying to speak up for Yu Xing.

340
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,630
As I once saw how you two got along with each other,

341
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,930
I don't think Yu Xing

342
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,430
is a person who would love someone just temporarily.

343
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,840
Shouldn't you give him a chance

344
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,210
to explain it?

345
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:48,900
Luhui.

346
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,490
Luhui!

347
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,690
I'll take you to school today.

348
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,190
Okay?

349
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:07,490
Luhui.

350
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,850
Please don't ignore me. Okay?

351
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,050
In a relationship,

352
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,450
you have to face and solve

353
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,400
problems by yourself.

354
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,400
Let's do it slowly. Okay?

355
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,400
Just go!

356
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:42,170
Are you going to give up your dream

357
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,400
just because you're dating someone?

358
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,200
Today, it's the last lesson from your

359
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,070
substitute art teacher.

360
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,210
And he's going back to Taipei the day after tomorrow,

361
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:49,920
isn't he?

362
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,930
Don't wait till we regret it when it's too late.
