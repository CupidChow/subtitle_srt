1
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,819
Uncle Jin.

2
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,220
Hui, what is it?

3
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,056
Did you see that guest's painting? The one I lost?

4
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,160
No clue.

5
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,562
I was too busy slicing fish to notice.

6
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,532
It's okay, I'll ask someone else.

7
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,167
Oh, listen.

8
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,568
Look for Uncle Hui.

9
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,737
Uncle Hui was fishing here the entire night.

10
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,871
He should know.

11
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,939
Okay. Thanks, Uncle Jin.

12
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,080
Lu Hui, why are you here?

13
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,016
Isn't it Monday?

14
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,919
Don't you have school?

15
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,421
Are you playing truant?

16
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,156
No, I...

17
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,992
I was sent out on a task.

18
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:07,327
Uncle Hui.

19
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,596
Why do you have this?

20
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,599
This? I was fishing by the dock.

21
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,803
I thought I caught a gigantic black sea bream.

22
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,272
But it turned out to be this.

23
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,673
Is this your painting?

24
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,308
It's impressive.

25
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,844
Uncle Hui, you're so humorous.

26
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,212
If I were so amazing,

27
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,380
I'd be competing abroad.

28
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,615
I wouldn't be here.

29
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,317
A guest at our inn dropped this.

30
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,888
Your guest is pretty talented.

31
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,457
All right, Uncle Hui. I'll take this back.

32
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,458
Sure.

33
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,916
Hello.

34
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,886
Hi.

35
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,589
I think I forgot to introduce myself yesterday.

36
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,090
I'm Xu Lu Xi.

37
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,860
"Xu" is my surname, "Lu" for the ground, and "Xi" for morning.

38
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,128
I'm the owner of Homecoming Inn, the place next door.

39
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,002
Ye Bing Chen.

40
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:25,071
Welcome, Bing Chen.

41
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,639
I grew up here.

42
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,341
My childhood was spent in this place.

43
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,909
I know all the neighbors.

44
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,445
So, if you need help with anything,

45
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,981
feel free to ask me.

46
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,182
Thank you.

47
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,556
If there's nothing else,

48
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,024
I'm very busy.

49
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,628
So, I can't chat with you.

50
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,629
It's fine.

51
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,098
Get on with your tasks, don't mind me.

52
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,266
But...

53
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,303
Do you need someone to help with painting the walls?

54
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:58,771
My little brother is a great artist.

55
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,140
He painted all the inn walls.

56
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,376
If he has time, he can come over to take a look.

57
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:04,544
One more thing.

58
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,145
The outward facing walls of Uncle Hui's place

59
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,914
were also painted by him.

60
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,716
He's as capable as professionals.

61
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,825
I'm not criticizing your painting skills.

62
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:19,993
Don't misunderstand.

63
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,194
I just wanted to say

64
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:24,297
it'll be faster with two people.

65
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,466
Then, you'll have more time to do other things.

66
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,370
It's the same with our inn.

67
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,006
Back then, the neighbors were so enthusiastic.

68
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,009
They helped us renovate the entire place.

69
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,710
Thanks.

70
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,412
But I'm used to working alone.

71
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,248
How about this?

72
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,650
I'll invite you guys over for the opening.

73
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,222
Sure.

74
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,491
I-I'll get going.

75
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,901
Why do you keep following me?

76
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:35,902
I was waiting for you.

77
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,603
I didn't ask you to wait for me.

78
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,672
Can't I wait?

79
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,673
Hey.

80
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,208
You make me want to cycle faster.

81
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,010
It's stressful.

82
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,479
Don't you work out?

83
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,447
That's not it.

84
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,584
Forget it.

85
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:53,585
Yu Xing.

86
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,386
Are you still upset about the painting?

87
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,921
That's not it.

88
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,991
Why do you care if I'm angry?

89
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:32,992
All right, fine.

90
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,127
Don't be angry.

91
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:36,596
I skipped school today to look for the painting.

92
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,464
Look, I'm so sincere.

93
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,366
So, don't hold this against me, okay?

94
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,136
Please.

95
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,573
Brat.

96
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,409
You were the one who tossed it into the sea.

97
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,778
You should be the one to retrieve it.

98
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,846
Why are you shamelessly asking for praises?

99
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,883
I didn't think you'd vomit out of fright from fish.

100
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,353
Any ordinary person would avoid that.

101
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,422
Xu Lu Hui, I barely said anything,

102
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,990
but you're talking back.

103
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,392
I guess someone wants to fail art.

104
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,660
Get lost.

105
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,163
All right, Yu Xing! Yu Xing!

106
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,532
Yu Xing, I'm sorry.

107
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,100
You can have watermelon! Yu Xing!

108
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,643
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,311
Are you going to give me failing grades?

110
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,046
Don't be angry. I'll get watermelon for you.

111
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:28,581
I'm sorry! Sorry!

112
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,882
Don't be angry!

113
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,718
- All right, enough! Stop grabbing my shirt.
- Xu Lu Hui!

114
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,788
Why did you skip classes again to loiter around?

115
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,590
How did you know?

116
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,459
I took your reply slip to school.

117
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,928
The teacher told me.

118
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,163
How did I bring you up?

119
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,132
You can be mischievous and have bad grades,

120
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,534
but you can't slack at studying.

121
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,736
A student should study.

122
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,004
The inn is so busy.

123
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,172
But have the inn's affairs

124
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,640
ever hindered your schooling?

125
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,375
Yes, Big Bro. Let me explain.

126
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,911
It's really not what you think.

127
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,413
Playing truant is what it is.

128
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,581
What excuses do you have?

129
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:02,815
Help me! Ouch!

130
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,485
My arm is breaking! Ouch!

131
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,019
It better be! I didn't even hit you!

132
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,422
- Get over here!
- Big Bro, wait! Stop!

133
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,556
Let me explain, Big Bro!

134
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,092
No excuses! Playing truant is bad!

135
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,827
I'll teach you a lesson today!

136
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,997
I can't let others think you're unruly because our parents aren't around.

137
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,932
Calm down.

138
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,736
I'll apologize on his behalf.

139
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,204
Why are you apologizing?

140
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,539
Lu Hui was helping me

141
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,441
find my painting that fell into the water.

142
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,977
That's why he skipped classes.

143
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,978
That's it.

144
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,816
I see.

145
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,852
You... should've said so!

146
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,388
You didn't let me speak!

147
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,023
I'll let you off the hook this time.

148
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,659
But don't you dare skip classes again.

149
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,461
Change out of your clothes and shower! You stink!

150
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,062
Yes, sir!

151
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,465
Xu Lu Hui, are you asking for a beating?

152
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,872
Sorry, that was embarrassing.

153
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,773
It's fine.

154
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,111
I'll head in.

155
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,246
Oh, Mr. Yu.

156
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,448
If you don't mind,

157
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,650
let's have dinner together.

158
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,888
Let me make it up to you for the poor hospitality.

159
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,990
It's a simple meal, so don't feel too pressured.

160
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,894
Okay.

161
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,597
<i>How was your first day of classes?</i>

162
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,236
<i>It was exhausting.</i>

163
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,805
<i>I don't think I can last for a month.</i>

164
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,187
<i>A painting can move hearts</i>

165
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:25,791
<i>when the piece can convey the painter's feelings.</i>

166
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,394
<i>That's the most valuable part.</i>

167
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,329
<i>You can't stick to the textbook.</i>

168
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,465
<i>You must have your own feelings and beliefs.</i>

169
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,403
<i>Only then can your painting reach others.</i>

170
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:42,274
<i>A painter's feelings...</i>

171
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,583
<i>Look, I'm so sincere.</i>

172
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,986
<i>So, don't hold this against me, okay?</i>

173
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,921
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

174
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,124
<i>Xu Lu Hui, are you asking for a beating?</i>

175
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:10,769
<i>I must be too tired.</i>

176
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,182
Xu Lu Hui!

177
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,017
You're taking too long to shower!

178
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,819
Hurry up and help me out here!

179
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,321
Okay, got it!

180
00:11:39,514 --> 00:11:42,435
<i>[University Options]</i>

181
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,504
<i>Why did you skip classes again to loiter around?</i>

182
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,306
<i>How did you know?</i>

183
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,141
<i>I took your reply slip to school.</i>

184
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,209
<i>The teacher told me.</i>

185
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,216
Big Bro took my slip to the school.

186
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:01,820
I guess that means he agrees.

187
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,469
<i>Lu Hui has discussed it with me many times.</i>

188
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,304
<i>He's worried about leaving you here.</i>

189
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,439
<i>I've been encouraging him to broaden his horizons</i>

190
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,508
<i>and enter university.</i>

191
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,744
<i>Lu Hui is very talented in art.</i>

192
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,812
<i>We lack resources here.</i>

193
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,014
<i>It's a real pity.</i>

194
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,328
Xu Lu Hui, why are you taking so long to shower?

195
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,629
You're wasting water.

196
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,065
Next time, you can only take five-minute showers.

197
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,968
Each minute more has a TWD100 fine.

198
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,937
That's daylight robbery!

199
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,940
How many times have I told you?

200
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,611
You'll catch a cold if you don't wipe
yourself dry after a shower.

201
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,579
I've been saying this since you were a child.

202
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,149
You just won't listen.

203
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,450
Put on your clothes.

204
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,318
Fine.

205
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,457
About the reply slip...

206
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,626
I noticed it was due days ago.

207
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,194
So, I brought it to your school today.

208
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,998
Thanks.

209
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,767
Don't you have anything to say to me?

210
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,969
I thanked you.

211
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,838
Not that.

212
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,640
It's about...

213
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,927
the reply slip.

214
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:33,946
Oh, I'll pass it to you sooner next time.

215
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,247
Don't play dumb.

216
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,954
Whatever, sit down.

217
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:44,255
I'll cut to the chase.

218
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,496
Since you've decided to study art,

219
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,464
why didn't you tell me?

220
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,401
I wanted to tell you,

221
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,538
but I didn't know where to start.

222
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,075
What's there to fear?

223
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,076
Scared that I'd scold you?

224
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,277
No way.

225
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,912
I'm used to you scolding me every single day.

226
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,448
I...

227
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,119
I don't want to leave you here all alone.

228
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,790
Silly.

229
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,961
I may be as naggy as our parents

230
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:25,430
and chide you about everything,

231
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:31,803
but don't forget that we're brothers.

232
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:37,409
Brothers have to support each other.

233
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,749
Do you remember?

234
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,185
When our parents left us,

235
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:51,322
your encouragement gave me the courage to come back.

236
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,563
After that, I used this house from our parents

237
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,164
to run an inn

238
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,800
and raise you.

239
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,603
Right now,

240
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,840
I've done what I needed to.

241
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,841
As for you...

242
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,943
Don't try to stick around and live off me.

243
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,944
Just kidding.

244
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,918
You should chase your dreams while you're young.

245
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,754
If you enjoy painting,

246
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,622
give it your all.

247
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,893
I'm an independent adult.

248
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,862
I can care for myself.

249
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:32,932
Besides,

250
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,334
a brat like you shouldn't be worrying about me.

251
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,769
I just don't want you to be all alone here.

252
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,205
- Give me a kiss.
- Chill. Go away.

253
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,008
Next time, just be frank with me.

254
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,145
We're family, so you shouldn't
worry about telling me things.

255
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,379
By the way,

256
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:52,016
Mr. Yu is a temp art teacher at your school.

257
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:55,621
Should I ask him to teach you art?

258
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,189
If I need your help with something so simple,

259
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,557
I'll be a real loser.

260
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,193
Who am I? I'm Xu Lu Hui.

261
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,262
I already have a plan, so leave it to me.

262
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,837
What? Why are you knocking so hastily?

263
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,877
Well?

264
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,945
Why aren't you saying anything?

265
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,886
Is there something wrong with my body?

266
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,322
What are you doing?

267
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,257
Wait,

268
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,259
you're still wet.

269
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,262
My brother said that you'll catch a cold easily
if you don't wipe yourself dry.

270
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,397
But I helped you with that,

271
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,632
so don't worry.

272
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,602
I need your help with something.

273
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,037
Can we talk inside?

274
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,775
Come on in.

275
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,044
Hang on.

276
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,246
Put on your clothes.

277
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,614
Why?

278
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,949
Don't distract me.

279
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,753
No, I meant...

280
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,221
I'm worried that you might feel cold.

281
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,368
Sorry, I was careless,

282
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,337
that's why your painting is drenched.

283
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,308
It's fine, I planned on redoing it anyway.

284
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,676
This is a rejected piece.

285
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,711
Rejected?

286
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,516
After you're done looking at it, toss it out.

287
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,720
By the way, I'm no longer upset with you.

288
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,455
This artwork was rejected?

289
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,090
That's impossible.

290
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,793
Tell me, who's so blind to do that?

291
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,761
How could they reject such a great painting?

292
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,831
So what if I tell you?

293
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,766
I'll gouge his eyeballs out

294
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:49,701
and stick them onto the painting
so they can have a good look.

295
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,504
And I checked. This piece won an award.

296
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,706
I wonder who was so blind.

297
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,242
They must have no sense of aesthetics.

298
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,547
This may be an award-winning piece,

299
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:04,550
but my professor isn't pleased with it.

300
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,285
Why not?

301
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,987
Your painting is a replica of the real scenery.

302
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:12,190
The brushstrokes are so fine.

303
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,127
You said you wanted to redo it.

304
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,795
Can I have this painting?

305
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:17,863
Why do you want it?

306
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,432
I like it and want to use it as a reference.

307
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,601
Please? Can I have it?

308
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,902
Take it if you like it.

309
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,837
Thanks.

310
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:32,110
Oh, what did you need my help with?

311
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,447
You'll help me, right?

312
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,949
Let me hear it first.

313
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,686
Fine, I'll assume you agree.

314
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:42,954
Can you teach me how to paint?

315
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,595
No way.

316
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,963
Why not?

317
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,475
That's hideous.

318
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:08,446
Why is it so sketchy?

319
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,556
<i>Countdown to Blue Heart Cafe's opening.</i>

320
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,558
<i>I'm stumped by how to paint the walls.</i>

321
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,126
<i>The walls outside need to be painted, too.</i>

322
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,719
Honey,

323
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,789
you always handled the aesthetic aspects.

324
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,662
Even this coffee can

325
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,464
was painted by you.

326
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:06,938
Can I really survive without you around?

327
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,148
But we made a promise.

328
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,319
It's been two years.

329
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,120
I've been working very hard

330
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,456
to fulfill our promise.

331
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:53,509
<i>[#PromisesMadeMustBeFulfilled
#RetirementLifeRunningACafeByTheSea]</i>

332
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:13,272
I won't teach you.

333
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:17,276
Please.

334
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,144
So, you planned everything.

335
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,412
You praised my painting,

336
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,513
because you wanted me to help you.

337
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,148
That's why you said all that.

338
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,216
No.

339
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,717
I genuinely like your painting.

340
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,757
Fine, explain yourself.

341
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:33,425
Why do you want to learn to paint?

342
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,894
Why do you like to paint?

343
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:38,997
Come here.

344
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,599
What are you doing?

345
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,868
- Hey, what the heck?
- Just come with me.

346
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:48,372
This is why I enjoy painting.

347
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,243
People will disappear,

348
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,178
but emotions won't.

349
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,247
Neither will paintings.

350
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,317
Once I paint the feelings I want to preserve forever,

351
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,352
they will never be forgotten.

352
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:07,059
Even now, I still remember

353
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,262
how sweet the watermelon was back then

354
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,697
and how happy I was.

355
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,972
If I draw everything that I want to remember,

356
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,474
I won't forget about them.

357
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,350
<i>Yu Xing, what are you drawing?</i>

358
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,451
<i>A pinky promise.</i>

359
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:34,419
<i>Why are you drawing that?</i>

360
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,054
<i>I'm drawing the promise down.</i>

361
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:39,190
<i>Once I do, I won't forget about it.</i>

362
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,630
So...

363
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,168
So, I want to create more amazing artworks.

364
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,137
I want to preserve even more emotions.

365
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,639
That's why I want to study art in university.

366
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,141
So, please teach me.

367
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:00,178
No.

368
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,180
Please.

369
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,383
You know that this place is out of the way.

370
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,685
No art teachers come here.

371
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:08,720
I really want to learn.

372
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,456
You're all I have, so please!

373
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,759
No, I'm busy.

374
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,128
I also have to redo that oil painting you got wet.

375
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,619
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

376
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,986
I'll help you up.

377
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,454
Get lost.

378
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:34,105
He may look callous,

379
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,475
but he has a very sensitive heart.

380
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,776
Time to get up.

381
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,144
I always sleep naked.

382
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,645
You didn't see anything, right?

383
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,980
Xu Lu Hui!

384
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,915
Get in the water!

385
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,817
The new neighbor's pretty nice, right?

386
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:49,086
I think he's your cup of tea.

387
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,204
Mr. Xu!

388
00:24:53,674 --> 00:24:55,460
Before you start sketching,

389
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,496
you have to learn to be a keen observer.

390
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,031
You can start sketching
after you've gotten a good look.
