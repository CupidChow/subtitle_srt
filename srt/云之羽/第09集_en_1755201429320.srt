[My Journey to You]

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,050
[Episode 9]

4
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:40,800
Father!

5
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,450
I don't want to go in.

6
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,100
It's cold inside.

7
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,229
No.

8
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,390
Young Master.

9
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,860
Yun.

10
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,310
Did I fall asleep?

11
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,200
You fainted from the cold.

12
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,820
I told you not to act tough or be impatient,

13
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,040
but you still acted recklessly.

14
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,860
If I hadn't come,

15
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,450
you might have

16
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,079
frozen to death in that ice bucket.

17
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,560
Why are your hands so hot?

18
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,030
I've had a nickname

19
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,350
since I was little,

20
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,530
called Little Furnace.

21
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,120
Why would a girl like you

22
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,920
have such a nickname?

23
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,340
My family said

24
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,760
that my mother had reached the full term

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,850
of pregnancy with me,

26
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,510
but there was no sign of birth.

27
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,310
I wasn't born until a dozen days later.

28
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,820
They teased

29
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,480
that I was well-cooked.

30
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,020
What a coincidence.

31
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,090
I had a premature birth,

32
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,430
so I tend to be cold.

33
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,750
With the two of us,

34
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,150
one is like ice

35
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,680
and the other is like fire.

36
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,610
We are a match made in...

37
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,090
Made in...

38
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,180
Yun,

39
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,980
you just said

40
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,200
it was you who pulled me out of the ice bucket.

41
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,360
I couldn't carry you by myself,

42
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,240
so I asked some servants

43
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,790
to help lift you out.

44
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,850
Young Master Ziyu.

45
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,340
You saw everything?

46
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,600
Yes.

47
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,640
I only saw your chest.

48
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,690
You're a man.

49
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,180
This is nothing.

50
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,050
Besides,

51
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,770
I'm already married to you.

52
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,779
We're not married yet.

53
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,600
Won't you ask me

54
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,820
why I came to see you in the middle of the night?

55
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,910
How would I know?

56
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,640
Young Master,

57
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,180
what are you thinking?

58
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,980
You asked me

59
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,620
why you came to me.

60
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,450
What?

61
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,100
I came to tell you

62
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,320
I seem to have found

63
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,159
the way to pass the first trial.

64
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,850
Really?

65
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,090
There are hundreds of mental techniques in the world,

66
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,460
but they can be roughly divided into

67
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,270
metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

68
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,360
[Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth]

69
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,410
These five types.

70
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,750
These five types

71
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,010
can be further divided into yin and yang.

72
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,200
Among them, metal and fire techniques

73
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,060
are the Supreme Yang techniques,

74
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,610
such as the Yang-Splitting Chant of the Kunlun Sect

75
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,070
and the Metal Language of the Cangshan Sect.

76
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,180
Water and wood techniques are the Supreme Yin techniques,

77
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,910
such as

78
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,020
the Brocade Heart Sutra of the Qingfeng Sect,

79
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,240
and the Water Avoidance Art of the Blackwater Sect.

80
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,970
Furthermore, the Yijin Manual

81
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,690
has an earth attribute.

82
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,750
It includes both yin and yang,

83
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,780
integrating all.

84
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,260
If the Gong residence's mental techniques

85
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,659
are under metal and fire,

86
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,560
then the Ice Pool can naturally be overcome.

87
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,270
This coincides

88
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,710
with what Jin Fan said.

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,420
The first trial

90
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,330
seems to ask you

91
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,540
to find the Snow Saber Scripture at the bottom of the Ice Pool,

92
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,740
but actually,

93
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,640
it is testing your internal skill.

94
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,050
But

95
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,030
the Gong residence

96
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,780
has multiple kinds of mental techniques.

97
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,980
We have so many kinds.

98
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,790
The Gong residence

99
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,270
has created three unique mental techniques.

100
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,240
In addition,

101
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,590
my ancestors had fought in the martial world for years

102
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,850
and learned many top mental techniques.

103
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,430
Even

104
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,370
some long-lost mental techniques

105
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,220
from major martial sects

106
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,890
are also recorded within the Gong residence.

107
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:26,090
It's just that we are not allowed to cultivate them.

108
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,040
Then,

109
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,730
which one do you cultivate?

110
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,460
Snowmelt Heart Sutra.

111
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,500
I've never heard of it.

112
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,620
It's a unique method created by the Gong residence.

113
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,950
Few people cultivate it

114
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,010
even within the Gong residence.

115
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,420
Father,

116
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,690
it's too cold.

117
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,740
I can't stand it anymore.

118
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,409
If you don't want to be frozen, use the chant.

119
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,240
I've memorized it long ago,

120
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,930
but it's too cold. I can't recite it.

121
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,240
You're too weak.

122
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,270
You don't deserve to be my son.

123
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,660
Look at how your brother

124
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,070
practices martial arts.

125
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,740
Cold air...

126
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,600
Cold air enters the clouds.

127
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,900
The reception and delivery must be controlled.

128
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,810
You're not allowed to cry.

129
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:30,800
Continue.

130
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,570
Gather in the core.

131
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,020
Snow...

132
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,400
Snow falls, but the heart does not.

133
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,770
Both enter the Fengmen acupoint.

134
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,090
The pulse nears the end point.

135
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,740
That's great.

136
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,000
It's not great.

137
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,100
My internal skill

138
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,150
can't even hold up

139
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,550
against the winter wind,

140
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,040
let alone dive to the bottom of the Ice Pool.

141
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,390
After my mother passed away,

142
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,710
my father

143
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,760
became stricter and colder to me.

144
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,600
I was born with cold intolerance,

145
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,270
but my father forced me

146
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,330
to practice in frigid environments.

147
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,860
So,

148
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,900
I always resisted

149
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,470
cultivating the Snowmelt Heart Sutra

150
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,260
and gave up later.

151
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,530
The ginger tea is cold.

152
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,890
I'll heat it up for you.

153
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,750
It's okay.

154
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,350
I'm not afraid of this kind of cold.

155
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,700
Young Master, do you think

156
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,340
that the former Sword Wielder

157
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,790
was too heartless to you?

158
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,200
Do you remember what I told you

159
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,620
about my father's shipwreck?

160
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,310
Of course I remember.

161
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,830
I misunderstood you at that time.

162
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,590
I thought you set the river lantern

163
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,170
to send some news out.

164
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,470
After my father passed away,

165
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,720
my mother supported the whole family by herself.

166
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,870
After that,

167
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,720
my mother, who once doted on me,

168
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,160
gradually became strict.

169
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,590
Is that similar to your situation?

170
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,750
When I was young,

171
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,330
I used to ride horses with my godmother, Zhuo Mei,

172
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,820
and practice swordsmanship

173
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,820
and martial arts.

174
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,890
I was as free as a boy.

175
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,260
But after my father's death,

176
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,660
my mother started forcing me to the learn women's virtues.

177
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,470
Every day, I had to practice needlework,

178
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,270
instruments, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

179
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,520
Mother said

180
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,310
that Zhuo Mei had extraordinary swordsmanship,

181
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,040
but she lived a miserable life.

182
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,390
If I can't protect myself by learning martial arts,

183
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,520
it's better to marry into a good family

184
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,770
and protect my whole clan.

185
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,640
Mother told me every day

186
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,430
that a woman

187
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,700
can't live on her own.

188
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,520
Later,

189
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,400
I gradually gave up

190
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,240
and accepted myself

191
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,710
as a tool for my mother to climb up the social ranks.

192
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,480
But in my heart,

193
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,070
a voice continued to tell me

194
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,740
that a person

195
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,730
only lives once.

196
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,850
I should live the way I like.

197
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,020
A skylark

198
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,470
should call out in the valley,

199
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,420
listen to the rain,

200
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,620
and smell the fragrant flowers,

201
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,620
instead of singing in a cage.

202
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,260
So,

203
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,510
I told my mother

204
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,610
I just want to live for myself.

205
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,150
I don't want to be anyone's accessory.

206
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,240
What right do you have to say no?

207
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,690
Since I have no right to say no,

208
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,670
then why am I practicing this?

209
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,000
You are practicing this

210
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,310
so that one day,

211
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,720
you can say no to others.

212
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,510
That's why

213
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,770
you kept wanting to escape from the Gong residence.

214
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:50,250
But later, I realized

215
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,570
that my mother was just worried that our family

216
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,700
only has women left.

217
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,730
We no longer have someone

218
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,080
who can support us.

219
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,320
She was afraid that I'd be mistreated in the future.

220
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,850
You owe your life to Wufeng.

221
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,360
You also owe your skills to Wufeng.

222
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,730
As long as you're alive,

223
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,980
you must be useful to Wufeng.

224
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,340
Even if you die,

225
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,270
you must still be useful to Wufeng.

226
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,450
I can't live the way I want,

227
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,450
but at the very least,

228
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,150
I can die as I wish.

229
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,030
You can,

230
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,960
but you dare not.

231
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,400
Why not?

232
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,630
Because you still have Yun Que.

233
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:42,520
As long as

234
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,150
there is someone you love in this world,

235
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,930
you won't dare to die.

236
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,330
If you don't want to have weaknesses,

237
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,810
you must not love anyone.

238
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,920
In my mother's eyes,

239
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,510
the martial arts world filled with conflicts

240
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,310
is too difficult

241
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,600
for a woman.

242
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,750
So, to her,

243
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,580
the Gong family was what could be relied on.

244
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,290
There is a mission now.

245
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,580
You can leave Wufeng

246
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,390
once you complete it

247
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,140
and get the freedom you want.

248
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,770
Actually, the care given by parents

249
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,880
is like the delicate rain on a spring night,

250
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,480
replenishing soundlessly.

251
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,930
My strict mother

252
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,100
watched me suffer every day,

253
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,840
but she tried her best

254
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,780
to bring me new gimmicks from the outside world

255
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,680
to cheer me up.

256
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,990
Give it to your sister.

257
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,280
But she never said anything.

258
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,700
Our parents forced us to grow up,

259
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:05,150
but it's not their original intention.

260
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,010
They just hope

261
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,380
that before they pass away,

262
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,870
we can learn more

263
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,980
and be able to

264
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,720
safely survive in this world.

265
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,170
More than anything,

266
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,240
they wish we can be children forever.

267
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,760
You're not young anymore.

268
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,300
You'd better think it over.

269
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:34,510
If

270
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,650
you want to continue being useless,

271
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,520
there's no need for you to stay in the Gong family anymore.

272
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,560
Did I overstep boundaries again?

273
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,120
No.

274
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,780
I like to hear you talk about

275
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,860
your past life.

276
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,800
I also like to hear about

277
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,960
the outside world.

278
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,790
Young Master,

279
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,820
have you never been outside?

280
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,120
Never.

281
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,870
If we have time in the future,

282
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,650
I will accompany you out to see it.

283
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:21,720
Okay.

284
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,870
But

285
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,810
my back...

286
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,060
After the secret text is tattooed,

287
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,020
you will never be able to leave the Jiuchen Valley.

288
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,030
You must live here for the rest of your life.

289
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,480
What?

290
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,410
Now that I carry the weight of Sword Wielder on my back,

291
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,140
I might not be as free as before.

292
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,070
I got it.

293
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,640
Earlier, you said

294
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,020
the former Sword Wielder always had you practice

295
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,750
the Snowmelt Heart Sutra in frigid environments.

296
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,470
I wonder

297
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,780
if he wanted to

298
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,390
make things easier for you?

299
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,250
I don't dare to speculate

300
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,110
the former Sword Wielder's mind,

301
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,800
But I did hear from my godmother, Zhuo Mei

302
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,910
that Supreme Yang techniques

303
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,350
should be practiced in extremely cold places,

304
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,750
while Supreme Yin forces

305
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,410
should be gained in burning places.

306
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,690
I've never heard of this before.

307
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,020
I didn't understand at that time either,

308
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,020
but my godmother explained it to me.

309
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,640
She said that ordinary people who don't know martial arts

310
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,100
can't help but run and jump

311
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,020
when faced with extreme cold

312
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,750
to warm up their body against the cold.

313
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,670
Those who have internal skills

314
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,820
unconsciously activate their internal skill

315
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,300
to resist the cold.

316
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,680
As time passes,

317
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,470
your internal skill will increase vastly.

318
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,730
You mean,

319
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,670
I accidentally got the way to pass the Ice Pool trial

320
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,710
by soaking in ice water?

321
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,530
Young Master,

322
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,480
you will depart again in a few days.

323
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,180
I'm afriad the cold from the ice water alone

324
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,480
is far from enough.

325
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,810
Then,

326
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,900
how about I sleep

327
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,359
in the lake of Xue Lineage's garden tonight?

328
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,640
I just wanted to liven up the atmosphere.

329
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,910
Ice water is only an external cold.

330
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,490
It's superficial.

331
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,440
It won't improve

332
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,650
your internal skills significantly in a few days.

333
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,520
External cold.

334
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,190
Then what should I do?

335
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,200
Should I chew ice and swallow it?

336
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,120
Miss Yun, are you hot?

337
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,560
My room is full of ice.

338
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,950
You shouldn't be hot.

339
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,620
I'm okay.

340
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,670
Ice and snow

341
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,440
are indeed external colds.

342
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,430
But what about poison inside your body?

343
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,560
Ingesting Supreme Yang poison

344
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,690
can make one feel like they're in hell,

345
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,460
suffering scathing pain.

346
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,790
Meanwhile, Supreme Yin poison

347
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,800
will make one feel

348
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,470
bone-gnawing coldness.

349
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,520
Young Master's extremely cold physique

350
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,490
is rare.

351
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,830
If you take Supreme Cold poison,

352
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,650
no matter what you're doing,

353
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,710
no matter the time,

354
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,720
your body will be constantly activating your internal skill

355
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,180
to resist the cold poison.

356
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,650
In this way,

357
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,150
your skills will

358
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,670
definitely increase vastly in a short time.

359
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:52,170
What's wrong?

360
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,640
Did I

361
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:55,490
say something wrong?

362
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,530
You're right.

363
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,390
There are

364
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,580
a handful of Supreme Cold poisons in the Gong residence,

365
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,360
but...

366
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,510
But what?

367
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,550
I've been taking Herb Elixir for a long time.

368
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,080
The poison won't work on me.

369
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,100
Then what if you stop taking it for now

370
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,300
and continue after passing this trial?

371
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,530
I'm sorry.

372
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,510
I was inconsiderate.

373
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,490
Yun,

374
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,550
the Gong residence...

375
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,130
Something just happened to the Gong residence.

376
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,990
Elder Yue was just assassinated,

377
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,270
while the former Sword Wielder and Young Lord

378
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,450
died of poisoning,

379
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,090
yet I suggested that you  stop taking the Herb Elixir

380
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,900
at a time like this.

381
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,460
I am a fool.

382
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,890
Yun, don't say that.

383
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,270
What I meant was

384
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,230
all of the Gong residence's poisons and antidotes

385
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,760
are managed and distributed by Gong Yuanzhi.

386
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,670
The reception, usage, depletion, and surpluses

387
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,390
are all strictly recorded.

388
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,460
He definitely will not allow me

389
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,400
to take a Supreme Cold poison for no reason.

390
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,130
What do you want to say?

391
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,000
Say it.

392
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,390
I trust you.

393
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,170
You can tell me anything.

394
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,590
My godmother, Zhuo Mei,

395
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,870
had been too impatient

396
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,450
when practicing these past few years,

397
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,740
which led to rage.

398
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,250
So,

399
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,210
she produces a kind of cold poison

400
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,740
to suppress the fiery rage in her body.

401
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,080
She said it is attacking poison with poison.

402
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,450
Then,

403
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,050
do you know how to make such cold poison?

404
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,020
Young Master.

405
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,680
Just tell me

406
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,480
if you know how to make it or not.

407
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,530
Choosing to trust you

408
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,170
is my own decision.

409
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,940
You don't need to worry.

410
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,210
I can.

411
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,140
Come.

412
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,580
Let's go to the clinic together.

413
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,520
Absolutely not.

414
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,500
If you go,

415
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,920
I won't be able to make the poison.

416
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:16,260
Why not?

417
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,290
You are the Sword Wielder now.

418
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,050
You catch attention wherever you go.

419
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,270
Besides,

420
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,450
you are in the middle of the trial

421
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,790
and the Gong residence is amidst a turmoil.

422
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,440
The clinic

423
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,690
is under Gong Yuanzhi's authority.

424
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,640
If you go there,

425
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:33,880
it will

426
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,870
cause unnecessary speculations and setbacks.

427
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,980
If you trust me,

428
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,880
I'll go on your behalf.

429
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,190
Okay.

430
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:53,650
Wait.

431
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,220
What's wrong?

432
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,410
I haven't finished yet.

433
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,110
Do you know how tight

434
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,830
the Gong residence's security is at night?

435
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,470
Secret guards and patrols

436
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,910
are scattered in places you can't see.

437
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,100
The poisonous arrows and needles hidden in the shadows

438
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,230
are indiscriminate in their attacks.

439
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,750
This is the patrol route

440
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,570
and layout of the secret guards

441
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,920
from here to the clinic.

442
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,180
Try to avoid them.

443
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:30,020
Don't run into any trouble.

444
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,800
Be careful.

445
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,360
[Zhi]

446
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:00,680
Who goes there?

447
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,220
Yun Weishan, the Sword Wielder's new Green Jade Guardian.

448
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,730
I was ordered to come to the clinic

449
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,390
to make a soothing decoction.

450
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,580
The Gong residence is on alert tonight.

451
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,240
Return as soon as you're done.

452
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,050
Yes.

453
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,000
[Clinic]

454
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,000
If the burning pain of the Fortnight Flies

455
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,200
is too insufferable,

456
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,620
you can use these herbs to make a tea.

457
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,300
Add brown gardenia,

458
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,660
sprouted fire licorice,

459
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,860
and amber with winter worms

460
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,490
to this prescription,

461
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,680
Then add cinnabar and saltpeter,

462
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,700
and boil with half-cooked water.

463
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,240
You will create a Supreme Cold poison.

464
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:22,530
[Cinnabar]

465
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,410
[The Yang family of Gusu]

466
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,350
[Has symptoms of dizziness, may have risks of premature birth]

467
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,790
Has symptoms of dizziness.

468
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,030
Thus gives birth prematurely.

469
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,460
Nepeta.

470
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,860
As expected of the former Sword Wielder.

471
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,190
It's indeed deceptive.

472
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,800
Someone is making medicine.

473
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,380
Put down the bottle.

474
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:23,570
Otherwise,

475
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,700
the blade will come down.

476
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,960
It's you, Miss Yun.

477
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,660
Why are you

478
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,690
sneaking around the clinic

479
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,520
in the middle of the night?

480
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,750
I'm here on the order of the Sword Wielder.

481
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,640
How am I sneaking around?

482
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,280
All the guards along the way saw me

483
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,610
and guided me.

484
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,060
If you don't believe me,

485
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,220
you can ask them.

486
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,180
Okay.

487
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,430
They know you're here,

488
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,180
but do they know why you are here?

489
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,310
I'm here to help the Lord Sword Wielder

490
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,880
make a soothing decoction.

491
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,140
Those who enter the clinic without permission

492
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,070
can be executed by the Zhi Lineage.

493
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,280
Did you know that?

494
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,360
Does the Sword Wielder's permission

495
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
not count either?

496
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,500
There are traces of cinnabar on your clothes.

497
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,640
The decoction smells of saltpeter.

498
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,070
There's also gardenia.

499
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,870
Miss Yun,

500
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,170
these ingredients

501
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,570
are not soothing at all.

502
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,130
You are making poison.

503
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,500
The people of the Gong family

504
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,520
all take the Herb Elixir made personally by you.

505
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,180
What's the use of poison?

506
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,650
Unless there's something wrong

507
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,360
with your Herb Elixir.

508
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,820
Give me your hand.

509
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,390
This is a witchcraft bug.

510
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:23,940
If you are honest,

511
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,100
it will not hurt you.

512
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,350
But if you lie,

513
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,640
it will mercilessly stab

514
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,830
into your skin.

515
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:34,980
Tell me.

516
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,300
Who do you plan to harm

517
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,300
with this poison?

518
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:39,140
Is it me

519
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,050
or my brother?

520
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,590
Or

521
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,420
do you want to kill Gong Ziyu?

522
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,260
It is said that Young Master Yuanzhi

523
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,400
is a rare pharmacology genius.

524
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,430
I didn’t expect you to be so childish.

525
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,340
If witchcraft bugs really do exist,

526
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:08,690
you should have used it to prove your innocence

527
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,610
when Housekeeper Jia accused you the other day.

528
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,210
You wouldn't have ended up

529
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,980
thrown into the dungeon by the elders.

530
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,380
Although you are not as beautiful as Shangguan Qian,

531
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,840
you seem smarter than her.

532
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,720
But to me,

533
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,870
beauty and brains

534
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
are both useless.

535
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,590
Drink half of this.

536
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:38,340
This is the decoction made for the Sword Wielder.

537
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,420
I can't drink it.

538
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,080
It's supposed to be soothing.

539
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,950
What are you afraid of?

540
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,380
I'm not qualified to drink the Sword Wielder's medicine.

541
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,790
I have many herbs here.

542
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,960
I'll help make another one for you and send it to the Yu Lineage.

543
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,670
This clinic

544
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,330
is under the Zhi Lineage's jurisdiction.

545
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,780
If something from this clinic

546
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,570
made Young Master Ziyu sick,

547
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,050
it would be difficult for me to explain myself.

548
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,510
Happy?

549
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,190
Young Master Yuanzhi, what are you doing?

550
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,020
I am the Sword Wielder's wife.

551
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,170
The Sword Wielder's wife?

552
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,810
I don't even respect the Sword Wielder,

553
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:56,730
let alone his wife.

554
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,810
You don't qualify.

555
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,530
No matter who I am,

556
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,640
how will you explain it

557
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,900
if something happens to me in your jurisdiction?

558
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,360
What's so hard to explain?

559
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,380
It's a dark, moonless night

560
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,840
with no lights or candles.

561
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,430
I found someone

562
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:17,760
stealing medicine in my clinic

563
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,890
and killed them.

564
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,060
Afterward, I found that the medicine thief

565
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,260
was the Gong residence's bride-to-be.

566
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,360
What did I do wrong?

567
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,590
If they also find some poison

568
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:30,680
on your body,

569
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,640
people will definitely not suspect me

570
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,770
for acting first and reporting later.

571
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,540
It's just poison.

572
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,560
I have plenty.

573
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,030
Gong Yuanzhi,

574
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,080
do you know what you are doing?

575
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,740
Gong Ziyu,

576
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,820
do you know what she is doing?

577
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,870
Of course I do.

578
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,100
Otherwise, why would I come to protect her?

579
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,900
That's great.

580
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,010
Tell me.

581
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:05,980
How dare you, the Sword Wielder,

582
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,540
send your unmarried wife

583
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,860
to infiltrate the clinic in the middle of the night

584
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,520
and secretly create a poison?

585
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,670
Who is it for?

586
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,370
I'm the Sword Wielder.

587
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,640
I don't need to explain this to you.

588
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,040
Young Master Ziyu,

589
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,620
were you

590
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,800
waiting for me outside the clinic all this time?

591
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,030
Yes.

592
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,400
I was worried about you,

593
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,450
so I followed you.

594
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,980
It's heavily guarded here at night.

595
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:59,450
I feared you would run into trouble.

596
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,510
Then I heard a commotion inside,

597
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,740
so I rushed in with Jin Fan.

598
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,090
Thank you.

599
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,540
Young Master,

600
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,450
I prepared the medicine,

601
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,350
but the dosage is not enough.

602
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,750
I'll make some more tomorrow.

603
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:22,740
Is there not enough reserve in the warehouse?

604
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,910
The Gong residence's pharmacy

605
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,840
has everything.

606
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,370
But just now,

607
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,640
Young Master Yuanzhi asked me to prove

608
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,430
that the medicine isn't poisonous,

609
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,360
so he ordered me to drink half of it.

610
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,570
Give me your hand.

611
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:41,690
This is...

612
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,780
Herb Elixir.

613
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,570
Young Master, you'll give me

614
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,170
something so precious?

615
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,140
Rumor has it

616
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,060
that one Herb Elixir is worth ten taels of gold,

617
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,900
but it doesn't have a market.

618
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,190
No one has ever

619
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,460
bought a genuine Herb Elixir before.

620
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,140
But for us,

621
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,110
it's just an everyday object.

622
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,120
If you take it now,

623
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,750
it can remove the Supreme Cold poison

624
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,700
you ingested for me.

625
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,170
The Herb Elixir is the most effective

626
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,640
when taken daily

627
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,650
and it can protect you from the toxin

628
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,980
before being poisoned.

629
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:25,930
But if you can take it promptly after being poisoned,

630
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:28,190
it can also have most of the same effects.

631
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,330
This poison

632
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,350
is extremely cold and painful,

633
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,350
but it's not fatal.

634
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,020
I'll be fine after just one night.

635
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,790
You should keep

636
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,230
this Herb Elixir for yourself.

637
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,430
Don't waste

638
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,330
something so precious on me.

639
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,440
It's not a waste

640
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,890
as long as it's for you.

641
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,750
Besides,

642
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,370
according to our arrangement,

643
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,730
I should stop taking the Herb Elixir for a few days.

644
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,989
Instead of wasting it,

645
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,719
I'd rather give it to you.

646
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:21,100
Alright.

647
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:22,510
Stop hesitating.

648
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,219
Take it.

649
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,080
What's wrong?

650
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,929
It's dark.

651
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,570
Let me lead you.

652
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,170
♫River lights, mountains dark, moon round♫

653
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,510
♫Moonlight shines upon the mountain south♫

654
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,320
♫My beloved♫

655
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,540
♫Gazes at me but with a river between us♫

656
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,100
♫The clouds and wind don't speak♫

657
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,780
♫Love begins with a point in one's heart♫

658
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,020
♫I have an empty room in my heart♫

659
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,990
♫But it can't be filled by gold and silver♫

660
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:42,890
♫A refuge in this world is rare♫

661
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:50,750
♫How the years go by with whitening hair♫

662
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,450
♫Listen to the shepherd boy's song♫

663
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,970
♫Ask the flowers and leaves whom they fall for♫

664
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:03,520
♫Wish moonlight can soothe the displaced ones♫

665
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,350
What's wrong?

666
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,180
I bumped into Yun Weishan in the clinic

667
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,960
and caught her in the act of making poison.

668
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,880
But then Gong Ziyu used his Sword Wielder status

669
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,670
and took her away.

670
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,740
Yun Weishan

671
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,190
produced poison?

672
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,940
Yes.

673
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,470
I saw her herbal residue.

674
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,260
It was gardenia, fire licorice, and amber with winter worms.

675
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,730
When boiling,

676
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,680
she added cinnabar and saltpeter.

677
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,600
This is obviously the prescription

678
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,000
for a Supreme Yin poison.

679
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,770
It was turned into a lump of black residue

680
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,930
and you could still distinguish the ingredients?

681
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,190
Brother,

682
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:54,870
others wouldn't know,

683
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,190
but to me,

684
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,530
it's a piece of cake.

685
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
Did Gong Ziyu know

686
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,840
that Yun Weishan was producing poison?

687
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,470
That fool.

688
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,750
He would say yes even if he didn't.

689
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:09,830
Brother,

690
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,110
you should've seen how he was

691
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,620
when he protected Yun Weishan.

692
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,380
Yun Weishan

693
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,320
is helping Gong Ziyu pass the Ice Pool trial.

694
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,760
Ice Pool?

695
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,910
What is this?

696
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,210
The Ice Lotus Pool

697
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,360
is the first test of the Trial of the Three Realms.

698
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,590
Brother,

699
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,560
according to the Gong family's rules,

700
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,020
you probably shouldn't have told me, right?

701
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:37,430
You've broken more than enough rules already.

702
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,530
Besides,

703
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,940
I don't think I told you anything.

704
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,310
You're so nice to me.

705
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:47,880
Brother,

706
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,660
what's so special

707
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,760
about the Ice Pool?

708
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,580
It sounds mysterious.

709
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,540
Don't ask about it.

710
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,490
When you are an adult

711
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,890
and go to the back hill for the trials,

712
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,990
you'll naturally find out.

713
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:02,840
It's easy.

714
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,360
I won't be a loser like Gong Ziyu

715
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:07,520
and be stuck in there for 3 or 4 days.

716
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,500
Back then, I was trapped there for 12 days.

717
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,930
But Brother,

718
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,290
I don't want to be the Sword Wielder.

719
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,170
You can do it.

720
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,570
So, I don't have to do

721
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,520
the trials in the back hill.

722
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,270
You must go.

723
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,260
If you don't want to be mistreated in the future,

724
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,000
you must go.

725
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,050
I'll do whatever you say.

726
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,190
By the way,

727
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,020
Yun Weishan's prescription

728
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,680
was very complicated.

729
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:04,760
It's not something that ordinary people can master.

730
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,710
Also, I just fought with her.

731
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,900
Her martial arts skills aren't bad either.

732
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,580
I don't think

733
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,940
she is Miss Yun from Lixi Town.

734
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,610
Of course she's not.

735
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,610
However,

736
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,560
there are no flaws in her identity

737
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,060
and Gong Ziyu is protecting her with all his might.

738
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,620
Without solid evidence,

739
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,030
it's hard to do anything to her.

740
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,610
However,

741
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,120
the frost and dew are heavy in winter.

742
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,990
If you walk too much at night,

743
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,790
things can get dangerous.

744
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,160
Are my hands a little cold?

745
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,600
I've been easily cold since childhood.

746
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,730
My body temperature

747
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,600
is always lower than the others.

748
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,560
But Miss Yun,

749
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,580
your hands are so hot.

750
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,090
I envy you.

751
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,760
What's there to envy?

752
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:15,640
The elders say

753
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,240
the palm is the heart of the hand.

754
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,660
Those with warm hands

755
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,590
are also warm-hearted.

756
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,560
Young Master Ziyu, you look cold but are warm inside.

757
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,610
I can feel it.

758
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,760
You're the opposite of me.

759
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,680
On the contrary,

760
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,550
I quite envy you.

761
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,730
The opposite?

762
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,670
Then, do you have a warm surface but cold heart?

763
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:41,970
I can warm you up.

764
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,970
The snow is thick.

765
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,350
We are further into winter.

766
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,870
Are you waiting for him?

767
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,010
I believe he will come back.

768
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,070
Jin Fan,

769
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,680
where's Gong Ziyu?

770
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,380
Lord Sword Wielder went to the back hill early in the morning.

771
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,380
Is he okay?

772
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,090
He has been frowning

773
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,730
ever since he returned from the back hill.

774
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,000
His brows are all knitted together.

775
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,470
The Sword Wielder seems to be in good spirits.

776
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,200
Don't worry.

777
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,330
He seems to be confident about the Ice Pool.

778
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,260
No wonder.

779
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,900
I secretly heard the servants say

780
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,600
that Miss Yun stayed in his room

781
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,410
for half the night yesterday.

782
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,130
It's all thanks to her.

783
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,030
The Sword Wielder and Miss Yun

784
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,290
merely had a chat

785
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,320
about their aspirations

786
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,330
and life.

787
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,210
How do you know they were talking?

788
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,610
You eavesdropped

789
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,910
while doing a handstand again?

790
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,610
I have no time to waste with you.

791
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,210
Lord Sword Wielder gave me a task.

792
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:23,780
Goodbye.

793
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,370
Okay.

794
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,920
I'll go with you.

795
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,860
Take me with you.

796
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:28,830
Wait for me!

797
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,910
Hey, stop running!

798
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,430
-Don’t follow me.
-Hey!

799
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,270
Lady Wuji.

800
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,680
Lady Wuji.

801
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:20,990
Lady Wuji.

802
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:05,130
It seems that Lady Wuji forgot to close the window.

803
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,770
You're lucky.

804
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,930
The Yang family of Gusu.

805
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,880
In good health.

806
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,770
A full-term birth.

807
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:56,290
Nepeta.

808
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,860
So this is Madam Lan's real medical case.

809
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,080
Hide a tree in a forest,

810
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,430
hide water in the sea.

811
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,340
It's indeed a smart trick.

812
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:15,450
Young Master Yuanzhi.

813
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,640
How dare a mere Green Jade Guardian

814
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,550
hurt the lord of the Zhi Lineage?

815
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,640
How dare you!

816
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,070
You broke into the Yu Lineage

817
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,470
and committed thievery.

818
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,190
As a guard of the Yu Lineage,

819
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,960
I have the right to arrest you.

820
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,900
You?

821
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,590
Guardian Jin,

822
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,640
are you alright?

823
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,080
I'm fine.

824
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,330
Miss Yun, please go back to your room.

825
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:39,590
It's not safe outside.

826
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,140
I knew

827
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,350
you would come back.

828
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,340
Young Master Xue, thank you for your leniency

829
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,700
and giving me another chance.

830
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,200
Agreeing to let you continue the trial

831
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,150
was the decision of the Council of Elders.

832
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:02,540
It's not us being lenient.

833
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,600
Cut the small talk.

834
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,530
Sword Wielder, you have already wasted many days.

835
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,390
You must hurry.

836
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,770
Actually,

837
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,300
you are the true Young Master Xue,

838
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:25,480
right?

839
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,120
Father,

840
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:43,210
it's too cold.

841
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,820
I can't stand it anymore.

842
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,050
Didn't I teach you?

843
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,650
If you don't want to be frozen, use the chant.

844
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:49,430
But...

845
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,960
But it's so cold.

846
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,500
I can't remember.

847
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,010
You're so weak.

848
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:56,030
You don't deserve to be my son.

849
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,480
Gong Ziyu,

850
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,340
come back!

851
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,680
Where are you going?

852
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:09,750
Mother!

853
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,500
Help me!

854
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,950
Cold air enters the clouds.

855
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:33,130
[Cold air enters the clouds. The reception and delivery must be controlled. Gather in the core. Snow falls, but the heart does not.]

856
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,320
The reception and delivery must be controlled.

857
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,690
Gather in the core.

858
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,370
Snow falls, but the heart does not.

859
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,300
Don't cry. Save your strength,

860
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,090
or else it'll be colder.

861
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,530
He knows the Snowmelt Heart Sutra.

862
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:42,930
It seems that he's a child of the Yu Lineage.

863
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,140
Do you

864
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,820
always stay here?

865
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:01,730
Yes.

866
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:05,250
Does it snow here all the time?

867
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,150
Aren't you afraid of the cold?

868
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,390
You know the Snowmelt Heart Sutra, but you're still afraid of the cold?

869
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:15,720
Did you know that the valley outside the Gong residence has a flower market,

870
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,120
a street market,

871
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:18,470
and a lantern market?

872
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:19,730
What are these?

873
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,610
It sounds interesting.

874
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,180
It's nothing.

875
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:25,070
My mother told me before

876
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:26,350
that if you leave the valley,

877
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:27,710
there are seas,

878
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:30,050
volcanos, and deserts.

879
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,270
There are lots of things that I've never seen before.

880
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:47,230
My father is the Sword Wielder.

881
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,580
My brother is the Young Lord.

882
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,910
They're all super cool.

883
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,310
When I grow up, I'll take all you to the sea,

884
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,330
see lanterns,

885
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,260
and the big camels in the desert.

886
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,280
The Gong family experienced

887
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,820
so much turmoil in the martial arts world.

888
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,040
Now, we live in isolation,

889
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,650
one generation after another.

890
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,140
What are we protecting

891
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,900
and what are we persisting for?

892
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,540
You'll understand when you grow up.

893
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,600
How could a mere Green Jade Guardian

894
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,990
be so powerful?

895
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,460
I'll investigate Jin Fan later.

896
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:48,820
Brother.

897
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:52,040
I only got half of the medical case.

898
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,670
How can we accuse Gong Ziyu?

899
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,890
You said

900
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,460
you have something important for me.

901
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:25,350
I have an idea

902
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,390
about what it is.

903
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,970
I'm so nervous.

904
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,820
But you didn't have to lock the door from the inside.

905
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,030
I have to go out later.

906
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:37,320
Tonight, you and I

907
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,690
will be locked together.

908
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:41,350
I'm going to call for help if you keep doing this.

909
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:48,730
This paper looks quite old.

910
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,610
I know why you came to me.

911
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:57,200
Physicians all have messy handwriting,

912
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:00,830
but you know that I'm cultured

913
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,260
and modest.

914
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,900
I know so, so many...

915
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,710
Young Master Shangjue,

916
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,120
you're hurting me.

917
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,950
How long have you been eavesdropping?

918
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:18,670
What is this?

919
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:20,480
Medicinal oil.

920
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,060
You were indeed eavesdropping.

921
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,210
Just now, I saw Young Master Yuanzhi come back

922
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,310
with injuries,

923
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,910
so I wanted to bring a bottle of medicinal oil over.

924
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:32,220
I didn't intend to accidentally hear...

925
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:37,010
Accidentally?

926
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,120
Young Master Shangjue,

927
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,890
I have a way to get it back.

928
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,080
Exactly how much did you hear?

929
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,450
Synchronizing the spleen and liver focuses on soothing the liver,

930
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,820
both in aura and blood.

931
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,530
Emphasize the regulation of aura in the last trimester of pregnancy.

932
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:12,410
It is best to eat less and eat light foods for nourishment.

933
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,110
Whose medical case is this?

934
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:15,590
Gusu.

935
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,490
Gusu?

936
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,400
Why are the words on the back torn?

937
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,410
Who would Gong Yuanzhi

938
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:23,870
care so much about?

939
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:25,800
Me.

940
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,830
It's the Sword Wielder.

941
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,490
I have a bold guess.

942
00:53:36,890 --> 00:53:40,340
Is this the medical case of Gong Ziyu's mother?

943
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:43,070
I also suspected that.

944
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:46,430
His mother was indeed from the Yang family of Gusu.

945
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,200
Madam Lan had a premature birth due to illness.

946
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,410
Everyone in the Gong residence knows about this.

947
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:52,710
But look, it says here

948
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:54,810
that it was a full-term birth.

949
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:56,720
This medical case must be full of nonsense.

950
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,850
Where did you get it?

951
00:53:59,010 --> 00:53:59,920
Gong Yuanzhi

952
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:02,310
stole it from Lady Wuji's room.

953
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,700
Before Lord Sword Wielder entered the back hill for the trial,

954
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,060
he found that Gong Shangjue and Gong Yuanzhi

955
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,300
secretly contacted Lady Wuji several times.

956
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:13,100
He asked me to keep an eye on them.

957
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,340
Usually, they never interact

958
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,140
with people from the Yu Lineage.

959
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,060
There must be something wrong.

960
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,230
They must want to

961
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,210
cause a commotion about the Sword Wielder's birth.

962
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,340
That's despicable.

963
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,760
We must find the other half of the medical case.

964
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:27,670
We must be fast.

965
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,630
Can anyone help?

966
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:45,530
Lady Wuji.

967
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,180
Miss Yun Weishan,

968
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:05,050
what can I do for you?

969
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:07,230
I wanted to ask

970
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,710
if you lost anything.

971
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,110
How did you know that I lost something?

972
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,020
Did you steal it?

973
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:27,930
Speak.

974
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:34,520
Anonymous.
