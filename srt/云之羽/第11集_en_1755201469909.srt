[Episode 11]

4
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,940
Carry your fate, starting with New Snow.

5
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,570
Fine, coarse, then suddenly complex.

6
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,140
Move swiftly

7
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,610
and unexpectedly.

8
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,900
Attack them by surprise

9
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,080
and take the lead.

10
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,060
The first form.

11
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,230
[First form: New Snow]

12
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,820
New Snow.

13
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,780
Wind, pressure, and deterrence.

14
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,310
The Air Frost restriction.

15
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,720
Wood is easy to break when frosted.

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,490
The second form.

17
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,090
[Second form: Air Frost]

18
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,030
Air Frost.

19
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,420
Gather your inner power

20
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,880
and control the opponent.

21
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Use the harsh cold

22
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,900
to slow down the opponent's movements

23
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,230
and form a restriction.

24
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,510
The last form.

25
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,680

Cold Wave.

27
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,780
Most importantly, the cold snow freezes the entire world.

28
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,240
A vast expanse of emptiness and loneliness.

29
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,010
It's so hard.

30
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:23,770
You're leaving.

31
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,300
Why did you specially come back half way

32
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,700
to get a block of

33
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,980
Thousand Year Ice?

34
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,520
To commemorate it.

35
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,030
I'm leaving.

36
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,440
Young Master Xue.

37
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,160
I've left the cakes you like

38
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,400
in your room.

39
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,829
It's all yours.

40
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,910
I'll definitely fulfill

41
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,510
my promise to you.

42
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,020
Wait for me.

43
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,550
Let me return the courtesy.

44
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,089
Since you gave us cakes,

45
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,250
I'll give you a book.

46
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,090
These are the annotations of the shortcomings

47
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,380
and reinforcements of the strengths of the Xue family's saber technique I did

48
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,160
when I created the Three Forms of Snow Saber.

49
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,020
This is the only copy in the world.

50
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,210
Please keep it well

51
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,480
and cherish it.

52
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,230
I'll get going.

53
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,480
I won't let you down.

54
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,600
See you again in the future.

55
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,410
When I grow up,

56
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,260
I'll take you to the sea,

57
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,620
to watch the festive lanterns,

58
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,280
and to watch the lonely smoke in the vast desert!

59
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,200
Since his potential took a long time to be unleashed,

60
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,000
he'll surely soar to greatness.

61
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,840
I hope he'll live up to the title of the Sword Wielder.

62
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,840
He's so stubborn.

63
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,490
He will definitely live up to it.

64
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,330
I hope that when we meet again,

65
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,830
he would have already mastered the Three Forms of Snow Saber.

66
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,630
By that time,

67
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,550
more snow lotuses in the yard would have bloomed.

68
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,350
I'll pick some

69
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,490
to make and drink tea with him.

70
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,620
What do you think?

71
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,280
Didn't I return much earlier than you expected?

72
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,380
Why are you two alone?

73
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,570
Where is Yun?

74
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,480
Jin Fan.

75
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,760
Lord Sword Wielder.

76
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,840
I know you trust Lady Wuji

77
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,480
and Yun Weishan.

78
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,250
But about this matter,

79
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,420
you can only ask them personally.

80
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,110
Lord Sword Wielder.

81
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,590
Lady Wuji wants me to congratulate you

82
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,650
on the completion of the first trial.

83
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,900
Lord Sword Wielder.

84
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,560
Lady Wuji is not feeling well.

85
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,140
She ordered that she won't see any guests today.

86
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,810
Am I a guest?

87
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,300
Lady Wuji specifically instructed

88
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,300
that she wouldn't

89
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,360
see anyone.

90
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,560
Then, Lady Wuji,

91
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,200
please take care of yourself.

92
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,930
For important matters, follow your heart.

93
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,690
No matter what choice you make,

94
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,090
I have no complaints.

95
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,380
I wish you a speedy recovery.

96
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,460
Young Master Ziyu.

97
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,360
Yes.

98
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,880
Congratulations.

99
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,820
Young Master Xue and Xue Chongzi

100
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,909
asked me to stay

101
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,679
to teach me the Three Forms of Snow Saber.

102
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,650
But I didn’t manage to master it.

103
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,650
You are smart.

104
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,850
You should be able to master it soon.

105
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,030
Don't worry.

106
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,880
What I said just now...

107
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,110
On my way back from the back hill,

108
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,680
I kept repeating them in my head.

109
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,360
There were many things

110
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,010
that I wanted to tell you first thing after I came back.

111
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,430
But you didn't wait for me at the door.

112
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,410
I want to go in.

113
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,560
I want to see you

114
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,430
and tell you face to face

115
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,540
about everything

116
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,270
that happened in the back hill.

117
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,800
But

118
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,350
I can't open this door now.

119
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,920
Is there a lock on the door?

120
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,310
No.

121
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,600
But I have one in my heart.

122
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,270
You have the key.

123
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,340
Are you willing to unlock it?

124
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,000
I've been thinking about

125
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,390
what Jin Fan just told me,

126
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,730
and why you and Lady Wuji are doing this.

127
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:42,750
I guess

128
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,500
Gong Shangjue must have agreed to

129
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,000
send her out of the Gong residence

130
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,400
and set her free.

131
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,130
Mother is dead.

132
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,640
Father is dead too.

133
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,350
There's nothing for Lady Wuji to miss

134
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,480
in the Gong residence indeed.

135
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,550
What about you, Yun?

136
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,440
Did Gong Shangjue promise you anything too?

137
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,000
Can you tell me what Gong Shangjue

138
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,060
promised you?

139
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,440
Can I help you with it instead?

140
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,540
Aren't you just like Lady Wuji?

141
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,840
You also want freedom.

142
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,460
If you want,

143
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,340
I can set you free.

144
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,170
The word "freedom" is too extravagant

145
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,610
for me.

146
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,380
Young Master Ziyu.

147
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,860
In your heart,

148
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,180
have you already decided

149
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,980
that I've betrayed you?

150
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
If I ask you to

151
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,220
trust me one more time,

152
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,220
will you trust me?

153
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,090
Will you trust me?

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,930
♫Cutting off fate♫

191
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,970
♫Our story has tenderness♫

192
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:56,120
♫It has regrets♫

193
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,100
♫But it has no ending♫

194
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:06,890
♫A cloud and a feather together in my palm♫

195
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,930
We have the medical record

196
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,190
and Wuji will testify.

197
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,380
It's time for the position of the Sword Wielder

198
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,840
be returned to my brother.

199
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,850
Cold and lonely dusk in the village.

200
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,920
The cold wind is raging

201
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,960
and the fields are howling.

202
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,460
Deep streams cannot bear snow.

203
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,570
The mountain's frozen such that the clouds aren't flowing.

204
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,740
The winter in the canyon

205
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,910
is coming soon.

206
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,860
Put on an extra winter coat.

207
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,400
Don't get sick.

208
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,520
No need.

209
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,500
I'm not the one

210
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,830
who's afraid of the cold.

211
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,320
Jin Fan.

212
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,830
Lord Sword Wielder.

213
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,540
Young Master Xue already told me

214
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,150
that you were once a Red Jade Guardian.

215
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,310
It's all in the past.

216
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,010
Have you ever regretted

217
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,730
giving up

218
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,970
your noble status of Red Jade Guardian?

219
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,690
No.

220
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,940
I've been an orphan since I was young.

221
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,800
I was homeless.

222
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,960
The Gong family gave me a place to stay.

223
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,380
No matter if I'm a Red Jade Guardian

224
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,940
or a Green Red Jade Guardian,

225
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,540
I'm loyal to the Gong family.

226
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,950
The former Sword Wielder made me swear

227
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,839
that I will do my best to protect you.

228
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,410
I'll go through fire and water for you

229
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,470
until I die.

230
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,460
At first,

231
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,120
I still resented my father.

232
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,520
It's good to clear up the misunderstanding.

233
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,050
The former Sword Wielder always had high hopes for you.

234
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,560
Don't let him down.

235
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,150
Get through the Trial of the Three Realms well.

236
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,800
The Gong family needs you.

237
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,320
I will.

238
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,300
Young Miss!

239
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:30,450
Young Miss!

240
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,090
Wuji.

241
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,990
Why are you here?

242
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,400
The Sword Wielder said

243
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,660
that you missed me,

244
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,190
so he asked someone to take me here.

245
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,950
You're so foolish.

246
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,630
You can't get out

247
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,490
once you come in here.

248
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,790
Remember what I told you?

249
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,340
When you see your mother later, you must shout out loudly.

250
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,380
Mother!

251
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,880
This is how your mother disguised as a male

252
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,530
when she was young.

253
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,200
Let your mother see if you look like her then.

254
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,660
Mother.

255
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,900
Look.

256
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,980
Change back into your usual clothes.

257
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,890
If others see us,

258
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,900
I don't know what gossip they'll come up with again.

259
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,360
The Sword Wielder won't believe the gossip.

260
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,660
Even if he doesn't,

261
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,520
there'll be people who'll believe it.

262
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,520
When many people believe something,

263
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,580
it'll become real.

264
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,210
Reporting to Lady Wuji.

265
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,300
The Council of Elders has ordered

266
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,960
for you to head to the Meeting Hall immediately.

267
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,080
Got it.

268
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,820
Yes.

269
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,260
You said there was no witness just now.

270
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,340
Now, the witness is here.

271
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,270
Lady Wuji, please sit down.

272
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:47,460
Now,

273
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,050
we can properly discuss

274
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,500
whether Gong Ziyu is qualified

275
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,030
to be the Sword Wielder.

276
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,050
Young Master Shangjue.

277
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,790
This is an important matter.

278
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,740
You must not speak recklessly.

279
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,930
Elders.

280
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,940
In the Gong residence,

281
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,330
the rumors about Gong Ziyu's background

282
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,950
have never ceased.

283
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,750
It's clearly noted in the medical record.

284
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,440
The evidence is solid.

285
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,450
At the same time, we also have Lady Wuji as the witness.

286
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,400
Can this

287
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,170
still be considered speaking recklessly

288
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,400
as you said?

289
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,490
Elder Xue, even if you think I'm speaking recklessly,

290
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,010
Lady Wuji

291
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,760
was a maid who served Lady Lan during her pregnancy.

292
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,780
They knew each other since they were young.

293
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,110
They were like sisters.

294
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,470
Let's hear

295
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,900
what Lady Wuji has to say.

296
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:04,100
Elders.

297
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,860
Although I have been

298
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,120
in the Gong residence for over 20 years,

299
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,630
as a woman,

300
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,260
I don't know if what I say at the Meeting Hall

301
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,480
counts.

302
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,460
Just tell us the truth.

303
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,680
We'll make our own judgments.

304
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,030
I, Wuji,

305
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,170
swear to God,

306
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,450
that Gong Ziyu

307
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,220
is indeed Gong Hongyu and Lady Lan's biological son.

308
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:44,590
You...

309
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,350
Since Lady Lan got pregnant,

310
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,140
I'd been taking care of her closely.

311
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:54,070
Lady Lan was not in good health

312
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,400
and had dizzy spells.

313
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,050
She was taking medicine regularly.

314
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:57,650
That's why

315
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,150
she had a premature birth.

316
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,320
All these are noted in the medical record

317
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,310
in the clinic.

318
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,690
Young Master Shangjue, is this the witness

319
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,100
you're referring to?

320
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,420
A few days ago,

321
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,550
Young Master Shangjue came to me

322
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,840
and asked me about the details of Lady Lan's pregnancy.

323
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,140
Then, I vaguely guessed

324
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,340
what he was thinking.

325
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,100
But at that time,

326
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,700
Ziyu was in the back hill

327
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,300
and devoted to passing the trial.

328
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,500
As a weak woman alone,

329
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,210
I had no choice

330
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,220
but to pretend to be his accomplice.

331
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,080
But I thought

332
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,180
that when I had to testify in front of the elders,

333
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,910
I couldn't give a false account of the true facts.

334
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,870
Elders.

335
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,230
I can understand

336
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,160
that Lady Wuji

337
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,890
can't bear to expose Gong Ziyu

338
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,700
because of the kinship between mother and son.

339
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,180
People can change their words,

340
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,570
but written words can't be faked.

341
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,400
This medical record

342
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,080
clearly states

343
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,770
that Gong Ziyu wasn't born prematurely

344
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,080
but after a full-term pregnancy.

345
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,100
When compared to the time Lady Lan first entered the Gong residence,

346
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,230
it's enough to prove

347
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,370
that Lady Lan was pregnant

348
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,200
before she married into the Gong family.

349
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,950
Brother Yuanzhi

350
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,620
obtained this medical record

351
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,830
from Lady Wuji's room.

352
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,820
She's been hiding this medical record for many years

353
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,280
and perpetrated the fraud

354
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,640
by replacing it with a fake one.

355
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,190
Can I have a look

356
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,410
at this medical record?

357
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:51,900
Of course.

358
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:53,610
Lady Wuji.

359
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:56,650
Have you never seen this medical record before?

360
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,450
This is not Lady Lan's medical record.

361
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,910
I've never seen it before.

362
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,860
Nonsense.

363
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,340
It was obtained from your room.

364
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,060
How could you have never seen it before?

365
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,390
And you personally said

366
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,090
that this is Lady Lan's medical record

367
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,570
that the former Sword Wielder switched out with a fake one.

368
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,890
Why do you say that?

369
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,930
There is only one medical record of Lady Lan.

370
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,660
It's always been in the clinic.

371
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,440
Enough with the argument.

372
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,070
Each only insists on their perspective.

373
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,670
There will be no conclusion.

374
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,440
What's written down

375
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,970
cannot be a lie.

376
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:37,860
In this medical record,

377
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,000
both the handwriting and the seal

378
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,380
correspond to the ink and signature of the doctor

379
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,100
who treated Lady Lan,

380
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,060
Mr. Jingjie.

381
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,370
It is Mr. Jingjie's handwriting.

382
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,590
It’s his favorite Huizhou ink.

383
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,440
The seal is also real.

384
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,190
Unfortunately,

385
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,780
Mr. Jingjie has already passed away from illness.

386
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,310
We can't get him to prove it.

387
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,180
There were many wives at the Gong residence then.

388
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,110
Lady Lan

389
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,530
wasn't the only one treated by Mr. Jingjie.

390
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,840
How can you prove

391
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,620
that this is Lady Lan's medical record?

392
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,300
On this medical record, it says

393
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,860
that the pregnant woman is from Gusu.

394
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,390
How could it not be Lady Lan?

395
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,220
Elder.

396
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,500
You can send someone

397
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,500
to the clinic to check the medical records of the wives

398
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,360
to see if there's any one missing,

399
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,850
as it was taken by Young Master Shangjue to frame Lady Lan.

400
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:30,810
Investigate!

401
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,350
The Sword Wielder opened the door for you last night.

402
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,250
Why didn't you leave?

403
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,010
Did Lord Sword Wielder send you here?

404
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,530
He asked me to send you off.

405
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,980
Reporting to Elder.

406
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,030
Lady Ling's medical record

407
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,560
is missing from the clinic.

408
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,100
You're in the third trimester of your pregnancy.

409
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,740
You shouldn't eat too much,

410
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,100
and you should eat predominantly bland foods.

411
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,750
Lady Ling, you actually have the same surname as me

412
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,800
and you're also from Jiangnan.

413
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,030
We sure are fated.

414
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,440
Mr. Jingjie.

415
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,740
You wouldn't confuse our medical records, right?

416
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,860
I am old,

417
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,480
but I'm not muddleheaded yet.

418
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,200
I've already made a distinction between the two records.

419
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,130
Look at the lower left corner of your medical record.

420
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,990
Flowers float away with the water.

421
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,410
Mr. Jingjie, you're really witty.

422
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,560
Mother.

423
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,070
Hey.

424
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,150
Young Master Shangjue.

425
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,250
Are you here to pick up your mother and brother again?

426
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,190
We don't even know if it's a boy or a girl yet.

427
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,250
If Mr. Jingjie says it's a brother, then it's a brother.

428
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,220
Okay, I'll give birth to a brother for you.

429
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,280
Come on, Shangjue.

430
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,360
Greet Lady Lan.

431
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:30,650
[Gusu]

432
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,740
Your mother, Lady Ling,

433
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,800
and Lady Lan are both surnamed Yang

434
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,890
from Gusu.

435
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,740
Back then,

436
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,570
they were also both treated by Mr. Jingjie.

437
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,030
So the handwriting and ink on the medical records are the same.

438
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,690
It's understandable that you're mistaken.

439
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,760
But if you use this medical record to forge evidence

440
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,490
and commit an act of injustice,

441
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,940
it'll really be a disgrace to your reputation, Young Master Shangjue.

442
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,550
Lady Wuji.

443
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,370
You're really good at scheming.

444
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,740
These rumors have been spreading

445
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,420
in the Gong residence for over 20 years.

446
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,380
Gong Ziyu has been wronged for more than 20 years.

447
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,610
I hereby ask the three elders to help

448
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,060
Ziyu clear his name.

449
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,160
I hope that from now on,

450
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,820
there wouldn't be another person with ulterior motives

451
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,950
who'd cause trouble with this matter.

452
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:06,500
Once you walk out of this door,

453
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,600
you'll be free.

454
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:15,840
Yun.

455
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,220
Let me go.

456
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:49,760
No.

457
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,620
If I let go,

458
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,120
you'll leave.

459
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,440
I ordered you to leave before.

460
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,380
Now,

461
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,810
I take back my order.

462
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,540
Don't go.

463
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,850
I'm telling you to let go

464
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,719
because there is still someone else here.

465
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,750
Jin Fan doesn't count.

466
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:19,540
I...

467
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,449
don't count?

468
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,150
Let's go.

469
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,190
I'll take you back to the Yu residence.

470
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,139
Why are you laughing?

471
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:34,300
You said

472
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,880
the exact same sentence to me before.

473
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,530
It was the time when I went to pick you up

474
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,190
at the Ladies' Hostel, right?

475
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:47,500
There won't be a third time.

476
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,389
No matter what happens in the future,

477
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,630
I'll never let you go.

478
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:03,680
Leave.

479
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,690
Leave!

480
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,320
I'll take my leave.

481
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,690
I'm sorry, Miss Yun.

482
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,880
I didn't know

483
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
you were cooperating with Lady Wuji

484
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,360
to help Gong Ziyu.

485
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,100
I knew it.

486
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:54,380
No matter how I look at you,

487
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,980
you don't look like a traitor.

488
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,040
I'm sorry.

489
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,180
That's right.

490
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,260
Miss Yun did know about it beforehand.

491
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,100
If she didn't intentionally give that half of the medical record

492
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,140
to Gong Shangjue,

493
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,660
there wouldn't have been a chance like today

494
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,460
where it'd come back to bite him.

495
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,920
I misunderstood Miss Yun.

496
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,630
But,

497
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,340
why didn't you tell me directly?

498
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,150
I asked her to keep it from you.

499
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,560
You are not calm enough.

500
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,040
You wear your heart on your sleeve.

501
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,700
Gong Shangjue is a cunning strategist.

502
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,640
With your short temper,

503
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,700
he'd see through you at a glance.

504
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,930
Lady Wuji, thank you

505
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,380
for protecting me this time.

506
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,220
I'm beyond grateful.

507
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,560
Of course I'd try my best to protect you.

508
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,270
Otherwise, how can I face your father?

509
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:53,740
Lady Wuji.

510
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,200
Actually, I've been

511
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,380
hiding a question in my heart for years.

512
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,860
Is it about your mother?

513
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,250
Yes.

514
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,280
My mother had always been cold to me

515
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,480
since I was young.

516
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,950
I always think she...

517
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,860
In this world,

518
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:17,350
there's no mother

519
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,130
who doesn't love her own child.

520
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,230
It was just that Lady Lan

521
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,510
was too obsessed...

522
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,890
Miss Yun is not an outsider.

523
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,470
Please go ahead.

524
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,920
This exquisite Longjing tea

525
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,240
reminds me of the scenery in Jiangnan.

526
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,220
[Memory]

527
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,820
The former Sword Wielder first met your mother,

528
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,010
that is Lady Lan,

529
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,240
in Jiangnan.

530
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,010
I can spare your life.

531
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,980
But you must forget what happened today

532
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,710
and forget

533
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,840
that you met me.

534
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,640
He always insisted that your mother forget him.

535
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:55,820
But it turned out

536
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,240
that he fell in love with your mother at first sight.

537
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,010
But at that time, your mother

538
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,040
already had someone in her heart.

539
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,580
Despite his humble background,

540
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,910
they loved each other

541
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,200
and took a solemn pledge of love long ago.

542
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,540
Unfortunately,

543
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,610
fate toys with people.

544
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,530
Lady Lan's family

545
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,280
despised him for being a poor scholar.

546
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,440
And the head of the family

547
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,230
had always wanted to latch onto the Gong family.

548
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,130
Lord Sword Wielder.

549
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,790
The auspicious hour has come.

550
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:35,870
Got it.

551
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:41,660
That's why

552
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,220
Lady Lan

553
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,850
was arranged to enter the Gong residence by her parents.

554
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,140
During your father's bride selection,

555
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,540
he saw the beloved woman

556
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,670
whom he thought he'd never meet again.

557
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,800
He thought

558
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,990
it was a godsent fate,

559
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,810
that it was God

560
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,920
who sent the person he loves to him.

561
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,300
After Lady Lan entered the Gong residence,

562
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,910
she was always depressed.

563
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,450
At first, your father thought it was because

564
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:25,650
she left her hometown

565
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,230
and was lonely

566
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,890
in an unfamiliar environment.

567
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:31,950
In order to please her,

568
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,310
he sent someone

569
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,720
to bring me, her lifelong companion,

570
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,500
into the Gong residence

571
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,150
as her personal maid.

572
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,110
Your father thought

573
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,780
she would be happier

574
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:51,120
with someone she's close with by her side.

575
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,140
But even though your father

576
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,940
tried his best to treat her well,

577
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,390
because the love wasn't deep,

578
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,620
Lady Lan remained indifferent.

579
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,800
Lady Lan.

580
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:03,920
The Sword Wielder planted orchids, your favorite flower,

581
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,670
in the yard.

582
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,380
Do you want to take a look?

583
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,430
Your father

584
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,410
was never good at expressing his affections.

585
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,670
After hitting the wall several times,

586
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,050
he instead became afraid to take the initiative to show his love.

587
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:37,800
As a result,

588
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,470
your mother also thought

589
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,180
he just chose her

590
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:43,890
in a spur of the moment.

591
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,140
After carrying on the family line,

592
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,600
there was no concern left.

593
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,250
They became

594
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:55,850
more and more estranged.

595
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,660
Not long after,

596
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,360
you were born.

597
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:07,970
Although she had you,

598
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,950
Lady Lan's hatred and regret in her heart

599
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:12,570
didn't subside.

600
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,770
Seeing that her only child

601
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,980
is also a descendant of the Gong family,

602
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,830
her heart became increasingly more entangled,

603
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:23,880
tortured,

604
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,860
and fragmented.

605
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,400
Father.

606
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,500
Can you teach me how to write my name?

607
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:31,270
Sure.

608
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,980
Gong...

609
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,190
Zi...

610
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,420
Yu.

611
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,200
Got it?

612
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:42,940
Yes.

613
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,410
Come on, write it for me.

614
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,120
Father said

615
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,500
that we are brothers.

616
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:49,360
Brothers should give each other

617
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,680
the best things.

618
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:53,690
I don't want to be friends with the little bastard.

619
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,230
Tears represent weakness.

620
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,740
Weak people

621
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,320
will be bullied.

622
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,160
In the future, when you want to cry,

623
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,870
wear this mask.

624
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:55,010
Then no one will see it.

625
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,030
Okay.

626
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:04,600
Wuji.

627
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,500
Yes?

628
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:09,990
Do you still remember

629
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,030
the time when we were at our hometown in Jiangnan?

630
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:21,910
Yes.

631
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,780
The spring water was bluer than the sky.

632
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:40,700
Falling asleep in painted boats to the sound of the rain.

633
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,590
Unfortunately,

634
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,640
I can no longer see the silhouette of him

635
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:02,130
holding an umbrella

636
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:07,370
and waiting for me to arrive at our dates.

637
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,780
Why are you still thinking about him?

638
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,820
I won't think about him anymore.

639
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,010
I won't think about him anymore.

640
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,160
In the end, Lady Lan

641
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,240
remained depressed until her death.

642
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,400
I didn't expect Lady Lan's story to be so tumultous.

643
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:54,260
It's even more heartbreaking

644
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,190
than the novel I read a few days ago.

645
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:58,750
Lady Wuji.

646
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,400
Actually, in my heart,

647
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,980
I never knew

648
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,810
what exactly my mother thought of me.

649
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:14,470
There was love

650
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:16,560
and unwillingness.

651
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,760
Even more so, it was a struggle

652
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,180
and self-contradictory for her.

653
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,350
Lady Lan used to have a pure and refined heart,

654
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:30,240
but she was too obsessed

655
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:34,420
and trapped herself until the end.

656
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,130
After Lady Lan passed away,

657
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,180
your father married me as a second wife.

658
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:44,550
I know

659
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,840
that he married me

660
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,590
because he was worried that

661
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,180
you'd be afraid from losing your mother at a young age.

662
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,710
After all, I was always by your mother's side.

663
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:57,990
If I took care of you,

664
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,190
you wouldn't be lonely.

665
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,080
But

666
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,610
why was Father so cold to me?

667
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,120
You

668
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,440
are young and inexperienced.

669
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,100
You don't understand your father's good intentions.

670
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,320
After Lady Lan passed away,

671
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,190
you cried all day

672
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:23,490
and was cowardly

673
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:24,180
and weak.

674
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,460
Your father realized

675
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:28,580
that he shouldn't just

676
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,970
spoil and indulge you.

677
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,820
He wanted you to learn to be independent and strong

678
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,300
so that you would become a responsible successor in the future.

679
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:37,990
That's why

680
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,740
he started to be strict with you.

681
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:41,980
Ziyu.

682
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,960
The former Sword Wielder,

683
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,180
your father, still loved you.

684
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,680
Now you understand.

685
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,090
So don't moan and sigh

686
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,530
and pull a long face all the time from now on.

687
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:55,380
Your father

688
00:49:56,970 --> 00:49:58,060
trusted me.

689
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,620
Although you are not my biological son,

690
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,070
I've always regarded you as my own child.

691
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:08,430
Yes.

692
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,950
I remember everything.

693
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,520
As a kid, whenever I fell down,

694
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,250
fell sick,

695
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,270
or was being willful,

696
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:27,070
you were always the one who consoled and accompanied me patiently.

697
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:30,320
I sincerely

698
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:31,470
thank you very much

699
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,840
and I've long regarded you

700
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,020
as my real family.

701
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:42,920
If you really want to thank me,

702
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:46,250
you have to be a dignified

703
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,520
Sword Wielder

704
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,730
and lead the Gong family with your capabilities.

705
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,250
Don't let your father down.

706
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:00,570
Also, don't let the women who enter the Gong residence

707
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,940
suffer the pain that your mother had been through.

708
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:07,010
I also believe that you have the ability to do that.

709
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:19,280
This box contains

710
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:22,170
some of the former Sword Wielder's old belongings.

711
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,610
I didn't give them to you previously

712
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,720
because I didn't want you to miss him from seeing his belongings

713
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,030
and be heartbroken.

714
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:29,850
Now,

715
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,420
it's time to give them to you.

716
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,890
I was actually tricked by that old woman.

717
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,130
I can't let her go just like that.

718
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,610
I must make her sorry for it.

719
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,260
This time,

720
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,200
we're lucky enough

721
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,910
that we weren't in big trouble.

722
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,840
Are we supposed to just let it go?

723
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,610
At this point,

724
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:15,280
what else can we do?

725
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,310
We lost.

726
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,700
Admit it.

727
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:23,780
Unless you're absolutely confident,

728
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,060
don't act recklessly.

729
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,030
Even more so, don't trust others easily.

730
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,300
I can't stomach this insult.

731
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,100
Even if it were a poisoned knife,

732
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:35,590
you'd have to swallow it!

733
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:44,070
Brother.

734
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,420
What's wrong?

735
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:50,770
You may leave now.

736
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,860
Please leave me alone.

737
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:00,520
Did

738
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,690
that medical record

739
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,320
remind you of Lady Ling

740
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:10,660
and Lang?

741
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:11,860
You may leave now!

742
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:34,950
If I were you,

743
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,470
I wouldn't go in now.

744
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,630
Young Master Shangjue didn't look well

745
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,200
when he came back from the Council of Elders Hall.

746
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,530
So I came to check on him.

747
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,000
My brother wants to be alone now.

748
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:51,550
I'll go in and keep him company.

749
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,510
Maybe if he can talk to someone,

750
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:54,710
he'll feel better.

751
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,750
My brother doesn't even want to see me.

752
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,510
Who do you think you are?

753
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:03,000
Then tell me

754
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,140
what happened.

755
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,460
There's something wrong with the medical record that Yun Weishan gave you.

756
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,790
You were tricked by her.

757
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:13,640
This time,

758
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:16,280
you've ruined my brother's life.
