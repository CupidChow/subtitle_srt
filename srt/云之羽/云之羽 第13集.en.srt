[Episode 13]

4
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,730
A lot of couples are here to admire the lanterns

5
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,900
in pairs.

6
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,650
Exactly.

7
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,070
Your Young Master Yu's eyes

8
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,790
have been stuck on you

9
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,300
like gum.

10
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,710
It's such a beautiful scene.

11
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,150
I should let you two

12
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:29,590
spend some time alone.

13
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,560
Jin Fan.

14
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,520
It's not safe to be alone.

15
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,920
Go look for Gong Zishang.

16
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,660
How about you?

17
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,410
It's okay.

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,160
I won't go far.

19
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,150
Besides, Miss Yun is still here.

20
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,570
After you find Gong Zishang,

21
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,770
go to Housekeeper Jia's house to check.

22
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,400
Let's go.

23
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,380
I went to the pharmacy to get some medicine today.

24
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,340
I made some porridge with the prescription from my hometown.

25
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,740
I don't know why

26
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,440
my chest has been feeling warm lately.

27
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,140
There's miasma in the valley.

28
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,690
It's cold and humid.

29
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,250
You always burn charcoal.

30
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,829
It would cause your chi and blood to be boiling.

31
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,270
So I added some red dates,

32
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,700
glutinous rice,

33
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,500
and dried longan specially.

34
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,910
I thought

35
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,030
it will also present the good omens of a Laba congee.

36
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Young Master Jue,

37
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,140
would you like to try some?

38
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,880
I've been simmering it for the whole afternoon.

39
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,640
Your hands are very steady.

40
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,590
My family practiced medicine for generations.

41
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,650
When I was young, my father trained me

42
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,840
to weigh medicine.

43
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,750
He said my hands must be steady.

44
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,680
I can't tremble.

45
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,290
A milligram difference in

46
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,450
the weight of herbs

47
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,980
could cost someone's life.

48
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,950
Young Master!

49
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,160
This position...

50
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,560
It is the life meridians.

51
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,500
It's so deep.

52
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,330
Can we take it out?

53
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,140
Take it.

54
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,390
Take it out!

55
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,200
Go get the white frost powder to stop the bleeding!

56
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,600
Hurry!

57
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,800
Bring the blood clotting powder!

58
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,040
Get me a wild ginseng.

59
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:41,990
Quick!

60
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,750
Young Master.

61
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,030
Young Master!

62
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:36,950
Brother...

63
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,760
The porridge is poisonous...

64
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,760
Be careful...

65
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,190
The porridge...

66
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:46,890

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:36,890
Mm.

175
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,160
Let's go.

176
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,770
Where are the lanterns?

177
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,910
Calm down, Young Master.

178
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,630
It might have been

179
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,320
a servant who didn't know better that kept them.

180
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,120
Go look for it.

181
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:11,740
Yes.

182
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:18,740
Brother.

183
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:19,810
Look.

184
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,560
I've fixed all the spoiled parts.

185
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,270
Who allowed you to act on your own?

186
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:28,770
I...

187
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,380
I thought the lantern looked a little old.

188
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:33,870
So I...

189
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,110
Do you think a new one will always be better than an old one?

190
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,900
You leave first.

191
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,720
Young Master Yuanzhi.

192
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,450
The sun is up.

193
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,900
Go back and rest.

194
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,960
The stain on the tail of the dragon lantern

195
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,600
was caused by the ink from the first time

196
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,300
Lang learnt to write poems.

197
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,480
The broken dragon whiskers

198
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,450
were broken by Lang's tight grip

199
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,860
when he was having a nightmare.

200
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,370
To Young Master Jue,

201
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,490
these are all traces left by Lang.

202
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,210
They're the only memoirs left.

203
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,320
I know now.

204
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,920
I won't repair the old one anymore.

205
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,570
Keep it.

206
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,330
I'll...

207
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,560
make a new one for Brother.

208
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,740
New clothes are better.

209
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,250
But not people.

210
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,850
Young Master Yuanzhi,

211
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,920
please try and understand.

212
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,290
But I...

213
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,310
But I'm not clothes.

214
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,190
What's wrong with your hand?

215
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,790
When I was making herbs,

216
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,750
I got cut by the dry hard herbs.

217
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,670
It's minor.

218
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,210
I’m fine.

219
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,050
Miss Shangguan.

220
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,700
I’m here to see Young Master Shangjue.

221
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,900
He went to the clinic.

222
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,070
I'll go to the clinic then–

223
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,000
He said he'd like

224
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,320
no one to disturb him tonight.

225
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,410
Young Master.

226
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,450
You've transferred so much internal skill to Young Master Yuanzhi.

227
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,400
Can you take it?

228
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,790
I'm fine.

229
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,140
You're looking for me?

230
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,740
The guards reported

231
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,290
that Gong Ziyu has left the Gong residence.

232
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,780
Flowery lights

233
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,460
and beautiful sceneries

234
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,110
are nothing to him.

235
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,170
But

236
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,630
he's with three other people this time.

237
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,349
Among them,

238
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,079
there's also the bride, Yun Weishan.

239
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,640
Send someone to keep an eye on her.

240
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,990
To keep an eye on Gong Ziyu?

241
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,589
To keep an eye on Yun Weishan.

242
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:23,220
If I'm right,

243
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,130
that invisible net will be reeled up soon.

244
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,170
I can't leave.

245
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,300
Go make arrangements quickly.

246
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,830
Brother.

247
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:33,990
Go.

248
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,610
I'm fine.

249
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,460
Go to the Yu Lineage now.

250
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,720
Wait for them to return,

251
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,790
and confront them right there.

252
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,820
Otherwise, they will deny it again.

253
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,080
Send someone to protect the clinic.

254
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,410
Without my permission,

255
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,930
no one can enter or leave.

256
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,070
Yes.

257
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,530
Brother.

258
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,750
That porridge...

259
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,580
That porridge was not poisonous.

260
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,380
I've checked.

261
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,220
Have a good rest.

262
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,180
If there's anything,

263
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,870
call for me with the whistling arrow.

264
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,600
Don't worry.

265
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,370
Brother.

266
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,300
Miss Yun.

267
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,980
This rabbit lantern is quite cute.

268
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,110
Miss Yun?

269
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,710
Do you like it?

270
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,680
If you like it, I will buy it for you.

271
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,110
Sorry, sir.

272
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,280
Our lantern

273
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,200
is a prize.

274
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,640
You can't just buy it.

275
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,950
If you like it,

276
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,280
you can solve the lantern riddles.

277
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,680
If you solve three riddles right,

278
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,810
you can take it away.

279
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,900
Solving lantern riddle?

280
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,390
Miss Yun.

281
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,360
Do you know how to solve lantern riddles?

282
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,000
It came from the valley

283
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,270
and moved to a tree.

284
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,500
When it's young, it wears green.

285
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,230
When it's old, it wears yellow.

286
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,720
I know this.

287
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,930
It's banana.

288
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,690
Second Young Miss.

289
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,060
Second Young Miss.

290
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,000
I know Eldest Young Miss is Gong Zishang.

291
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,410
But I have no clue about the Second Young Miss...

292
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,250
The second-in-line of the Gong Family

293
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,050
is a man who wears nothing but a cold face everyday.

294
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,950
Poise.

295
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,140
Posture, poise.

296
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,290
It's made up of the words that means "second daughter."

297
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,180
You're amazing.

298
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,110
Solve one then.

299
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,390
It's been a long drought with no rain,

300
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,650
only thunder is heard.

301
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,990
Guess a word.

302
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,010
Field.

303
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:23,350
There's only thunder but no rain. It has to be field.

304
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,380
You're so smart?

305
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,280
Why didn't you say anything just now?

306
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,830
You wanted to see me make a fool of myself?

307
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,620
They all say the Sword Wielder doesn't like studying.

308
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,750
I wanted to see if the rumors were true.

309
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,170
Please be careful with

310
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,150
how you talk to the Sword Wielder.

311
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,420
Understood, the Sword Wielder.

312
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,680
I know my mistake.

313
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,620
In the past,

314
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,770
I often solved riddles with my younger sister.

315
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,950
My younger sister would give the question,

316
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,010
and I'll answer it.

317
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,130
As time passed,

318
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,400
I understood the key to it.

319
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,860
You have a younger sister?

320
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,060
I've never heard you talk about her.

321
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,380
Godsister.

322
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,080
I've told you about her before.

323
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,140
The one who'd sing for you at night?

324
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,760
I only hope that the one I love

325
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,050
can understand the light in my hand.

326
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:44,790
Speechless.

327
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,260
Annoying!

328
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,360
So many lanterns.

329
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:55,760
What?

330
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,920
Stealing lanterns?

331
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,540
Buying lanterns.

332
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,700
I want the brightest lantern here

333
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,240
that'd stand out the most in the crowd.

334
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,170
Do you have any?

335
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,500
You must be on a date with someone you like.

336
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,470
Look at this delicate jade rabbit.

337
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,980
Many girls like it.

338
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,380
Delicate?

339
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,870
I don't like it.

340
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:15,930
Wait.

341
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,470
I have a tough one.

342
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,580
You must like it.

343
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,910
This colorful phoenix lantern

344
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,260
is bigger and brighter.

345
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,390
But

346
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,470
it's too heavy.

347
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,790
Ordinary girls...

348
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:34,340
can't lift it.

349
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,370
You are quite something.

350
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,230
Quite,

351
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,240
but not too much.

352
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,180
Is this lantern bright enough?

353
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,230
There are so many people here.

354
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,020
What if my lover can't see it?

355
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,910
What should I do then?

356
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,380
Is your lover old?

357
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,060
Does he have a bad eyesight?

358
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,900
Stop it.

359
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,170
I'll buy

360
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,750
this entire cart.

361
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,560
Miss,

362
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,830
you are more beautiful than a fairy.

363
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,520
Deal.

364
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,870
Deal.

365
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,990
But this cart is a bit heavy.

366
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,250
Isn't it too much for you to push it alone?

367
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,340
No.

368
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:14,270
I purposely lost him in the crowd

369
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,010
to get him to come find me.

370
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,150
If he could still find me among this crowd,

371
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:23,990
then we are fated to be.

372
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:25,220
Miss,

373
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,200
if you buy my entire lantern cart,

374
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,170
isn't that cheating?

375
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,230
In this way,

376
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,200
aren't you going to win easily?

377
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,320
As the saying goes,

378
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,490
with a calm mind can I win more easily.

379
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:37,790
Everything else is fine.

380
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,970
But what about fate?

381
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,320
As long as your hearts are connected, it will naturally be a long-lasting love.

382
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,180
You don't have to be too stubborn.

383
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,480
I insist on being stubborn.

384
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,490
All right.

385
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,680
Good luck to you.

386
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,920
Be it manmade, or natural fate,

387
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,570
I want all these fates.

388
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,800
Jin Fan!

389
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,700
Come quickly!

390
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,870
Jin Fan.

391
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,040
Come quickly.

392
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,660
Watch out for the fire.

393
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,860
Look, that man is holding a rabbit lantern.

394
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,230
Young Master, let me take the rabbit lamp.

395
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,650
No.

396
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,320
This is a gift from you.

397
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:52,070
You paid for the lantern riddle.

398
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,670
It can't be considered as a gift from me.

399
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,030
Some things can't be bought with money.

400
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:57,640
Sir,

401
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,550
Miss, do you want to make a braid?

402
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,750
Love braids can ensure fulfilling love

403
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,440
and a harmonious marriage.

404
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,680
Sure.

405
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,280
I'll just buy something for you then.

406
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:16,860
Sir,

407
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,930
take as much as you need for the braiding.

408
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,380
I think this lady here has a thin wrist.

409
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,780
You don't need that much.

410
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,420
I accidentally pulled too much.

411
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,440
I will make two then.

412
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:24,830
Okay.

413
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,350
Sir,

414
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,000
this is a bit deliberate.

415
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,280
Haven't you been trained to lie?

416
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,250
Who will train to lie?

417
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,820
Sir.

418
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,150
Your hand.

419
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,690
Put it on for me.

420
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,950
This is for girls.

421
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,620
They said this will ensure fulfilling love and a harmonious marriage.

422
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,750
How can the girl wear it but not the man?

423
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,740
♫Sighing at the lights and song♫

424
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,870
♫Weaving the world's lights♫

425
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,040
♫Sigh at the beautiful scenery♫

426
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,120
♫Who will enjoy it with me?♫

427
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,350
♫Where the lights fall upon♫

428
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,530
♫People come♫

429
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,540
♫And people go♫

430
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,450
♫You and I look♫

431
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,580
♫At the long galaxy between us♫

432
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:13,760
♫What can we do?♫

433
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,880
♫Flowers fall with the rain♫

434
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,270
♫The wind doesn't ask the clouds♫

435
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,150
♫The clouds♫

436
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,830
♫Don't speak too♫

437
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,010
♫I'm waiting for the wind without pain♫

438
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,830
♫Waiting for when I can't stand how much I miss you to get drunk♫

439
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,610
♫Waiting for the snow to not be lost♫

440
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,180
♫Waiting for the cold to leave and when everything grows♫

441
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,180
♫Waiting for the moon in the poem♫

442
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,640
♫To make a bottle of forever and ever♫

00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,560
♫Taste all the warmth♫

♫And let's talk about leaving for somewhere far♫

445
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,830
♫I'm waiting for my beloved to return home♫

446
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,600
♫Waiting for the rainy night lit by the red candles by the west window♫

447
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,440
♫Waiting for the leaves to fall and the white snow♫

448
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,010
♫Write the story on the thick snow♫

449
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,840
♫Waiting for our story♫

450
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:56,580
♫To be spread everywhere by the wind♫

451
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,330
♫Ferment all the longing♫

452
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,770
♫Cherish all the past♫

453
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,170
Miss.

454
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,150
Is the person you like not here yet?

455
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,570
They will come.

456
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,230
Good luck.

457
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,470
Jin–

458
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:22,300
Why do you look so lonely?

459
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,250
Did you get separated?

460
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,650
How about

461
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,230
enjoying the lanterns with us?

462
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:27,750
Yes.

463
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:28,310
Come.

464
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,700
Let's enjoy the lanterns together.

465
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,350
What are you doing?

466
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,110
Let's go see the lanterns together.

467
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,510
Let go!

468
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:32,730
Let go!

469
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:35,920
Jin Fan...

470
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,730
You finally found me.

471
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,240
Well...

472
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,050
How does that poem go again?

473
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,260
Something marriage...

474
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,040
Something lights.

475
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:58,610
This is for you.

476
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,140
But this lantern is small.

477
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,390
You probably like big ones.

478
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,230
No.

479
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,830
Small ones are cute.

480
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,480
Fireflies?

481
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,730
You caught them yourself?

482
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,970
When did you prepare a gift for me?

483
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:17,890
It's sold over there.

484
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,290
Ten copper coins for one.

485
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,410
You don't mean what you say.

486
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,950
I'm going to raise them,

487
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,480
and name them.

488
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,430
Fireflies can only live for three to five days.

489
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,160
I don't care.

490
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,590
I will put them in the valley of the Gong Residence

491
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,780
so that they can continue to reproduce.

492
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,990
The insects multiply

493
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,440
and go on for

494
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,080
endless generations.

495
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:43,990
Only male bugs

496
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,010
glow, no?

497
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,380
Bad apples fall from rotten trees.

498
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,010
Gong Ziyu doesn't study and so don't you.

499
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,630
All fireflies, regardless of gender, glow.

500
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,620
What should I name it?

501
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,960
Why don't we use your surname and my name?

502
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,080
Let's call it Little Jin Zi.

503
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,070
Little Jin Shang might sound better...

504
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,480
Sure.

505
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,530
Naming is something important. I'll listen to you.

506
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,920
You just said there are pottery and candied haws here.

507
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,460
Did you inquire about these

508
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,800
because you thought about going around this lantern festival with me hand in hand?

509
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,390
No.

510
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:30,950
I'm a dog if I'm lying.

511
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,940
You'd rather be a dog than admit it.

512
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,980
Young Master, I didn't lie to you.

513
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,090
I told you the person you like would like it

514
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,480
if you gifted it to them.

515
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:42,990
He forced me into

516
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,010
buying it from him

517
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,110
and refused to let me leave,

518
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,210
so I bought one.

519
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,920
Sir,

520
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,020
that's not what you said. You said–

521
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,230
What did he say?

522
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,500
He said this lantern can't be blown out by the wind.

523
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,490
It's good.

524
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,770
How sweet.

525
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,100
Don't rush to meet up with Gong Ziyu.

526
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,220
Let the couple

527
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,040
spend more time together.

528
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,210
I'm not looking to meet up with him,

529
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,610
but the Sword Wielder gave us two a mission.

530
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,510
So exciting?

531
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,450
Gong Zishang sneaked out for so long.

532
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,630
I feel sorry for Jin Fan.

533
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,910
I thought you wouldn't notice.

534
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,630
I can see through her little trick.

535
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,310
But you still helped her.

536
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,640
I have my own ideas.

537
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,400
What are you talking about?

538
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,360
Nothing.

539
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:47,770
What's wrong?

540
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:48,980
Oh no!

541
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:49,960
My necklace!

542
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,760
My sister's ring is on it.

543
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:53,830
Take this.

544
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:54,570
Wait for me.

545
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:23,679
Please spare my life!

546
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,690
Today is a good day.

547
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,310
I don't want to ruin the mood.

548
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:31,940
Scram.

549
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,150
Thank you, sir.

550
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,650
Is anyone here?

551
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,380
Where did you get the mirror from?

552
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:30,900
Mind your own business.

553
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,530
Okay.

554
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,400
Miss Yun.

555
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,330
Miss Yun!

556
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,000
Are you here for Old Man Jia too?

557
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,400
What happened to him?

558
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:00,510
People keep coming to look for him these days.

559
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,040
Who else came?

560
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,660
A few days ago,

561
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,360
a rough and tough guy

562
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,020
with a fierce face came too.

563
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,520
What happened to Old Man Jia?

564
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,530
It's nothing.

565
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,280
What can happen to him when he works in the Gong Residence?

566
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,180
We are Jia's distant relatives.

567
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,510
We came to visit him since it's the festival.

568
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,950
But he's not here.

569
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,910
Tell me about it.

570
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:29,910
He

571
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,800
is my husband.

572
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,630
He's not good at talking.

573
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,050
Please don't mind him.

574
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,830
[Wanhua Pavillion]

575
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:45,970
Sword Wielder.

576
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,510
You call me the Sword Wielder

577
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
but you don't listen to my commands.

578
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,950
We will do everything

579
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,700
you order.

580
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,390
I didn't ask you to come,

581
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,540
but you came.

582
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,690
Who ordered you to do this?

583
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,500
I want to protect you.

584
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,110
Do you want to protect me...

585
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,490
or spy on me?

586
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,140
I dare not.

587
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:09,610
Stop!

588
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,360
Where are you going?

589
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,060
Are you going back to report to your master?

590
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,020
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

591
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,950
Wait for me here.

592
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:27,980
You are Ziyi?

593
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,700
I won’t drink the tea.

594
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm not here for tea.

595
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,000
And tea is not only for drinking.

596
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,780
Leave it.

597
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,510
It's good to just look at it too.

598
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,020
She's also a Chi?

599
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,660
A Mei?

600
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,990
Is she...

601
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:13,850
a Wang?

602
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,910
But there are only four Wangs

603
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,720
in Wufeng.

604
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,260
I've never seen them before.

605
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,900
Stop guessing.

606
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,880
I am nobody.

607
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,380
I'm just helping Han Yasi.

608
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,460
You must have an identity.

609
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,880
But I have no right to know.

610
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,180
I won't guess.

611
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,430
I'm here

612
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,040
to get the antidote for Shangguan Qian and me.

613
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,210
Why didn't Shangguan Qian come herself?

614
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,930
She can't get out.

615
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,720
She trusts you so much.

616
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,580
Not bad.

617
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:01,030
The young generation is really different.

618
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,810
Did you bring the thing?

619
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,010
The antidote.

620
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,840
Young Master Ziyu.

621
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:33,470
It's been a long time.

622
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,330
Young Master Ziyu.

623
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,640
It's been a long time.

624
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:39,850
But unfortunately,

625
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,150
Ziyi has guests today.

626
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,370
Did you see

627
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,380
a young and beautiful female guest entering just now?

628
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,150
Come on.

629
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:47,630
Are you kidding?

630
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,780
Why would a female guest come here?

631
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,190
Let me get you some–

632
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,370
Did you really not?

633
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,690
No.

634
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:54,920
Fine.

635
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,290
I'll take take a look myself. You get back to work.

636
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,690
Come here often.

637
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,130
You should.

638
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,340
Come often.

639
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:03,880
Come more often.

640
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:07,400
Does Miss Ziyi have a guest?

641
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,030
No.

642
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,590
I just passed by.

643
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,120
The pattern hung out on her door is still a Bud.

644
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,090
Within the Gong Residence,

645
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,140
besides Shangguan Qian and me,

646
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,900
is there anyone else from Wufeng?

647
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:35,690
Wait.

648
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,910
The charcoal has been burning for too long.

649
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,170
Let me open the window for some fresh air.

650
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,790
You can't leave through the window.

651
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,450
Hide first.

652
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,020
Do you know each other?

653
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:10,830
Of course not.

654
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,580
You know Miss Ziyi?

655
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,280
The tea is not only for drinking.

656
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,050
Leave it.

657
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,210
It's good to just look at it.

658
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:30,850
This signal

659
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:34,670
means to attack.

660
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,030
This signal

661
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,670
means to retreat.

662
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:57,760
Miss Ziyi.

663
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,610
Someone told me you have a guest just now.

664
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:02,810
I didn't expect...

665
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,910
it's Miss Yun.

666
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:15,980
That's right.

667
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,490
I'm Miss Ziyi's

668
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,430
guest.

669
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:23,140
Miss Yun.

670
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,500
I...

671
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:26,530
This...

672
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,950
I heard from Sister Zishang that

673
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,220
you often leave Gong Residence

674
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,010
to come here the most.

675
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:37,800
Even when the former Sword Wielder was angry,

676
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,600
he couldn't stop you from coming to visit one person.

677
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:45,550
I was really curious,

678
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:47,350
so I came to see.

679
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:49,920
I thought

680
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,490
she must know more than me.

681
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,540
I want to know you better.

682
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,910
So I came here...

683
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:02,850
alone.

684
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:10,660
Yes.

685
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:13,190
I was surprised when I heard that

686
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,420
there was a female guest looking for me.

687
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,150
Later, I heard the servants say

688
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,200
it's the lady that Young Master Gong Ziyu

689
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,380
was walking around the lantern market with,

690
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,440
and figured it out.

691
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,640
That's why I invited her here

692
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:28,420
to have some tea

693
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,980
and talk about what you usually do when you come to look for me.

694
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,840
I didn't do anything.

695
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:36,680
Are you nervous?

696
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,580
This is the first time

697
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,100
I'm seeing you so nervous.

698
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,300
But don't worry.

699
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,680
I won't give her a hard time.

700
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,610
In fact, even before you came,

701
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,950
we were having a good time chatting.

702
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,150
Am I right, Miss Yun?

703
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,380
Miss Ziyi

704
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,230
told me a lot about your past.

705
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:09,790
There are not many things between us.

706
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:11,110
Yes.

707
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:14,070
That's all we have between us.

708
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,680
All right.

709
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:20,550
This is not the best place

710
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,760
for Miss Yun to stay around for too long.

711
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,410
Please take her back, Young Master.

712
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,410
My tea is cold.

713
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,790
I won't keep you.

714
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:05,920
Let's go.

715
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,940
There's something I haven't taken yet.

716
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,420
Blood...

717
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,260
[The murderer is Anonymous. The sharpest saber has no blade.]

718
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,070
Who?

719
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:46,270
Who are you?

720
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:48,750
There is no woman with martial skills like you in the Gong family.

721
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,550
What should we do?

722
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:50,610
Do we keep waiting?

723
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:51,960
Yun Weishan is missing.

724
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:53,750
We can't keep waiting.

725
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:54,750
Shoot the whistling arrows.

726
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:55,770
Notify Young Master Shangjue that

727
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:57,390
the bride is suspected to have escaped.

728
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,700
Ask if they would like to order the guards

729
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,100
to search the whole city.

730
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:03,720
Oh no!

731
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,710
Something happened.

732
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,860
Go look for the Sword Wielder.

733
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,720
Gosh. Goodbye.

734
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,920
Let's talk next time!

735
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,500
Who's there?

736
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,610
What are you doing?

737
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:42,310
I thought

738
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,560
Miss Yun has escaped.

739
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:44,530
Escaped?

740
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:45,540
No.

741
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,310
I mean...

742
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:46,790
Lost...

743
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:47,830
Lost your way.

744
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:21,110
Sword Wielder.

745
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,590
Go to the Council of Elders.

746
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:23,450
What happened?

747
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:24,060
Report,

748
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,440
Lady Wuji was attacked.

749
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,210
She has been sent to the clinic for emergency treatment.

750
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:28,380
The Anonymous Murderer

751
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:29,510
has appeared again.

752
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:33,680
Jin Fan,

753
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,510
escort Yun Weishan back to the Yu Lineage first.

754
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:37,440
Sister Zishang,

755
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,810
go to the clinic to visit the Concubine.

756
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,310
I'm going to the Council of Elders now.

757
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:58,110
You two

758
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,140
go check over there.

759
00:50:59,140 --> 00:50:59,630
Yes!

760
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:03,390
Search carefully!

761
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:06,610
What happened?

762
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,190
Elder Hua ordered for a search.

763
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:11,120
The Sword Wielder has gone to the Council of Elders.

764
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,970
Eldest Young Miss

765
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,900
went to the clinic to see Lady Wuji.

766
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:15,590
What we are looking for is any females among the different lineages

767
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:17,190
for any injuries sustained.

768
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,500
Why are you looking for a wounded woman?

769
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,830
We're just following orders.

770
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:21,770
As for the reason,

771
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:22,970
please ask Elder Hua.

772
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:54,130
Miss Shangguan Qian.

773
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,260
[Jue]

774
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,120
Miss Shangguan Qian.

775
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:20,410
Young Master Shangjue.

776
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,210
What’s wrong?

777
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:23,010
Elder Hua has made an order

778
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,720
to search the various lineages to see if there are any injured women.

779
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,120
Please ask Shangguan Qian to open the door.

780
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,540
All right.

781
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:34,810
Miss Shangguan Qian.

782
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:38,610
Miss Shangguan Qian.

783
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,160
Break the door.

784
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,750
Young Master Shangjue?

785
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:49,910
Young Master Shangjue...

786
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:51,000
What happened?

787
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,100
Why didn't you open the door?

788
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:58,120
I feel a little feverish.

789
00:52:58,310 --> 00:52:59,770
I'm afraid I caught a cold.

790
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:00,990
So,

791
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,590
after taking the sleeping medicine,

792
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:03,650
I went to bed early.

793
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,340
I heard someone knocking on my door in my dream,

794
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,270
so I just woke up.

795
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:11,550
Sorry for intruding.

796
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:45,950
You light such a

797
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:48,530
heavy incense when you're sleeping?

798
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,590
I have insomnia recently.

799
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,970
So I put

800
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,510
a little more spices.

801
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:38,650
You're smart.

802
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,580
You know I'm sensitive to the smell of blood,

803
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:45,240
so you deliberately lit such strong incense.

804
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:47,850
Unfortunately,

805
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,420
there was one small flaw.

806
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:52,170
Sir,

807
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,190
I don't understand what you're talking about.

808
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,270
Tell me.

809
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:00,630
Whose blood is this?
