First,

101
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,980
the Gong family must always have a Sword Wielder.

Second,

105

if the Sword Wielder and his successor die together,

106
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,460

00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,270
I've confirmed it.

173
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,840
Our assassins did it?

174
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,740
I'm not sure.

175
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,060
But

176
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,590
I don't think the assassins we sent out

177
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,850
are capable enough

178
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,850
to take him down in such a short time.

179
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:02,730
Besides,

180
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,600
the mission we gave them

181
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,290
is not to kill the Sword Wielder.

182
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,460
Maybe they got exposed

183
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,290
and had no choice but to kill him.

184
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,270
I got word

185
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,640
that Miss Zheng Nanyi's cover was blown.

186
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,850
Gong Shangjue is headed to the Zheng family of Hunyuan

187
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,710
to look into it.

188
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,160
Have you taken care of it?

189
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,440
Rest assured.

190
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,370
It's all done.

191
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,480
No trace

192
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,950
is left behind.

193
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,820
Good.

194
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,280
The remaining Chis and Meis

195
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,740
must've made it into the Gong family.

196
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's look forward to their performance.

197
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,130
[Zheng Family of Hunyuan]

198
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,850
Young Master Shangjue.

199
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,450
The entire mansion is empty.

200
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,130
All the valuables are gone.

201
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,880
Did you stay here all night

202
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,490
or come early in the morning?

203
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,500
You're already the Sword Wielder.

204
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,690
There are a lot of things you need to do.

205
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,150
You can't fall apart.

206
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,770
I never wanted to be the Sword Wielder.

207
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,490
-But...
-But...

208
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,790
Now that I'm already the Sword Wielder,

209
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,000
I can do whatever I want.

210
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,300
No one can stop me.

211
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,120
What are you going to do?

212
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,490
Who found

213
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,940
my father and brother's bodies?

214
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,089
Lady Wuji.

215
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:12,910
Let's go.

216
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,290
I need to meet her.

217
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,440
Your father asked me

218
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,780
to give this to you.

219
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,330
Last month, he got a fine red fox pelt

220
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
and made a robe for your brother.

221
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,950
Then he used the remnant

222
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,340
to make this for you.

223
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,130
He said you like these exquisite things.

224
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,300
He was too shy to give it to you himself

225
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,590
so he asked me to do it.

226
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,450
Your father's bark was worse than his bite.

227
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,750
Actually,

228
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,250
he regretted being so harsh to you

229
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,420
because of the female assassin

230
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,710
but was too embarrassed to apologize to you.

231
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,950
Don't blame him.

232
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,110
Lady Wuji.

233
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,180
Can you tell me

234
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,580
what happened that night?

235
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,700
That night,

236
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,410
I was in your father's study

237
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,830
brewing tea for him.

238
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
Young Lord Huanyu

239
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,580
suddenly came in with a woman

240
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,210
whose hands were tied.

241
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,220
I got up and left.

242
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,500
I went to the kitchen

243
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,340
to make supper for them.

244
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,330
After it was finished,

245
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,390
I returned to the yard

246
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:08,010
and heard a fierce fight.

247
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,470
Through the window,

248
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,530
I saw three people fighting.

249
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,320
After a few loud thuds,

250
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,150
the room went dark.

251
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,700
Then

252
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,170
it became quiet.

253
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,790
Lady Wuji.

254
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,970
Why didn't you call the guards?

255
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,660
I did.

256
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,800
But at that time,

257
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,440
there was no guard on duty in the yard.

258
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,930
That was strange.

259
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,840
The guardians should always be around to protect the Sword Wielder.

260
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,330
Seeing the candles go out

261
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,010
and the room plunged into darkness,

262
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,340
I rushed over immediately

263
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,460
and opened the door of the study.

264
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,770
I found the Sword Wielder,

265
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,350
Huanyu,

266
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,260
and that woman lying dead on the floor.

267
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,350
I met that female assassin once.

268
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,890
She wasn't good enough at martial arts

269
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,900
to kill both my father and brother.

270
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,020
I don't believe it.

271
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,790
But she used poison.

272
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,030
Maybe she managed it

273
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,400
by catching them unawares.

274
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,330
Lady Wuji, we shall leave.

275
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,160
Let's go

276
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,330
meet those two guardians.

277
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,870
That night, the Sword Wielder met Young Master Shangjue first.

278
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,390
Then Young Lord Huanyu suddenly came

279
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,910
and asked to see the Sword Wielder.

280
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,080
After the three of them talked for a while,

281
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,790
Young Master Shangjue left in a hurry.

282
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,990
Young Master Shangjue left Jiuchen Valley in the night.

283
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,520
The wedding is coming soon.

284
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,230
Why is he leaving?

285
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,790
Who do you mean?

286
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,710
Young Master Shangjue.

287
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,700
Young Lord Huanyu went to the prison to interrogate the female assassin

288
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,310
and brought her to the Sword Wielder.

289
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,110
He ordered me and the Green Jade Guardian to leave.

290
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,390
Young Lord Huanyu said he needed to discuss something important with the Sword Wielder

291
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,120
and asked me and Jin Yu to leave.

292
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,060
Do you think they were lying?

293
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,970
Then let's meet someone who doesn't lie.

294
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,540
The dead don't lie.

295
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,310
Be careful.

296
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,880
The hairpin may be poisonous.

297
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,910
Something was wrong

298
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,370
with the Herb Elixir your father and brother took.

299
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,970
The Herb Elixir you take may not be safe either.

300
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,910
The gem on the hairpin is hollow.

301
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,070
The poison

302
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,040
was hidden in the gem.

303
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,920
The fingers of Father's right hand are purple.

304
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,840
It's obviously caused by poison.

305
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,760
But

306
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,120
how did my father and brother

307
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,200
come into contact with the poison?

308
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,970
Maybe something was hidden in the secret groove of the hairpin

309
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,540
and taken out by them.

310
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,890
Perhaps, during that process,

311
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,490
they were exposed to the deadly poison.

312
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,010
Secret groove?

313
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,680
Did you find anything in it?

314
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,950
It was empty when I found it.

315
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:57,870
Maybe

316
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,940
Young Master Shangjue took away whatever was inside.

317
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,310
There is a burn on the female assassin's skin

318
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,710
which was left by poison.

319
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,480
But it didn't cause her death.

320
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,030
The cut that pierced through her chest

321
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,050
killed her.

322
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,750
How did she get on the bride list?

323
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,370
She was the second daughter of the Zheng family of Hunyuan,

324
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,180
Zheng Nanyi.

325
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,760
But we don't know if that identity

326
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,590
is true.

327
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,420
After the accident happened,

328
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,050
did you check the Ladies' Hostel?

329
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,090
I sent guards over in time.

330
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,990
All of them were in the house.

331
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,550
None of them had gone out.

332
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,370
But

333
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,760
two brides were poisoned.

334
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,240
Who are they?

335
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,320
They're the two brides

336
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,890
who got the golden tokens.

337
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,440
Jiang Lili and Yun Weishan.

338
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,520
Let's go.

339
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,580
[Feng]

340
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,210
What brought you here at this early hour?

341
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,380
You think too much.

342
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,190
How can I help?

343
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,620
Since we're the same,

344
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,860
I think

345
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,100
I should be clear with you.

346
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,270
Wait. We're not the same.

347
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,660
I told you yesterday.

348
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,240
I'm a Mei. I'm superior to you.

349
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,560
In Wufeng, you must listen to your superiors.

350
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,210
You must know that.

351
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,450
I do.

352
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,260
I just didn't expect them

353
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,990
to plant a Mei

354
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,600
in the Gong family too.

355
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,000
Everything comes with a price.

356
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,700
With prices come sacrifices.

357
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,960
If Miss Zheng hadn't been exposed,

358
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,310
you would've been the one

359
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,200
who was sacrificed.

360
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,770
Was she a Mei too?

361
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,620
She was too stupid

362
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,270
to be a Mei.

363
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,280
So in the future,

364
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,870
the two of us

365
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,930
will carry out the mission together?

366
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,870
Is there anyone else with us?

367
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,060
Crows gather together.

368
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,390
The eagle flies high alone.

369
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
There is

370
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,690
no "us".

371
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,250
And we won't do anything together.

372
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,180
I see.

373
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:36,850
Wait.

374
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,040
You went out by stealth last night.

375
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,470
What did you find?

376
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:45,480
I saved you.

377
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,830
The least you can do is tell me

378
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,520
who's dead.

379
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,570
How did you know someone died?

380
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,350
There are so many white lanterns in the air.

381
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,940
And the servants have been bustling around with candles and funeral items.

382
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,740
I'm not blind.

383
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,300
I can guess.

384
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,440
The Sword Wielder and Young Lord Huanyu

385
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,790
both died.

386
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,100
You killed them?

387
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:34,930
Physician,

388
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,510
what's the poison that's making her sick?

389
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,570
It's complicated.

390
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:44,280
There seems to be more than one kind of poison.

391
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,380
Physician,

392
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,440
is the rash on her face

393
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,920
caused by poison too?

394
00:27:59,340 --> 00:27:59,710
Yes.

395
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,720
It's a kind of strong poison

396
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,370
that takes effect very fast.

397
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,240
Miss Jiang is unconscious

398
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,700
and keeps slurring.

399
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,260
She might have been affected

400
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,210
by a poison that targets her mind.

401
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,900
Is her life in danger?

402
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,930
I'm not sure of that.

403
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,830
The rash on her face will heal

404
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,360
after she takes some detoxifying decoction.

405
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,880
But as to the poison

406
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,700
that makes her delirious,

407
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,190
I haven't figured out

408
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,780
how to neutralize it yet.

409
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,790
I have to consult Young Master Yuanzhi later.

410
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,990
Physician, the decoction is ready.

411
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,720
Send it over.

412
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,460
Yes.

413
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,610
Physician.

414
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:36,780
That decoction…

415
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,220
Well,

416
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,790
it's for Miss Yun Weishan,

417
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:41,030
the girl who also got a golden token.

418
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,550
She has the same rash on her face too.

419
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,020
I didn't kill them.

420
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,790
My mission is not to kill the Sword Wielder.

421
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,270
Then what's your mission?

422
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,670
I don't think

423
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,410
we can talk about that.

424
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,770
We can't.

425
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,010
But I just want to help.

426
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,850
If you act recklessly again

427
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,960
like you did yesterday,

428
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,620
I'll have to

429
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:14,190
clean up the mess for you.

430
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,750
If I know what your mission is,

431
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,540
I may be able to cover for you.

432
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,470
After all,

433
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,440
if you're exposed,

434
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,320
Miss Zheng Nanyi

435
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,440
would've died for nothing.

436
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,610
Weishan,

437
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,750
I mean no harm.

438
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,310
Don't overthink it.

439
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,340
Do you mind me calling you

440
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,610
Weishan?

441
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,520
You don't feel sorry for Miss Zheng at all.

442
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,070
You're just worried that if I'm exposed,

443
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,800
you can't stay hidden anymore.

444
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,200
The Gong family will realize

445
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,370
that there may be other assassins

446
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,720
besides me.

447
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:04,830
Am I right?

448
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,500
Look.

449
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,820
There is

450
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,130
an "us".

451
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,260
So,

452
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,450
we'd better work together.

453
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,580
I told you.

454
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,010
Our missions are different.

455
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,400
You poisoned Miss Jiang's tea.

456
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,830
You want to replace her.

457
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,610
Our missions should be the same.

458
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,870
Didn't Miss Jiang get the rash on her face

459
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,800
from your nail polish?

460
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,870
You saw it?

461
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,370
I don't need to.

462
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,880
Isn't that the basic training in Wufeng?

463
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,200
I could've made Miss Jiang a lunatic

464
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,770
without arousing any suspicion.

465
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,250
But you suddenly showed up.

466
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,070
If I'm right,

467
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,440
before long,

468
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,080
I'll have to clean up your mess again.

469
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,170
Physician,

470
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,840
is the poison the two girls suffer from

471
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,110
related to the poison

472
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,170
that killed the Sword Wielder?

473
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,320
No.

474
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,670
Thank you, Physician.

475
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,470
Since the poison making Miss Jiang sick

476
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:35,170
is not the one that killed your father and brother,

477
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,370
shall we still go to the Ladies' Hostel?

478
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,220
You're already the Sword Wielder

479
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,600
and haven't chosen your bride yet.

480
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,730
It's inappropriate

481
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,050
for you to go there.

482
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,040
A clean hand wants no washing.

483
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,230
My hands are very clean.

484
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,230
There's nothing to be afraid of.

485
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,890
You always…

486
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,960
The tea I gave Miss Jiang

487
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:03,980
was not poisoned.

488
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,280
Then it was the incense.

489
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,410
The incense was not poisonous either.

490
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,450
But inhaling the incense after drinking the tea

491
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,250
changed things.

492
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,860
At first, she'd just be delirious.

493
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,770
A few days later, she'd start to mumble to herself

494
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,040
as if she had dementia.

495
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,710
As an assassin of Wufeng,

496
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,190
you shouldn't

497
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,820
have that look on your face.

498
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:41,070
You're so soft-hearted.

499
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,070
It'll cost you your life sooner or later.

500
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,730
I don't hurt innocent people.

501
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,510
You're so interesting, Weishan.

502
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,680
Back to my incense and tea.

503
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,940
Both of them are harmless when examined separately.

504
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,490
Even if they get suspicious,

505
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,550
they can't find anything.

506
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,430
I kindly reminded you

507
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,500
that tea

508
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,670
had been tampered with

509
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,070
and you should not drink it,

510
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,870
but you tried to be clever and ruined everything.

511
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,240
Thanks to you,

512
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,680
both the rash on Miss Jiang's face

513
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,630
and your nail polish

514
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,000
have become solid evidence.

515
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,210
If I were you,

516
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,920
I'd wash it off now.

517
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,530
Young Master Yuanzhi, you came to the clinic too.

518
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,700
What are you here for?

519
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,560
Sword Wielder.

520
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,570
Young Master Yuanzhi.

521
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,000
According to the rules,

522
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,270
you should greet

523
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,520
the Sword Wielder.

524
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,850
Who are you?

525
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,780
How dare you tell me what to do?

526
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,010
Jin Fan.

527
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,070
He must have a good reason for not greeting me.

528
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:13,360
Although I don't understand,

529
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,370
I won't force him.

530
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,159
The Council of Elders will deal with him.

531
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,250
Sword Wielder.

532
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,830
No need for formalities.

533
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,120
You specialize in making poisons and antidotes

534
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,790
and performed autopsies on my father and brother.

535
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,550
Did you find anything?

536
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,389
They were killed by Ascension,

537
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,449
a poison invented by the Gong family.

538
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:45,920
That poison takes effect very quickly. Without timely detox,

539
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,920
death is certain.

540
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,340
So you mean

541
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,250
it can be neutralized.

542
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:52,610
Yes.

543
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,170
But very hard.

544
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:55,120
Is it?

545
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,550
Since it was invented,

546
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,380
no one taking it has ever been brought back to life.

547
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,790
Ascension is deadly and spreads all over

548
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,790
the victim's body via bloodstream.

549
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:07,620
The window for detox is very short.

550
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:10,770
How short?

551
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,190
Within 200 heartbeats.

552
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,680
Is it difficult

553
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,670
to obtain such a lethal poison?

554
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,930
Seems that you're

555
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,550
not very familiar with the Gong family's business.

556
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,350
Ascension

557
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,530
is sold at every post of the Gong family

558
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,950
in and out of Jiuchen Valley.

559
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,130
Anyone can buy it.

560
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,470
So you mean

561
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,980
the poison called Ascension

562
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,220
is hard to cure but easy to get.

563
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:41,090
Young Master Yuanzhi.

564
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,470
Are there precautions

565
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,270
one can take?

566
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,070
I don't understand what you mean.

567
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,950
Let me put it another way.

568
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,100
Will someone who takes the Herb Elixir every day

569
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,330
be affected by it?

570
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:07,830
No.

571
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,790
My father and brother

572
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,350
took the Herb Elixir every day

573
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,410
but were poisoned.

574
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,520
Does that mean I can hold

575
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,600
those who make the Herb Elixir accountable?

576
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,550
Everyone in the Gong family, from elders to madams,

577
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:24,070
has been taking the Herb Elixir and other tonics

578
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,590
made by the Zhi Lineage for many years.

579
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,190
Nothing had ever gone wrong.

580
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,990
You asked me why I came to the clinic.

581
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,790
I came to check

582
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,050
if there is any problem

583
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,530
with the Herb Elixir here.

584
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,840
Is there?

585
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,420
No.

586
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,760
We're right back where we started.

587
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,500
Why on earth

588
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,440
were my father and brother poisoned?

589
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,610
I'm in charge of making the Herb Elixir,

590
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,280
but after sending it to different lineages,

591
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,480
it's served by the servants of your own.

592
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,480
Why don't you

593
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,860
look into the servants of the Yu Lineage?

594
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:02,300
Maybe you'll be surprised.

595
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:11,300
Of course I'll look into

596
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,150
the servants of the Yu Lineage.

597
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,150
You should do that.

598
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,350
Besides,

599
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,100
you were just appointed the Sword Wielder

600
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,000
and made ungrounded accusations against the Zhi Lineage.

601
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:27,800
How impressive.

602
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,340
I'll find the evidence.

603
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,870
Wait and see.

604
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,120
The Sword Wielder and Young Lord Huanyu

605
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,080
both died,

606
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:47,610
so

607
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,880
Absent Inheritance must have been initiated.

608
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,510
Absent Inheritance?

609
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,100
Didn't your Raven

610
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,140
tell you about that?

611
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,060
I'm just a Chi.

612
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,780
Don't overestimate me.

613
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,760
Your sudden humbleness

614
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,990
took me by surprise.

615
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,810
Absent Inheritance

616
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,140
is a rule of the Gong family

617
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,840
set to tide it through crises.

618
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,980
Basically,

619
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:27,250
it makes sure that the Gong family and Jiuchen Valley

620
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,000
always have a leader.

621
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,570
If the Sword Wielder and the Young Lord both die,

622
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,510
the next in line of succession

623
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,470
in Jiuchen Valley

624
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,420
will become the new Sword Wielder unconditionally.

625
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,710
So

626
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,750
the Sword Wielder now

627
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,400
should be Young Master Shangjue,

628
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,580
Gong Shangjue.

629
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,030
The current Sword Wielder

630
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,450
is the younger brother of Young Lord Huanyu,

631
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,980
Gong Ziyu.

632
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,740
Gong Shangjue left the Valley last night.

633
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:07,710
He's not here.

634
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,750
So according to the line of succession,

635
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,670
Gong Ziyu took the position of the Sword Wielder.

636
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,040
Sure enough.

637
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:20,130
That's what Absent Inheritance means.

638
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,810
The Gong family is a bunch of stubborn fools.

639
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,220
Pedantic and absurd.

640
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,430
Now that

641
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,350
Gong Ziyu has become the new Sword Wielder,

642
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,230
he'll choose a new bride.

643
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,350
It seems

644
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,990
that he's your new target now.

645
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,970
After losing Gong Huanyu,

646
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,530
you can't lose Gong Ziyu too.

647
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,280
I wish you good luck.

648
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,540
What about you?

649
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,000
Don't you need good luck?

650
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,780
Miss Jiang won't recover any time soon.

651
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,870
Don't you need

652
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:59,510
to get a golden token?

653
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,660
Why do I need that?

654
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,930
With a golden token,

655
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,630
whether Gong Ziyu chooses you or me,

656
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,290
our missions will be easier.

657
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,350
I don't need Gong Ziyu to choose me.

658
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,550
Besides,

659
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,910
do you think I didn't get a golden token

660
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,410
because I couldn't?

661
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,430
Girls, you all need to take a bath tonight.

662
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,080
Get up early tomorrow.

663
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,070
Don't put on any makeup.

664
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,440
Don't wear perfume.

665
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,520
Be your true selves

666
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,340
and wait to be summoned.

667
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:04,970
Physician.

668
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,720
Unpleasant body smell.

669
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,010
Low body temperature.

670
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,190
Heavy dampness.

671
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,980
You gave up the golden token yourself?

672
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,380
What else could it be?

673
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,130
Your target is not the Sword Wielder.

674
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:56,890
My target

675
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,230
is much trickier than the Sword Wielder.

676
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,350
The Zheng family of Hunyuan

677
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,540
has moved away.

678
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,650
Someone must've tipped them off.

679
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:33,870
Besides,

680
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,430
the matter Young Lord Huanyu asked me to investigate

681
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,080
has not been leaked yet.

682
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,700
Send it back

683
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,190
to the Gong Residence as soon as possible.

684
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,560
Yes.

685
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:54,750
Hurry.

686
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,930
Urgent message from the Gong Residence.

687
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:16,200
Young Master Shangjue.

688
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:16,930
Read it.

689
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:19,780
Read it.

690
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:21,540
Yes.

691
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,220
Destiny can't be refused.

692
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,410
The lineages need a head.

693
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,730
The Council appointed

694
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:35,880
Gong...

695
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,410
Gong Ziyu

696
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,990
as the new Sword Wielder.

697
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,190
When Gong Huanyu was made the heir,

698
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:53,550
I thought

699
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,200
it was so unfair

700
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:56,770
and still think so now.

701
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:58,530
In my mind,

702
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:00,350
you're the one

703
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,170
who should be the Sword Wielder.

704
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,750
Instead of what happened to the Gong family

705
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:10,770
and how the late Sword Wielder

706
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,480
died,

707
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:14,520
you're concerned about

708
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,740
who is the new Sword Wielder.

709
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:23,700
In the future,

710
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,540
don't say anything like that again.

711
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,200
Sorry.

712
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,120
My horse has run for days

713
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,780
and is exhausted.

714
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,530
Find me the fastest horse here.

715
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:40,500
Yes.

716
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,300
You can see through people.

717
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,660
You're even more capable than I thought.

718
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,120
You flatter me.

719
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,260
I'm a Mei after all.

720
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,650
Well,

721
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,270
you're much smarter than I thought too.

722
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,840
I thought you were stupid to carry out an assassination

723
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,810
on the first night you arrived

724
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,330
at the Gong Residence.

725
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,660
But now that I think about it,

726
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:39,350
you didn't act on a whim.

727
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,410
When Gong Ziyu

728
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,040
brought us out of the prison,

729
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:45,330
you memorized the night patrol routes

730
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,330
of the guards in the Gong Residence.

731
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:50,100
The night before the wedding,

732
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,900
all the ladies went to bed early.

733
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,050
No one would disturb them.

734
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,400
It was the perfect time for an assassination.

735
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,680
If the Sword Wielder hadn't been killed,

736
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,690
you wouldn't have been discovered.

737
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,460
Besides,

738
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,460
you deliberately ran away from other brides that night

739
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,330
to attract the attention of Gong Ziyu, right?

740
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,410
When he came to the prison for the first time,

741
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,370
all he could see was me.

742
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,630
You pretended to escape

743
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,450
to let him chase after you.

744
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:25,320
Then,

745
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,700
you deliberately took his precious mask

746
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,560
to make him come to you again.

747
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:31,870
You're amazing.

748
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,430
I'm not as calculating as you think.

749
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,910
You think too highly of me, Miss Shangguan.

750
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:41,510
I just don't want

751
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,570
to meet my Raven empty-handed

752
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,680
half a month later.

753
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:56,650
No one wants that.

754
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,000
No one dares.

755
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:08,630
Drink this

756
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,040
and you'll be a Chi.

757
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,060
Don't chew.

758
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:39,850
Swallow them.

759
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:49,940
What are they?

760
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,010
Eggs.

761
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,320
Eggs of Bone-Gnawing Flies.

762
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,490
They're also called Fortnight Flies.

763
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:03,370
The poison made of them

764
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,100
is called Death Oath.

765
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,140
It means to be loyal to Wufeng until death.

766
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,250
It's solely used on assassins of Wufeng.

767
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,980
After drinking it,

768
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,580
Bone-Gnawing Flies will live in your body.

769
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:22,530
Usually, you won't feel them.

770
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,140
But you need to take the antidote

771
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,200
every half a month.

772
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,900
I don't know when I can come back

773
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,190
after entering the Gong Residence.

774
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,700
Shouldn't you give me more antidote

775
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,710
to Death Oath?

776
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:44,990
Every half a month,

777
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,780
someone from Wufeng will meet you

778
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:49,720
in the town in Jiuchen Valley.

779
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:51,540
If you have something to offer,

780
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:53,200
you'll be given the antidote.

781
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,990
No need to finish your words.

782
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:57,790
I can definitely get the antidote.

783
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:58,680
Don't worry.

784
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,230
Besides,

785
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,770
from a Chi to a Mei,

786
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,480
I suffered more than one can imagine.

787
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,500
I'm not afraid

788
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,250
of those flies and bugs.

789
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:20,230
No matter how painful the torture is,

790
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:22,520
I can bear it.

791
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,140
You can't.

792
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:30,980
Trust me.

793
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,240
You can't bear it.

794
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:41,130
So,

795
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:42,470
you must

796
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,200
get important information

797
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,370
before Fortnight Flies attack you.

798
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,270
You can also

799
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:52,830
do something that Wufeng deems satisfactory.

800
00:49:58,650 --> 00:49:59,380
Yun Weishan.

801
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,150
Where are you going?

802
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,460
I'm going to send out the information

803
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:06,590
I gathered.

804
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:09,070
How?

805
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,970
I'll float lanterns down the river.

806
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,310
Wait.

807
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,430
River lanterns?

808
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:26,960
In the broad daylight?

809
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:29,710
Jin Fan.

810
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,530
Get the lanterns out and search upstream.

811
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,590
If you can't find anyone, come downstream to meet me.

812
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:35,320
Downstream?

813
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,570
Why are you going downstream?

814
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,550
Miss.

815
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,020
Miss.

816
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,080
Miss Yun Weishan.

817
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,260
Miss Yun Weishan.

818
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,080
Yuan Weishan.

819
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,850
It's really you.

820
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:41,950
Instead of staying in your room,

821
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:43,500
you're headed to the gate.

822
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,800
What are you going to do?

823
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:47,730
I want to leave.

824
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:52,950
You tried to escape

825
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,590
when I first brought you out of the prison.

826
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,320
I thought you ran away

827
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,010
just because you were scared.

828
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,790
Now the assassin has been found.

829
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:03,990
The dust has settled.

830
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,170
But you still want to leave.

831
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,050
Why?

832
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:12,010
I never wanted to marry into the Gong family.

833
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,860
Mother forced me to come here.

834
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,170
Don't let her go.

835
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,250
Sword Wielder.

836
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,500
There are words written on the lantern.

837
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:42,540
Yun Weishan.

838
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:45,400
You wrote so many words on the lantern

839
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,210
and floated it down the river.

840
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,380
Did you plan

841
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,000
to send messages out?

842
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:05,990
I'll float lanterns down the river.

843
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,920
Do you take the Gong family for fools?

844
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,550
How to make sure the lanterns end in the right hands?

845
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:12,990
If they're picked up halfway,

846
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,050
the information on them will be seen.

847
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:16,260
Yes.

848
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:19,060
That's my plan.

849
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:23,720
You didn't drink my tea.

850
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,300
Why are you out of your mind

851
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,090
like Miss Jiang?

852
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,070
I mean,

853
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,730
I'll expose myself.

854
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,810
You were taught to do that too.

855
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,020
I see.

856
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:46,540
When we're faced with a crisis that may expose us,

857
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,510
we leak insignificant information as a distraction

858
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:52,620
to hide our true goals and identities.

859
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,680
Yes.

860
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,960
The Gong family is smart,

861
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:00,360
but everyone will fall for that trick.

862
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:03,320
Just like Miss Zheng exposed herself willingly.

863
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,360
Once the Gong family believes

864
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:08,060
that the assassin has been found,

865
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:10,050
the true assassins,

866
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:11,050
you and I,

867
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:12,450
will be safe.

868
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,010
Maybe Miss Zheng

869
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,940
didn't expose herself willingly.

870
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:22,360
For Wufeng,

871
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:24,440
her death

872
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,880
is just part of their plan.

873
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,870
The death of every one of us

874
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,320
is just a willing sacrifice they want.

875
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:38,630
What if Zheng Nanyi was so selfless

876
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:41,290
and sacrificed herself willingly?

877
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,470
The mountain is steep.

878
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:46,600
The river runs fast.

879
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,870
Come back as soon as you're done.

880
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:49,410
No.

881
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:52,690
I'll go downstream.

882
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:57,910
I see.

883
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,800
Your target has always been the Sword Wielder

884
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:03,800
instead of Gong Huanyu.

885
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,350
Now,

886
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:06,990
the Sword Wielder of the Gong family

887
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,850
has become Gong Ziyu.

888
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:14,740
Gong Ziyu seems to be a toff,

889
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:18,640
but judging from what I observed,

890
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:21,780
he's smarter than he appears.

891
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:24,950
He'll follow the clue of Miss Jiang's poisoning

892
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:26,550
to look into the other girls,

893
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:29,400
especially me who was poisoned too.

894
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:32,240
To come here,

895
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,170
he'll have to walk up along the river.

896
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,560
I want him to think that our meeting

897
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,790
is by accident.

898
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,800
You want him to think that he's destined

899
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:47,300
to meet you, right?

900
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:52,210
You're so smart.

901
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:54,310
Why are you just a Chi?

902
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,550
But all the information I have

903
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:03,510
is about his brother's personality and preferences.

904
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:06,870
This is the information

905
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:08,470
we collected on Gong Huanyu.

906
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:12,570
That's all?

907
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:13,930
That's all.

908
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,370
We tried our best.

909
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:19,530
Irrelevant information is not included

910
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:20,570
in it.

911
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:25,150
For example, Gong Huanyu has a younger brother named Gong Ziyu.

912
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,050
Gong Ziyu?

913
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:28,990
Do you have his information?

914
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:30,390
What kind of person is he?

915
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,950
He's not important.

916
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,140
You should focus on Gong Huanyu.

917
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:38,300
Gong Huanyu is the Young Lord of the Gong family,

918
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,250
which means he's the future Sword Wielder.

919
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:41,270
Only from him

920
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,260
can you get what you need.

921
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,950
I know very little

922
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,880
about Gong Ziyu.

923
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,810
Gong Ziyu lost his mother at an early age.

924
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:55,430
That's why he became

925
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:56,870
a grumpy playboy.

926
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:01,270
After he grew up, he spent all his time drinking and fooling around.

927
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,600
He can't amount to much.

928
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:05,770
Gong Ziyu and his father were not close.

929
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:07,640
Seems that he's never

930
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,370
gotten his father's approval.

931
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:12,730
His father gave almost all his love

932
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:14,940
to Gong Huanyu

933
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:17,430
who was cleverer and better at martial arts.

934
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,070
Father.

935
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:20,850
I'm cold.

936
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,600
You're so delicate.

937
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,260
You don't deserve to be my son.

938
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,120
Look at your brother.

939
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,210
See how he practices martial arts.

940
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,860
That's why Gong Ziyu gave up on himself.

941
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,480
However,

942
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:41,670
Gong Huanyu doted on him.

943
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:45,840
I know what to write on the river lanterns.

944
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,270
Is this river lantern yours?

945
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:52,110
Yes.

946
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,350
Miss Yun, you're so smart.

947
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,750
You know that if someone discovers the lantern,

948
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:01,300
they'll go upstream

949
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,630
to find the person who floated it.

950
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:05,490
So you went downstream on purpose

951
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:07,040
and took a detour to go back.

952
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,360
But do you know how many guards

953
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,990
there are along the river?

954
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:11,920
You may…

955
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,790
You get me wrong.

956
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,250
I just want to leave.

957
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,310
Young Master Ziyu.

958
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,220
I beg you.

959
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,410
Please let me go.

960
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:29,730
There have been rumors

961
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:31,130
in the Gong Residence

962
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:33,870
that Gong Ziyu is not a Gong.

963
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,300
His mother, Lady Lan,

964
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:38,140
had someone she loved

965
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:41,240
before marrying into the Gong family.

966
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,870
She missed him day and night

967
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,710
and kept trying to escape.

968
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:47,690
In the end, she died from depression.

969
00:58:58,550 --> 00:58:59,210
Father,

970
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,100
I've got married.

971
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,690
They gave me a lot of betrothal gifts.

972
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,340
I think

973
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,740
Mother doesn't have to work so hard

974
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:12,840
to support our family anymore.

975
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:14,830
Father,

976
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,560
I know you've been feeling bad

977
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,180
about not having a son to ennoble our family.

978
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:23,510
You always said

979
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,650
that I must marry a good man

980
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:28,230
to show everyone in the town

981
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:31,390
that the Yun family's daughter is blessed.

982
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,010
But Father,

983
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,340
I wasn't chosen by the Sword Wielder.

984
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,370
Sorry to disappoint you.

985
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:44,950
Is this really for your father?

986
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:54,450
Let her go.

987
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,170
No matter what your mission is,

988
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,620
if you want to leave this courtyard,

989
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,300
you must carefully avoid the guards' patrol route.

990
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:07,870
I can draw it for you.

991
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,500
Don't take the road on the east side.

992
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:15,600
Yun Weishan.

993
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,840
God help you if you lied to me.
