[Episode 17]

4
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,930
Is the golden gentian enough?

5
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,789
Yes.

6
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,240
Lady Wuji gave me a lot.

7
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,350
I was afraid there will be scarring

8
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,840
and you won't like it.

9
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,000
You could have just asked me for it directly.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,050
It's just a herb.

11
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,960
There was no need for you to compromise and apologize.

12
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,180
I didn't have to compromise.

13
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,410
Really?

14
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,000
I know you still suspect Lady Wuji.

15
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,790
That's why I went to fix my relationship with her

16
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,050
so that it'd be easier for me to help you

17
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,050
investigate her.

18
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,460
Is it for me

19
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,240
or for yourself?

20
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,790
Doing something for you

21
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,770
is the same as doing something for myself.

22
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,800
You and I

23
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,460
are one.

24
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,820
We have Anonymous as our common target.

25
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,100
So we should work together.

26
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,960
You've changed.

27
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,960
Maybe this is the real me.

28
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,840
Since you have found out my real identity,

29
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,570
I'm just being honest with you.

30
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,920
Do you like it?

31
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,480
These flower buds

32
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,790
seem like they're about to bloom.

33
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,020
You'll know soon

34
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,640
whether I like it or not.

35
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,400
Lord Sword Wielder.

36
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,820
I'm looking for Miss Yun.

37
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,460
Can I trust

38
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,160
the guardian's words?

39
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,690
I can't be sure.

40
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,110
He did drink then,

41
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,830
but he insisted that he wasn't drunk.

42
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,060
What is this?

43
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,240
It's a new medicine

44
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,700
that Elder Yue developed,

45
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,680
the truth grass.

46
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,260
After taking it,

47
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,350
it can make people tell the truth.

48
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,460
Is this what

49
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
cleared Miss Yun of her suspicions?

50
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,790
Why did Elder Yue give you this?

51
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,120
How could he have given me this?

52
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,020
I stole it.

53
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:09,910
Originally,

54
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,400
I just wanted to use this to probe Gong Shangjue.

55
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,150
But now I suddenly feel

56
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,020
that instead of investigating around

57
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,950
without finding any useful clues,

58
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,100
why not be more straightforward?

59
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:24,890
Is there really

60
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,530
a magical medicine that can control one's mind in this world?

61
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,720
Yes.

62
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,659
It's unbelievable.

63
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,470
Why don't you try it?

64
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:42,090
Do you have a conscience?

65
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,670
It's not bad for your health.

66
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,930
Just sacrifice yourself and cooperate.

67
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,030
Take it now.

68
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:14,970
How do you feel?

69
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,490
I feel a little dizzy.

70
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,450
So soon?

71
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,570
I'll start the questioning now.

72
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:35,670
Do you...

73
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,320
like Gong Zishang?

74
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:43,400
Tell me.

75
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,060
I don't like her.

76
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,570
Really?

77
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,920
This medicine doesn't work.

78
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,790
It's fake?

79
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,470
It's fake.

80
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,880
Do you mean

81
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,730
that it's fake when you said you don't like Gong Zishang?

82
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,140
You like my sister...

83
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:03,900
Gong Ziyu.

84
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,030
Every time you call me by my full name, I get flustered.

85
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,280
If this medicine is fake,

86
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,570
does that mean that what Miss Yun said then

87
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,660
cannot be trusted?

88
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,620
Do you...

89
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,870
like me?

90
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:24,970
No.

91
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,070
Right.

92
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,960
How can you smile after knowing that?

93
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,490
Are you

94
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,260
a Wufeng spy?

95
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,780
No.

96
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,909
Elder Yue

97
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,510
was seen by a guardian

98
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,720
when he went to the prison to meet the Wufeng assassin.

99
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,180
Miss Yun is also suspected to be from Wufeng.

100
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:54,170
Elder Yue used fake medicine to get Miss Yun out of trouble.

101
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,820
This...

102
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,430
I suddenly remembered

103
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,810
that there is a secret room

104
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,940
in Elder Yue’s room.

105
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,890
In the secret room,

106
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,070
there are traces that indicate that a woman had lived there.

107
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,130
I've never heard of

108
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,990
any woman who'd lived in Yue Residence before.

109
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,200
In the secret room,

110
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,760
there was also a bracelet.

111
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,620
A bracelet?

112
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,320
What's so special about that bracelet?

113
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:18,790
Yun Que.

114
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,300
Yun Que?

115
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,260
On the ring Miss Yun carries around,

116
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,520
there's also a Yun Que.

117
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,380
Oh no.

118
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,360
My necklace!

119
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,150
Are you sure the person who the guardian saw

120
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,179
was Elder Yue?

121
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,270
No.

122
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,080
He said that person was wearing a plain robe

123
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,830
and there was a faint cloud pattern on his hem.

124
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,010
Deep yearning and a myriad of emotions.

125
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,030
I'll wait for you at the Yu residence.

126
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,060
Deep yearning and a myriad of emotions.

127
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,920
Walk out of the West Pavilion and speak with words.

128
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,220
I'll wait for you at the Yu residence.

129
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,870
She has an appointment with Elder Yue.

130
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,470
[Jue]

131
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,540
This is what a servant should do.

132
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,290
Miss Shangguan.

133
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,870
Don’t bother.

134
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,940
How did you know it's me?

135
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
Everyone's gait in terms of rhythm,

136
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,300
heaviness and pace,

137
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,550
scent,

138
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,880
and breathing,

139
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,940
are different.

140
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,820
You must have trained before.

141
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,440
When I was in the Gushan Sect,

142
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,160
I learned some basic martial arts skills from my father.

143
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,110
As for the kind of training

144
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,400
that you're talking about,

145
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,340
I haven't experienced that.

146
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,640
Are you fully recovered?

147
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,040
I think all the wounds have healed.

148
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
There wasn't much scarring either.

149
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,250
Young Master.

150
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,210
Do you want to take a look?

151
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,410
I won't disturb you then.

152
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,390
This hot spring bath

153
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,210
is good for healing the skin.

154
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,460
Do you want to try it?

155
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,300
Miss Yun.

156
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,230
We're preparing the soothing and insect-repelling incense

157
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,430
for after lights out.

158
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,580
Why are you here?

159
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,960
Lord Sword Wielder and I just came back from the mountain.

160
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,000
The Yue residence has a high level of water vapor and is cold and humid.

161
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,500
Add some Chinese mugwort in the incense tonight

162
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,960
to get rid of the humidity.

163
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,200
These incense will be hung outside.

164
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
I'm afraid it won't be effective.

165
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
Why don't we just add some Chinese mugwort incense

166
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,310
directly in the Sword Wielder's room?

167
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:42,940
Hmm...

168
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,730
That's fine too.

169
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,870
Go get some Chinese mugwort from the storehouse.

170
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:48,940
Yes.

171
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,320
You should go along too.

172
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,560
Get more.

173
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,640
Put a pot of it in my room too.

174
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,460
Yes.

175
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,130
It's so late

176
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,540
and he didn't even bring a lantern.

177
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,140
He even brought so many guardians equipped with sabers with him.

178
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,500
Where is Jin Fan going?

179
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,140
The Yu residence?

180
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,420
It's his territory.

181
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,040
Why is he sneaking around?

182
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:31,580
Incense?

183
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,840
As expected, you really understood that poem.

184
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,030
Deep yearning and a myriad of emotions.

185
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,040
Using this to ask me out,

186
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,080
what is it you want to ask?

187
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,010
Why do you have Yun Que's bracelet?

188
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,180
You know Yun Que?

189
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,690
Your foster sister...

190
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,030
is the person I love.

191
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,020
Yun Que once told me about you.

192
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,700
She said that you are the only person

193
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,510
that's nice to her in this world.

194
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,690
She showed me your portrait.

195
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,240
So,

196
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,910
I recognized you

197
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,200
the first time we met.

198
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,010
Since you knew I'm from Wufeng,

199
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,480
why did you use fake truth grass

200
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,890
to help me out secretly?

201
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,900
How did Yun Que die?

202
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,460
Was Yun Que killed by the Gong family?

203
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,100
Sword Wielder.

204
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,230
You're from Wufeng.

205
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,650
Don't talk to me.

206
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,440
How dare you attack me?

207
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,830
This is insubordination.

208
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,980
How bold of you!

209
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,770
As a guardian of the Yu residence,

210
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,730
it's my duty.

211
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,760
How are you not poisoned by the poison of the incense?

212
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,690
You did take the Herb Elixir indeed.

213
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,220
How could a mere Green Jade Guardian

214
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,720
have the right to obtain the Herb Elixir?

215
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,790
I knew you were suspicious.

216
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,150
This time, old and new grudges

217
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,450
will be accounted for together.

218
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,510
I'm afraid the roof of the Yu residence

219
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,620
will be overturned this time.

220
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,260
This is the outfit you chose.

221
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,110
Do I look good?

222
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,310
I'm not looking at the clothes.

223
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,790
Actually,

224
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,590
I came here late at night

225
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,620
to ask you for a favor.

226
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,590
What do you want?

227
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,420
Please help me take my revenge.

228
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,390
Who is your enemy?

229
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,610
Dianzhu from Qingfeng Sect.

230
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,050
You took on someone else's identity and sneaked into the Gong residence.

231
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,510
Despite numerous crises,

232
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,460
you've always managed to turn them around.

233
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,830
With your intelligence and capability,

234
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,570
why don't you take revenge yourself?

235
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,120
I tried.

236
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,510
More than once.

237
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,090
It seems that the results were unsatisfactory.

238
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,620
Our Shangguan family is a family of medicine.

239
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,210
We know a lot about poison.

240
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,070
I've received almost all the poisons

241
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,460
that came from the Gong residence into the martial world.

242
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,450
And I know

243
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,230
that your most powerful poisons and hidden weapons

244
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,020
are always for personal use

245
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,250
and never for sale.

246
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,380
That's true.

247
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,600
You have a poison

248
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,040
called Ascension.

249
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,970
I used it as the base

250
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,280
for other potent poisons to be mixed in

251
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,750
such that it's incurable.

252
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,440
In the Martial World Assembly two years ago,

253
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,100
I disguised myself to blend in

254
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,270
and secretly put poison

255
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,370
in Dianzhu's food.

256
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,500
Two years ago, the incident of Dianzhu being poisoned by a strange poison

257
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,570
shocked the world.

258
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,450
It was actually you.

259
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,290
It was me.

260
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,720
After that,

261
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,940
I've been waiting

262
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,140
for the news of Dianzhu's death to spread in the martial world.

263
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,740
I waited for more than a month

264
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,120
but Dianzhu actually reappeared unscathed.

265
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,160
I really couldn't understand.

266
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,920
If he was poisoned by Ascension,

267
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,670
unless he had the exclusive antidote from the Gong family,

268
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,310
he

269
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,610
should have died.

270
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,700
Not to mention

271
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,440
how you had mixed in so many other potent poisons.

272
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,680
Even a deity couldn't have saved him.

273
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,300
Unless...

274
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,240
Unless right after Dianzhu got poisoned,

275
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,570
he took the Gong family's secret medicine

276
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,730
and panacea, the Herb Elixir.

277
00:22:59,270 --> 00:22:59,880
Elder Yue.

278
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,950
You are a high-ranking member of the Gong family.

279
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,880
Why did you betray the Gong family?

280
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,680
Lord Sword Wielder.

281
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,730
Since I was born,

282
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,430
I've been living deep in the back hill.

283
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,990
I've never wandered around the martial world.

284
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,720
I can't be a person from Wufeng.

285
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,200
I have no intention to hurt the Gong family.

286
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,150
But indeed,

287
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,770
I did help Wufeng.

288
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,360
About what happened,

289
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,870
as long as you're willing to listen,

290
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,300
I'll tell you everything.

291
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:40,700
Say it.

292
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,180
Two years ago,

293
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,900
Wufeng sent someone to sneak into the Gong residence

294
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,830
and tried to steal the Herb Elixir.

295
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,420
Do you remember that?

296
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,520
Of course.

297
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:56,660
That person

298
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,580
was Yun Que.

299
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,640
Enter the Gong residence?

300
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,120
Yes.

301
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,030
It's not that easy.

302
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,970
The container used to transport herbs in the Gong residence is very small.

303
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,230
It can't hide a person.

304
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,550
But you're an exception.

305
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,560
The Muscle Shrinking Technique you practice

306
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,490
can shrink your muscles and bones.

307
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,110
It must be you.

308
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,910
Young Master.

309
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,060
Here's the seashell powder you asked for.

310
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,430
Chuyun Chonglian

311
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,390
has always only existed as in legends.

312
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,880
I didn't expect you'd succeed in cultivating it.

313
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,270
Chuyun Chonglian has been extinct for years.

314
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,880
Only in the thick freezing soil back then

315
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,020
are there still seedlings that were scattered.

316
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,150
I've sent people to look for them for years,

317
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,550
but I've only found a few.

318
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,210
It was tended to for a long time

319
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:07,270
before a flower has finally bloomed.

320
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:08,460
You just said that Gong Yuanzhi

321
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,080
successfully cultivated the Chuyun Chonglian.

322
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,140
Are you lying to me?

323
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,330
No.

324
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,160
I knew you'd be interested.

325
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,290
The already extinct magical flower

326
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,370
has really been successfully cultivated.

327
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,500
He must have put a lot of effort into it.

328
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,170
No wonder they keep saying

329
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,390
that a rare herb genius has appeared

330
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,590
in the front hill of the Gong residence.

331
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,650
I'd like to see the Chuyun Chonglian.

332
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,940
I also want to meet this young Young Master Yuanzhi.

333
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,800
You can't go.

334
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,630
According to the rules,

335
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:40,290
we can't leave the back hill even for a step.

336
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,750
You are so bad.

337
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,930
You said something that made him itch

338
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,690
and yet forbid him to leave the back hill.

339
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:47,770
I'm just honest.

340
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,460
I'm just speaking facts.

341
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,500
Aren't you busy with your research of Drunk Blood?

342
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,670
Why do you still have the time to care about the front hill's matters?

343
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,490
In my opinion,

344
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,050
the Gong residence is the Gong residence.

345
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,050
We should be allowed to go wherever, be it the front hill or the back hill.

346
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,180
[Clinic]

347
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,470
After Yun Que's whereabouts were exposed,

348
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,020
she was immediately

349
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,550
encircled and pursued by everyone from the front hill of the Gong residence.

350
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,760
That was the night

351
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,240
I met Yun Que.

352
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,750
That night was the first time I disobeyed the ancestral precept

353
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,550
and sneaked out of the back hill.

354
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,710
I was going to take a look

355
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,640
at the Chuyun Chonglian cultivated by Gong Yuanzhi.

356
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:33,380
But I ended up running into Yun Que.

357
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,700
It was the first time I saw the outside world,

358
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,490
and I was curious and kind about everything.

359
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,730
Back then, I didn't know

360
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,830
who that injured girl was.

361
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,710
So I brought the unconscious Yun Que

362
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,960
directly back to the back hill.

363
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,770
Did the Wufeng sneak into the Gong residence two years ago

364
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,450
to help Dianzhu steal the Herb Elixir?

365
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,940
That's exactly the same time.

366
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,800
Although Qingfeng Sect has surrendered to Wufeng,

367
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,150
it's just Dianzhu.

368
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,790
Wufeng wouldn't have gone to such great lengths to steal medicine for her.

369
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,070
Unless Dianzhu has a special identity.

370
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,020
Otherwise,

371
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:26,120
Wufeng wouldn't have provoked the Gong family that easily.

372
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,390
You're back.

373
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:37,680
Yes.

374
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,890
You went to see Dianzhu this time.

375
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,690
How is she?

376
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,130
The chief is severely poisoned.

377
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,660
She can only suppress the poison with her internal skill for now.

378
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,390
I don't think she'll last long.

379
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,900
I came back

380
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,700
to attend the Chief Assembly on behalf of my chief.

381
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,160
Have you found the person who poisoned her?

382
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,580
Chief suspects

383
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,490
Zhuo Mei.

384
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,520
The Chief Assembly is held every half a month

385
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,580
and there had never been an omission.

386
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,880
But it was cancelled for no reason that time.

387
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,220
After Elder Yue scolded me harshly,

388
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:34,800
he handed Yun Que

389
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,220
over to the former Sword Wielder to be dealt with.

390
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,390
So my foster sister

391
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,300
was really killed by the Gong family?

392
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,390
No.

393
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,370
At that time,

394
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,860
I was researching the anesthetic Drunk Blood.

395
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,980
So I proposed to Elder Yue

396
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,190
and asked if I could use Yun Que

397
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,550
as a medicine tester

398
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,200
to test the medicine in the Yue residence.

399
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,260
I know you think it's cruel.

400
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,210
But if I didn't do that,

401
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,110
Yun Que might have died that night.

402
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:23,880
Who are you?

403
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,820
Don't waste your energy.

404
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,110
What did you do to me?

405
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,340
Why is my internal skill depleted?

406
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,290
Don't move.

407
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,130
Don't try to use your power.

408
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,900
It's not good for your health.

409
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,540
Since you've caught me,

410
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,190
I don't want to live either.

411
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,490
Kill me if you want.

412
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,940
It's useless to say more.

413
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,220
We're not Wufeng.

414
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,030
We're not that cruel.

415
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,820
You're from the Gong residence.

416
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,020
How dare you say that?

417
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,170
What's wrong with people from the Gong residence?

418
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,610
Have you never left the Gong residence before?

419
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,450
In the martial world,

420
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,900
everyone regards the people of the Gong residence

421
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,100
as fierce and evil,

422
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,630
and avoid them at all costs.

423
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,000
Is that so?

424
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,400
What place is this?

425
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,070
It's a safe

426
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,200
but also dangerous place.

427
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,100
What is this?

428
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,570
What else could it be?

429
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,170
Medicine.

430
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,690
As the last resort,

431
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,720
you have to take your own life.

432
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:43,780
Are you trying to kill yourself by biting your tongue?

433
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,790
I disregarded my health

434
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,970
and researched all kinds of detoxification methods

435
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,740
and finally snatched you back from the depths of Hell.

436
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,640
I hate people

437
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,430
who don't cherish their lives the most.

438
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,600
The dead won't suffer.

439
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,910
The pain is left to those who will grieve for you.

440
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,170
Those who seek death are cowards.

441
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,680
Because they're transferring their pain

442
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,940
to those who love them.

443
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,900
Sister.

444
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,860
I'm here.

445
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,350
I'm leaving tomorrow.

446
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:39,840
I know.

447
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,250
Don’t listen to Hanya Si.

448
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,430
Even if the mission fails,

449
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,970
you must find a way to survive.

450
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,699
I told the Sword Wielder

451
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,340
to make you my medicine tester

452
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,800
to help me test my medicine

453
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,380
so as to save your life.

454
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,889
What medicine do you want to test on me?

455
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:26,860
The Drunk Blood.

456
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:28,440
A poison?

457
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,480
No.

458
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:33,340
It's an anesthetic that relieves pain.

459
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,060
I like making antidotes

460
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,639
and saving people.

461
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,290
There are enough people in the Gong residence who can make poison.

462
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,290
They can do without one more like me.

463
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:53,100
So I won't die from drinking it?

464
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:54,940
No, you won't.

465
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:58,280
But

466
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,980
you'll suffer.

467
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,440
I'm not even afraid of death.

468
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,890
Why would I be afraid of suffering?

469
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,850
Don't keep mentioning death.

470
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,910
You must live on well.

471
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,020
Don’t listen to Hanya Si.

472
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,930
Even if the mission fails,

473
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,460
you must find a way to survive.

474
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,560
You're awake.

475
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,500
A few days ago, after taking the medicine,

476
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,830
your muscles became tense and you lost your consciousness.

477
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,900
I felt your pulse

478
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,940
and realized it was chaotic.

479
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,390
At first, I didn't know the reason.

480
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,430
Then I guessed

481
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,650
that it was because you were forced

482
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,000
to practice the Muscle Shrinking Technique since you were little.

483
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,900
You were often confined in narrow spaces over a long period of time,

484
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,430
so you felt claustrophobic

485
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,630
in a confined space.

486
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:42,900
So

487
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,750
I moved you out of the room.

488
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,940
I'm just your medicine tester.

489
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,540
You don't have to care for me.

490
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,560
I need my medicine tester to be healthy

491
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,270
in order to test my medicine.

492
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,810
I'm just your tool.

493
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,570
I'm outside,

494
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,410
but I'll still be tortured by you.

495
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,670
There's a difference.

496
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,690
When I'm torturing you,

497
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,620
I'll be happier.

498
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,950
I didn't know what you like to eat,

499
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,150
so I just brought what I like.

500
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,490
Does it suit your tastes?

501
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:49,630
No.

502
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,310
That's too bad.

503
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,030
You just have to eat

504
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,930
whatever I eat.

505
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,010
Then why are you asking?

506
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,860
I just wanted to be polite to you.

507
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,270
After all, I'm a knowledgeable and sensible person.

508
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,400
If you don't like it,

509
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,090
I can change my style.

510
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,590
It's not poisonous.

511
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,220
Look.

512
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:30,910
You...

513
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:32,490
It tastes good.

514
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,850
I won't eat it even if it's not poisonous.

515
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,670
If you want to protest with a hunger strike,

516
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,000
then I can only mash up the food and feed you

517
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,690
like how I treat cats and dogs.

518
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,440
Do you like this style?

519
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:56,110
A medicine tester is worse off than a cat or dog.

520
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,200
Cats are much more obedient than you.

521
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,270
What did you say?

522
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:00,590
I said

523
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,300
that this is really delicious.

524
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:02,920
Try it.

525
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,120
I'm just a medicine tester.

526
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,850
Why do you care so much about me?

527
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,760
Have you ever raised a pig?

528
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,460
They have to be fed well

529
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,770
before they can become pork rib soup.

530
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,180
You...

531
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,120
So you think it's dirty to use the chopsticks I've used.

532
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,570
I didn't think too much about it at first.

533
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,720
I planned to continue using her to test my medicine

534
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,900
after she recovered.

535
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:17,430
But after spending a long time together,

536
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,250
I gradually grew

537
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,070
to feel differently towards Yun Que.

538
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,580
Why did you join Wufeng

539
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,180
and become an assassin?

540
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:12,760
Most people who join Wufeng

541
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,360
don't know their origins

542
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,780
and don't know where to go.

543
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,430
A person who drifts around

544
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,780
has a life like withered grass.

545
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,560
They're usually orphans who have lost their parents when they were young

546
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,730
and were taken in by Wufeng,

547
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,660
and became used to obeying orders.

548
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:36,900
Or they bear grudges

549
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,310
that they can't reconcile with,

550
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:43,230
so they want to take revenge with the help of the powerful Wufeng.

551
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,630
Which type are you?

552
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,390
Do you know what a coffin-born baby is?

553
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,640
It's a baby who was born in the coffin

554
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,990
of a deceased pregnant woman.

555
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:03,810
That's right.

556
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,160
I'm a coffin-born baby.

557
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,870
An old beggar found me

558
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,730
and saved me by getting me out

559
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,130
and raised me.

560
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,820
I called him Grandpa.

561
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,310
One year on New Year's Eve,

562
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,350
Grandpa saw some cold buns

563
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,420
at the entrance of a tavern

564
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,490
and wanted to give them to me.

565
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:43,710
But he was regarded as a thief

566
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,260
and beaten to death by some thugs in the tavern.

567
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,550
At that time,

568
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:57,380
I was biting onto the thug's hand with all my might.

569
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,550
He called me a dog

570
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,950
and beat me up so badly that I was bleeding from my head.

571
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,100
But I didn't let go.

572
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,400
Later,

573
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,050
while I was barely breathing on the streets,

574
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:17,650
someone from Wufeng saved me

575
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,680
and took me back.

576
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,010
That year,

577
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,390
I was seven.

578
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,590
In Wufeng,

579
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:37,980
I was obedient,

580
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:39,310
never rebelled,

581
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,860
and made myself stronger.

582
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,480
Only by being competitive

583
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,240
was I able to survive in that dark place.

584
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,830
I just wanted to stay alive.

585
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,670
You're no longer in Wufeng.

586
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,810
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

587
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,140
I won't be able to escape.

588
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,580
Wufeng has a medicine

589
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,550
called Fortnight Flies.

590
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,790
That was when

591
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,550
I found out that the Fortnight Flies that Wufeng uses

592
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,120
is the secret medicine specially made by the Gong family,

593
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,580
the Heart Devouring Moon.

594
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:53,170
Wufeng created the Fortnight Flies

595
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,190
by modifying it to a certain degree,

596
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:55,900
removing

597
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,650
the poisonous element that forms a black line on the wrist,

598
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,910
such that it became more inconspicuous.

599
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,300
Although I don't know

600
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:02,980
how Wufeng

601
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,840
got the prescription for the Heart Devouring Moon,

602
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,220
after I finished studying the Death Oath pill

603
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:11,060
that Yun Que gave me,

604
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,460
I was sure

605
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,390
that that's the modified version of the Heart Devouring Moon.

606
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:59,250
At first,

607
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:01,100
Yun Que didn't trust me.

608
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,970
It was only until I accompanied her

609
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,830
through the most painful period of the Heart Devouring Moon's attack

610
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,880
and her internal skill was increasing day by day

611
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:15,850
that she finally trusted me.

612
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,360
She told me

613
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,810
that that was her first time

614
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,130
she thought that she might be able to get out of Wufeng for good.

615
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,360
Did you leave this piece of paper

616
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,550
[I O U]

617
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,410
on the desk?

618
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,670
You want to thank me,

619
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:05,440
but you're too shy to say it.

620
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,890
So you gave me this word riddle?

621
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,260
I, O, U.

622
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,240
That sounds like "I owe you".

623
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:14,960
You're thanking me.

624
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:20,860
In Wufeng,

625
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,980
amidst the endless cruel training,

626
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:26,600
my only joy every day

627
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,230
was playing word riddles with my sister.

628
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,190
Your sister?

629
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,520
We met at Wufeng.

630
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,380
She took me as her foster sister.

631
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,260
I remember when I wanted to kill myself,

632
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,370
you said that I was cowardly.

633
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,480
That by dying,

634
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,170
I'm just transferring my pain to those who will grieve for me.

635
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,240
At that time, the person I thought of

636
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,220
was my sister.

637
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:05,820
She has no family.

638
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,550
Neither do I.

639
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:09,890
Then, I was thinking

640
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:11,850
that if I died,

641
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:14,900
my sister would be alone

642
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,840
and really sad.

643
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,280
That's why

644
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,640
I chose to be your medicine tester.

645
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,800
You're in the Gong residence now.

646
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,240
You're safe.

647
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:34,950
I can't stay here.

648
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,920
You don't like...

649
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,500
You don't like this place?

650
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,420
You're right.

651
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,130
Having heard the numerous stories about your life in the martial world,

652
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,190
I also yearn for it.

653
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,380
I've been in this back hill since I was born.

654
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,650
The days here

655
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,610
are indeed boring.

656
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:08,780
I understand.

657
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:11,380
No.

658
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,640
I like this place.

659
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,820
If possible,

660
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,230
I'm willing to stay here forever.

661
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,110
Then stay.

662
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,440
Stay here for the rest of your life.

663
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,090
You don't know Wufeng.

664
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,870
If I stay,

665
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,040
it will only bring you disaster.

666
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,650
I came here this time

667
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,200
not only to steal the Herb Elixir,

668
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,400
but also for another mission.

669
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,700
What is it?

670
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,240
To look for Anonymous.

671
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:01,560
Anonymous?

672
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,000
Anonymous is a Mei, who Wufeng hasn't heard from

673
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,930
since they entered the Gong residence ten years ago.

674
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:11,960
Wufeng won't let anyone

675
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,900
who knows its inner workings to leave the organization.

676
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,900
So they sent me here to look for them.

677
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,820
If I stay,

678
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,670
Wufeng will also

679
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,620
keep sending assassins

680
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:25,450
to the Gong residence to look for me.

681
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:26,870
Regardless of if I'm dead or alive,

682
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:28,200
they have to confirm it.

683
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,080
Until then, the Gong residence will never be peaceful.

684
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:35,870
It was also at that time

685
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,200
that I said something

686
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,090
that I regret the most in my life.

687
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,300
What if

688
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,640
we just let them witness a corpse?

689
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:01,300
What happened

690
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,080
to that Wufeng assassin after that?

691
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,850
She was used as a medicine tester

692
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,850
and died soon after.

693
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,670
In order to threaten Wufeng,

694
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:16,850
so that they won't

695
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:20,530
easily sneak people into the Gong residence again,

696
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,380
her corpse was hung on the city gate

697
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:30,600
and exposed to the sun for three days and nights.

698
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,740
I told Yun Que

699
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,700
that the winter cicada grass I developed

700
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:40,750
could turn a person into

701
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:43,210
a state like a hibernating insect in winter.

702
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,670
Your breathing and heartbeat

703
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:46,760
are inhibited,

704
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:49,600
and your skin turns completely pale.

705
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,000
It's akin to a fake death.

706
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,220
Later,

707
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:58,190
I proposed to Elder Yue and the Sword Wielder

708
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:01,430
to hang Yun Que's corpse

709
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,500
on the Gong residence's city gate wall

710
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,080
as a demonstration to Wufeng.

711
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,880
The Sword Wielder agreed to my request.

712
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,260
Drink this.

713
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,470
This medicine is so sweet.

714
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,420
This is the elixir I made

715
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,020
with golden cicadas

716
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:43,660
and the Snow Lotus Germ I asked Xue Chongzi for.

717
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,730
It can guarantee that

718
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,370
for three days and three nights,

719
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,630
you won't die from starvation or thirst.

720
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,300
Give me your hand.

721
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,000
This ointment

722
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,690
can help reduce the abrasions

723
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:06,290
when you're tied up and hung by a rope.

724
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:08,350
If a scar forms

725
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,920
on such a beautiful hand,

726
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,430
my heart will ache.

727
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,220
Give me your other hand.

728
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,210
My sister gave me that bracelet.

729
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,330
I've never taken it off since I put it on.

730
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:50,690
When you come back,

731
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:52,880
I'll put it on for you again.

732
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,980
I'll ask the Gong residence's

733
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:01,060
best craftsman, Young Master Hua,

734
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,210
to make a new bracelet for you.

735
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:07,170
I'll carve

736
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,560
a crescent moon on it.

737
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:14,650
Okay.

738
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:32,940
Later,

739
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,520
Yun Que's corpse

740
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,600
was hung on the Gong residence's city gate wall.

741
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:38,570
As promised,

742
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,630
on the third night,

743
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,140
I'd bring the corpse down

744
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,230
and fake a burial.

745
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:46,580
Then,

746
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:49,960
Yun Que will no longer exist in this world.

747
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:53,590
Yun Que.

748
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:57,190
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

749
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,140
Then, she can live with me in the Yue residence

750
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,710
for the rest of our lives.

751
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,810
But I didn't expect

752
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,940
that on the third night,

753
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,470
when I went to the city gate tower,

754
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,040
what I wished for

755
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,140
actually came true.

756
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:16,410
What's wrong?

757
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,100
Young Master Yue.

758
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,410
The assassin's corpse

759
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,100
is gone.

760
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,540
In this world,

761
00:55:55,330 --> 00:55:57,590
Yun Que really no longer exists anymore.

762
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:18,500
♫The sun rises in the east and sets in the west♫

763
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:25,540
♫Our parents call us home for dinner♫

764
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:34,680
♫We grew up together♫

765
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:40,670
♫We never wake up from our sweet dreams♫

766
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,280
You're still here.

767
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:48,440
♫Spring brews life, and Winter brews coldness♫

768
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,260
But my Yun Que is gone.

769
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:55,940
♫You're always in my thoughts♫

770
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:03,690
♫Summer is long, and Autumn is brief♫

771
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:10,330
♫I hope we can reunite again♫

772
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,300
After that...

773
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:18,650
I never saw Yun Que again.

774
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,580
I have seen her.

775
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,460
Yun Que's corpse

776
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,860
was sent back to Wufeng.

777
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,400
How did she die?

778
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:46,590
She was killed by the Gong family's exclusive saber technique...

779
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:49,600
in which her skull was smashed up.

780
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,580
Are you sure you want to see it?

781
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:57,480
Her body

782
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,000
was reduced to mush.

783
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,880
Her skull was chopped up.

784
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,470
Elder Yue.

785
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:16,940
On the night my father and brother were killed,

786
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:18,230
did you go to the prison

787
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,270
to look for the Wufeng assassin

788
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:22,640
to find out about Yun Que?

789
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:35,660
Then, I heard from the assassin

790
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:39,990
that Yun Que was already dead.

791
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:43,600
As you said,

792
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:47,660
she...

793
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:52,770
She was killed by having her skull smashed.

794
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,530
So, was Yun Que killed by the Gong family?

795
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:00,170
The people of the Gong residence

796
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:02,470
wouldn't have killed Yun Que.

797
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:07,480
I think when Wufeng retrieved Yun Que's corpse,

798
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:11,580
they found out the secret of Yun Que's fake death.

799
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:29,950
What's wrong?

800
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:32,430
Is something bothering you?

801
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:39,060
I just thought of an old friend who passed away.

802
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,850
Today is her death anniversary.

803
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,250
You did a good job in this mission.

804
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,250
As a Chi,

805
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:31,890
not only did you sneak into the Gong residence and get the Herb Elixir,

806
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,840
but you also escaped unscathed.

807
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,160
You're the first one to do so in all these years.

808
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,800
Although when we retrieved your body,

809
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,470
we thought you were dead.

810
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,060
You've suffered.

811
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:52,740
To complete my mission,

812
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,400
any amount of suffering is worth it.

813
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:29,850
Feigning death by taking medicine.

814
01:03:29,870 --> 01:03:31,660
You lied and put on a show.

815
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,460
How ridiculous.

816
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,480
Hanya Si.

817
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:37,960
Carry her body down.

818
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:40,230
Tell Yun Weishan

819
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,830
the Gong family killed her.

820
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:48,230
Yes.

821
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:00,690
It's all your fault!

822
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:03,590
It's all your fault!

823
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:05,960
It's all your fault!

824
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,450
It's all your fault!

825
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,430
It's all your fault!

826
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,390
You killed her!

827
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,500
How did this happen?

828
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:29,510
It's all your fault!
