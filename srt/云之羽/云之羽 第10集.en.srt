[Episode 10]

4
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,210
Miss Yun Weishan,

5
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,030
what can I do for you?

6
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,330
I want to ask you...

7
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,740
if you lost something.

8
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,420
How do you know I lost something?

9
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,620
Did you steal it?

10
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,100
Speak.

11
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,540
Anonymous.

12
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,120
What did you say?

13
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:18,829
You have...

14
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,110
no evidence.

15
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,890
I said you have no evidence.

16
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,270
Why would you say that?

17
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,110
If you didn't steal it,

18
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,310
how did you know

19
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,310
I lost something.

20
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,950
It's Jin Fan and Gong Yuanzhi.

21
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,440
Jin Fan and Gong Yuanzhi

22
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,620
fought from your room to the lineage.

23
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,160
Jin Fan loudly scolded

24
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,780
Gong Yuanzhi for stealing something from you.

25
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,280
The servants all heard it.

26
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,690
Although I haven't been in the Gong family for long,

27
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,650
I can see

28
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,020
there's been some conflict between Jue Lineage and Yu Lineage.

29
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,580
This time,

30
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,470
Gong Yuanzhi broke into your room,

31
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,850
probably with no good intentions.

32
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,480
This is an internal matter of the Gong family.

33
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,890
It has nothing to do with you.

34
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,560
Don't make too many guesses about it.

35
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,670
Your Ladyship,

36
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,560
since I entered the Yu Lineage,

37
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,520
and will be the Sword Wielder's wife in the future,

38
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,980
the Sword Wielder and I

39
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,310
will share weal

40
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,780
and woe.

41
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,540
How does Gong Zhiyuan

42
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,530
stealing something from my room

43
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,329
have anything to do with the Sword Wielder?

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,310
You think...

45
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,600
quite deeply.

46
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,450
Does it really have nothing to do with the Sword Wielder?

47
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,010
Their fight was no child's play.

48
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,860
Their moves were strong.

49
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,590
Both of them were injured.

50
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,350
Gong Yuanzhi aside,

51
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,390
Jin Fan tried so hard to protect it,

52
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,570
it has to have something to do with the Sword Wielder.

53
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,070
How observant.

54
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,029
What Gong Yuanzhi stole

55
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,570
is indeed something

56
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,890
that can threaten Ziyu's position as a Sword Wielder.

57
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,150
It has something to do with the Sword Wielder's background.

58
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,950
You also believed those rumors?

59
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,380
For Gong Ziyu,

60
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,800
you're willing to risk anything, right?

61
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,370
Yes.

62
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,240
The thing I lost

63
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,720
was the medical record of Ziyu's mother,

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Lady Lan, during her pregnancy.

65
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,510
This medical record

66
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,370
shall be kept with me for now.

67
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,860
I don't believe that Gong Yuanzhi

68
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,270
will still dare to come steal it.

69
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,550
I'm not afraid of Gong Yuanzhi.

70
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,690
We can fight again.

71
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,790
What I fear is...

72
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,320
Gong Shangjue.

73
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:27,940
And you.

74
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,990
Let me keep it.

75
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,230
What are you talking about?

76
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,850
You don't trust me?

77
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,350
All these years, I've been loyal to youâ€“

78
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,260
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

79
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:46,780
Oh?

80
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:53,570
Oh?

81
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:55,860
Leave it with me.

82
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,800
Even if there's danger,

83
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,280
let me handle it.

84
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,610
Gosh... Gosh...

85
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,510
Young Master Shangjue.

86
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,270
After moving in,

87
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,470
I've been trying to think of ways

88
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,480
to make you happy.

89
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,450
I did many things

90
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,530
that you didn't like.

91
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,190
But I really want

92
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,490
to help you.

93
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:38,990
That way,

94
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,710
I can live up to my status.

95
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,430
Your status?

96
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,310
How arrogant.

97
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,440
Just now,

98
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,650
I heard Jin Fan

99
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,340
snatched something from Young Master Yuanzhi.

100
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,620
If this thing

101
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,850
is very important,

102
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,290
he will definitely carry it on him.

103
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,800
Jin Fan will be wary of Young Master Yuanzhi,

104
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,730
but not me.

105
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,130
If you fail,

106
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,500
the consequences won't be as simple as you think.

107
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,430
I'll do anything

108
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,950
for you.

109
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,640
You care so much?

110
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,900
The fate of one's husband

111
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,580
is more important than heaven.

112
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,310
No?

113
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,010
Good tea.

114
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,470
The thing you're going to get

115
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,500
is half a medical record.

116
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,820
As to its content and purpose,

117
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,670
don't ask what you shouldn't ask,

118
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,909
and don't read what you shouldn't.

119
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,770
Understand?

120
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,530
Yes.

121
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,800
You seem worried.

122
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
I'm worried that he's acting tough.

123
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,560
He's afraid of cold.

124
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,540
He has been spoiled since he was young too.

125
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,390
He can't bear hardships.

126
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,560
Perhaps,

127
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,430
just a small dip into the water

128
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,860
will get him resurfacing while screaming.

129
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,080
With his personality,

130
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,810
he can't stand this test.

131
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,030
Really?

132
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,090
My thoughts are the opposite of yours.

133
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,050
Maybe,

134
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,340
he was indeed

135
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,030
a playboy who loafed around.

136
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,210
But now,

137
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,610
he is persistent about many more things.

138
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,059
Persistence alone is useless.

139
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,700
You have to be capable

140
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,270
to be recognized.

141
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,420
Persistence and capability.

142
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,190
What we want to test

143
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,550
is one of these two, no?

144
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,960
I hope his persistence

145
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,870
is better than his capabilities.

146
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,940
Are you referring to

147
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,080
two people?

148
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,100
That Gong Ziyu's persistence

149
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,690
can overtake Gong Shangjue's capabilities.

150
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,790
So delicate.

151
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,230
You don't deserve to be my son.

152
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,180
Gong Ziyu doesn't deserve to be the Sword Wielder.

153
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,240
In terms of status,

154
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,140
capabilities,

155
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,800
and virtue,

156
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,020
you have nothing.

157
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,440
How can you say

158
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,470
you can take on this position?

159
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,660
Our parents forced us to grow up

160
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,100
because maybe they just hoped that

161
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,140
we can survive in this world safely.

162
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,680
I'll teach you the moves verbally first.

163
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,130
Can you memorize it first?

164
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,740
Okay!

165
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,390
Very well.

166
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,500
Cold air enters the clouds.

167
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,660
Cold air enters the clouds.

168
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,230
The reception and delivery must be controlled

169
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,290
The reception and delivery must be controlled

170
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,590
-Gather in the core.
-Gather in the core.

171
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,230
Snow falls, but the heart does not.

172
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,640
I hope he won't be too persistent.

173
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,380
His perseverance to not give up

174
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,910
will make him persist in diving downwards

175
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,510
until the diversion stream.

176
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,330
Under the diversion will be cold water no more.

177
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,280
It might even be warm and comfortable.

178
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,950
But

179
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,530
he doesn't have strong internal skill

180
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,930
to help control his breathing accurately.

181
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,050
The remaining air in his lungs

182
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,140
is only enough for him to float immediately.

183
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,130
If he persists to

184
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:23,590
continue to dive to the bottom of the pool...

185
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,760
How would he choose?

186
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,220
That's why I said

187
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,580
I hope he won't be too persistent.

188
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,100
The water...

189
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,810
has become warmer.

190
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,530
Should I go up to the surface to ensure my life

191
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,660
or finish the trial?

192
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,960
Sword Wielder,

193
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,900
remember,

194
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,140
don't push yourself.

195
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,190
You're awake.

196
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:43,820
Here.

197
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,050
It's so warm.

198
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,330
This is the clothes you prepared

199
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,660
for me from the luggage.

200
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,190
I just heated it up.

201
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:00,990
I'm curious.

202
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,430
How did you break through the Ice Pool?

203
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,420
â™«The hills become sand with the windâ™«

204
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,790
â™«The river takes me homeâ™«

205
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:25,030
â™«The cloud in the sky doesn't speakâ™«

206
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,940
â™«Where are you, where are you?â™«

207
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,780
â™«How are you?â™«

208
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,860
â™«When the clouds cry, it becomes sunsetâ™«

209
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,990
â™«Look at the sky, flowers bloomâ™«

210
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,630
â™«Can the clouds and soil meet?â™«

211
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,710
â™«Every waveâ™«

212
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,410
â™«Is asking about himâ™«

213
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:07,490
â™«The ground will nurtureâ™«

214
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:11,060
â™«And a pair of wings will growâ™«

215
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,590
â™«Take me to flyâ™«

216
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,050
â™«The clouds and soil are differentâ™«

217
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,370
â™«You always tell me thatâ™«

218
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,040
â™«But in my heartâ™«

219
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,860
â™«There's a little lightâ™«

220
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,900
It's none of your business.

221
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,510
No matter how they passed,

222
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,050
it's their ability.

223
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,180
Are all the secret scriptures at the Xue Lineage all transparent?

224
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,540
I almost died

225
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,070
and you're still lying to me.

226
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,850
Not almost.

227
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,690
If Yun Weishan didn't save you,

228
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,170
you would have died.

229
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,110
So you knew

230
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,630
I only succeeded because we worked together?

231
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,950
Aren't you very strict?

232
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,970
Why are you not abiding by the rules suddenly?

233
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,490
I abided by the rules.

234
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,830
During the trial,

235
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,000
it is not allowed for any outsider to

236
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,660
intervene.

237
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,040
But you did reach the bottom of the water

238
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,050
and got the box.

239
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,250
According to the rules,

240
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,380
as long as you can get the box successfully,

241
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,980
it will be considered a pass.

242
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,240
After you entered the Ice Pool,

243
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,030
he has been by your side,

244
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,300
ready to save you at any time.

245
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:24,850
Wait.

246
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:27,650
I passed...

247
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,120
the trial?

248
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,270
You mean

249
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,330
I passed the trial?

250
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,060
The Thousand-Year Ice Lotus Pool's biting cold,

251
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,450
apart from being able to make the trial taker experience devastation

252
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,810
and consume their internal skill rapidly,

253
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,610
it will also bewitch people's mind due to the cold.

254
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,620
If the person who dived in

255
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,620
is weak mentally,

256
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,260
they will definitely give up halfway.

257
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,260
Only the mentally strong

258
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,120
can stick to their wish

259
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,290
and dive to the bottom of the pool.

260
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,760
Under the cold pool,

261
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,300
are secret ley lines.

262
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,880
So the lower half of the water is warm.

263
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,650
As long as a trial taker is determined

264
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,900
to survive the first half of the biting cold,

265
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,960
they will succeed.

266
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:19,020
Those who waver easily

267
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,120
will return to the water surface in the middle of it.

268
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,170
This trial

269
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,180
is a test of the trial taker's

270
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,780
persistence or capability.

271
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,710
Either one of them

272
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,000
can help them pass this trial.

273
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,650
There is no so-called secret scripture at the bottom of the pool.

274
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,510
The secret scripture is to break through yourself.

275
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,630
You...

276
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:44,960
Don't mention about

277
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,430
how I saved your life.

278
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,080
I mean...

279
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,870
your porridge

280
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,600
is burnt.

281
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,720
It's delicious.

282
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,370
Hey!

283
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,370
Miss Yun prepared that for me.

284
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,440
It's fine.

285
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,640
How stingy.

286
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,500
Miss Yun needs to go back to the front hill tomorrow.

287
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,910
Because there are some things

288
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,510
I have to relay to the Sword Wielder privately.

289
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,950
All right.

290
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,420
[Shang]

291
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:53,860
Gosh.

292
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,470
Ouch!

293
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:54,910
Ouch!

294
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,240
Gosh.

295
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,020
-Hurry.
-Young Master.

296
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,330
Help him.

297
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,380
-Help him.
-What are you doing here?

298
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,920
Gosh. Get up.

299
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,740
It's dirty.

300
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,490
Are you okay?

301
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,400
Thief! Give it back to me.

302
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,980
How could you say that?

303
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,540
You hit me first.

304
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,630
Even if you're not a thief,

305
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,700
you are blind.

306
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,080
Watch where you're going.

307
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,480
Hey.

308
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,350
I'm your sister.

309
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,850
You can't be rude to me.

310
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,460
You're not my sister.

311
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,320
Mother hates you the most.

312
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,190
That's because

313
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,270
your mother is not my mother.

314
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,830
But your father is my father.

315
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,510
So we are still siblings.

316
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,640
But my father said he doesn't like you too.

317
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,750
He only likes me.

318
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,430
Letâ€™s go first.

319
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,230
What kind of Lineage Head is she?

320
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,260
I am the Lineage Head of the Shang Lineage.

321
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,220
When I grow up,

322
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,320
Father will make her return the position to me.

323
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:46,720
Humph.

324
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,380
Ah.

325
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,790
Don't cry.

326
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,780
Let's get up.

327
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,370
I'll take you to the clinic.

328
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,800
Are you satisfied?

329
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,990
About what?

330
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,430
I made him kneel and apologize to you.

331
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,620
So it's you!

332
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,490
You're the best, Xiaohei.

333
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,500
Of course.

334
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,780
I think about

335
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,190
serving you everyday.

336
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,670
But...

337
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,980
You've already forgotten about me recently.

338
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,020
You don't even come look for me to do research.

339
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,590
Sigh.

340
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,850
All you do is chase after that man all day.

341
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,130
His name is Jin Fan, right?

342
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:25,670
Humph.

343
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,960
I'll remember him.

344
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,260
As you can see,

345
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,020
although I am

346
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,910
in charge of everything in the Shang Lineage,

347
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,670
no one takes me seriously.

348
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,100
See,

349
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,460
no matter how good

350
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,990
or powerful the weapon I create is,

351
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,780
my father won't even take another look.

352
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,760
What's the use?

353
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,030
It's better to be good to Jin Fan.

354
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,600
At least

355
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,090
he really loves me.

356
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,020
I don't see it.

357
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,320
I only see you

358
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,380
chasing after him all day long.

359
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,930
What do you know?

360
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:57,840
Gosh.

361
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,830
Eldest Young Miss.

362
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,670
Young Master Ziyu said

363
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,990
this is the hill pear from this year.

364
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,190
He knows you like them

365
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,110
so he asked me to bring you some.

366
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,080
Eldest Young Miss?

367
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,530
Eldest Young Miss.

368
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,630
You have such a high fever.

369
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,540
Why is no one taking care of you?

370
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,250
Where are your servants?

371
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,160
I'll take you to the clinic.

372
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,670
To be honest,

373
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,620
I've recovered.

374
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:32,740
Say no more,

375
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,970
take the medicine.

376
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,460
I can't do as you say.

377
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:36,930
It's not up to you.

378
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,980
My life is horrible. No!

379
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:46,740
Wait for me then.

380
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,640
Just wait for me for a while here.

381
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,530
Do you want your favorite hill pear?

382
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,660
Then take the medicine too

383
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,460
along with it.

384
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,820
It's bitter but sweet.

385
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,050
Sweet but bitter.

386
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,650
Is this

387
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,390
the sweet and bitter

388
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,670
taste of love

389
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,770
they talk about

390
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,040
in romance novels?

391
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,110
Goodbye.

392
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:11,670
Good...

393
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,060
Goodbye.

394
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,710
You're still young.

395
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,540
How do I tell you about it?

396
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,310
The relationship between men and women

397
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,780
can't be explained

398
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,160
in just a few words.

399
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,590
You're talking nonsense again.

400
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,650
I'm older than you.

401
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,980
Your face may be bigger, but everything else is below me.

402
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,120
You're a servant in the kitchen.

403
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,610
If people find out that

404
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,140
you came here to look for me secretly,

405
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,820
you'll be doomed.

406
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,320
You didn't come looking for me

407
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,890
so I can only come look for you.

408
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:10,820
You have no idea.

409
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,900
So many terrible and scary things

410
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,300
happened in the Gong family.

411
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,900
How can I tell you about them?

412
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,180
I am shocked,

413
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,360
worried,

414
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,910
and scared.

415
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,880
Tell me about it slowly.

416
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,790
I'll help you calm down.

417
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,650
All right.

418
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,310
Let me stretch while I talk about it.

419
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,240
Here's what happened.

420
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:55,990
What's wrong?

421
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,660
You look pale.

422
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,870
I just came back from the back hill

423
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,520
and I caught a cold.

424
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,470
What a good time to

425
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,350
catch a cold.

426
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,300
I wish I can catch a cold too.

427
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,230
My internal organs are all burning up.

428
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,950
This painting is so vivid.

429
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,680
If you have the time to do this,

430
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,450
why not spend it on drawing more maps of the Gong residence

431
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,380
and the distribution of the posts?

432
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,480
It's none of your business.

433
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,830
Speaking of,

434
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,820
Gong Ziyu cares so much about you.

435
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,840
You and Jin Fan

436
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,040
should be pretty close too, right?

437
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,030
That has nothing to do with you.

438
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,430
I didn't use to.

439
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,090
But now it does.

440
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,780
I need you to get close to Jin Fan

441
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,060
and take something from him.

442
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,410
I'm unable to help.

443
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,150
Go get it yourself.

444
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,650
Are you unable to help,

445
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,880
or that you don't want to help?

446
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,180
I'm unable,

447
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,200
nor do I want to.

448
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,550
You still

449
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,020
owe me a favor from last time.

450
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,420
What now?

451
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,630
You don't want to pay me back?

452
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,500
I can repay you,

453
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,400
but you're trying to get me killed.

454
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,660
You want me to steal something from Jin Fan.

455
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,260
If it turns out badly, I might even lose my life.

456
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,390
Didn't you just deliver medicine to Gong Yuanzhi?

457
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,270
Then you must know how skilled

458
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,400
Jin Fan is at fighting.

459
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,030
I know.

460
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,900
So Jin Fan is definitely not so simple.

461
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,670
He's too strong

462
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,220
to be

463
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,920
just a Green Jade Guardian.

464
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,070
I've fought him before.

465
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,850
Although I won,

466
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:03,770
but when he fought me,

467
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,200
he didn't even use 30% of his power.

468
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,850
Since he let you win,

469
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,240
isn't it more convenient for you

470
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,420
to steal it?

471
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,060
Shangguan Qian.

472
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,050
Do you think I donâ€™t know what you want?

473
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,350
You are

474
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,390
quite well-informed.

475
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,770
You want that half of Jin Fan's medical record.

476
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:30,920
The thing I lost

477
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,520
was the medical record of Ziyu's mother,

478
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,520
Lady Lan, during her pregnancy.

479
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,720
If I help you steal the medical record,

480
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,790
I'm helping Gong Shangjue

481
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,450
drag Gong Ziyu down from the position of his position as the Sword Wielder.

482
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,050
My mission at the Gong family

483
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,900
will then fail.

484
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,090
I understand now.

485
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,220
Gong Ziyu's background has always been a mystery.

486
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,350
This medical record

487
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,780
can prove that Gong Ziyu is not Gong Hongyu's biological son.

488
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,420
Indeed...

489
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,120
This concerns Gong Ziyu's position as the Sword Wielder.

490
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,449
The thing you need to get

491
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,810
is half a medical record.

492
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,210
As to its content and purpose,

493
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,730
don't ask what you shouldn't ask,

494
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,790
and don't look at what you shouldn't.

495
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,040
I didn't know the content of this medical record.

496
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,130
Thank you for answering my question.

497
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,360
Looks like

498
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,810
all the more I need to get it then.

499
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,050
Stop there.

500
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,780
If you get it,

501
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,860
then I'll lose.

502
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,080
My mission

503
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,440
has a higher priority than yours.

504
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,520
You're but a Chi assassin.

505
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,130
Just lose.

506
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,710
There's no difference in priority

507
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,980
in Wufeng missions.

508
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,710
The same level as me?

509
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,270
No difference in priority?

510
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,880
Chi are pawns to start with.

511
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,250
You'd be lucky

512
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,810
to be able to help me.

513
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,160
Sister Yun.

514
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,180
If you help me succeed,

515
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,660
and I help Gong Shangjue succeed

516
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,370
and gain his trust,

517
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,230
I'll be one step closer to success.

518
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:50,900
After I succeed

519
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,890
and return to Wufeng to receive the reward,

520
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,800
I'll put in a good word for you.

521
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,930
If you don't help me today,

522
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,680
don't blame me for being ruthless.

523
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,310
You're making cakes?

524
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,170
Yes.

525
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,480
Bitter gourd and mulberry?

526
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,980
What kind of combination is this?

527
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,840
Don't get a tummy upset from this.

528
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,060
It's a delicacy from my hometown.

529
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,990
For everyone to try something new.

530
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:39,710
Miss Yun.

531
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,230
Where is the food you left for Guardian Jin?

532
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:43,070
He just came back.

533
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,460
I have to deliver it to him.

534
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,280
It's here.

535
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,230
Wait.

536
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,830
Guardian Jin has been working hard lately.

537
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:58,640
Bring him some cakes.

538
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:00,470
Yes.

539
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,640
Jin Fan was fine.

540
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,550
Why is he suddenly vomiting and having diarrheas?

541
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,200
Right.

542
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,750
I also found it strange.

543
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:20,240
Could he have been poisoned

544
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,980
without knowing when he fought with Young Master Yuanzhi?

545
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,970
I'm so mad.

546
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,730
If anything happens to Jinfan,

547
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,260
I'll go and blow up... Gosh.

548
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,060
I'll go and blow up Zhi Lineage.

549
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,120
Do not be anxious, Eldest Young Miss.

550
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,400
I am so anxious.

551
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,470
But it doesn't matter.

552
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,860
I brought my own Herb Elixir.

553
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,190
Jin Fan can use it later.

554
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,220
Jin Fan!

555
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,380
Are you all right

556
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,100
after being bitten by that poisonous insect?

557
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,280
What are you doing?

558
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:47,930
Ouch!

559
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,690
You have an ulterior motive.

560
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:52,660
I'm really fine.

561
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,640
Nonsense.

562
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,200
How can you be fine?

563
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,060
You vomited.

564
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,260
I've known you for so long,

565
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,610
you haven't even sneezed before.

566
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:04,680
You are the one who got bitten by

567
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,460
Gong Yuanzhi's poisonous insects.

568
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,440
I have to check if you are okay.

569
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,750
That despicable Gong Yuanzhi

570
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:12,220
is full of schemes.

571
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,110
I'm afraid you won't even feel anything

572
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:16,170
when you have been eaten whole by him!

573
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,700
Eldest Young Miss,

574
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,420
please examine him closely.

575
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,180
I'll guard outside.

576
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:23,880
Okay.

577
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,950
Go now.

578
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,730
Go ahead.

579
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,860
What are you doing?

580
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,010
I've seen everything.

581
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,150
He is flawless indeed.

582
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,890
There's no wound at all.

583
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,360
Jin Fan,

584
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,760
your skin is well maintained.

585
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,010
Teach me your ways.

586
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,100
Teach me.

587
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:21,770
I was born with it.

588
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,430
You're being all pretentious

589
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,420
telling me to come out just because

590
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,260
you're changing your clothes.

591
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,160
Don't you run around the guardian camp

592
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,180
without clothes on all the time?

593
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:36,830
Oh no!

594
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,190
The medical record is missing.

595
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,630
What?

596
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,140
By the way,

597
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,910
I didn't tell anyone that

598
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,620
I fought with Gong Yuanzhi.

599
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,880
How do you know I was hurt by Gong Yuanzhi?

600
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,670
Miss Yun said

601
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,880
she saw a poisonous insect biting you

602
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,470
and you vomited and had diarrheas.

603
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,130
So I guessed

604
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,820
you must've been poisoned.

605
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,920
Miss Yun?

606
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,470
Didn't she come with you just now?

607
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:03,570
Yes.

608
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,540
She's guarding the door.

609
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:07,630
Miss Yun.

610
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:08,930
Miss Yun?

611
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,740
If you don't have any other instructions,

612
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,980
Iâ€™ll leave now.

613
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,310
Wait.

614
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:30,650
Do you know how to play?

615
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,370
I know a little.

616
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:36,600
Come.

617
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:54,830
Tell me.

618
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,670
How did you get it?

619
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,540
Through wisdom.

620
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,710
Just like playing chess.

621
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,600
You can't rely on brute force.

622
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,650
But as for brute force,

623
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,980
you're not weak either.

624
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,790
Yuanzhi had fought with you before.

625
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,350
He said you were good.

626
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,950
Young Master Yuanzhi went easy on me.

627
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,500
He used insects to scare me.

628
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,280
He was just pulling my leg.

629
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:27,840
Tell me then,

630
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,770
how did you get it through wisdom?

631
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,360
I canâ€™t approach someone as tricky

632
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,090
as Jin Fan.

633
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,300
Then I can only leave it to

634
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,100
someone who can get close to him.

635
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,020
Gong Zishang?

636
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,690
Yun Weishan.

637
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,840
Yun Weishan and Jin Fan

638
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,810
are so close?

639
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,310
Not that close,

640
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,300
but close enough to get

641
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,880
the medical record.

642
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,180
When did you become close

643
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,690
with Yun Weishan then?

644
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,210
You don't need to be close to someone

645
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,410
to get help from them.

646
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,390
It's enough to just know

647
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:15,320
the secrets they don't want others

648
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,120
to know about.

649
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
Please excuse me.

650
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,130
I told Yun Weishan that

651
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,920
if she doesn't help me,

652
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,970
I will tell Gong Ziyu about

653
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,870
how a guardian

654
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,350
saw her undressed.

655
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,800
If I say a few more words to the narrative,

656
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,410
it'll be hard for Yun Weishan to explain the situation.

657
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,230
This concerns her reputation.

658
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,010
If she still wants to be the Sword Wielder's wife,

659
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,320
she can only help me.

660
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,800
If Yun Weishan is aware that

661
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,590
if she took the medical record for you,

662
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,980
not to mention her status as the Sword Wielder's wife,

663
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,640
even Gong Ziyu's position as the Sword Wielder will be taken away,

664
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,750
she'll probably be so regretful.

665
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,180
Is this

666
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:10,820
related to the position of the Sword Wielder?

667
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,030
You succeeded in helping me with this.

668
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,130
What reward do you want?

669
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:20,860
I dare not.

670
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,720
It's my honor

671
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,400
to help you.

672
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,460
Besides,

673
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,200
I'm just making up for my mistake.

674
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:31,910
That's all.

675
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,530
What mistake did you make?

676
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:45,900
Previously,

677
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,870
when I tried to be smart.

678
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,190
You weren't trying to be smart.

679
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,620
You are smart.

680
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,210
But sometimes,

681
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,020
a wise man can be ruined by their own intelligence.

682
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,590
Don't get carried away.

683
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:12,750
Yes.

684
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:27,980
Thank you.

685
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,740
Yun Weishan.

686
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:04,170
Did you give this box of desserts

687
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:07,690
to Jin Fan?

688
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:09,810
Yes.

689
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,220
What's wrong?

690
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,250
What's wrong?

691
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:14,960
You're a lady. How can you be so shameless?

692
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:19,330
How can you make desserts secretly and send them to Jin Fan?

693
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:20,780
He is an unmarried man.

694
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,400
Can you avoid arousing suspicion? Even I haveâ€“

695
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,170
That's not the point.

696
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:24,750
That's the point.

697
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:26,640
I'm so mad.

698
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:32,900
Mulberry and bitter gourd.

699
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,230
They are both yin foods.

700
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,630
Miss Yun knows medicine well too.

701
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,660
Why would you use these two ingredients as stuffings?

702
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,970
We've gone to the kitchen

703
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,000
to ask the grannies and servants.

704
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,190
They all said

705
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,810
you made the desserts

706
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,610
and put them in Jin Fan's lunch box.

707
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:52,960
Stop denying it.

708
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,830
This is the sweet cakes from my hometown.

709
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:18,960
I've been eating it since I was a child.

710
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,490
I've made some for the Sword Wielder

711
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,750
to bring to the back hill previously too.

712
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,210
He wasn't unwell.

713
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,630
I heard that Guardian Jin was injured

714
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,790
and has a bad appetite,

715
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:31,720
so I wanted to make something that tastes different.

716
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:33,720
I meant well.

717
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:35,610
You misunderstood me.

718
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:40,590
We fought before.

719
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:42,860
The internal skill you cultivated

720
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:43,930
is extremely yin.

721
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,060
Eating yin things

722
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,190
will be fine for you.

723
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:49,780
But what I have cultivated

724
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,080
is extremely yang.

725
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:52,800
It clashes with yin.

726
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,370
Besides, I've already suffered internal injuries.

727
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,910
So you can eat it.

728
00:46:58,810 --> 00:46:59,540
While it will

729
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,460
damage my health.

730
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:02,660
Guardian Jin,

731
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,490
I don't know you well.

732
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:07,260
How would I know

733
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,260
what internal skill you cultivate?

734
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,220
We fought before.

735
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:12,870
Of course you'd know.

736
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,260
Guardian Jin,

737
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:18,310
I've always respected you for your righteousness.

738
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,110
I've always been nice to you too.

739
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,610
But if you are going to be slandering me here and asking questions you know the answers to,

740
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:25,870
I'll just be frank too.

741
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,030
You know very well

742
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,160
if you used your internal skill

743
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,490
when you fought with me.

744
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:34,190
I thought you were going easy on me

745
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,320
because you didn't want me to get hurt.

746
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:38,180
That's why you only use your skills

747
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,780
and not your internal skill.

748
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,020
I even told the Sword Wielder that

749
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,960
you deliberately let me win the bet

750
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:46,580
so that I can go to the back hill to protect him.

751
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,440
But why are you trying to

752
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,900
set me up for now?

753
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,860
You're eloquent.

754
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:55,470
You win.

755
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:58,520
You said the internal skill I practiced is extremely yin.

756
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,130
Fine.

757
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,430
The Snowmelt Heart Sutra that the Sword Wielder practices

758
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:04,490
is an extremely yang internal skill.

759
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,740
Why don't we ask him

760
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,640
when he's back

761
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,890
if he's okay

762
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,440
after eating my desserts?

763
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,290
It's so hard.

764
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,280
Morning.

765
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,470
There are so many

766
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,870
interesting things in Xue Lineage.

767
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,310
The snow lotus is very precious in the front hill.

768
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,540
Even the clinic often runs out of it all the time.

769
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,510
Can I have a few?

770
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:37,090
No.

771
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:39,990
So stingy.

772
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,050
I'm not asking you for the best snow lotus in the Ice Pool.

773
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,880
You're not giving me even the ordinary snow lotus in this lake

774
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,480
and even ate all my desserts.

775
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,140
Desserts can be made easily.

776
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:51,800
This snow lotus

777
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,620
take years for it to bloom.

778
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,700
Who says desserts can be made easily?

779
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:59,410
They are the desserts from Yun's hometown that she made personally.

780
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,940
You canâ€™t buy it with money.

781
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,090
You've passed the first trial.

782
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,630
Can you act a little more like a Sword Wielder?

783
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,720
We're going to teach you the swordsmanship of the Xue Lineage.

784
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,410
[Three Forms of Snow Saber]

785
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,370
I thought you were lying to me.

786
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:22,670
So there really is a saber scripture.

787
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,350
Give me the medical record.

788
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,050
Gong Ziyu treats you so well.

789
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,690
We treat you as our own too.

790
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:34,070
How dare you conspire with outsiders to cheat us?

791
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,650
Don't you feel guilty?

792
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,510
I knew you were not simple when you attempted to

793
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:41,680
approach the Sword Wielder time after time.

794
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,980
But I just thought you were

795
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,810
a bride who was sent into the Gong family

796
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:46,870
trying to climb up the social ladder.

797
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,650
Since you entered the Yu Lineage,

798
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:49,910
we are on the same boat.

799
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,310
As long as you're good to the Sword Wielder,

800
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:54,310
even if you have an ulterior motive,

801
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:56,000
I won't hold it against you.

802
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,110
But I didn't expect that I was wrong about you.

803
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,970
You're just on the same boat,

804
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:02,810
but can't go through the hardships,

805
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:04,470
and only side with the strong.

806
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,770
But Miss Yun,

807
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,930
don't you think it's too hasty to jump ship

808
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,390
before you even see the end line?

809
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:19,370
I don't understand what you're talking about.

810
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,190
Since you aren't going to defend yourself,

811
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,520
then we don't need to waste our breath too.

812
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,280
Let's decide everything

813
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,010
when the Sword Wielder is back.

814
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,150
Before the Sword Wielder is back,

815
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:51,540
no one is allowed to come near

816
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,270
nor anyone is allowed to leave.

817
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:54,410
Yes.

818
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,930
Gong Ziyu has passed the Ice Pool trial.

819
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:17,040
The Xue Lineage approved him of his

820
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,470
determination,

821
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:19,710
focus,

822
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:20,850
strength,

823
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,130
and strong will.

824
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:25,670
Now, we will be passing on the Three Forms of Snow Saber,

825
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:26,830
New Snow,

826
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,030
Air Frost,

827
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,380
and Cold Wave,

828
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,270
to Gong Ziyu...

829
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,100
We hope Gong Ziyu can practice them hard

830
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,680
with the ancestors witnessing it

831
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:38,030
to protect the valley.

832
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:40,910
Although there are only three forms,

833
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:42,440
they are very complicated.

834
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,750
Whether you can master it

835
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,480
depends on your intelligence.

836
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,490
How long will it take?

837
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,380
Not too bad.

838
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,280
I've been learning them for seven years.

839
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,600
Seven years?

840
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,060
You were born afraid of cold,

841
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,800
but because of that,

842
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:03,310
your eight meridians are different from ordinary people.

843
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:04,590
It's perfect for

844
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:05,890
Snowmelt Heart Sutra.

845
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,980
If you can learn the Three Forms of Snow Saber,

846
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,330
you won't be the Sword Wielder just by title,

847
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,330
but without capabilities anymore.

848
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,870
Am I that strong?

849
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:24,910
Oh right.

850
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,140
My brother Gong Huanyu and Gong Shangjue

851
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,470
also passed the test of the Ice Lotus Pool.

852
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:32,530
You said

853
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,730
its a test of either persistence or capabilities.

854
00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:36,730
May I ask

855
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:38,860
how did Gong Shangjue

856
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,140
pass this test?

857
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:43,080
He has both persistence

858
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,540
and capabilities.

859
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:46,520
It's only natural that

860
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:48,680
he passed this test.

861
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,800
He dived to the end of the pool

862
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,180
with his persistence.

863
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:56,210
At the same time, with his strong internal skill,

864
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,470
he controlled his breathing perfectly.

865
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:00,940
After he got the iron box

866
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,560
and emerged from the surface of the pool,

867
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,220
he was still extremely sober,

868
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:07,310
and sustained just some superficial frostbites.

869
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,640
Did you

870
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,260
teach him the Three Forms of Snow Saber?

871
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,260
Did he master it?

872
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,020
We won't know that.

873
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,730
I must learn it

874
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,400
and pay him a visit.

875
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:23,310
I didn't expect

876
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,060
the crybaby

877
00:53:25,350 --> 00:53:26,950
has become the Sword Wielder

878
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:30,540
and took on the responsibility of the Gong family.

879
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,720
You flatter me.

880
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,190
After leaving the back hill that day,

881
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,890
Elder Xue took me home.

882
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,360
Father locked me up for three months

883
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:46,150
and forced me to practice every day.

884
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,300
He had high hopes for you.

885
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:52,710
Yes.

886
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:55,100
I understand now.

887
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,930
Unfortunately,

888
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,720
I only understood it now.

889
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:11,260
Have you ever blamed me?

890
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,870
I never came to look for you

891
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:14,220
since then.

892
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:17,180
I promised

893
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:18,550
to take you to the sea,

894
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:19,950
to view lanterns,

895
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:21,430
and see the desert.

896
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,390
You were still young.

897
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,590
I didn't take your words seriously.

898
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,930
But I was serious.

899
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:34,260
When I secure my position as the Sword Wielder

900
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,990
and the Gong family is at peace,

901
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:38,320
I'll take you out to have a look.

902
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,120
It's so cold at the back hill.

903
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,560
You've been guarding here for so many years.

904
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,370
It must've been lonely.

905
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:54,440
Since I'm the guard of the Xue Lineage,

906
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:57,640
the hustle and bustle of the outside world

907
00:54:57,790 --> 00:54:59,430
has nothing to do with me.

908
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:04,750
Same goes for the Sword Wielder.

909
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:07,310
Since you've taken on the task to guard the Gong family

910
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:09,440
and shoulder the burden of the valley,

911
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,100
you should also have a proper attitude.

912
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,370
The promise you made with me

913
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:16,410
is just a passing remark made by a child.

914
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:18,910
But the promise that the Sword Wielder makes to the Gong family

915
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:20,150
can never be changed

916
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,890
and never taken back.

917
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:25,740
You may have strong emotional attachments

918
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,800
to the Gong family,

919
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,590
but I'm but a nobody

920
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,990
who has been looked down since I was a child.

921
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:36,310
I've seen the women of the Gong family

922
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,110
be trapped for their whole life.

923
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,990
Although they may think they are happy,

924
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,070
they are still birds in cages

925
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,900
and fishes in the pond.

926
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:54,020
I've seen the men of the Gong family,

927
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,980
though they have the ability to fight against Wufeng,

928
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:01,520
they only know how to cower in this corner of a valley

929
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,040
and care only about their own peace,

930
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,150
indifferent to the chaos in the outside world.

931
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:12,760
So...

932
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:17,130
I don't actually have a strong

933
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,550
emotional attachment to the Gong family.

934
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:23,930
You are no longer a 9-year-old child,

935
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,170
but you are still saying nothing but immature things.

936
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,730
Wufeng is strong and complicated.

937
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,260
It's not something

938
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,070
that can be shaken up easily

939
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:37,330
with just a spurt of rashness or passion.

940
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,490
Although the martial world is big,

941
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:42,780
isn't this valley

942
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:46,260
also part of the martial world?

943
00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:48,950
By guarding this corner,

944
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,790
we are also protecting

945
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,520
a glimmer of light and hope for the martial world.

946
00:57:00,030 --> 00:57:02,230
You're overlooking what's important.

947
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:03,730
You see a dead leaf

948
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:06,270
and think the whole tree is withered.

949
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,020
This is narrow-minded.

950
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,250
You have had your prejudice against the Gong family since you were a child.

951
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:14,210
This prejudice

952
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,700
is this dead leaf to you.

953
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,470
Sword Wielder, you must've not

954
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,330
tried to learn more about the Gong family, have you?

955
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,420
Learn more about the Gong family?

956
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:32,050
Did you just

957
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:34,390
call me the Sword Wielder?

958
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:37,550
I told you.

959
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:39,930
If you pass the trial,

960
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,370
you will be the Sword Wielder to me.

961
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:47,950
But

962
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:50,030
I just passed the first trial.

963
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,280
There are two more trials ahead of me.

964
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:54,680
They have nothing to do with me.

965
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,600
In my heart,

966
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,670
you are worthy of the title "Sword Wielder."

967
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:03,560
What about you?

968
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:04,820
He acknowledged you.

969
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,020
Of course I would too.

970
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,380
What's there to ask?

971
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:13,110
I've always wanted to ask...

972
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,570
who among you two

973
00:58:15,710 --> 00:58:17,770
is the guardian of the Snow Hill?

974
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,130
Me, of course.

975
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,140
It took you so long to ask this question.

976
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,670
You're bad at reading the room.

977
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:28,500
The person

978
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,990
you promised to take and see the outside world,

979
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:32,770
to the sea,

980
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,250
to view lanterns,

981
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,850
and see the desert, was also me.

982
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:40,410
Heh.

983
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:42,770
Men can't be trusted.

984
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:50,020
I'm just a servant who grew up with him.

985
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,990
Why else do you think

986
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,500
it took me seven years to learn

987
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,160
the Three Forms of Snow Saber?

988
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:56,140
What about

989
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:56,910
him then?

990
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,050
How long did he take to learn it?

991
00:58:59,050 --> 00:58:59,710
Four years.

992
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:01,780
Four years?

993
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:03,910
That's not fast either.

994
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,920
I thought he was gifted.

995
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:07,990
He spent four years

996
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,460
to create these three forms

997
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,380
to replace the old Snow Saber forms.

998
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:14,770
Gong Ziyu.

999
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,180
You're now the Sword Wielder,

1000
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,260
don't let your father

1001
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,880
down.

1002
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,400
My father

1003
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,380
didn't have high hopes for me.

1004
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,520
He put all his expectations on my brother.

1005
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,160
I became the Sword Wielder

1006
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:41,780
only because of the sudden situation in the Gong family.

1007
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,160
You're wrong.

1008
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:47,860
Your father has devoted himself to you

1009
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:49,480
and had high hopes.

1010
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:51,590
Jin Fan is the proof.

1011
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:54,140
Jin Fan?

1012
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:56,780
Didn't you find it weird?

1013
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:57,990
In the Gong family,

1014
00:59:58,510 --> 00:59:59,840
only the Sword Wielder,

1015
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:00,930
the Lineage Heads,

1016
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:01,770
the Elders,

1017
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,300
as well as the Young Lord in succession

1018
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,310
are qualified to

1019
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,060
have a personal Jade Guardian.

1020
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,550
What was your status before

1021
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,340
that could have allowed Jin Fan

1022
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,740
to follow you around since you were a child?

1023
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,110
Maybe it's because my father

1024
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,500
wanted to arrange a Green Jade Guardian by my side

1025
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,560
to keep an eye on me.

1026
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:21,830
He's afraid that I will bring him troubles outside of the Gong family.

1027
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:24,410
Do you really think an ordinary Green Jade Guardian

1028
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,070
can know the content of the Trial of the Three Realms

1029
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:26,930
to this detail?

1030
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:28,570
What do you mean?

1031
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,710
Those who are in the front hill are all Green Jade Guards.

1032
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:33,450
Those in the Council of Elders

1033
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,460
and the guards in the back hill

1034
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,190
are the Yellow Jade Guardians.

1035
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:38,260
Back then, the former Sword Wielder,

1036
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,720
withstanding the pressure from the elders,

1037
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,310
took great pains to get them to agree to

1038
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:44,640
transferring to Jin Fan to be by your side.

1039
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,950
The former Sword Guardian took your safety

1040
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,470
as seriously as he did with the whole Gong family

1041
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:53,390
and even the whole valley.

1042
01:00:58,130 --> 01:00:58,950
Jin Fan...

1043
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,760
is really a Yellow Jade Guardian?

1044
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:02,840
No.

1045
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,330
He's a Red Jade Guardian.

1046
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:10,090
He is the youngest ever

1047
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:13,810
Red Jade Guardian in Gong family's history.

1048
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:22,280
Are there really Red Jade Guardians?

1049
01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:25,380
I think the elders lied to us.

1050
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,190
Red Jade Guardians,

1051
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:29,920
to me, are just like Nuwa and Fuxi,

1052
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,230
they are just legends.

1053
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,320
Your father asked Jin Fan

1054
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:24,650
to give up his position of

1055
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:26,120
the Red Jade Guardian he achieved painstakingly

1056
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:27,390
through the trials

1057
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,790
to be demoted to the lowest-level Green Jade Guardian

1058
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,720
to serve you since you were a child.

1059
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:34,340
Can't this prove

1060
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:36,670
your father had high hopes for you?

1061
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,300
Come!

1062
01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:40,690
Let's play together!

1063
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:57,540
Guardian Jin.

1064
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,050
You've been guarding for a whole day.

1065
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:00,250
Would you like to eat?

1066
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:05,620
No.

1067
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:14,540
In order to match your top-class guardian,

1068
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:15,990
Gong Ziyu,

1069
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:18,990
you need to be a top-class Sword Wielder too.
