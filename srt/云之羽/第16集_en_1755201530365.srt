[My Journey to You]

3
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,120
[Episode 16]

4
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,110
Do you...

5
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,420
like me?

6
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,530
Young Master Ziyu.

7
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,510
Drink the medicine first.

8
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,500
Otherwise, the hot poison in your body will make you suffer again.

9
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,320
If it weren't for the truth grass,

10
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,890
I might never have

11
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,270
heard your true feelings in this lifetime.

12
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,020
Even without the truth grass,

13
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,850
what I say to you

14
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,079
is always true.

15
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,659
Don't ruin my mortar.

16
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
I’ll compensate you if it’s ruined.

17
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,710
Elder Yue.

18
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,590
Can your truth grass

19
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,650
make mistakes?

20
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,670
What answer do you want to hear?

21
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,240
The truth.

22
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,830
You saved her life several times

23
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,480
and tested the medicine on yourself.

24
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you regret it?

25
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,290
I'm not working hard to develop the antidote

26
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,580
just for her,

27
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,630
but also for myself.

28
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,150
To pass the trial,

29
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,290
become the Sword Wielder,

30
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,909
and protect my people.

31
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,970
Although I don't like Gong Shangjue,

32
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,510
he's right.

33
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,250
If I only care about romance,

34
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,870
and can even risk the lives of my family...

35
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,410
I don't deserve the Sword Wielder title.

36
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,310
Young Master Ziyu, you're young

37
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,470
and thoughtful.

38
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,020
It's the blessing of the Gong family.

39
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,060
But when you have a big heart,

40
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,590
it'll contain many things.

41
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,280
It's inevitable that your heart is heavy.

42
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,020
One's heart

43
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,150
is like a big empty house.

44
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,850
All the wealth and material goods in this world

45
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,010
are not enough to fill it up.

46
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,500
But as long as there is a little light,

47
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,280
just a little light,

48
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,600
it can fill up one's entire heart.

49
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,850
When your heart has brightened up

50
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,080
and become warm,

51
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,890
it wouldn't be heavy anymore.

52
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,560
Do you know how love begins?

53
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,510
Of course.

54
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,730
Love begins

55
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,640
with a little flutter of the heart.

56
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,360
It's always good

57
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,850
for one's heart

58
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,480
to have a little light.

59
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,740
Love begins

60
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,840
with a little flutter of the heart.

61
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,430
You wanted to see me?

62
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,810
Where did you go?

63
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,110
Your body hasn't been detoxified of the poison yet.

64
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,380
If your limbs became paralyzed outside,

65
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,850
no one would know.

66
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:24,760
I saw that you left on your own accord just now.

67
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,190
I thought you didn't want to see me for the time being.

68
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
I didn't say that.

69
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:39,520
I asked you here

70
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,990
to tell you

71
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,960
that I've figured out how to make

72
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,290
the antidote to the Heart Devouring Moon.

73
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:09,910
Elder Yue.

74
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,910
Please have some tea.

75
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,240
I heard

76
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,670
that the antidote has been made.

77
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,060
I'm boiling it right now.

78
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,350
In a while,

79
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,220
you can

80
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,750
check it.

81
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:46,720
Okay.

82
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:08,810
Elder Yue.

83
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:17,730
Elder Yue.

84
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,050
Elder Yue.

85
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,860
I’m sorry.

86
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,830
Please tell me

87
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,150
the ingredients of the Heart Devouring Moon's antidote.

88
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,120
One liter of crow-dipper,

89
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,110
half a tael of Fritillaria thunbergii,

90
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,610
one tael of Chinese ground orchid,

91
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,570
ten Lianshan seeds,

92
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,540
and the most important three herbs.

93
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,540
Three taels of Wujiang

94
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,000
and three taels of Jiemao.

95
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,300
Between these two herbs,

96
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,590
the most important herb is missing.

97
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,610
The most important herb

98
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,100
is the Xuyu grass.

99
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,170
Why is there only one tael of Xuyu grass?

100
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,300
It's only enough to make one antidote.

101
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,530
There's not much Xuyu grass in the storehouse.

102
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,350
This is the only tael of it in the entire Yue residence.

103
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,480
What a coincidence.

104
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,910
I don't believe it.

105
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,750
Could it be that Elder Yue's angry

106
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:29,210
because I deceived him with the truth grass?

107
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,780
The Xuyu grass has always been rare.

108
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,420
In the years where winters are long and summers are short,

109
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,920
it can only be procured from the snowy mountain peaks.

110
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,760
Last year, there was abundant rainfall

111
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,960
and the summer was long,

112
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,420
so there's a lack of stock.

113
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,600
Does the pharmacy at the front hill have it?

114
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,630
All the herbs in the Gong residence

115
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,690
are given to the Yue residence first.

116
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,380
If there isn't any in the Yue residence's storehouse,

117
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,640
then it's impossible that there'd be any at the front hill.

118
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,940
Keep these Xuyu grass well.

119
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,090
It's such a precious herb.

120
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,920
We mustn't lose it.

121
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,320
Yes.

122
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,240
Why send the green silk?

123
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,280
Worry about your lack of clothing.

124
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,020
Not envious of the world.

125
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,810
Dangerous clouds interwoven with rain.

126
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,940
It'll depend on what choice

127
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,450
this little couple makes.

128
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,200
Why aren't you coming here?

129
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,340
I don't want to disturb you playing the qin.

130
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,590
You won't disturb me.

131
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,590
Come over.

132
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,000
My legs are already paralyzed.

133
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,610
It's inconvenient for me to walk.

134
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,030
Otherwise,

135
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,880
I'd go to your side.

136
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,010
This is for Young Master Ziyu

137
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,060
to relieve the hot poison.

138
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,250
This medicine

139
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,720
is for Miss Yun

140
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,910
to relieve the cold poison.

141
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,960
I didn't expect

142
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,090
you to be so good at playing the qin.

143
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,630
Ziyi taught me this.

144
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,350
There are trees in the mountains

145
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,630
and branches on trees.

146
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,700
I love you,

147
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,300
but you don't know that.

148
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,230
The wanderer in the vast and high-walled courtyard.

149
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,470
Having no fixed place to live

150
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,930
but having a peace of mind.

151
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,170
But

152
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,460
Ziyi told me

153
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,060
that since I'm a man,

154
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,840
this kind of song

155
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,800
is too sentimental for me to play.

156
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,620
My sister once asked me

157
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,350
whether I wanted to be a cat

158
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,670
or a dog.

159
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,950
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

160
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,300
The kittens on the streets are free,

161
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,210
but they are wandering around aimlessly

162
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,840
without a home.

163
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,250
Dogs in vast and high-walled courtyards have a place to stay,

164
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,580
but they have to be subservient to others forever.

165
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,350
She asked me

166
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,190
how I'd choose.

167
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,160
Wait.

168
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,390
I've finished making

169
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,150
the antidote.

170
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,080
You don't need to drink this from now on.

171
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,120
I know that this antidote is only enough for one person.

172
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,690
I won't take it.

173
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,770
I told you

174
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,290
I'd definitely save you.

175
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,570
So I'd never break my promise.

176
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,600
You also told me

177
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,030
that you married into the Gong family

178
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,580
just to seek protection

179
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,360
and live a peaceful life.

180
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,980
Then I'll fulfill your wish

181
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,920
and protect you.

182
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,480
Why did you do that?

183
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,460
Do you want to die?

184
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,570
You're the Gong family's Sword Wielder.

185
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,020
No one's life is more important than yours.

186
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,920
If you die,

187
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,950
they won't let me live either.

188
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,260
I won.

189
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,080
I made a bet with God.

190
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,560
I bet that you like me.

191
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,570
I bet

192
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,770
that you would give up your chance to live to me.

193
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:31,850
That bowl of medicine just now

194
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,770
is the real antidote.

195
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,250
Why are you so foolish?

196
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,430
Why are you so foolish?

197
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,240
Yun.

198
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,190
Yun!

199
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,280
Elder Yue.

200
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,170
Why did you hurt her?

201
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,870
Elder Yue!

202
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:04,970
Yun.

203
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,680
Yun!

204
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,470
Yun!

205
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,430
Young Master Yuanzhi, you have so much morning dew on you.

206
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,560
Did you go and tend to the plants again?

207
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,920
Morning, brother.

208
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,350
What rare flowers and herbs are they

209
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,310
that they have to be personally taken care of by you?

210
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,100
I'm afraid you won't know even if I say it.

211
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:01,740
Chuyun Chonglian.

212
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,520
Have you heard of it?

213
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,040
I read about it in a book.

214
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,470
The Chuyun Chonglian is a rare flower in the world

215
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,800
and also a magical herb.

216
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,450
Isn't it already extinct?

217
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,820
Unfortunately,

218
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,600
this rare flower in the world

219
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,330
was for the use of someone else.

220
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,920
Brother Yuanzhi originally planted the Chuyun Chonglian,

221
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,830
but it was taken and used by

222
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,720
the former Young Lord Gong Huanyu.

223
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,120
Why did you give it to him?

224
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,850
Back then, Gong Huanyu

225
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,110
was practicing the...

226
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,630
Divine Stone Skill,

227
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,170
but couldn't make a breakthrough no matter what.

228
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,260
So the former Sword Wielder asked me

229
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,720
to give him the Chuyun Chonglian for his consumption.

230
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,450
As expected,

231
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,900
with the miraculous medicine, he mastered the skill.

232
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,870
If it weren't for the former Sword Wielder's order,

233
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,530
I wouldn't have given him the Chuyun Chonglian.

234
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,340
I planted it for my brother.

235
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,770
According to the old medical book,

236
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,990
Chuyun Chonglian is extremely precious.

237
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,980
Martial artists

238
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,560
can increase their power.

239
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,910
Even the sick can be resurrected.

240
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,670
The former Sword Wielder was so biased.

241
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,990
Lady Wuji heard that Miss Shangguan

242
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,250
needs golden gentian,

243
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,910
so she specially asked me to come and tell you

244
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,110
that she'll share some of hers with you.

245
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,740
Lady Wuji is so thoughtful.

246
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,120
This was just a misunderstanding anyway.

247
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,140
I should also

248
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,500
visit her and apologize.

249
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,040
I'll relay your message to Lady Wuji right now.

250
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,420
I think...

251
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:33,840
Go.

252
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,690
Okay.

253
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,560
You're smart.

254
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,220
Not only do you have an escape plan,

255
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,030
but you also know how to retreat.

256
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,760
You know what should be said

257
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,540
and what shouldn't be said.

258
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,700
Senior, I'm just suffering

259
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,700
and taking the blame in your stead.

260
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,690
It's my duty.

261
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,930
It's better than both of us suffering great losses.

262
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,760
But...

263
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,410
What do you want to say?

264
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,010
Anonymous has been undercover successfully for so many years.

265
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,870
Why did she take action suddenly?

266
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,300
Are you asking Anonymous

267
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,170
or me?

268
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,720
Stop acting.

269
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,680
Aren't you doing the same?

270
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,070
A Wufeng spy

271
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,200
should try to get close to the Sword Wielder.

272
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,690
Why do you keep hanging around Gong Shangjue?

273
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,730
Is there someone else

274
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,910
by Gong Ziyu's side?

275
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,890
Chi, Mei, Wang, Liang.

276
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,640
We act alone in the dark

277
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,550
without keeping in contact

278
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,210
or asking each other's names.

279
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,630
You've left Wufeng for too long,

280
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,280
so you must have forgotten the rules.

281
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,490
How would I know about other people's missions?

282
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,630
Then what's your mission?

283
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,850
To get close to Gong Shangjue?

284
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,080
What if

285
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,020
I tell you we have the same mission?

286
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,350
The July Heat...

287
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,290
Immeasurable merits.

288
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,090
You can use these golden gentian first.

289
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,520
If you need anything in the future,

290
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,640
you can come to me anytime.

291
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,920
It's quite heavy.

292
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,650
Truth grass?

293
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,250
Yes.

294
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,780
What do you think?

295
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,750
In terms of making antidotes,

296
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,520
Elder Yue is not inferior to me.

297
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,210
If he personally made it,

298
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,120
it should be trustworthy.

299
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,570
But I don't believe Yun Weishan's not problematic.

300
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,510
Neither do I.

301
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,720
But Elder Yue

302
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,380
didn't have to

303
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,410
cover up for a Wufeng assassin.

304
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,330
What did Elder Yue say

305
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,060
about Housekeeper Jia's son's illness?

306
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,920
Elder Yue agreed to investigate.

307
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,420
But...

308
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,090
But what?

309
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,510
Brother.

310
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:17,980
Nothing.

311
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,500
Chuyun Chonglian

312
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,630
can cure all diseases

313
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,750
and bring the dead back to life.

314
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,560
In these books,

315
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,640
the medicinal properties of many medicinal herbs are mentioned.

316
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,970
Have you tried them all?

317
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,240
For example,

318
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,340
Wujiang.

319
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,020
Three taels of Wujiang.

320
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,930
What about Jiemao?

321
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,730
Three taels of Jiemao.

322
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,560
The most important herb that's missing...

323
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,120
is the Xuyu grass.

324
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,460
[Jiemao] [Xuyu grass] [Wujiang]

325
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,200
"Wu xu jie", that it doesn't need to be cured!

326
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,320
Is the paralysis in your limbs

327
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:25,830
all gone?

328
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,370
Yes.

329
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,610
You don't cough up blood anymore too, right?

330
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,900
Congratulations, Miss Yun.

331
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,909
Congratulations, Lord Sword Wielder.

332
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,850
You just called him...

333
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,110
Lord Sword Wielder?

334
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,170
Yes.

335
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,010
Young Master Ziyu passed the trial successfully.

336
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:05,980
In my heart,

337
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,450
he's already a true Sword Wielder.

338
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,150
So,

339
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,950
you've gotten rid of the Heart Devouring Moon

340
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:16,960
in our bodies?

341
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,270
No.

342
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,330
Do you remember

343
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,560
what Elder Yue said

344
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,930
were the three most important herbs?

345
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,130
Wujiang,

346
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,040
Xuyu grass,

347
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,830
and Jiemao.

348
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,550
It was

349
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,920
an acrostic poem by Elder Yue.

350
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,140
An acrostic poem?

351
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:39,820
"Wu"...

352
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,460
"xu"...

353
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:42,790
"jie"...

354
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,760
"Wu xu jie", that it doesn't need to be cured?

355
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,940
That's right.

356
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,380
The Heart Devouring Moon poison

357
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,020
doesn't need to be cured.

358
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,920
On the first day, you blurted out

359
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,080
that the Heart Devouring Moon

360
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,350
is an incurable poison.

361
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,950
I was really surprised then.

362
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:00,950
I thought

363
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,250
you

364
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,100
were too talented.

365
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,750
Finding a solution for the incurable poison

366
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,870
is the challenge.

367
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,020
Now I finally understand

368
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,380
what you meant back then.

369
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,630
It's not that it's incurable,

370
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,980
but that it doesn't need to be cured.

371
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,790
The Fortnight Flies

372
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,500
would make your whole body feel like it's being burned in a raging fire.

373
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,160
If you don't get rid of it soon,

374
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,840
the poison will attack the heart.

375
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,780
Then, there'll be no cure for it.

376
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,060
So what I took

377
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,640
was not even poison.

378
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:42,870
Not only was it not poison,

379
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,820
but it's also a very precious tonic.

380
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,240
This is also why the Herb Elixir

381
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,090
doesn't work on the Heart Devouring Moon.

382
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,300
That's right.

383
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,520
After taking the Heart Devouring Moon,

384
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,120
your body will be in pain.

385
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,810
But as long as you can get through it,

386
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,140
all poisoning symptoms

387
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,730
will go away on their own.

388
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,200
This is the page that I tore out.

389
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:16,550
Actually, Lord Sword Wielder, you were right.

390
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,190
It does include Kuxin grass.

391
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,660
The Heart Devouring Moon

392
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,940
is a strong tonic.

393
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,340
It can greatly enhance your internal skill,

394
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,600
strengthen your body,

395
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,950
and prolong your life.

396
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,720
There'll be gains and losses during the first consumption.

397
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,700
According to the different internal skills of the consumers,

398
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,030
it causes body heat or body chills

399
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,040
along with the weakening of the internal skill.

400
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,730
The blood vessels in the wrists become congested,

401
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,130
the heart and lungs burn,

402
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,400
and bodily pain is felt immediately.

403
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,170
Then, you cough up blood.

404
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,420
Later, your hands and feet become stiff.

405
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,570
The blood congestion spreads along the arms

406
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:57,830
and forms a black line.

407
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,030
This is accompanied by spasms and severe pain in all your internal organs.

408
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,660
And then

409
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,960
all four limbs become paralyzed.

410
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,510
It's really a good medicine

411
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,270
where both parties suffer tremendous losses.

412
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,700
Although it's considered

413
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,360
that you've passed the trial,

414
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,280
I still want to test you.

415
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,380
The Qishe flower,

416
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,260
the carrion beetle brain and the Bombyx silkworm are all poisonous.

417
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,030
Why is it a tonic when combined?

418
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,400
There are so many books in the library.

419
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,200
Can someone like you who has a photographic memory

420
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,570
answer this question?

421
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,150
The Qishe flower

422
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,980
causes severe heart and abdominal pains

423
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,020
and reverses the flow of the meridians.

424
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,150
The Bombyx silkworm

425
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,640
is also highly poisonous

426
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,340
and results in stagnation of your internal energy and stiffening of your movements.

427
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,960
If the Qishe flower and Bombyx silkworm

428
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,150
are taken together,

429
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,840
your arms and legs become paralyzed.

430
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,370
By using one poison to counteract the other poison,

431
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,470
it's instead turned into a medicine with high efficacy.

432
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:57,740
It's exactly because the meridians in the arms and legs are sealed

433
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,000
that the concentrated energy of the internal skill

434
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,330
can only exist between the heart and lungs.

435
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,740
This accelerates the circulation

436
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,540
which leads to

437
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,670
the concentrated energy of the internal skill
switching from circulating along all meridians to just the Ren and Du meridians,

438
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,810
such that it's even easier to open up the eight extraordinary meridians

439
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,830
and your internal skill is strengthened quickly.

440
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,700
But the carrion beetle brain dominates the meridians

441
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,100
and is highly poisonous.

442
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,040
A black line on the wrist

443
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,270
indicates that the poison has begun to circulate all over the body.

444
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,070
Lord Sword Wielder,

445
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,730
have you figured this out too?

446
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,350
The carrion beetle brain is usually consumed raw

447
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,610
or crushed up directly

448
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,360
and made into a potent poison.

449
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,910
Could it be...

450
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,520
the water-boiling technique?

451
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,130
Yes.

452
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,180
The carrion beetle brain is affected by temperature.

453
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,240
After boiling it, its potency will be greatly reduced.

454
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,300
Instead, it will increase your powers

455
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,130
and have a miraculous effect that allows you to go beyond your limits.

456
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:45,950
But

457
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,570
in people's impressions,

458
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,910
the carrion beetle brain has always been

459
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,310
a potent poison that causes instant death,

460
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,590
so its medicinal benefits are ignored.

461
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,770
However,

462
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,740
even though its potency is reduced,

463
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,070
you'll still lose some of your internal skill

464
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,600
in the process of taking it.

465
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,080
As for the last herb,

466
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,370
the Kuxin grass...

467
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,000
Actually, I already detected the Kuxin grass's smell.

468
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,950
But at that time,

469
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,110
I doubted myself.

470
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:14,750
This smells

471
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:17,000
a little like the Kuxin grass.

472
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,310
Could it be the Kuxin grass?

473
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,710
Because the Kuxin grass

474
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,600
is originally a good herb for antidotes,

475
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,830
I never thought

476
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,970
that it'd be added to make a poison.

477
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,800
Now that I think about it,

478
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:31,350
the reason the Kuxin grass was added from the start

479
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:32,610
is to let the consumers

480
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,900
detoxify slowly.

481
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,010
But

482
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,500
when mixed with more than three herbs,

483
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,280
it will take some time,

484
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,710
around half a month,

485
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,210
for the Kuxin grass

486
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,530
to take effect

487
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,320
and initiate the detoxification process.

488
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,210
So,

489
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,990
the cycle of the Heart Devouring Moon

490
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,180
is half a month.

491
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,190
Yes.

492
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:00,190
When the poison is completely cleared,

493
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,050
your powers

494
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,280
will naturally be restored.

495
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,370
So, previously,

496
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,910
when you saw me making all kinds of concoctions

497
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,570
with different ingredients,

498
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,510
you must have thought I was a fool.

499
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,480
I dare not.

500
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,030
It's just a test for the Sword Wielder.

501
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:15,960
Besides,

502
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,580
during this process,

503
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,310
you read a lot of medical books, Sword Wielder.

504
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,510
You've improved a lot

505
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,590
in the knowledge of pharmacology.

506
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:24,870
Besides

507
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,080
the ability to learn pharmacology,

508
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,920
trial takers also must have the determination and perseverance to risk their lives for medicine testing.

509
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,790
The moment you were willing

510
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,950
to take the Heart Devouring Moon and risk your life testing it,

511
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,410
you already passed the test, Sword Wielder.

512
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:42,390
I know.

513
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:43,800
In that case,

514
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,110
I want to tell you, Sword Wielder,

515
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:46,910
this realm...

516
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,220
Elder Yue.

517
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,700
It's just that

518
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,920
something unexpected happened.

519
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,410
Yes.

520
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,700
Young Master Shangjue happened to come visit me,

521
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,630
so I was delayed.

522
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:01,130
But, Elder Yue,

523
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,540
what is it with

524
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:05,850
the Eggs of Bone-Gnawing Flies?

525
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,230
It's not some medicine that's beneficial.

526
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,290
Sword Wielder, you are really sharp.

527
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,270
The Bone-Gnawing Flies

528
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:14,210
are the essence of this medicine.

529
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,650
When the Bone-Gnawing Flies get inside the body,

530
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,920
they will be attached to the eight extraordinary meridians

531
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,520
and keep generating stimulation.

532
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,670
It will make people

533
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,690
use their internal skills to resist it unconsciously.

534
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:25,310
Therefore, the host

535
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,770
has to use their martial skills

536
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,470
and aura 24 hours non-stop.

537
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,400
No matter how diligent a person is,

538
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:33,270
he wouldn't be able to do this.

539
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,440
So,

540
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:36,990
you mean

541
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,800
even when that person's eating or sleeping, he's still practicing his martial skills?

542
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,080
If you insist

543
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,500
on putting it that way.

544
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,010
That's too much.

545
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,140
But Heart Devouring Moon

546
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,780
also has a serious drawback.

547
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:53,780
What is it?

548
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,480
Other symptoms

549
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,210
can be relieved by taking it,

550
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,780
but the loss of internal skills

551
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,910
is irreparable.

552
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,780
In other words,

553
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,550
every half a month,

554
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,570
there'll be 4 hours when

555
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,600
you're in a state of having no internal skills at all, Sword Wielder.

556
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,530
That'll also be your Darkest Hour,

557
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,920
the Hour of Lunar Eclipse.

558
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,070
What if

559
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:25,260
someone wants to assassinate me during that time?

560
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,990
It'll be a piece of cake, right?

561
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,890
So you have two options.

562
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,200
One,

563
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,390
during the Hour of Lunar Eclipse,

564
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,390
find somewhere absolutely safe and stay there alone.

565
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:40,410
Or, have someone skillful that you absolutely trust by your side.

566
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,410
But this solution

567
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,270
is not completely safe.

568
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,080
So there's a second one.

569
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,360
This is the formula of the Heart Devouring Moon.

570
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,390
After you return to the front hill of the Gong Residence,

571
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:57,460
make it yourself

572
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,070
and choose a date to take it.

573
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,290
Don't tell anyone about it.

574
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,560
In this way,

575
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,960
no one will know when your Hour of Lunar Eclipse is.

576
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,200
So, Elder Yue,

577
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:20,640
the Fortnight Flies...

578
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,440
No, the Heart Devouring Moon.

579
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,020
Are you sure there's no need to detoxicate it?

580
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,550
Is it enough to endure the most painful hours?

581
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,190
Yes.

582
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,350
I have one more thing

583
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:37,150
to ask you, Elder Yue.

584
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:39,840
Go ahead.

585
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,170
Is it true

586
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,780
about the truth grass?

587
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:46,760
Right.

588
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,290
What's the deal with the truth grass?

589
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:51,580
You took it,

590
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,060
yet you still tricked me.

591
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,070
Why did you tell me about Xuyu grass?

592
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,190
Xuyu grass wasn't necessary at all.

593
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,700
Since the truth grass was developed by me,

594
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,040
of course I know how to detoxicate it.

595
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,220
Then why did you hide the Xuyu grass?

596
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:08,750
I put so much effort into it,

597
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,820
yet you still want to complain?

598
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,040
You only got to know Miss Yun's love is real

599
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,030
since there was only one antidote,

600
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,030
didn't you?

601
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,450
People can lie,

602
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,900
but the decisions they make wouldn't.

603
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,480
You did so much for Miss Yun.

604
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,500
You were even willing to give her the only antidote.

605
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:35,200
Even if Miss Yun's heart was made of stone,

606
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,210
it should have bloomed.

607
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,940
Just like how Xuyu grass grows

608
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,340
on the steep iceberg cliff.

609
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,840
When faced with life and death,

610
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:49,060
she was willing to give you the antidote

611
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,650
and leave the chance to live to you.

612
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,110
That's the most precious thing.

613
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:54,830
Isn't it?

614
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:58,690
So,

615
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,400
why did you help us, Elder Yue?

616
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:08,900
I just hope

617
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:10,370
lovers

618
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,250
can have a happy ending.

619
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:16,020
It seems

620
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,280
I shouldn't call you Elder Yue.

621
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,500
You're more like God of Matchmaking.

622
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,900
Truly, I'm like God of Matchmaking.

623
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:26,890
I've facilitated countless couples in the world.

624
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,290
Only I

625
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,000
am always alone.

626
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,830
I've been an excellent doctor all my life,

627
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,930
but I can't cure the pain of love.

628
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,080
Doctors can't treat themselves.

629
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,780
You can only help others, but not yourself.

630
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,500
The pain of love...

631
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,380
How is it painful?

632
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,630
I think it's quite sweet.

633
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,780
Your moving techniques

634
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,510
and internal skills

635
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:44,610
have both improved, Sword Wielder.

636
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:45,210
Thank you.

637
00:47:58,430 --> 00:47:59,560
Thank you, Miss Yun.

638
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:06,660
The Heart Devouring Moon has been detoxicated.

639
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,610
And we have both

640
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,080
almost recovered.

641
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:12,460
It's time for us to return to the front hill.

642
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,460
You can't leave yet, Sword Wielder.

643
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,170
Why?

644
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:17,670
You learned

645
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,470
the Three Forms of Snow Saber when you passed the first test, right?

646
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:21,910
Yes.

647
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:24,670
You lied to me,

648
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,060
saying that the Snow Saber Scripture is under the Ice Pool,

649
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,260
and asked me to get it.

650
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,570
Although the first test is a test of internal skills,

651
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,570
the purpose was to teach you the Three Forms of Snow Saber.

652
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:34,120
However,

653
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,600
without enough internal skills,

654
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:39,580
one wouldn't be able to learn the Three Forms of Snow Saber.

655
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,240
Similarly,

656
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,430
although the Heart Devouring Moon

657
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:44,310
seems to be the test of poison making and detoxicating skills,

658
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:45,270
the key purpose

659
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,650
is to improve

660
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,100
the trial taker's internal skills

661
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,680
so that he can master more sophisticated saber techniques of the Gong family.

662
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,070
You also have saber techniques to teach me?

663
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,600
Starting with the New Moon.

664
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,270
Wrangling during the Full Moon.

665
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,030
Killing during the Crescent Moon.

666
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:00,430
Sounds pretty powerful.

667
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,070
So, Miss Yun,

668
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,540
you should return to the front hill first

669
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:11,540
and bring back the good news that the Sword Wielder has passed the trial.

670
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:17,900
Yun.

671
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:19,710
Why are you crying?

672
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,880
Miss Yun must be reluctant to part with you.

673
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:32,750
Go back first.

674
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,270
I'll be back soon.

675
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,680
My lovesickness and melancholy is endless.

676
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,930
I'll tell you all about it when you come back.

677
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,130
I'll wait for you at the Yu Lineage.

678
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:48,990
Wait for me.

679
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:01,490
Young Master.

680
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:04,930
Yun Weishan has returned to the Yu Lineage.

681
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:08,260
It seems that Gong Ziyu has made it through the second realm.

682
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:10,980
He really

683
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:12,930
impressed me.

684
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:15,240
Is there any news

685
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,200
of Lady Wuji?

686
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:18,080
She stays at the Yu Lineage every day.

687
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,220
On the first and fifteenth day of every lunar month,

688
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,620
she goes to the ancestral hall in the back hill

689
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,990
to recite sutras for the former Sword Wielder.

690
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,950
Nothing else

691
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:24,340
for now.

692
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,190
Brother.

693
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,400
Do you still suspect Wuji?

694
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,160
I still can't trust her.

695
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,470
You just came back to the Yu Lineage.

696
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:41,840
I'm sorry

697
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,520
that I summoned you here in such a hurry.

698
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:45,830
Don't say that.

699
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:49,870
I know you're concerned about the Sword Wielder, Your Ladyship.

700
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,260
So Ziyu...

701
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:51,590
I've also been worried.

702
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:53,900
While Gong Ziyu was away,

703
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,580
Jin Fan had a long face every day.

704
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,030
I've also...

705
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,070
I've also been very depressed.

706
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,510
Don't worry.

707
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:06,210
Young Master is fine.

708
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,630
And he has made it through the trial.

709
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,180
He's not back yet

710
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,720
because he still has to learn saber techniques from Elder Yue.

711
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:15,760
That's good.

712
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:16,840
It seems

713
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,620
my left eyelid

714
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,150
defeated my right eyelid.

715
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:22,440
The twitch of the left eyelid portends wealth.

716
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,700
So that was a good omen.

717
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,340
Next time it twitches,

718
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,650
it will double the merriness.

719
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,900
And happiness... Happiness comes in pairs.

720
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,890
Your Ladyship.

721
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:33,390
Look, Jin Fan is blushing.

722
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,730
You said your right eyelid twitched badly.

723
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,710
What else?

724
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:42,640
Tell us about it.

725
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,360
Midway through it,

726
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:49,030
Gong Shangjue came once.

727
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:58,760
It's okay.

728
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:13,620
Elder Yue.

729
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:15,830
There's something

730
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,920
I'm curious about.

731
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:18,890
What is it?

732
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:21,590
Who took the Heart Devouring Moon

733
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,340
during Young Master Shangjue's trial?

734
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,310
It was his subordinate.

735
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:28,320
Jin Fu?

736
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:32,250
It wasn't him.

737
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,630
It was someone else.

738
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:37,900
Oh.

739
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:42,390
It didn't take Young Master Shangjue very long to think.

740
00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,250
He also ate Heart Devouring Moon.

741
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,370
He tested medicine in person

742
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:47,770
for a guardian.

743
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:49,450
It shows

744
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:51,870
that although Young Master Shangjue

745
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,430
is stubborn and ruthless,

746
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:54,790
he's actually

747
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:56,260
a loyal and gentle person.

748
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:01,950
He's not gentle

749
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,400
with me.

750
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,380
He made things difficult for me again and again.

751
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:07,980
Even Miss Yun was not spared.

752
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:13,710
Although I don't agree with some of his actions,

753
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,430
I can understand him.

754
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:18,000
You can empathize with him?

755
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,750
In fact, from his point of view,

756
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,740
he just hopes people in the position of the Sword Wielder

757
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,790
can be capable.

758
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:27,680
And because of this,

759
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,530
you

760
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,810
should pass the Trial of the Three Realms

761
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,980
and be a convincing Sword Wielder.

762
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,620
What kind of person is he?

763
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:51,460
How about

764
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,690
you give me your truth grass

765
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,150
so that I can know

766
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,590
whether he is a good person or a bad person?

767
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:01,460
Sword Wielder is the center of the power of the Gong family.

768
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,500
In the future, you have to face countless people.

769
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,460
It'll be hard for you to tell whether they're loyal or treacherous.

770
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,620
Discerning people's thoughts

771
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,210
relies on keen insight.

772
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:11,310
How can you rely on other things?

773
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:13,710
Besides,

774
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,440
even if you have truth grass, so what?

775
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,520
Didn't you refuse to believe

776
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:22,070
what Miss Yun said?

777
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:28,120
You're right.

778
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,100
Nothing can escape your...

779
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,890
I know you want to describe my eyes as dogs' eyes.

780
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:43,040
Anyway,

781
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:45,630
even if there is no truth grass,

782
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,440
I'm willing to believe what she says.

783
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:54,470
Being willing to believe her

784
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,480
and believing her

785
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,670
are two different things.

786
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:13,260
Gong Shangjue is really something.

787
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,700
He even gave trouble in the back hill.

788
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,580
I told you.

789
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,010
I had a premonition.

790
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,300
Fortunately, Ziyu and Elder Yue were there.

791
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:23,390
Otherwise,

792
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:26,470
you would have...

793
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,320
I've dispelled his suspicion on me.

794
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,620
I think he won't make things difficult for me again

795
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,800
in the future.

796
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,530
He's been coveting the position of the Sword Wielder for a long time.

797
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:38,980
He makes things difficult for you

798
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,970
because he wants to find dirt on Ziyu

799
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:41,900
and replace him.

800
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:44,390
This person is very deep.

801
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:46,770
You and Ziyu

802
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:48,600
should be careful at all times.

803
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,070
Understood.

804
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,370
Send someone to continue to keep an eye on Lady Wuji.

805
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,090
If there really is something wrong,

806
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,150
she'll give her away sooner or later.

807
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:01,010
Yes.

808
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,990
Young Master Shangjue.

809
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:09,330
Come in.

810
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:17,310
Young Master.

811
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:18,260
These are the new clothes you ordered us

812
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,810
to prepare for Miss Shangguan.

813
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:20,870
Please have a look.

814
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,700
No need.

815
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,080
Deliver it over.

816
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:23,680
Yes.

817
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,490
Say what you want to say.

818
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,490
No need.

819
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:32,500
I...

820
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,760
I can see it on your face.

821
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:36,740
Humph.

822
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,400
Lady Wuji.

823
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,620
Put it here.

824
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:47,460
Yes.

825
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,020
Wow.

826
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,280
Miss Yun.

827
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,340
Sword Wielder is so nice to you.

828
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,000
The clothes are so beautiful.

829
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:00,170
I'm so jealous.

830
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:02,550
You're Eldest Young Miss.

831
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,280
What's there to be jealous of?

832
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,190
Yours have already been delivered to the Shang residence.

833
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:11,870
Really?

834
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:14,220
Goodbye.

835
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:17,710
Jin Fan.

836
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:20,190
Wipe your saliva.

837
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,500
Lady Wuji is still here. Hold it back.

838
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,400
I'll come to you when I get changed. There's no hurry.

839
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,530
Gong, Shang, Jue, Zhi, and Yu.

840
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:03,350
Only I am

841
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:05,120
a beauty.

842
00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:06,570
Ah.

843
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,780
This knife is so beautiful.

844
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,360
My knife

845
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:25,940
is called Moonlight.

846
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:28,160
Moonlight?

847
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:32,910
How is it?

848
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:35,540
I'm fine.

849
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,610
I just got a cut.

850
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,180
I'm asking you

851
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,570
how my knife is.

852
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:45,950
What do you think?

853
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:52,400
Your knife

854
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:54,630
has a smooth surface.

855
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:55,790
Its edge

856
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,380
is quite sharp.

857
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,730
It's indeed a good knife.

858
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:02,800
You have good taste.

859
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,150
But

860
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,250
it hurts people by accident easily.

861
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,260
I need some ointment.

862
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,920
Wait for me there.

863
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,560
You want ointment for such a small wound?

864
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,380
Your surname is Gong, and your first name is Ziyu.

865
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,390
Is your nickname Delicate?

866
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,650
I don't want to hear it.

867
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,800
I'll wait for you in the bamboo forest outside the Yue residence.

868
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,370
Hurry up.

869
00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:28,430
Ointment.

870
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:30,340
Ointment.

871
00:59:30,990 --> 00:59:31,580
Oint...

872
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:39,350
Truth grass.

873
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:52,780
Truth grass.

874
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,630
Wubaizi.

875
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,200
Xuanshen.

876
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,410
Luokui.

877
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:03,620
It's strange.

878
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:07,030
Why do they smell like ordinary herbal medicines?

879
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,620
A mirror.

880
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,280
Hairpins.

881
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:48,300
[Where to send my hair? I'm worrying about your lack of clothing. I'm not jealous of the world. Clouds weave rain.]

882
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,210
A woman once lived here.

883
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:26,900
Thank you, Miss Yun.

884
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:49,240
[Shang]

885
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,580
You scared me.

886
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,330
I thought I ran into a thug

887
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,270
who wanted to kidnap me,

888
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,740
a poor, innocent, and beautiful girl.

889
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,340
Poor, innocent, and beautiful.

890
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,280
You have to remove at least two words.

891
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:11,940
Then only "beautiful girl"

892
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:13,350
is left.

893
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:14,380
Beautiful girl.

894
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,780
Hand me some lead powder.

895
01:02:20,910 --> 01:02:21,710
Hurry up.

896
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,820
I'm wearing new clothes.

897
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,090
Actually,

898
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,100
you don't have to dress beautifully when you see me.

899
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,210
I'm not ready yet.

900
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:38,310
You're so thick-skinned.

901
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:39,900
Who came to see you?

902
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:42,660
I was going to see Jin Fan.

903
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:44,110
But

904
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:45,790
after I got changed,

905
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:47,660
you took me here by tooth.

906
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,090
It's "by force".

907
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:52,660
What?

908
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:53,640
Forget it.

909
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:54,740
Hand me some lead powder.

910
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:55,430
Thank you.

911
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,380
[New Moon]

912
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:01,580
[Little Wangyue]

913
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:18,850
[Moonbreak]

914
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:44,240
Elder Yue.

915
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,260
The Three Forms of Moon Slash

916
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:48,880
looks much more powerful than the Three Forms of Snow Saber.

917
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,870
Look at you.

918
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,840
If you see Young Master Xue next time,

919
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:53,880
don't...

920
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,950
Don't forget what you said.

921
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:58,700
You have to say it loudly

922
01:04:58,700 --> 01:04:59,900
in front of him again.

923
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,710
This is the saber scripture.

924
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:04,830
You can't take it out of the Yue residence.

925
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:05,440
So,

926
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:08,570
[Three Forms of Moon Slash]

927
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:07,270
once you memorize it,

928
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,460
you can leave.

929
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:12,330
I see.

930
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:14,250
Go back and practice hard.

931
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,270
With your wisdom,

932
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,140
you'll definitely make rapid progress.

933
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,510
I won't let you down.

934
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:32,830
Hey.

935
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:33,520
Jin Fan.

936
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:34,890
You're back.

937
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,110
Come here.

938
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,620
Let's drink together.

939
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:39,620
You're still drinking at this hour?

940
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,310
We heard

941
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,400
Sword Wielder passed the trial.

942
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:44,280
We're celebrating.

943
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:45,020
Come here.

944
01:05:45,020 --> 01:05:45,830
Come here.

945
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,440
Come here.

946
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:53,210
Hey.

947
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,930
Don't drink too much.

948
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:56,340
If you get drunk,

949
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,750
you'll make mistakes during the day shift.

950
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:00,540
I won't get drunk.

951
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:01,710
Nonsense.

952
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,160
When you were drunk last time,

953
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,360
you talked nonsense.

954
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:06,780
He said he saw a handsome young man

955
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:08,350
in the prison.

956
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:09,860
What prison?

957
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,400
He was drunk last time.

958
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:12,930
He was in a daze.

959
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:14,110
He said

960
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:17,110
on the night when the former Sword Wielder and the former Young Lord were killed,

961
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:17,970
he saw

962
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:19,000
a handsome man

963
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:20,220
who looked like a god

964
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,940
in the prison

965
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:24,280
passing by the cell where the female assassin from the Wufeng

966
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,210
was imprisoned.

967
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,510
What are the characteristics

968
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:28,620
of the young man you mentioned?

969
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:29,000
Hey.

970
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:30,300
Look.

971
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:31,190
Jin Fan

972
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:33,100
believes me.

973
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:35,200
Jin Fan.

974
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:38,120
He was wearing plain clothes.

975
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,560
There seemed to be some cloud patterns on his clothes.

976
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:42,540
By the way,

977
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,030
I think the new Elder Yue

978
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:46,690
and that young man

979
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:47,970
have the same body shape.

980
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:49,820
The more you say, the more outrageous it becomes.

981
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,590
Don't let Elder Yue hear it.

982
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:53,510
Let's drink.

983
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:54,570
Here.
