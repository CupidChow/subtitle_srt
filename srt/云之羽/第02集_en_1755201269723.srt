[My Journey to You]

00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,100
[Episode 2]

4
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,850
Gong Ziyu.

5
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,550
I'm not trying to let them go.

6
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,550
It's just a trap.

7
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,710
Interesting.

8
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,660
I thought the most famous playboy of the Gong family

9
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,260
only knows how to play cards.

10
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,670
Then let me play along with you so that it seems more realistic.

11
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,490
Don't get me wrong.

12
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,490
I'm not mistaken.

13
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,250
I'm just making the best of a bad bargain.

14
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,080
Gong Yuanzhi.

15
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,460
They are all bride candidates.

16
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:11,130
You're being too negligent of the consequences.

17
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,260
You're indeed the most tender towards women, Young Master Ziyu.

18
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,390
But if there's a Wufeng spy among them,

19
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,000
they should all be executed.

20
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,130
They are already poisoned.

21
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,600
Without my antidote,

22
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,990
they'll just have to wait for their deaths.

23
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,760
Are we really going to die?

24
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,670
I'm scared.

25
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,640
Help me.

26
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,510
I won't die here, right?

27
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,530
I don't want to.

28
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,920
I don't want to die yet.

29
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,130
What are you doing?

30
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,570
Congratulations.

31
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,590
Your trap has succeeded.

32
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,250
The bug has entered the pit.

33
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,430
Bring the antidote to us in exchange for his life.

34
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,900
You can try.

35
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,830
Let's see if you'll die first or he'll die first.

36
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,700
What are you talking about?

37
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,280
Take her away.

38
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,380
Brother Yuanzhi.

39
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,210
You were reckless.

40
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,080
Young Lord.

41
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,680
I was desperate to save Brother Ziyu.

42
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,690
The acupoints below the knees are connected to the elbows.

43
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,410
Since his elbows were numbed,

44
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,990
Brother Ziyu should be safe.

45
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,460
Besides,

46
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,090
Brother Ziyu had eagerly set up a trap.

47
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,150
I couldn't let his effort go to waste.

48
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,140
Didn't we catch her in the end?

49
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,740
Nonsense.

50
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,420
You obviously tried to kill me just now.

51
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Brother Yuanzhi.

52
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,830
Next time,

53
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,700
don't be so reckless.

54
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:23,840
Yes,

55
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,000
Young Lord.

56
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,690
Morning.

57
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,760
Does it still hurt?

58
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,130
A little.

59
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,540
Why did you pull such a foolish stunt last night?

60
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,790
You clearly can't defeat Gong Yuanzhi in a fight, but you insisted on...

61
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,520
Who can't defeat Gong Yuanzhi?

62
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,950
If it weren't for you hindering me,

63
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,260
it would probably have been a balanced fight.

64
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,470
Dream on.

65
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,290
Shut up.

66
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,390
I need to find someone later.

67
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,440
Don't follow me.

68
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,220
Wait for me here.

69
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,100
What are you going to do?

70
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,360
None of your business.

71
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,320
I swear on my conscience

72
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,440
that I really don't want to care about you.

73
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,840
Do you have a conscience?

74
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,000
I do.

75
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,730
But it was eaten by a dog.

76
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,270
[Zhi]

77
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,120
Someone was here.

78
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,470
Chi, Mei, Wang, and Liang.

79
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,580
I heard that Wufeng assassins

80
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,080
are divided into four levels.

81
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,710
With your ability and skills,

82
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,770
you're probably in the lowest level, Chi.

83
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,610
Sigh.

84
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,950
It was such a good opportunity,

85
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,900
yet they actually sent a Chi.

86
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,720
Was this a suicide mission?

87
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,940
We Wufeng people

88
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,350
are not afraid of death.

89
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,770
Oh?

90
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,080
Yes.

91
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Many people are not afraid of death.

92
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,930
But that's because

93
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,270
sometimes,

94
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,340
living is scarier

95
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,550
than death.

96
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,580
You must be the Gong Yuanzhi that they talk about,

97
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,580
who's adept at using poison.

98
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,100
Even if I die,

99
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,040
I won't drink your poison wine.

100
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,470
It's fine if

101
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,800
you don't want to

102
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,340
drink this cup of poison wine.

103
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,550
I need you to do something for me.

104
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,740
I'm willing to do anything for you.

105
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,670
I want you

106
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,570
to protect someone for me.

107
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,420
We're not going to die here, right?

108
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,990
Bring the incense burner to the brides.

109
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,430
Yes.

110
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,500
Young Master.

111
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,870
What are you doing here?

112
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,250
I just came to look around.

113
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,130
Nonsense.

114
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,510
This is the Ladies' Hostel. What is there to see?

115
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,830
Go to Wanhua Pavilion if you want to look at women.

116
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,270
Hey.

117
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,040
Young Master.

118
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,660
Hurry.

119
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,560
Guard the door.

120
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,700
Don't let anyone find out that Young Master is here.

121
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,980
Or he'll be in big trouble.

122
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,380
Yes.

123
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,090
And I'll be in bigger trouble.

124
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,070
Young Master Ziyu.

125
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,630
Young Master Ziyu?

126
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,200
What is he doing here?

127
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,380
Why is he here?

128
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,830
Wait for a moment.

129
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,420
Young Master Ziyu.

130
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,660
Thank you for your help last night.

131
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,530
Don't call me Young Master Ziyu.

132
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,530
Call me Gong Ziyu.

133
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,580
Isn't it funny?

134
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,780
My name is Yun Weishan.

135
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,860
"Yun" as in the clouds,

136
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,640
and "shan" as in clothes.

137
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,870
The clouds are your clothes.

138
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,190
What a poetic and great name.

139
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,690
How did you know

140
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,440
I'm here for this mask today?

141
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,890
The coloring on this mask

142
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,750
is not ordinary oil paint or color paste,

143
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,690
but a very thin layer of glaze.

144
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,060
It's tough for ordinary craftsmen to create.

145
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,550
It must be made by a skilled craftsman

146
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,580
and expensive.

147
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,680
If I were the owner,

148
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,650
I would also be heartbroken if I lost it.

149
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,470
It has nothing to do with the price.

150
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,700
The main thing is that it can't be bought anymore.

151
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,430
Has the craftsman passed away?

152
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,660
You can say that.

153
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,490
Has your body been detoxified?

154
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,360
Last night, Young Lord sent the antidote here for everyone.

155
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,340
I'm fine now.

156
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,290
Young Master Ziyu.

157
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,480
This medicine is...

158
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:53,100
It's the Baizhi Jincao Tea.

159
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,430
I'll hold it.

160
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,340
You may leave.

161
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,220
Yes.

162
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,720
When I checked in last night,

163
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,190
I had a bowl of

164
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,560
this Baizhi Jincao Tea.

165
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,940
They said that all outsiders have to take it

166
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,610
to resist the fog of poisonous miasma in Jiuchen Valley.

167
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,990
What's wrong, Young Master Ziyu?

168
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,080
Is anything wrong?

169
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,930
Oh.

170
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,050
No.

171
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,110
You must take this Baizhi Jincao Tea.

172
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,840
The depths of the valley

173
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,570
are scattered with rare herbs.

174
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,260
But there are also many poisonous plants.

175
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,360
The valley is constantly shrouded in poisonous miasma.

176
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,820
If a woman stays in the valley for a long time,

177
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:39,960
then...

178
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,400
What?

179
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,810
Then it'll be hard to

180
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,710
bear a child.

181
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,810
Miss Shangguan, please take the medicinal tea.

182
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,800
Do I have to drink it now?

183
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:10,930
Yes.

184
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:13,810
I'll take the medicine cup back after you finish it.

185
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,370
That's why the Gong family

186
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,230
wants to marry brides from outside the valley.

187
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,800
But don't worry.

188
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,490
This Baizhi Jincao Tea

189
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,220
is made for women to help resist the poisonous miasma

190
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,680
and nourish their bodies.

191
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,830
But this bowl of medicine...

192
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,630
What's wrong with this bowl of medicine?

193
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,190
Is there a problem?

194
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,180
A few pieces of rat poop fell into it.

195
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,150
Are you serious?

196
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,020
Guess.

197
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,420
Where did you go?

198
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,170
I've been waiting for you this whole time.

199
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,500
Aren't you a little too delicate?

200
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,960
You need medicine even for a minor injury.

201
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,730
This is the Baizhi Jincao Tea.

202
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,830
Why are you drinking that?

203
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,420
Are you out of your mind?

204
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,670
I wouldn't drink the Baizhi Jincao Tea even if I'm out of my mind.

205
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,450
Smell it yourself.

206
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,490
This smell is not right.

207
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,080
Is it poisoned?

208
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,920
I'm not sure yet.

209
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,060
But it's definitely not the original Baizhi Jincao Tea.

210
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,880
Who did this?

211
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,310
Who else could it be?

212
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,700
The person who is

213
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,790
most adept at using poison in the whole valley.

214
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,590
Gong Yuanzhi.

215
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:18,880
Ziyu.

216
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:20,750
Brother.

217
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,380
Did you go to the Ladies' Hostel

218
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,980
to look for Miss Yun Weishan?

219
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,110
Brother.

220
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,990
How did you find out?

221
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,660
Last night,

222
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,530
I saw her wearing your mask.

223
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,450
It's your treasure.

224
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,520
You wouldn't have given it

225
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,500
to a regular girl.

226
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,290
I mean,

227
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,180
how do you know her name?

228
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,250
It's my turn to select a bride.

229
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,700
About their family backgrounds,

230
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,800
personalities, and names,

231
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,760
of course I know everything.

232
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,660
Don't worry.

233
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,730
I won't choose Miss Yun.

234
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,420
Brother.

235
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,470
What are you talking about?

236
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,540
Young Lord.

237
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,560
Young Master Ziyu.

238
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Lord Sword Wielder wants to see you.

239
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,760
Okay.

240
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,220
We'll be there soon.

241
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,010
Father.

242
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,650
I heard from them

243
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,860
that the identity of the assassin

244
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,410
has been exposed.

245
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,380
My brother and I...

246
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,190
Young Lord and I

247
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,870
planned to

248
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,710
use the mechanism in the secret tunnel to lure out the assassin...

249
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,230
I didn't expect you to have learned to lie.

250
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,600
How could Young Lord

251
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,370
be as stupid as you?

252
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,600
You fancied yourself as smart

253
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,970
and even want to get Young Lord involved.

254
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,420
Ever since I said I wanted to kill the brides,

255
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,180
it was already a trap.

256
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,260
Huanyu and I

257
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,580
had already discussed it.

258
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,200
Of course we can't kill all the brides.

259
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,400
Otherwise, there will be

260
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,910
no place in the martial world for the Gong family.

261
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,610
Then why did you

262
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,440
say those things to Ziyu?

263
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,990
He has been soft-hearted since he was little

264
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,450
and tender towards women.

265
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,140
If he knew I wanted to kill those brides,

266
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,920
he would try his best to save them.

267
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,900
Are you planning to use Ziyu to lure out the assassin?

268
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:47,010
Yes.

269
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:48,910
Yuanzhi.

270
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,250
I called you here

271
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,110
because I need your help.

272
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,080
I'm at your service.

273
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,470
Brother.

274
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,440
So,

275
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,200
you all knew this was a trap,

276
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,620
but you didn't tell me

277
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,030
and made me think I was being a hero?

278
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,400
-Let me tell you in advance.
-Ziyu.

279
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,410
With your temper,

280
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,670
what can you hide?

281
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,220
You're incompetent

282
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,120
and a failure.

283
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,200
Do you have that little faith in me?

284
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,450
Look at yourself.

285
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,250
You never focus on business.

286
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,740
All you know is to run to Wanhua Pavilion.

287
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,340
From inside and outside and head to toe,

288
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,270
what is trustworthy about you?

289
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,420
And what do you have in your hand?

290
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,830
Today, I realized

291
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,210
that there's something wrong with the Baizhi Jincao Tea

292
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,700
that's being sent to the Ladies' Hostel.

293
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,480
I suspect

294
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,420
that Gong Yuanzhi changed the formula without permission

295
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,680
to test the new medicine with the brides.

296
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,760
I did change the formula.

297
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:19,730
Ziyu.

298
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,960
Do you know what the effect of Baizhi Jincao Tea is?

299
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,530
To resist the poisonous miasma in the valley?

300
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,390
Then have you noticed that the poisonous miasma has been increasing?

301
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:36,220
You're always idle all day.

302
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,350
You never once asked about the affairs of the Gong family.

303
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,550
Of course you wouldn't have noticed it.

304
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,510
Because the miasma is getting worse

305
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,450
and the effect of the original formula is decreasing,

306
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:49,440
I asked Gong Yuanzhi to come up with a new formula.

307
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,620
Did you say he had no permission?

308
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,870
Do you think

309
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,840
all the Gong family's children are like you,

310
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,150
who fancy themselves as smart

311
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,080
and take action before reporting?

312
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:04,230
Reporting to Lord Sword Wielder.

313
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,420
Young Master Shangjue has entered the valley.

314
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,480
He'll reach the Gong residence soon.

315
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,570
Lord Sword Wielder.

316
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,070
I want to go and welcome my brother.

317
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,070
Please excuse me.

318
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,230
Okay.

319
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,090
You may leave too.

320
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,850
Go back

321
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,040
and reflect on your mistakes.

322
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,640
You're not young anymore.

323
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,540
You'd better think it over carefully.

324
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,260
If

325
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,660
you want to continue to be a useless person,

326
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,900
you don't have to stay in the Gong residence.

327
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,080
I don't really want to stay in the Gong residence anyway!

328
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,480
You...

329
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,550
Ziyu.

330
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,140
Where are you going?

331
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,000
Don't stop him!

332
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:38,950
Let him go!

333
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:39,740
Seriously.

334
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,320
I can't even say a word.

335
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,230
Father, Ziyu...

336
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,380
He should go as far as possible.

337
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,490
He'd better not come back

338
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,290
and he'd better not show up at the wedding tonight!

339
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,380
Father.

340
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,250
All right.

341
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,510
Go and get ready

342
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,850
for your bride selection.

343
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,610
Why are you still here?

344
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,440
Go.

345
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,110
Yes.

346
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,500
Lady Wuji.

347
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,440
I just saw that boy running away angrily.

348
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,780
Did he make the Sword Wielder angry again?

349
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,930
I'll have to trouble you to persuade my father.

350
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,550
On such a joyful day of Young Lord's bride selection,

351
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,640
why are you still fighting with Ziyu?

352
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,710
He's old enough to get married.

353
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,420
He's not the same kid who would just take your scolding.

354
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,150
You should at least let him preserve his dignity.

355
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,760
That brat.

356
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:58,180
When he was a kid, he was obedient.

357
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,360
But now that he's grown up,

358
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,030
he's getting more and more rebellious.

359
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,850
Whenever I see him,

360
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,360
I get enraged.

361
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,370
Tell me.

362
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,380
He's idle every day.

363
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,950
That's untypical of a son of mine.

364
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,670
You can say that in front of me,

365
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,610
but you must not say that in front of others,

366
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,090
especially in front of the two brothers, Gong Shangjue and Gong Yuanzhi.

367
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,960
You know

368
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,670
that's what he cares about the most.

369
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,080
In my opinion,

370
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,600
he is the most like you.

371
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,360
The two of you have the same temper

372
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,550
and are never willing to say what's in your hearts.

373
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,980
You clearly care about each other,

374
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,780
but you still refuse to admit it.

375
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:47,340
Listen to my advice.

376
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,040
Find a chance

377
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,370
to talk to him nicely.

378
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,810
You're not young anymore.

379
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,620
Just compromise.

380
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,610
I'm his father.

381
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,220
If someone has to compromise,

382
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,590
it should be him.

383
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,050
Fine.

384
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,070
He'll compromise.

385
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:08,490
Drink the soup first.

386
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:32,340
Before the bride selection ceremony,

387
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,580
the Gong family will arrange for a physician

388
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,380
to check all the brides' pulses,

389
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,670
evaluate your physiques,

390
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,720
and check for hidden diseases.

391
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,050
Then, he'll evaluate

392
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,500
your body postures.

393
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,320
After that,

394
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,020
you'll drink the Gong family's secret medicine to heal your body.

395
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,060
After all the assessments,

396
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,780
the three tokens will be issued.

397
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,150
The golden token,

398
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,910
the white jade token,

399
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,110
and the wooden token.

400
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,440
The brides who get the golden token

401
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,970
will stand in the first line

402
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,270
at the bride selection ceremony.

403
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:04,990
So, Yun Weishan,

404
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,070
you need to try your best

405
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,330
to get the golden token for yourself.

406
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,610
Why?

407
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,620
Why?

408
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,890
I actually got a wooden token.

409
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,070
At least give me a white jade token.

410
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,140
I really envy you.

411
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,770
Young Lord will definitely choose you.

412
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,140
That's not true.

413
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,390
Miss Yun has a golden token too.

414
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,860
Based on my understanding of Young Lord Huanyu,

415
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,010
he will definitely choose you.

416
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,810
He won't choose Miss Jiang.

417
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,270
Miss Yun.

418
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,340
Don't worry.

419
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,200
You know Young Lord very well.

420
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,700
We're all after him.

421
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,470
Of course we should know about him in advance.

422
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,270
You should stop pretending too.

423
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,730
Miss Yun.

424
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,050
Don't worry.

425
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,150
Even if Young Lord chooses Miss Jiang,

426
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,740
there's still the Gong family's

427
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,070
Young Master Shangjue.

428
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,180
Gong Shangjue is old now.

429
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:37,470
He wouldn't wait for the next bride selection.

430
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,850
Young Master Shangjue's prestige

431
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,290
is not lower than that of Young Lord.

432
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,860
Miss Yun.

433
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,110
You must want to be the wife of Young Lord,

434
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,580
right?

435
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,550
I don't care.

436
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,780
Young Master Shangjue is a nice guy too.

437
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,800
Not him.

438
00:30:59,010 --> 00:30:59,600
Why?

439
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,110
Because

440
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,050
I fancy Young Master Shangjue.

441
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,010
Open the door.

442
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,060
I said, open the door. I'm going out.

443
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,030
Young Master Ziyu.

444
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,410
Today is Young Lord Huanyu's wedding day.

445
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,140
All the gates have been closed.

446
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,420
The Sword Wielder

447
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,830
has banned anyone from leaving.

448
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,760
Here comes Young Master Shangjue.

449
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,540
If Gong Huanyu didn't choose me as his bride,

450
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,990
would that mean I failed my mission?

451
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,360
If you fail,

452
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:42,120
you die.

453
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,290
I just finished reading the file you submitted.

454
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,409
Sword Wielder.

455
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:35,770
Come on.

456
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,620
Sit.

457
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,360
Sword Wielder.

458
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,110
I can stand.

459
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,389
It's okay.

460
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,219
Sit down.

461
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,880
I'll make us some tea.

462
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:49,850
It's late.

463
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,679
Drinking tea now

464
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,610
may give you a sleepless night.

465
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,340
Don't worry.

466
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,380
I couldn't sleep well

467
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,540
a while ago

468
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,950
and asked Yuanzhi

469
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:02,770
to make me an herbal tea that helps me sleep.

470
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,200
Why don't you try it?

471
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,010
The herbal tea Brother Yuanzhi made.

472
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,270
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

473
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,250
Sword Wielder.

474
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:18,910
Let me do it.

475
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,310
The Zheng family of Hunyuan and the Phoenix Villa

476
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,260
refuse to bend to Wufeng.

477
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,140
They want to seek protection from the Gong family.

478
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:36,480
But…

479
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,930
I see your dilemma.

480
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,170
Since the accident ten years ago,

481
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,750
the Gong family has been keeping a low profile

482
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,570
and gathering our strength.

483
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,450
There's really not much we can do

484
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,240
to help those two families.

485
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,630
Zheng Zhongyi, head of the Zheng family,

486
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,890
is a friend of mine.

487
00:35:58,770 --> 00:35:59,760
I visited him

488
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,090
and explained the situation.

489
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,380
But

490
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:07,050
to continue their family line,

491
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,670
the Zheng family made their daughter,

492
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,470
Zheng Nanyi,

493
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,810
sign up for the marriage selection this year.

494
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,540
By this time,

495
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,840
she should have settled in the Gong Residence.

496
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,210
Thank you.

497
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,480
I just did my job.

498
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,980
I intended

499
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,210
to let you have a few days off.

500
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,440
But I sent for you at this late hour

501
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:33,610
because I have something important to tell you.

502
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,340
I'm all ears.

503
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,640
For the past decade,

504
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,410
the Gong family

505
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,910
has been accumulating wealth

506
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,020
at a steady rate

507
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,640
and become far richer than when the former Sword Wielder was in power.

508
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,840
Your contribution to the accumulation

509
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,230
of our family wealth

510
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,730
didn't go unnoticed.

511
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,810
The martial world thinks

512
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,070
that you

513
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,440
are the ablest one

514
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,940
among your peers in the Gong family

515
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,600
in terms of both martial arts and intelligence.

516
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,190
It's just empty fame.

517
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,030
Don't take it seriously.

518
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,800
Wufeng is afraid of you.

519
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,110
The martial world respects you.

520
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,590
But in the martial world,

521
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,000
in most cases,

522
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,720
fear

523
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,070
works better than respect.

524
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,700
Whether they fear or respect me,

525
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,460
it's because of the Gong family,

526
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,570
not me.

527
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,640
Shang, Jue, Zhi, Yu.

528
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,760
These four lineages

529
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,020
all have a role to play.

530
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:32,670
The Shang Lineage forges

531
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,250
and invents weapons.

532
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,610
The Zhi Lineage

533
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,150
creates all kinds of poisons and antidotes

534
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,200
that can be used with hidden weapons.

535
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,730
Brother.

536
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,940
These are the gunpowder and hidden weapons from the Shang Lineage

537
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,400
and the poisons and antidotes I made for you.

538
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,110
If you need anything else,

539
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,360
just let me know.

540
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,310
Of course.

541
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,950
The most important lineage

542
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,940
is the Yu Lineage

543
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,910
which runs the Gong family like a tight ship

544
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,910
so that I do my job outside

545
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,540
without worries.

546
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,360
Shangjue.

547
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,860
You

548
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,960
are a clever man.

549
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,160
I should apologize to you

550
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,740
for the decision I made back then.

551
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:13,990
The next

552
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,230
Sword Wielder should…

553
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,360
Lord Sword Wielder.

554
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,420
It's late

555
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,820
and I'm tired.

556
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,920
If you have anything to say,

557
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,350
just say it.

558
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,370
I've been thinking

559
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,650
about it for some time.

560
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,100
Father.

561
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,650
Father.

562
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,950
When you came in,

563
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,670
didn't the guards tell you

564
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,920
that I don't want to be disturbed now?

565
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,260
They did,

566
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,220
but it's something urgent.

567
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,080
Shangjue is not an outsider.

568
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,360
Go ahead.

569
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,420
I've found out the identity of the assassin

570
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,720
Wufeng planted in the brides.

571
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,710
She

572
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,160
is the second daughter of the Zheng family of Hunyuan,

573
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,890
Zheng Nanyi.

574
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,760
It's getting late.

575
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,000
I'll take my leave.

576
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,110
What should I do

577
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,470
if Gong Huanyu didn't choose me?

578
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,440
You have to figure that out yourself.

579
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,940
You're handy.

580
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,840
You'll find a way.

581
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,100
So, Yun Weishan,

582
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,460
you need to try your best

583
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,170
to get a golden token.

584
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,000
It'd be better

585
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:09,650
if you were the only girl getting it.

586
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,400
It's chilly tonight.

587
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,300
I'm afraid that you may catch a cold

588
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,160
and was about to close the window.

589
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,210
The wedding is coming soon.

590
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:47,810
Why is he going out?

591
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,110
Who do you mean?

592
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,770
Gong Shangjue.

593
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,350
Young Master Shangjue.

594
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,920
Who cares about him?

595
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:07,300
Just now,

596
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:09,990
I dreamed of my mother.

597
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,530
It must have been a beautiful dream.

598
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,000
People say

599
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,000
that dreams are the opposite of reality.

600
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,920
The more beautiful a dream is,

601
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:26,200
the sadder you will be after waking up.

602
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,350
Because dreaming of someone

603
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,070
means you can't be with them

604
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,380
or have lost them.

605
00:43:03,410 --> 00:43:04,440
Now,

606
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,490
I can only see my mother in dreams.

607
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:13,690
So it doesn't matter whether it's a beautiful dream

608
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:16,790
or a nightmare.

609
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,580
Miss Jiang, you're here too.

610
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,590
It's a private area.

611
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:47,650
Do not disturb.

612
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,270
How private?

613
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,830
Who am I disturbing?

614
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,240
Why don't you make it clear?

615
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,350
Jin Fan!

616
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:58,890
Eldest Young Miss.

617
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,040
I…

618
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,320
What a surprise.

619
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,940
You're here too.

620
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,870
Eldest Young Miss.

621
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,200
What are you doing here?

622
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,680
That's my line.

623
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:11,100
What are you doing here?

624
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,350
I'm here…

625
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,400
Oh, Jin Fan.

626
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,020
You look like a gentleman

627
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,590
but actually visited somewhere like this.

628
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:26,760
Do I look

629
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:27,830
exotic?

630
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:31,910
Very exotic.

631
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,430
Yellow Jade Guardian.

632
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:47,660
Seriously?

633
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,460
Gong Ziyu is a regular here but no one came to take him back.

634
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,820
This is my first time here

635
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,420
but a Yellow Jade Guardian came to take me back.

636
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,820
Maybe it's because Gong Ziyu didn't dress like you.

637
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,020
The Council of Elders

638
00:45:58,270 --> 00:46:00,670
wants Young Master Ziyu back immediately.

639
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,320
Sorry to disturb you this late.

640
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,910
I couldn't sleep

641
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,790
and saw the lights in Miss Shangguan's room still on,

642
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,280
so I came for a little chat.

643
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,080
Did I disturb you?

644
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:17,640
No.

645
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:19,370
I couldn’t sleep either,

646
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,520
so I came to chat with Miss Shangguan.

647
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,690
I thought

648
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,940
I was the only one who couldn't sleep.

649
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:30,350
It turned out that you can't sleep either, Miss Yun Weishan.

650
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:33,850
Earlier today,

651
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:37,000
I didn't get the chance to congratulate you

652
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,460
on becoming Young Lord's bride, Miss Jiang.

653
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:40,810
I envy you.

654
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,120
The fragrance in the room smells so good.

655
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,540
It's from an incense called Autumn Slumber.

656
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,740
It's a well-known incense

657
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,150
from my hometown.

658
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,070
Miss Jiang said she couldn't sleep,

659
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,710
so I decided to use it.

660
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,440
It helps with sleeping and calms the nerves.

661
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,690
If you like it, Miss Yun,

662
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:15,010
I have more.

663
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,390
Miss Shangguan

664
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,470
insisted on letting me try

665
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,110
some aged tea from her hometown in the middle of the night.

666
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:23,830
I'm afraid

667
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,290
I can't sleep well again.

668
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,750
But it's good.

669
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:28,850
The three of us can chat

670
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,030
and relax.

671
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,280
What were you talking about?

672
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,640
Why do you look like

673
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,010
you have been crying, Miss Jiang?

674
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:45,050
We were talking about

675
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:46,550
Miss Jiang's sweetheart.

676
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,300
Her sweetheart?

677
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:52,980
Miss Jiang

678
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,140
has a sweetheart in her hometown.

679
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,210
So she doesn't want to marry into the Gong family.

680
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:01,410
Tell me.

681
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,470
What can we do

682
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,170
to help her?

683
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:19,960
Miss Yun Weishan,

684
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:21,250
do you not like tea?

685
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,060
I'm a light sleeper.

686
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,350
Judging from the color of the tea,

687
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,220
it should be a strong tea.

688
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,540
If I drink this,

689
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,660
I'm afraid I can't sleep until dawn.

690
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:45,340
Please have it instead, Miss Jiang.

691
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,830
Don't be too upset.

692
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,610
It's bad for your health.

693
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:51,910
Yes.

694
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,030
Young Lord

695
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,910
has only temporarily chosen you.

696
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:58,040
The wedding has yet to be held.

697
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,810
Plans might still change.

698
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:05,110
It would've been great if Miss Yun were chosen instead.

699
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,820
It's rare for a bride of the Gong family

700
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,690
to have her heart elsewhere

701
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,350
like you, Miss Jiang.

702
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,120
They all say the Gong family is good.

703
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,570
It's a blessing to marry into the family.

704
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,990
After Miss Jiang is sent to the Yu Lineage tomorrow,

705
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,420
I'm afraid the rest of us

706
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,410
will be ushered out of the Gong residence

707
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,620
and sent home.

708
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,610
You won't be sent home.

709
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,020
According to the Gong family's rules of marriage selection,

710
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,100
even if you're not chosen by the young lord,

711
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,870
all the bride candidates will be

712
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,840
given a good family to marry to.

713
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,040
First, these bride candidates

714
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,780
are the daughters of the Gong family's allies in the martial world.

715
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:46,860
The Gong family cannot embarrass anyone.

716
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,190
Second, the Gong family is very cautious.

717
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,690
It tries to keep people who come here.

718
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,860
Miss Yun and Miss Shangguan, with your beauty,

719
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:57,820
you will certainly find a good husband.

720
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,230
I hope so.

721
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:00,910
Besides,

722
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,800
Young Master Shangjue

723
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,630
and Young Master Ziyu

724
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,420
are not married yet.

725
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,630
So don't worry.

726
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,100
Miss Jiang,

727
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:14,380
you are so nice.

728
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,080
I wish that

729
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,820
your dreams will come true, Miss Jiang.

730
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:32,390
After drinking this tea,

731
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,510
I should rest.

732
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:37,720
We should rest too.

733
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,710
-Did you do something again?
-Did you do something again?

734
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,770
Of course it has nothing to do with me!

735
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:02,670
They said that the Elders wanted to see Young Master Ziyu.

736
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:04,500
Am I Young Master Ziyu?

737
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:06,700
Forget it.

738
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,080
No matter what I do, I can't escape it.

739
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,510
Let's wait until we get there.

740
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:13,370
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

741
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,890
Don't you have a mirror in your room?

742
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:18,740
If not, you should drink more water,

743
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,010
so you can see your reflection when you relieve yourself.

744
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,210
It may be a good thing

745
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:24,240
if the Elders were meeting Gong Shangjue or Gong Yuanzhi.

746
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,040
But us?

747
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,510
You and me?

748
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,230
The last time I went to the Council of Elders,

749
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,760
they almost skinned me before they let me out.

750
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,500
Look at what you're wearing. They'll skin you for sure this time.

751
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,430
What do you know?

752
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:39,770
This is the latest autumn and winter style from Jiangnan.

753
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:40,610
It's classy.

754
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,430
Understand?

755
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,760
It's quite mixed.

756
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:45,120
But it's not classy.

757
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,200
I feel cold just looking at it.

758
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,140
You might be weak and sickly,

759
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,380
but the rest of the world isn't afraid of the cold like you.

760
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,370
Who was it?

761
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:55,000
Who cried eating ice in the hot June weather?

762
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,990
You don't have the right to feel cold for others.

763
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,840
I was only seven then.

764
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:01,070
By age seven, your development for the rest of your life is determined.

765
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:02,470
Stop talking about this.

766
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,540
I'm telling you, it's all your fault today.

767
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,670
If it weren't for you,

768
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:07,180
how could such a classy person like me

769
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,200
go to such an unclassy place?

770
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,230
Also,

771
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,030
can you stop taking Jinfan

772
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,530
to brothels?

773
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,200
You're leading him astray.

774
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,390
I'm leading him astray, so you'll have a chance with him.

775
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,430
I have a bad feeling.

776
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:29,530
The Yellow Jade Guardian

777
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,590
only accepts orders from the Elders.

778
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:34,200
Looks like we're in for some trouble.

779
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,620
Truly, you get to see everything if you live long enough.

780
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,320
Maybe I will even see

781
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,590
the Red Jade Guardian in this life.

782
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,240
Is there really a Red Jade Guardian?

783
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:52,790
I think the Elders lied to us.

784
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:54,340
To me, Red Jade Guardian

785
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,800
is just like Nuwa and Fuxi.

786
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:59,260
They are all people from myths and legends.

787
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,980
Why did you change the subject again?

788
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,840
Let me tell you.

789
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,800
Drop me off at the Gong residence.

790
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,980
I can’t accompany you to the Council of Elders.

791
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,180
They clearly stated that they want you.

792
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,800
I'll now cut ties with you.

793
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:10,940
Sorry.

794
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:11,900
Then get off now.

795
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,410
Can I?

796
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,700
Stop the carriage.

797
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,620
Why did my brother leave in such a hurry?

798
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,680
This mission was posted directly by Sword Wielder.

799
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,410
I don't know anything about it.

800
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:40,240
Besides,

801
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:42,300
there is no checkpoint along the way

802
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,500
to tell where Young Master Shangjue is.

803
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,230
He went out alone.

804
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:49,910
He even left you behind.

805
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:54,710
Why did the lantern on the tower

806
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:55,720
turn red?

807
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,270
A red light warning.

808
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,980
It's been years since the previous one.

809
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:16,220
Whose funeral is it?

810
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:17,130
What happened?

811
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:21,100
Brother.

812
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:22,960
Come back soon.

813
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,180
Something bad

814
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:30,330
is about to happen in the Gong residence.

815
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,750
All female guests come out of the room.

816
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:13,750
Count the number.

817
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,400
My lords,

818
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:25,910
are you

819
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,490
looking for Miss Yun Weishan?

820
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,150
She's resting in my room.

821
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,980
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

822
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,450
Because...

823
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:41,730
Miss Yun Weishan seems to have eaten something wrong.

824
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:43,530
She has rashes all over her face.

825
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,450
She doesn't want others to see her like that.

826
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:46,980
And...

827
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:48,910
It looks very scary.

828
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,270
She's afraid of infecting others.

829
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,200
Miss Yun Weishan.

830
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,460
Please show your face.

831
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:47,020
You said she's afraid of infecting others.

832
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,550
Then why is she

833
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:49,870
resting in your room

834
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,790
instead of her own room?

835
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,110
Why is she in my room?

836
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:56,970
Yes.

837
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,190
I'm asking you.
