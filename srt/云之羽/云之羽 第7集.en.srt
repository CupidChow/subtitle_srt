[Episode 7]

4
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,380
Although you fought me with a saber,

5
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:38,930
all your moves

6
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,400
were sword lunges.

7
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,259
Besides, I happen to know the sword technique you used.

8
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,120
It was Qingfeng Nine Moves Sword.

9
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,620
It's a top-class sword technique that Qingfeng Sect keeps secret.

10
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,500
And Qingfeng Sect happens to have surrendered to Wufeng.

11
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:51,960
Tell me.

12
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,620
Who are you from Qingfeng Sect?

13
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,150
I'm not from Qingfeng Sect.

14
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,350
Even the legitimate disciples of Qingfeng Sect

15
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,350
can only master three or four moves.

16
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,190
There are only few people

17
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,140
who can master all the nine moves.

18
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,660
Yet you were saying you're not from Qingfeng Sect?

19
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,630
Nonsense!

20
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,740
My mother

21
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,190
is just an ordinary woman.

22
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,380
Father has been a businessman all his life...

23
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,040
Cut it out.

24
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,970
You've played that card when you were launching the river lanterns.

25
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,760
My father has been a businessman all his life.

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,290
He travelled extensively.

27
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,500
Fourteen years ago,

28
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,360
when he was transporting goods by water,

29
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,620
he found a swordswoman

30
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,600
hiding in a secret cabin at the bottom of the ship.

31
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,750
She's the traitor

32
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,560
that Qingfeng Sect had been chasing,

33
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,350
who's known as

34
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,610
the rare swordsmanship genius that may only be found once in 50 years, Zhuo Mei.

35
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,670
You saved her life,

36
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,750
so she taught you Qingfeng Nine Moves Sword?

37
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,770
Actually, my foster mother had her self-serving reasons

38
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,660
for teaching me the sword techniques.

39
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,640
She wanted me to avenge her.

40
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,430
Back then,

41
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,620
Zhuo Mei fell in love with a young man

42
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,150
and violated the discipline of the sect.

43
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,680
The sect leader back then,

44
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,840
who was also her peer senior, Dian Zhu,

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,730
punished her severely.

46
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,530
Back then,

47
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,920
this incident shocked the whole martial world.

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,920
You must have heard about it, right?

49
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:22,850
Yes.

50
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,170
I heard from my mother that

51
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,620
Zhuo Mei's lover

52
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,820
lost his hands and feet, and had his mouth sealed.

53
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,620
He was almost lifeless when he was sent to Zhuo Mei.

54
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,380
It's said that Zhuo Mei couldn't handle the shock,

55
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,440
so she went out of her mind and killed a dozen people.

56
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,910
She ran away from Qingfeng Sect

57
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,240
with blood all over her.

58
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,940
Turns out Zhuo Mei who disappeared from the martial world

59
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,090
has been hiding in your place.

60
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,820
So you married into the Gong family

61
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,220
to take revenge on Qingfeng Sect with the Gong family's help?

62
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,190
Foster Mother passed away

63
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,870
a few years ago.

64
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,550
All those years,

65
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:13,230
she had been depressed and couldn't let it go.

66
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,710
Before she died,

67
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,680
she told my father that

68
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,560
if there's still a place that's peaceful in the world,

69
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,550
that is the Gong family.

70
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,680
All right.

71
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,380
Stop being sad.

72
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,960
Can I go to the back hill now?

73
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,440
Jin Fan.

74
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,390
If that trial

75
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:50,340
is really as dangerous as you said,

76
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,050
isn't it better

77
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,000
if someone takes care of Gong Ziyu by his side?

78
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,130
There's something

79
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,760
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

80
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,680
We're family.

81
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,430
Just say whatever you want.

82
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,190
I heard from

83
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,100
Shangguan Qian that

84
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,530
Young Master Shangjue and Yuanzhi

85
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,060
were very happy to know that

86
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,080
the Sword Wielder had entered the hill,

87
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,610
and they were talking about doing something.

88
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,220
I don't know the details about what they plan to do.

89
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,260
But they said

90
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,320
it wouldn't be easy for the Sword Wielder

91
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
to pass the first round of the trial,

92
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,650
so they'd have enough time to do it.

93
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh my god.

94
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
What good could they be up to?

95
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,810
They really said that?

96
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,620
We must hurry up.

97
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,930
Let's meet up tonight

98
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,310
and try to send Yun Weishan over to Gong Ziyu

99
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,120
first thing tomorrow morning.

100
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,780
However,

101
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,280
scent tracking is the hardest one.

102
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,860
Besides,

103
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,310
the longest time the scent can last

104
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,550
is only 12 hours.

105
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,320
-No.
-No.

106
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,690
If we want to find the Sword Wielder,

107
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,220
we must go in there tonight.

108
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,110
We may not be able to see him

109
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,280
tomorrow morning.

110
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,970
Ziyu.

111
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:18,810
Elder Yue.

112
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,480
Why are you here?

113
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,040
I'm worried that

114
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,380
you might be nervous

115
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,910
going through the trial for the first time.

116
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,070
So I'm here to walk with you for a while.

117
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,740
Ziyu.

118
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,280
According to the rules,

119
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,159
you have to cover your eyes.

120
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:37,610
Okay.

121
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,800
Give me your hand.

122
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,760
Come on.

123
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,300
Ah.

124
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,380
Slowly.

125
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,300
Jin Fan, where are you? Jin...

126
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,180
Jin Fan, you are here.

127
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,640
I've been looking for you.

128
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,450
I...

129
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,870
My Lady.

130
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,900
Can I help you?

131
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,620
Yes.

132
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,670
Let me ask you.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,770
Which color do you like the best, gold,

134
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,180
purple,

135
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,070
or golden purple?

136
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,030
I like neither gold nor purple.

137
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,940
I only like my green jade

138
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,670
and my black guardian uniform.

139
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,220
My Lady.

140
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,940
I still have a task to complete.

141
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,460
I don't have time to mess around with you.

142
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,320
You have a task?

143
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,480
You've always been inseparable from Gong Ziyu.

144
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,030
Now that he's in the back hill,

145
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,430
you should be on holiday.

146
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,990
During the holiday,

147
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,170
you should spend some time on nice things

148
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,680
and nice people.

149
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,260
Before the Sword Wielder left,

150
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,920
he asked me to keep an eye on

151
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,720
Gong Shangjue and Gong Yuanzhi.

152
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,630
Are they important?

153
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,580
They are not,

154
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,130
but the Sword Wielder is.

155
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,500
So

156
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,970
who's more important, me or Gong Ziyu?

157
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,500
Gong Ziyu.

158
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,630
This way.

159
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:34,940
Ah.

160
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,830
Wait.

161
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,690
Elder Yue.

162
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,450
What?

163
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,610
Are you making a detour?

164
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,200
Why would you say that, Ziyu?

165
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,170
We turned left three times in a row,

166
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,220
and we took similar number of steps each time.

167
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,500
So,

168
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,070
are we back to where we started?

169
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,880
Ziyu, you're smart indeed.

170
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,720
But you are still wrong.

171
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,660
What?

172
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:06,890
Am I wrong?

173
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,660
If

174
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,230
the height of the secret tunnel didn't change,

175
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,780
then as you said,

176
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,300
we'd have come back to where we started

177
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,490
since we took three left turns or right turns in a row.

178
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,940
But did you notice that

179
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,030
the secret tunnel

180
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,660
is ascending?

181
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,860
I kind of get it now.

182
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:25,930
Alas.

183
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,790
Ziyu.

184
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,620
They all say you are unruly and rebellious,

185
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,820
but I always think

186
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,270
you are gifted, smart, and kind.

187
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,470
You're also amiable.

188
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,440
You know the names of all the servants in the Gong family.

189
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,450
So they all

190
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,710
favor you

191
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,300
and care for you.

192
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,000
But

193
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,230
you are too young.

194
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,370
Sometimes,

195
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,620
you make rash judgments

196
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,740
out of overconfidence.

197
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,980
As the Sword Wielder,

198
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,340
this kind of rashness can be fatal.

199
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,220
Ziyu.

200
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,250
In your future life...

201
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:16,950
Here.

202
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:19,930
Look.

203
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,200
You'll have to

204
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,150
probe and advance in the dark a lot.

205
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,310
And by then, perhaps no one will guide you anymore.

206
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,470
Being alone in the dark,

207
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,700
no matter how hard it is,

208
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,410
you have to make the right decision.

209
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
I look forward to

210
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,740
the day you become the real Sword Wielder.

211
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,440
By that time,

212
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,920
I'll help you put on your Sword Wielder robe.

213
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:52,730
Jin...

214
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,440
Lady Wuji.

215
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,320
Why are you here?

216
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,030
I heard from the servants that you are here.

217
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,420
You are the Eldest Young Miss of the Gong family

218
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,060
and the lord of the Shang Lineage.

219
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,790
How could you follow a Green Jade Guardian around all day?

220
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,800
What a disgrace.

221
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,080
Jin Fan said he can't spend time with me since he has a task to complete.

222
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,520
If he said he has a task,

223
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,260
it must be something serious.

224
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,020
If you keep interfering,

225
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,950
he will only be more disgusted,

226
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,690
distant, and alienating.

227
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:29,920
I know.

228
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,320
But I just want to keep him company.

229
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,080
Have you heard

230
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,460
a joke rumored among the servants?

231
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,520
The lord of Shang Lineage has three things to do every day.

232
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,850
Eating, sleeping and looking for Jin Fan.

233
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,260
I also want to fulfill the responsibilities of the lord of the Shang Lineage,

234
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,280
but no one takes me seriously.

235
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,530
Father...

236
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,410
Father is just waiting for my younger brother to grow up.

237
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,300
Everyone knows that

238
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm just temporary.

239
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,750
My Lady.

240
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,020
Yes?

241
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,210
Tell me.

242
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,860
Why doesn't Jin Fan like me?

243
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,480
The world is vast.

244
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,010
Everything has a reason

245
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,840
and can be figured out,

246
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,260
except love.

247
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,480
Love is inexplicable,

248
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,410
and can't be forced.

249
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,740
But I must force it.

250
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,850
I must get Jin Fan to like me.

251
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,700
My Lady.

252
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,000
Check out the orchids.

253
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,820
This is the third time they've bloomed this year.

254
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,770
The Sword Wielder is so thoughtful.

255
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,930
I'll get the scissors,

256
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,460
lop several branches off,

257
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,390
-and put them in the vase.
-No need.

258
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,320
Throw them away.

259
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,380
Don't you always like orchids?

260
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,700
The flowers only bloom forcibly

261
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:31,090
after I've used all kinds of means

262
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,890
and tricks.

263
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,280
They smell bitter.

264
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,950
Ouch.

265
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,590
Ah.

266
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,530
Why are you so careless?

267
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,130
Don't move.

268
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,410
It's not a big deal if you want to force it.

269
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,230
I'm just afraid that you may hurt others

270
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,540
and yourself.

271
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,260
It seems to hurt

272
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,670
whether I force it or not.

273
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,470
Poor girl.

274
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,690
Sometimes, taking a step back works better

275
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,240
than pushing too hard.

276
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,110
If one day, you don't like him anymore,

277
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,200
maybe he'll start to like you.

278
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,930
By then,

279
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,100
Jin Fan will be the one to follow you around all day.

280
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,790
You will understand.

281
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,110
Ziyu.

282
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,830
What you are carrying is not your own fate,

283
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,280
but the future

284
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,090
of the whole Gong family.

285
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,700
No matter how hard it is,

286
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,010
you must make the right decision.

287
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,710
[Back hill of the Gong Residence, Xue Lineage]

288
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,860
Ziyu.

289
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,740
You may take off the black cloth and open your eyes now.

290
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,010
The entrance to the Xue Lineage is right ahead.

291
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,830
It's also the first realm you'll be facing.

292
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,660
If you have a thick coat with you, put it on here.

293
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,610
You'll be surrounded by snow and frost-covered leaves.

294
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,740
Keep yourself warm.

295
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,150
I'll stop here since there's someone waiting for you ahead.

296
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:20,330
Ziyu.

297
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:22,860
Take care.

298
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,070
Brewing wine with fresh tea.

299
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,350
Melting snow with birchleaf pear.

300
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,640
It's quite poetic.

301
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,180
Young Master Ziyu.

302
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,160
Or,

303
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,010
maybe I should call you Lord Sword Wielder.

304
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:08,609
Well.

305
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,310
Just call me Gong Ziyu.

306
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,060
It'll be more appropriate to call me Lord Sword Wielder

307
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,490
after I pass this round.

308
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,740
It won't be enough to pass this round only.

309
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,400
What's your name, please?

310
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,300
My surname is Xue.

311
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,579
Xue from "feng hua xue yue", as in the idiom describing romance.

312
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,510
You can call me Young Master Xue, Lord Sword Wielder.

313
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,220
So,

314
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,370
you are a descendant of Elder Xue?

315
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,330
Yes.

316
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,790
I've never heard Elder Xue talk about it.

317
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,780
No one of the Xue family

318
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,660
is allowed to leave the back hill except Elder Xue.

319
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,190
We live here all year long.

320
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,490
Of course he wouldn't talk about us.

321
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,990
What about your other clansmen?

322
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,250
Why are the two of you here by yourselves?

323
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,990
They're not part of your trial,

324
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,630
so there's no need for them to show up.

325
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,240
I grew up in the front hill.

326
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,880
I didn't know

327
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,140
the back hill of the Gong Residence is so extensive.

328
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,770
You are the Trial Keeper of the first round.

329
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,130
Does that mean

330
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,630
the other two clans

331
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,100
also live in the back hill of the Gong Residence?

332
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,270
Young Master Ziyu, you're quick-witted.

333
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,970
After you pass this trial,

334
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,800
you will get to know

335
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,930
the whole picture of the back hill, Lord Sword Wielder.

336
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,230
Looks like there are quite a lot of secrets

337
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,360
in the back hill of the Gong Residence.

338
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,440
It's getting late.

339
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,960
Rest early, Young Master Ziyu.

340
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,260
We'll officially start the trial

341
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,370
tomorrow morning.

342
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,650
There's no need to wait for tomorrow.

343
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,710
Let's start today.

344
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:41,710
I'm not tired,

345
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,210
and I don't need to rest.

346
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,930
I heard that you made a promise to someone

347
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,520
that you'd pass the trial in three months, Young Master Ziyu.

348
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,380
Is that why you're in such a hurry?

349
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,770
Not for that.

350
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,410
You should take a rest, Young Master Ziyu.

351
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,340
There's no rush.

352
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:00,770
Xue Chongzi.

353
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,480
Please.

354
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,740
The baggage is heavy.

355
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,830
I've prepared an outfit that you can move around easily in for you.

356
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:33,210
Thank you, Guardian Jin.

357
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,920
He's only giving this to you because it's his job.

358
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,080
It's not personal.

359
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,070
Don't overthink it.

360
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,870
Her Ladyship and I

361
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,870
will distract

362
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,330
the guardians at the entrance of the secret tunnel to the back hill.

363
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,050
Wait for the right time to enter.

364
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,480
There should be mechanisms in the secret tunnel.

365
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,300
Be careful.

366
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,780
Also,

367
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,200
before entering the back hill,

368
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,570
there's something I need to give you.

369
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,020
Young Master Yue asked me to bring him these herbs.

370
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,220
Please give it to him.

371
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,860
Help!

372
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,680
Oh my god!

373
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,570
It sounds like Eldest Young Miss.

374
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,480
Eldest Young Miss?

375
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,680
Help!

376
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,900
Are you not familiar with

377
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,430
Eldest Young Miss's voice?

378
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,270
How could I be familiar with it?

379
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,410
What do you mean?

380
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,980
I, Gong Zishang, am so beautiful,

381
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,950
gorgeous, and charming.

382
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,640
Am I going to die here today?

383
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,830
Come with me to save Eldest Young Miss.

384
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,590
Let's go!

385
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,870
[Feng]

386
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,510
The longest time the scent can last

387
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,780
is only 12 hours.

388
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,890
The longer the time, the lighter the smell,

389
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,910
and the harder it is to track.

390
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,580
You have to hurry.

391
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,750
The scent is already faint.

392
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,500
I can hardly smell anything but burning candles.

393
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,660
You can go.

394
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,920
I can handle it myself.

395
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:27,890
Oh.

396
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,740
So you can't speak.

397
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,290
But I don't know sign language.

398
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,540
Oh.

399
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,470
I got that.

400
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,560
There are fewer and fewer snow lotuses this year.

401
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,310
It seems the miasma in the back hill

402
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,630
is getting worse.

403
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,530
I wonder when the miasma will fade.

404
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,090
If the new Sword Wielder can ascend the throne as soon as possible,

405
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,820
I hope he can make a difference.

406
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,080
You have expectations for him?

407
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,840
Don't you?

408
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,990
When Gong Shangjue was trapped for 12 days,

409
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,510
he was almost lifeless when he came out.

410
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,300
His vitality was greatly damaged.

411
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,280
Even Gong Shangjue was like that.

412
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,960
How good do you think Gong Ziyu can be?

413
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,670
Let him try.

414
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,900
Go wake him up.

415
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,760
I'm ready.

416
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,630
Let's go.

417
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,270
You don't need to go anywhere.

418
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,730
Here is where the trial is.

419
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,720
Young Master Ziyu.

420
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,420
This is where the first round

421
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,350
of the Trial of the Three Realms is,

422
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,030
Ice Lotus Pool.

423
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,660
Ice Pool...

424
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,500
I heard it from the front hill

425
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,910
that you've had poor circulation since you were a kid.

426
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,940
You were born incapable of handling the cold.

427
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,550
Yes.

428
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,430
Everyone knows that I have cold intolerance.

429
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,070
This round wasn't deliberately designed

430
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,370
to target me, was it?

431
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,700
You're quite self-complacent, Sword Wielder.

432
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,000
The Ice Lotus Pool

433
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,610
has always been the first round for trial takers.

434
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:30,670
It's been like this

435
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,210
for over a hundred years.

436
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,390
The water here

437
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,230
is icy

438
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,040
and extremely freezing,

439
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,240
but it never freezes.

440
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,150
There's a box made of black iron at the bottom of the pool.

441
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,480
In it is the Xue family's Saber Scripture,

442
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,410
The Snow Three Moves Saber.

443
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,270
As long as you can dive into the Ice Pool

444
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,490
and get the Scripture,

445
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,290
you'll pass this round of trial.

446
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,960
Dive in...

447
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,590
If you think you can't do it,

448
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,130
just leave the Xue Lineage

449
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,660
and give up, Sword Wielder.

450
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,350
You don't have to be cornered

451
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,480
or suffer from it.

452
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,890
Loosen the soil over there more.

453
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,800
What are you doing?

454
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,040
Young Master Shangjue.

455
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,500
We're planting flowers.

456
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,750
Planting flowers?

457
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,950
Planting flowers...

458
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:37,710
Brother.

459
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,010
Miss Shangguan said

460
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,570
the orchids in the Yu Lineage bloomed.

461
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,970
They're very beautiful.

462
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,710
So

463
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,650
she gathered us to plant azaleas.

464
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,660
She said when spring comes,

465
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,670
they'd bloom even more beautifully than the orchids in the Yu Lineage.

466
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,990
You're speculating about my preferences again.

467
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,250
Why don't you kneel?

468
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,890
Brother wasn't asking you to kneel.

469
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,130
He was just asking why you didn't kneel.

470
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:44,190
Brother Yuanzhi, you're good at reading Young Master Shangjue's mind,

471
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:48,190
while Young Master Shangjue is good at putting people through the mill.

472
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,000
It's wrong whether I kneel

473
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,150
or not.

474
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,520
I grew up with my brother,

475
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,170
yet I dare not speculate about him.

476
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:06,230
Wipe your face clean.

477
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,550
The most important thing for a girl

478
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:10,430
is to be clean.

479
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,080
A clean family,

480
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,450
a clean face,

481
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,120
and clean hands.

482
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,660
You are right, Young Master Shangjue.

483
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,750
Remove all these messy flowers.

484
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,230
Only keep the white ones.

485
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,720
Young Master Shangjue said he only wants the white azaleas.

486
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,970
Sorry, everyone.

487
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,130
What's wrong?

488
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,030
Young Master Shangjue said he wants the white azaleas.

489
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:08,950
Yes.

490
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,280
Sorry that the whole morning's work went to waste.

491
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,410
No, Miss Shangguan.

492
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,510
It’s really something.

493
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,120
Yes.

494
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,510
I've been in the Jue Lineage for a long time.

495
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,380
I've only heard Young Master say no,

496
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,640
or what he didn't want.

497
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,820
This is the first time I've heard him say what he wants.

498
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,020
Yes, Miss Shangguan.

499
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,060
You've only been here for a short while,

500
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,990
and Young Master started to eat chicken and fish,

501
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,060
and he started to ask for things he wants.

502
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,990
What will it be like when you officially get married?

503
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,590
Stop making fun of me.

504
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,490
It must be because Young Master Gongjue couldn't bear to see

505
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,950
your hard work go to waste.

506
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,690
Sorry that I was reckless.

507
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,830
I'll go brew some sugared water for you in the kitchen.

508
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,550
Thank you.

509
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,480
Miss Shangguan.

510
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,340
Once the trial begins,

511
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,010
if you feel it's too hard,

512
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,870
get hurt,

513
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,790
or want to reconsider how to pass it,

514
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,190
you can return to your room anytime.

515
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,630
There's no limit to

516
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,520
when you want to try it again

517
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,380
and how many times you want to try.

518
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,280
However, if you leave the Xue Lineage halfway,

519
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,810
it means you fail the trial.

520
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,550
Young Master Ziyu.

521
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,310
Take care.

522
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,590
Although Yun prepared winter clothes for me,

523
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,010
I can't dive in the water with my clothes on.

524
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,440
Stop crying. Save your energy.

525
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,870
Otherwise, you'll feel colder.

526
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,860
His meridians are different from ordinary people.

527
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,100
He's born with poor circulation.

528
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,030
That's why he can't stand the cold.

529
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,110
So, shall we take him back and make adjustments to his meridians?

530
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,940
There're some snow lotuses left.

531
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,940
What adjustments?

532
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,340
He's from the front hill,

533
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,230
and he's not here for the trial.

534
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,340
He must have got in by mistake.

535
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,410
Just send him back.

536
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,530
So I've really been here.

537
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,620
Lady Wuji.

538
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,030
Young masters.

539
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:20,389
Why didn't you give me a heads-up before you came?

540
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,179
I didn't even get to prepare hot tea for you.

541
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,719
How rude of me.

542
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,239
My apologies

543
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,790
if we offended you, My Lady.

544
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,409
We're here

545
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,550
to talk about Gong Ziyu's background.

546
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,110
Have you forgotten?

547
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,429
I'm from the Yu Lineage.

548
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,780
Although I'm not Ziyu's birth mother,

549
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,909
everyone in the Gong family knows that

550
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,710
I'm Ziyu's mother nominally.

551
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:57,470
That doesn't stand in the way of our cooperation.

552
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,680
Cooperation?

553
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,700
Fair cooperation.

554
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,880
We each get what we need.

555
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,140
I've been in the Gong family for so many years.

556
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,670
I've got everything I want.

557
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,080
The Lantern Festival is coming.

558
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:18,800
Lady Wuji.

559
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,800
Don't you want to take a walk in the streets

560
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,130
and enjoy the lanterns?

561
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,120
I'm old.

562
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,590
I don't want to go to lively places anymore.

563
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,630
I don't mind it.

564
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,340
In this vast world,

565
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,980
there must be a quiet place where people rarely go.

566
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,160
Don't you want to

567
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,230
walk freely somewhere, Lady Wuji?

568
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,260
I can help you leave the Gong family,

569
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,150
and I promise that you can live carefreely ever after.

570
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,310
The Gong family

571
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,520
will never come to bother you.

572
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,450
Is Gong Ziyu's background

573
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,110
really that important to you?

574
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,160
I don't care about his background.

575
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,110
But if he wants to be the Sword Wielder,

576
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,060
I must find it out.

577
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,430
It's been a long time.

578
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,360
There are many details

579
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,240
that I need time to recall.

580
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,640
If you remember anything,

581
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,420
come to me anytime.

582
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,140
We'll leave now.

583
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,830
It's already midnight.

584
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,230
You're always up so late?

585
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,260
Time is money.

586
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,920
Then why are you busy

587
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,350
following Jin Fan around during the day all the time?

588
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,010
The "money" I was talking about

589
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,820
is Jin Fan.

590
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,040
I cherish every second I get to spend with him.

591
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,640
That's why I have to work hard at night.

592
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,800
Laugh if you want. No need to hold it in.

593
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,420
Others laugh at you,

594
00:37:25,790 --> 00:37:27,430
but I only feel sorry for you.

595
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,100
Could it be that

596
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,430
it's the other way around?

597
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,360
You're so tired, living like this.

598
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,170
Does Gong Shangjue ever say he's tired?

599
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,830
Does Gong Yuanzhi ever say he's tired?

600
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,070
The lord of a lineage shouldn't say he or she is tired easily.

601
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,400
But you are just a woman.

602
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,710
So what?

603
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:45,820
I'm the person who'll revitalize the Shang Lineage.

604
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,440
Among Gong, Shang, Jue, Zhi, and Yu Lineages,

605
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,290
Shang ranks first.

606
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,160
Anyway.

607
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,530
Anyway,

608
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,010
I must make my father feel that

609
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,830
having a daughter like me

610
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,390
is something to be proud of.

611
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,190
It's so dark at night.

612
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,820
There's not even a mouse here.

613
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,550
Who will see how hard you work?

614
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,440
They only see you following Jin Fan around all day.

615
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,060
They only think you're the Eldest Young Miss

616
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,970
who's obsessed with male charm.

617
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,660
I don't care what others think.

618
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,720
As long as I know what it is myself.

619
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,750
We should live for ourselves.

620
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,750
Are you living for yourself?

621
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,010
More like you're living for your father.

622
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,490
I'm sorry.

623
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,780
It doesn't matter.

624
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,930
Anyway, before anything's achieved,

625
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,660
I'll just work hard in silence.

626
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,940
I believe that

627
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,110
one day,

628
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,600
I will make it.

629
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,570
One day, you'll impress the whole world?

630
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:50,180
Wrong.

631
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,210
I'll shock the whole world.

632
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,310
What we are doing

633
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:55,600
is something as powerful as thunder and fire.

634
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:55,960
Yes.

635
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,120
Why did you say yes?

636
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,250
I was talking to him.

637
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:00,350
Yes.

638
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,250
I've got the herbs.

639
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:09,860
How about we brew them into medicine

640
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,860
and send it to him?

641
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,270
I heard from the servants that

642
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,450
he had tried several times.

643
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,650
His vitality has been greatly damaged.

644
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,580
If he can't take it, he can return to his room anytime,

645
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,060
get his mind straight and
his energy back,

646
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,190
and try again later.

647
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,280
You don't have to worry so much.

648
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,550
If only he's that

649
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,030
flexible and resilient.

650
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,800
If the rumors in the front hill are true,

651
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,530
he has a stubborn personality.

652
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,670
He'll definitely act tough.

653
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,320
Didn't you say the rumors in the front hill are untrustworthy?

654
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:47,790
You win.

655
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,960
Since you've got the herbs,

656
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,560
don't brew it into medicine.

657
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,080
It'll be hard to swallow.

658
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,460
Make him a bowl of medicinal porridge.

659
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,660
Put a snow lotus in it.

660
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,770
You seem to have a good impression of him.

661
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,350
I just don't want him to die in the Xue Lineage.

662
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,600
I'll go get the snow lotus.

663
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,230
Well,

664
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,600
should I get an ordinary snow lotus or...

665
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,850
You asked me this question.

666
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,700
That means you have a good impression of him.

667
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:24,750
You're even willing to give him the snow lotus in the Ice Pool.

668
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,470
Up to you.

669
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,750
I'll go check on the person we caught in the secret tunnel.

670
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,880
Where is this?

671
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,670
Somewhere you shouldn't be.

672
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,030
Are you from the front hill?

673
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,100
I'm from the Yu Lineage.

674
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,770
The Sword Wielder left in a hurry,

675
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,170
and he forgot something.

676
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,600
So I came to find him.

677
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,340
I accidentally got lost in the secret tunnel

678
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,000
and triggered the mechanism.

679
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,270
The fuel in the candles and torches in the secret tunnel

680
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,930
is a kind of special kerosene.

681
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:28,610
There is a small amount of poison in the kerosene.

682
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,180
If it stays in your body for long,

683
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,910
your limbs will become feeble,

684
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,980
and you'll become unconscious.

685
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,750
Here's the antidote.

686
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,020
Thank you.

687
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,700
I believe everything you said.

688
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,000
But tell me,

689
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,760
why are you wearing the black night suit of an assassin?

690
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,830
Elder Yue.

691
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,980
Are you going out at this hour?

692
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,500
Yes.

693
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,360
I'm going to the Meeting Hall.

694
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,140
Oh.

695
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,820
By the way,

696
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,230
send these books

697
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,510
to the Yu Lineage.

698
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,820
Ziyu told me

699
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,360
he had read all the medical books he borrowed from me.

700
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,690
These are all new books.

701
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,420
Ziyu is still going through the trial

702
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,060
in the back hill.

703
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,780
He can read these when he gets out.

704
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:38,620
Yes.

705
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,180
Ziyu.

706
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,770
Hope everything goes well for you.

707
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,870
The porridge will be ready soon.

708
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,560
I put a snow lotus in it for you.

709
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,170
This is something that's only available in the Xue Lineage.

710
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:31,060
It can help you regain your inner power

711
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,520
and strengthen your body.

712
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,750
The Fortnight Flies are

713
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,780
already starting to take effect.

714
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:49,180
So,

715
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:50,970
we have to get something important achieved

716
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,100
before the deadline

717
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,590
of the Fortnight Flies.

718
00:44:57,150 --> 00:44:57,800
Or,

719
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,440
do something that can satisfy Wufeng.

720
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,380
What you used is a sword technique, not a saber technique.

721
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,310
You're not from the Gong family.

722
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:30,720
[The Sword Wielder is injured. The Elder is dead. The dead is silent. The murderer is Anonymous. The best of men is like water. The sharpest saber has no blade.]
