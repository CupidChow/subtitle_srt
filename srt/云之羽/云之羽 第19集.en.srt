[Episode 19]

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,660
The elders said

5
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,210
before we have solid evidence,

6
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,050
we can't kill you

7
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,670
nor

8
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,560
can we cause permanent physical damage to you.

9
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:52,950
Neither can we

10
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,360
damage your appearance.

11
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,930
It seems

12
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,600
Gong Ziyu must've said a lot

13
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,080
in front of the elders.

14
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,880
However,

15
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:09,060
to make you suffer so much you'd rather die

16
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,710
while fulfilling

17
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,990
the three points above,

18
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,030
is not hard.

19
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,360
Did you see those wine?

20
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,890
Every cup of Yuanzhi's poisonous wine

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,579
can make you

22
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,040
regret coming to this world.

23
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,170
What do you want to ask?

24
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,100
Under the Sword Wielder's order,

25
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,100
I'm here to deliver food to Miss Yun.

26
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,280
How dare you disobey the Sword Wielder's order?

27
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,920
Guardian Kim.

28
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,350
Give it to me.

29
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,220
I'll inform them now.

30
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,980
Are you...

31
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,720
someone from Wufeng?

32
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,350
I am.

33
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,170
Sir.

34
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,070
Jin Fan is at the door.

35
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,360
He said he's here to delivery chicken soup

36
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,760
to Miss Yun Weishan according to the Sword Wielder's orders.

37
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,380
Chicken soup?

38
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,990
It's Herb Elixir chicken soup, right?

39
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,950
Gong Ziyu really loves you.

40
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,510
He's afraid that I would use poison to force a confession out of you

41
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,640
that he'd rather take the risk himself

42
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,570
and give you the Herb Elixir.

43
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,300
Unfortunately...

44
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,540
Confiscate it.

45
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,459
Yes.

46
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,950
Guardian Kim.

47
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,640
I apologize.

48
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,790
Young Master Gong Shangjue

49
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,470
doesn't allow for food to be delivered.

50
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,120
[Xue Residence]

51
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,500
Did you go to the front hill secretly?

52
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,540
No.

53
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,070
Yes.

54
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,320
I went to the front hill.

55
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,920
According to the family ban,

56
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,440
unless there is an emergency at the Gong family,

57
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,570
you can never step out of the back hill.

58
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,260
Have you forgotten the family rules?

59
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,280
Sword Wielder was in trouble.

60
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,230
Is that considered an emergency in the Gong family?

61
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,290
Ridiculous.

62
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:06,840
I was wrong.

63
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,320
Was it fun at the front hill?

64
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,050
Not really.

65
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,650
Compared to the snowy Xue Residence,

66
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,060
it's nothing.

67
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,240
It's actually really fun.

68
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,740
The front hill is very big.

69
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,770
I almost got lost.

70
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,000
It was fun.

71
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,230
I wonder if Sword Wielder is in danger.

72
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,190
The Sword Wielder is so smart,

73
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,900
I'm sure he can turn the tide.

74
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,240
I think...

75
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,820
Sword Wielder

76
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,190
is definitely in danger right now...

77
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,990
and needs our help.

78
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,010
Let's stop pretending.

79
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,670
Let's go!

80
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,660
They didn't allow me to deliver chicken soup?

81
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,470
Gong Shangjue guessed that there was Herb Elixir in it.

82
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,380
Zhiyuan's poison is so vicious.

83
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,140
I wonder if Miss Yun can handle it.

84
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,070
What do you think?

85
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,340
There are so many strong warriors

86
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,940
that can withstand stabs

87
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,000
but can't take any of Gong Yuanzhi's poison.

88
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,740
This can't do.

89
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,720
I have to break into the prison!

90
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,600
Break into the prison?

91
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,890
Just with the two of us?

92
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,650
I heard you're short of hands.

93
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,890
Why...

94
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,320
did you two come to the front hill?

95
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,570
A little boy

96
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,290
once lied to me that he would take me outside the Gong Residence

97
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,430
to watch float parades

98
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,630
set off sky lanterns,

99
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,190
and watch the beautiful world of fireworks.

100
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,210
Many years later,

101
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,820
although that man didn't fulfil his promise,

102
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,140
we still left the back hill

103
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,050
because of him.

104
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:08,990
Let's go.

105
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,300
Let's make a scene.

106
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,340
But...

107
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,380
you have to look for Gong Zishang first.

108
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,220
Why?

109
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,790
Do you want to take her with you?

110
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,450
She'll only cause trouble if you bring her along.

111
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,710
I must take her with me.

112
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,630
I need to borrow some gunpowder from her.

113
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,660
You go to Shang Lineage first.

114
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,060
I'll prepare something.

115
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,630
I will meet you in a bit.

116
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,210
Hey!

117
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:37,740
Ha!

118
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,530
Not bad.

119
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,020
I think there's room for improvement.

120
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,060
Young Master Hua.

121
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,510
What?

122
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,010
You're a playboy?

123
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,940
It's Young Master Hua.

124
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,000
The Young Master Hua of the three Hua Families of the back hill.

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,200
Who are you?

126
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,700
Xue Chongzi.

127
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,620
What are you doing here in the front hill secretly

128
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,740
instead of growing your Snow Lotus in the back hill?

129
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,460
This is against the rules of the back hill.

130
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,660
If I tell Elder Xue,

131
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,680
you're doomed.

132
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,610
Elder Xue is gentle and elegant.

133
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,230
He would scold me at most

134
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,460
and punish me to reflect on my mistakes.

135
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,250
But Elder Hua

136
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,230
is short-tempered,

137
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,850
and skilled in martial arts.

138
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,620
If he knows

139
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,300
you have sneaked

140
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,140
to the front hill time after timeâ€“

141
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,300
All right, all right!

142
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,299
Let's stop talking about it.

143
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,360
Let's call it even.

144
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,289
Goodbye.

145
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,030
Hey!

146
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,260
That won't do.

147
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,380
We happened to be looking for Eldest Young Miss

148
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,610
to do something big.

149
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,320
But this big thing

150
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,270
needs a helper.

151
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,770
Why don't you go with us?

152
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,430
Me?

153
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,120
What for?

154
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,710
Eldest Young Miss,

155
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,500
I would like to borrow something from you.

156
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,340
What is it?

157
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,200
Gunpowder.

158
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,900
It's you.

159
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,100
All right.

160
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,380
May I ask

161
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,250
where are we going

162
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,800
with so many explosives?

163
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,990
The wall behind the prison.

164
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,380
What are we going for?

165
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,570
I bribed one of the guards

166
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,290
and asked about the location of Yun Weishan's prison.

167
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,530
We blow up the outer wall

168
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,390
and rescue her.

169
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,100
-See you.
-See you.

170
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,540
Hey.

171
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,920
Do you know how many rules this is going to break?

172
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,940
My father will beat me up so bad my head swells up like a pig's.

173
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,780
Have you seen that big pig head

174
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,850
on the dining table during new years'?

175
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,050
I really can't. I'm going back to sleep.

176
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,390
Zishang!

177
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,280
I need you.

178
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,450
I, Gong Zishang,

179
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,390
am not afraid of death.

180
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,500
For the sake of my sister, Yun Weishan,

181
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:00,100
let's go.

182
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,880
Let's go!

183
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,500
It's here.

184
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,210
Oh, sorry.

185
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,960
Sorry for wasting time.

186
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,500
Where?

187
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,020
Behind.

188
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,460
Hurry!

189
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,310
Brother.

190
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,200
Did Yun Weishan confess?

191
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,740
Are you in some trouble?

192
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,710
Do you need me to goâ€“

193
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,410
Don't follow me. It's dangerous.

194
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,210
[New Moon]

195
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,480
Take Yun Weishan and leave first.

196
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,860
Yuanzhi!

197
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,600
Why are you covered in blood?

198
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,470
It's not my blood.

199
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,200
It's my brother's.

200
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:27,660
Hurry!

201
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,550
Brother!

202
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,620
Go get some guards over!

203
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,710
Go!

204
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,540
Do you need help?

205
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,020
No.

206
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,080
In my eyes,

207
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,530
you are my brother.

208
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,100
I'm not shy about it.

209
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,360
What are you afraid of?

210
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,540
Didn't you say

211
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,180
you were worried

212
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,470
and couldn't sleep yesterday night?

213
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,100
Go back and rest.

214
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,830
Young Master Shangjue is seriously injured.

215
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,250
How could I fall asleep?

216
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,380
How fake.

217
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,730
I knew who you are a long time ago.

218
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,480
A Gushan Sect descendent.

219
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,170
You married into the Gong family just for protection.

220
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,930
You don't love my brother at all.

221
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,800
So Young Master Shangjue has already told you about it.

222
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,660
It seems

223
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,510
he really trusts you.

224
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,200
Of course.

225
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,550
You and Gong Ziyu

226
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,030
are brothers.

227
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,900
Why are you

228
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,550
so ruthless towards each other?

229
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,550
In order to protect Yun Weishan,

230
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,350
Gong Ziyu rather injure his family.

231
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:44,950
Brother!

232
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,460
Shangjue has been worried that

233
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,420
there will be internal fights within the Gong family,

234
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,680
allowing Wufeng to take advantage of it.

235
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,620
If this causes

236
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,480
the Gong family to be fragmented,

237
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,940
Gong Ziyu will be the thousand-year sinner

238
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,040
to the Gong family.

239
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:14,099
From what I know about Young Master Shangjue,

240
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,190
even if he were besieged by Gong Ziyu and Jin Fan,

241
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,430
he wouldn't have been so badly injured.

242
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:24,390
That's if nothing went wrong with my brother's internal skill.

243
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,300
What happened?

244
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,070
The medicine has been applied.

245
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,070
I'll guard here.

246
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,690
Go back and rest.

247
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,330
Thank you, Yuanzhi.

248
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,490
Make some porridge for Young Master Shangjue.

249
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:58,510
Add some ginseng in it to help replenish his chi.

250
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,310
Remember to grind the porridge.

251
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,490
Yes.

252
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:03,210
By the way,

253
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,740
there are guards all over

254
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,800
the Jue Residence.

255
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,590
Why are they missing today?

256
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,380
At regular time intervals,

257
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,980
Young Master Yuanzhi will dismiss all the servants

258
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,290
and only allow himself to be by Young Master Shangjue's side,

259
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,150
saying that Young Master Shangjue needs to cultivate his inner skill

260
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,580
and can't be disturbed.

261
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,840
Oh.

262
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,080
How long

263
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,510
is this time interval?

264
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,630
Around...

265
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,430
half a month.

266
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,310
I see.

267
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:48,950
What if

268
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,150
our mission is the same?

269
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,980
July heat,

270
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,690
countless merits.

271
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,790
What if I tell you

272
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,510
I can give you

273
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,610
what you want?

274
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,350
How's that?

275
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,700
It depends on

276
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,300
what you want from me.

277
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,380
Kill Gong Shangjue.

278
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,330
You must be joking.

279
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,290
Both Gong Shangjue and the dead Gong Huanyu

280
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,940
are both Sword Wielder successors who

281
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,870
have both passed the three trials.

282
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,540
In the whole Gong family,

283
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,470
they are the two most highly skilled in martial arts.

284
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,230
In terms of strength,

285
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,160
the highest level Lang

286
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,690
may not even be able to handle them.

287
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,560
Do you expect me to do that?

288
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,250
What if I tell you

289
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,970
every half a month,

290
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,950
his internal skill will decrease significantly

291
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,500
and has at least four hours

292
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,740
with completely no internal skill?

293
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,670
It should be easy

294
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,320
to kill someone without any internal skill at all.

295
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,460
Which day is it?

296
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,790
What you want

297
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,660
is hidden in the back hill.

298
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,450
I'll tell you the exact location

299
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,570
when you have really killed Gong Shangjue.

300
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,950
How can I trust you?

301
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,470
You can gamble.

302
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,070
When you enter the Gong family,

303
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,110
will you fall in love with someone from the Gong family?

304
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,880
Impossible.

305
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,930
The Three Forms of the Moon Slash

306
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:00,860
are the New Moon,

307

Little Full Moon,

[New Moon]

Attack the enemy immediately after brandishing the sword

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,050
with the sword energy invisible.

313
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,030
It's of no trace

314
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,660
and is an all attack and no defence move.

315
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,460
The sword goes against the edge,

316
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,020
and the cloud goes on for miles,

317
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,770
the full moon comes up from the east,

[Little Full Moon]

319
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,860
with the wind not stopping.

320
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,660
and leaving absolutely no flaw.

321
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,260
The Little Full Moon is a sparring move.

322
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,520
It goes for a long time.

323
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,060
One hook and one push,

324
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,740
with the shadow and the sword's edge becoming one,

325
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,200
make the movements silent

326
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,660
and flawless.

327
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:48,930
The Crescent Moon kills cruelly.

328
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,390
The fire burns it to ashes,

329
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,020
and the path not left behind.

330
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,230
The heart beats with the mind,

331
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,360
combining into one.

332
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,400
The last move.

[Crescent Moon]

334
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,960
The Crescent Moon.

335
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,760
Everything is ready.

336
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:11,930
Let's set off.

337
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,010
What is this?

338
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,200
The moonlight is stable.

339
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,900
The moon shocks the ocean.

340
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,250
The aftermoon returns to its full,

341
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,280
killing the moon immortal.

342
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,570
This is what my father left me.

The Three Forms of Moon Slash sword technique.

344
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,150
I fought too hard with Gong Shangjue.

345
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,450
The sword is a little tired.

346
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,780
I suddenly remembered that there is

347
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,970
a top grade sharpening stone in my father's study.

348
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,230
So I came to look for it,

349
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,410
but found this silk bag

350
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,700
under the sharpening stone.

351
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,760
It seems that

352
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,720
he has been protecting you all this while.

353
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,370
Ziyu.

354
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,620
Lady Wuji.

355
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,570
I just came back from the ancestral hall.

356
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,530
I heard that you

357
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,210
blew up the prison in the middle of the night to save Yun Weishan.

358
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,830
The Gong family is in chaos.

359
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,480
Ziyu.

360
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,270
Is it worth it

361
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,650
for Yun Weishan?

362
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,620
Lady Wuji.

363
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,400
I don't want to lie to you.

364
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,880
But now,

365
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,870
I can't tell you the truth yet.

366
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,350
Later,

367
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,080
I'll tell you everything.

368
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,760
Okay?

369
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,830
You've grown up

370
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,710
and have your own ideas.

371
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,130
Since you don't want to tell me,

372
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,540
I won't force you.

373
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,760
You resemble your father so much.

374
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,750
Mei.

375
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,010
Really?

376
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,640
When you come back from the back hill,

377
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,410
I have something to tell you too.

378
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,690
Is that something you can't say at this moment too?

379
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,190
Yes.

380
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:35,860
All right.

381
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,890
When I return,

382
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,140
I will find a time to talk to you.

383
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,590
Like when you were a kid?

384
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,950
Eating candied haws

385
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,600
and talking to me on and on.

386
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,090
To be honest,

387
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,200
it's been a long time

388
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
since I've eaten your candied haws.

389
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,890
Do you want it?

390
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
I'll have it prepared for you

391
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,030
and you can eat it when you come back.

392
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,410
Okay.

393
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,150
You really dote on me.

394
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,280
I'm leaving.

395
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,420
Okay.

396
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,460
Take care.

397
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:17,640
You too.

398
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,990
Why did you make such a big fuss?

399
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,410
You went too far.

400
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,500
We were there to save people,

401
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,170
not to kill Gong Shangjue.

402
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,540
What should we do now?

403
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,710
Let go of my face first.

404
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,140
No way.

405
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:02,270
We didn't hit too hard either.

406
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,440
But we didnâ€™t expect that when

407
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,810
three of them to each use a form of the Three Forms of Snow Saber,

408
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,470
it'd be so powerful combined.

409
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,910
We went overboard cause we were too hasty.

410
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,570
Besides, Gong Yuanzhi's hidden weapons are indeed hard to deal with.

411
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:14,570
Where is Miss Yun?

412
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,050
She's been sent back to her room.

413
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,780
Where is Gong Ziyu?

414
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,060
He was just behind me.

415
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,760
He's gone.

416
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,450
Did he pass out in the yard after getting hurt?

417
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,820
Sword Wielder went straight to the back hill.

418
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,420
Again?

419
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,070
Again?

420
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,710
Do you think just because you are a bystander

421
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,110
you can just rub salt into my wound?

422
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,230
According...

423
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,570
According to the Gong family rules,

424
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,910
no one is allowed to disturb

425
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:48,710
or stop those who are participating in the trials.

426
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,460
So,

427
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,390
even if they want to punish the Sword Wielder,

428
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,210
they have to wait until the trial is over.

429
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,220
Once Sword Wielder passes the trial,

430
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,240
Gong Ziyu will be the legitimate Sword Wielder.

431
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,290
It'll be hard

432
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,490
to punish him then.

433
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,910
Letâ€™s go to the Elderâ€™s Hall

434
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,230
to buy some time now.

435
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,280
Young Master Hua,

436
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,410
go find your father.

437
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,500
Why are you here?

438
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,840
How inappropriate of you

439
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,170
to be dressed like this?

440
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,620
You disappoint me.

441
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,360
You have no talent.

442
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,010
And you have to waste your time

443
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,270
hanging out with Gong Zishang every day.

444
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,660
I turned a blind eye

445
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,680
and indulged you.

446
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,450
How dare you...

447
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,520
Are you trying to piss me off?

448
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,270
Father!

449
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,190
After so many years,

450
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,800
the Hua family has never developed

451
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,130
more powerful weapons.

452
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,380
Wufeng is getting stronger day by day.

453
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,660
I just want to develop stronger weapons

454
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,680
with Gong Zishang

455
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,570
to protect the Gong family.

456
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,370
Shut up!

457
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,350
You overestimate yourself.

458
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,810
You donâ€™t know your place.

459
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,870
The Hua family

460
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,960
is humiliated because of you.

461
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,410
Father!

462
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:17,980
Father!

463
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:32,140
[Jue]

464
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,070
Young Master.

465
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,210
Young Master Yuanzhi.

466
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,940
Gong Ziyu went to the back hill.

467
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,140
He's going to do the trial at this time?

468
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,950
Yuanzhi?

469
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,390
Brother.

470
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,560
Once Gong Ziyu enters the back hill,

471
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,090
we can do nothing about him.

472
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,560
I'll go stop him now.

473
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,240
Don't go.

474
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,180
He has learned

475
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,220
the Three Forms of Snow Saber and the Three Forms of Moon Slash.

476
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,420
You canâ€™t defeat him.

477
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,250
I may not be able to win

478
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,550
a proper fight.

479
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,840
But I don't believe

480
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,460
he can dodge by hidden weapon.

481
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,470
Didn't you see

482
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,890
who broke into the prison with him?

483
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,830
Young Master Xue,

484
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,370
Xue Chongzi,

485
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,710
Young Master Hua,

486
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,690
and

487
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,010
Young Master Yue who helped Yun Weishan cover her identity.

488
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,350
Although I don't know

489
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,370
how Gong ZIyu bribed them,

490
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,310
now,

491
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,100
he has the whole back hill supporting him.

492
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,850
Though the elders lean towards me,

493
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,460
they definitely don't want to see an internal conflict within the Gong family.

494
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,980
We can't confront Gong Ziyu.

495
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,900
What should we do?

496
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,530
Should we just let him

497
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,380
become the Sword Wielder like this?

498
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:51,970
No.

499
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,800
The existence of Yun Weishan

500
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,290
is Gong Ziyu's biggest weakness.

501
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,130
So,

502
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:03,350
you have to work with Shangguan Qian

503
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,800
and execute according to my plan.

504
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,240
Shangguan Qian?

505
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,540
Is she trustworthy?

506
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,710
Brother.

507
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,200
Just tell me your plan.

508
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,730
I will do it for you.

509
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,610
There are some things

510
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:25,680
that only she can do.

511
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,310
I'll do anything

512
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:35,710
for you.

513
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,150
Elder Hua.

514
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,760
You are smart.

515
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,600
You knew to come to the back hill immediately.

516
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,990
I need to remind you,

517
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,540
this third trial

518
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:26,360
is not as easy as the first two trials.

519
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,550
Many outstanding Gong family talents

520
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,510
failed on the third trial.

521
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,940
The closer one is to success, the more difficult it is.

522
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,340
Rest assured, Elder Hua.

523
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,940
I wonâ€™t take it lightly.

524
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,580
My son will relay

525
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,510
the content of the third trial to you.

526
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,150
Sword Wielder,

527
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,130
I will take my leave first.

528
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,890
Young Master Hua is really high and mighty,

529
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,960
and handsome.

530
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,180
But

531
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,360
you look totally different

532
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:13,230
from the servant I remember.

533
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,430
Keep your voice down.

534
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:15,890
My father hasn't gone far.

535
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,130
Are you so afraid of your father?

536
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:18,730
Of course.

537
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,800
Aren't you afraid of your father?

538
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,750
This sword is quite beautiful.

539
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,270
You have good taste.

540
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,340
This is my favorite sword.

541
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,760
The Hua famly

542
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,590
calls it Cloud Weaved Feather.

543
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,460
Because it's too light and too thin,

544
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,520
just like feathers

545
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,720
weaved with clouds.

546
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,950
Cloud Weaved Feather.

547
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,520
Can I have this sword

548
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,540
after I become the Sword Wielder?

549
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,820
If you pass the Trials of the Three Realms,

550
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,800
every sword here

551
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,240
would belong to you.

552
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:56,880
No need.

553
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,640
I only want this one.

554
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:27,989
Elder Yue?

555
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,780
You were poisoned by the smoke.

556
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:33,969
You're awake now.

557
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:43,090
The Sword Wielder blew up the prison

558
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:43,980
to save you.

559
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,530
In order to save you,

560
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,500
he's already against the whole Gong family.

561
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:54,790
So you can't stay at the Gong family anymore.

562
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,370
You must leave.

563
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,650
I know.

564
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,680
I'm a Wufeng assassin.

565
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,200
Although I didn't want to be one,

566
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,820
my hands are still full of blood,

567
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,710
and I've killed countless people.

568
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,510
The Gong family won't allow me to be the Sword Wielder's wife.

569
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,620
Don't worry.

570
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,680
I will leave.

571
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,520
For yourself,

572
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,340
you have to leave too.

573
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,310
You resemble Yun Qe.

574
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,660
Back then,

575
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,470
I was selfish

576
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,990
and kept her on my own accord.

577
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,730
But it ended up killing her.

578
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,010
I don't want the Sword Wielder to go through the same pain as I did.

579
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,980
Every time the blade falls,

580
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,940
I think

581
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,310
life

582
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,170
is just a breath.

583
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,030
In the moment of life and death,

584
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,260
pain is nothing but brief.

585
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,260
What's so scary about it?

586
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,830
But after Yun Que died,

587
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,970
I realized

588
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,920
it's not like that.

589
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,870
What life and death seperates

590
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,260
is the time where mountain flowers bloom vastly

591
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,660
but having no one to look at each other by my side.

592
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,410
It will be a rainy night with birds crying,

593
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,830
but no one to comfort my sadness.

594
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,740
It's the joy of being together with all three generations

595
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,140
to grow old together,

596
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:24,970
but I

597
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,420
cut off all the relationships and love in the world with my own hands.

598
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:32,580
Do you...

599
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,030
like me?

600
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,410
No I don't.

601
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,150
I can't atone

602
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,270
for the sins I carry.

603
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,920
But you are free now.

604
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,360
The Fortnight Flies are fake too.

605
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,580
You can leave Wufeng,

606
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,730
find a quiet place,

607
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,590
find a reliable person

608
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,670
and spend the rest of your life together.

609
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:15,180
I promised Wufeng to come to the Gong family...

610
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,770
to get freedom.

611
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,740
I don't want to hurt people anymore.

612
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,440
I can find a quiet place.

613
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,400
But I won't look for anyone

614
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,270
to spend the rest of my life with.

615
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,510
I already found them.

616
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:50,840
Before that,

617
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,530
don't let the Sword Wielder know.

618
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:55,890
Otherwise,

619
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,910
he won't let you go.

620
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,710
Don't worry.

621
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,140
But before that,

622
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,250
I want to spend more time with him.

623
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,950
For the last days,

624
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,350
I want to keep some memories

625
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,550
so that it can...

626
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,510
help me continue living my future days.

627
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,740
Do you see the knives in front?

628
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,270
The trial of the third realm

629
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,870
is to forge a new sword

630
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,950
with the Thousand-Year Xuan Iron.

631
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,220
Then I will choose one of these six swords

632
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,590
to fight with you.

633
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,900
If the sword you have forged

634
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,800
can break it,

635
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,590
the trial will be considered successful.

636
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,310
Six swords?

637
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,760
Then do I have to break

638
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,920
all six swords

639
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,400
or...

640
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,300
I just need to break one of them?

641
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,370
Six?

642
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Don't underestimate these swords.

643
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,980
It depends on who's wielding the sword too.

644
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,880
I know what you're capable of.

645
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,210
I think

646
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:17,210
you can't beat me.

647
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,650
As the saying goes,

648
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,460
a hero with his bare hands

649
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,240
is no match to a hot-headed man with strong weapons.

650
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,500
I'll tell you secretly later

651
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,030
the weakness of each sword.

652
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,870
Know yourself and your enemy, and never lose a match.

653
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:30,020
Then pick one

654
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,380
you think you can break.

655
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,150
The previous trial takers picked without knowing anything.

656
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,780
I'm helping you on the sake

657
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:37,740
of Gong Zishang.

658
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,280
Aren't I a good friend?

659
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,330
What you said can only deceive Gong Zishang.

660
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,170
You're just afraid

661
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,420
that I can't pass the trial

662
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,780
and when the elders question me,

663
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,780
you canâ€™t escape.

664
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,130
My goodness.

665
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,970
You have to pass.

666
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,510
The flowers haven't bloomed yet.

667
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,250
Why did you pluck them off?

668
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,950
Because only the flowers that haven't bloomed

669
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,620
will be remembered forever.

670
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,700
He likes white flowers the most.

671
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,930
I remember you said

672
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,920
he doesn't like flowers.

673
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,740
Why

674
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,480
does he like white flowers?

675
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,620
Shangjue doesn't like them.

676
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,030
The person who likes white flowers

677
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:12,810
is Lang.

678
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,470
In Shangjue's heart,

679
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,330
we who are alive,

680
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,960
can never compare to the dead Lang.

681
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,890
How did Lang die?

682
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:28,440
Lang

683
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,310
died ten years ago

684
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,390
in that winter which changed the Gong family.

685
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:04,430
Father.

686
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,070
Are you looking for me?

687
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,640
You're always in the Yu Residence.

688
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,510
Where is your home exactly?

689
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,980
People say

690
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,710
the Shang Lineage is the Yu Lineage's lackey.

691
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,730
You're admitting to it?

692
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,030
If you have this time,

693
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,070
you might as well take care of your younger brother.

694
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,950
Father, I was wrong.

695
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:45,940
You're wrong?

696
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,050
Unfortunately,

697
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,200
I'm useless now.

698
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,000
I can't do anything.

699
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:55,950
No, Father.

700
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,880
You still have me.

701
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,150
You can tell me anything.

702
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,060
As a woman,

703
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,510
what can you do?

704
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,090
The Shang Lineage

705
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,340
can only wait for your brother to grow up

706
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,420
before it can be revitalized.

707
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,110
Ten years ago,

708
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:26,180
the Cangdong Thunder Sect that formed an alliance with the Gong family,

709
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,980
in order to avoid Wufeng's hunt,

710
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,800
sought protection from the Gong family.

711
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,450
The Gong family has made an exception

712
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,780
to let the whole family of the Thunder Sect

713
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,240
into the Gong family.

714
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:40,830
But who would have thought that this was all Wufeng's trap?

715
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:43,720
They were all impersonated by Wufeng's masters.

716
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,490
During that attack,

717
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,520
the price the Gong family paid was high.

718
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,370
Those in my father's generation,

719
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:56,770
except Gong Hongyu and Gong Liushang who managed to survive,

720
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,240
the other Lineage Heads

721
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,720
and adult men

722
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,530
mostly died in the battle.

723
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,750
It was the biggest lineage in the Gong Family.

724
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,300
Now,

725
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,550
it has become a joke in the eyes of everyone.

726
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,760
What about the women and children?

727
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,680
They hid in the secret tunnel of the back hill.

728
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,140
Then why did Lang...

729
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:07,840
Mother.

730
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:11,230
Mother.

731
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,220
Brother...

732
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,910
Mother!

733
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,790
Brother.

734
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:32,480
Wufeng could not find a breakthrough point,

735
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,290
and had no choice but to retreat.

736
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,430
But the Gong family

737
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,510
also paid a huge price for that.

738
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,240
After that,

739
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:44,000
I've been living in the shadow of self-blame.

740
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,880
You were still young back then.

741
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,740
Why do you blame yourself?

742
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,430
Because

743
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:54,420
I was the last one to arrive at the secret passage.

744
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:58,180
The secret tunnel's gate reopened

745
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,440
because I was late.

746
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:05,440
Lang

747
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,300
took the chance to sneak out

748
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,830
to retrieve

749
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,340
the knife that his brother gave him.

750
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,760
I should be the one who died

751
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:23,740
instead of him.

752
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,600
If that's the case,

753
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,320
my brother

754
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,490
wouldn't have to suffer so much this life.

755
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:43,930
This kid has been different from others since they were young.

756
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,250
He likes bugs

757
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,240
and not people.

758
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,700
He didn't even cry when his father died.

759
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,620
He has no heart.

760
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,330
Just like bugs,

761
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:53,120
he's cold-blooded.

762
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,050
How did you get hurt?

763
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,350
I was scratched by the nail on the coffin.

764
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:38,050
You'd rather bleed

765
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,470
than cry?

766
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,260
Why should I cry

767
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,370
and shed tears?

768
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:52,160
Because bleeding can tell others

769
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,310
that your body is injured.

770
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,300
Crying

771
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,370
can tell others that your heart is hurt.

772
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,070
Sometimes one can't tell if

773
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:04,820
you are sad

774
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,520
and you need tears to tell others that.

775
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:10,230
Why should I tell others that?

776
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,890
You can get other people to help share the burden

777
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,090
and give you comfort.

778
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,190
But a bleeding wound

779
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,470
doesn't need others to share the pain and give comfort for.

780
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,940
It's probably because the wound can scab

781
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,110
but sadness

782
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,640
can never heal.

783
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,050
After that,

784
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:44,250
he gave me this knife.

785
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:46,580
He treated me as his brother

786
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,340
and asked me to learn martial arts with him.

787
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,540
My brother...

788
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,070
went somewhere else.

789
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,560
Don't cry.

790
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,170
I'll be your brother.

791
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,500
Wait for me here.

792
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:12,820
I'll go find a knife.

793
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,650
I'll be right back.

794
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,050
Don't go.

795
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,840
I won't leave.

796
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:30,830
You don't leave too.

797
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,640
â™«The sunset light fallsâ™«

798
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,610
â™«A little ink on my heartâ™«

799
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,030
This knife

800
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,020
is for you.

801
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:40,000
â™«Two ties of grudges becoming into three lives of mistakesâ™«

802
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:38,990
Really?

803
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:43,880
â™«The childhood musicâ™«

804
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,140
I can also practice swordsmanship too!

805
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,570
â™«Singing about and old friend's songâ™«

806
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:47,580
I can also practice swordsmanship too!

807
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:51,770
â™«What can we do about this guest?â™«

808
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:53,430
Why are you so happy?

809
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,180
â™«Whose songâ™«

810
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:56,260
Because no one has ever given me a gift.

811
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,930
â™«Is matching every line?â™«

812
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,450
Do you want me to give you something too then?

813
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:02,370
â™«Fold it gently as the wound spreadsâ™«

814
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,300
â™«We share the same hand and feetâ™«

815
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:09,130
â™«And the same bloodlineâ™«

816
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,510
I've already received the best gift.

817
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:10,640
â™«How do weâ™«

818
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,060
â™«Tell the two of us apartâ™«

819
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:19,940
â™«Brotherâ™«

820
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,050
Although Brother gave me this knife for Lang

821
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:24,990
â™«You teach me not to cryâ™«

822
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,150
to me,

823
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:26,930
I know...

824
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:27,630
â™«Brotherâ™«

825
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,980
â™«You see through the worldâ™«

826
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:31,240
Do you think something new is always better than the old one?

827
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:33,990
â™«But don't understand whyâ™«

828
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,540
In his heart,

829
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:35,330
no one can replace Lang.

830
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,060
â™«I am sadâ™«

831
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:51,230
So what?

832
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,200
I'm his brother now.

833
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,440
So I have to do better...

834
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,180
than anyone else.

835
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:07,490
You've already been doing a good job.

836
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:11,950
No.

837
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:15,830
If I did well enough,

838
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,680
Brother should be

839
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,460
smiling all day.

840
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,110
Like you,

841
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,120
I am also doing my best to do things

842
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,800
just to see him smile.

843
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,570
But it seems

844
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,180
I never know

845
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,840
what he really wants.

846
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,570
In his eyes,

847
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:49,580
there is the martial world's loyalty,

848
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,170
the family's burden

849
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,450
and the Gong family's reputation.

850
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,150
But

851
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,930
there isn't he himself.

852
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,440
I grew up with him.

853
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,480
It seems that

854
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,410
he has never pursued anything.

855
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:13,700
Until he met you.

856
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,340
I envy you.

857
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,560
And am thankful to you too.

858
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,620
Because you made Brother,

859
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,240
for the first time,

860
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,450
have something he wants to pursue himself.

861
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,420
Really?

862
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,100
When people get close to a tall tree,

863
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,440
they always talk about

864
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,520
how its branches are flourishing

865
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,580
and many fruits are bearing.

866
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,090
People always see its amazing appearance

867
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:06,460
but no one

868
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,450
pays attention to the huge

869
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,420
yet silent roots.

870
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,370
The roots

871
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,210
are buried in cold...

872
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,090
and dark mud.

873
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:20,950
Deeply digging into

874
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,080
the hard land

875
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,570
with no complaints and no regrest.

876
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,700
It is also these roots

877
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,410
that no one cares about

878
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:36,930
that supported all the power to thrive pwards

879
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:39,530
and wither.

880
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:42,480
And my brother

881
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,160
is the quiet root.

882
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,000
I raise insects and grass.

883
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,080
I often dig into the soil

884
00:55:58,510 --> 00:55:59,510
to look for herbs.

885
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,430
Every time I dig the root of a tree,

886
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,010
it's as if I saw its heart.

887
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:12,950
I can feel that he looks strong,

888
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,880
but is soft inside.

889
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,840
From now on,

890
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,070
he can show weakness,

891
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,760
and doesn't have to act tough.

892
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:30,790
He has me,

893
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:35,780
and you.

894
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:47,410
But others don't allow it.

895
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:54,590
The martial world doesn't allow it.

896
00:56:58,170 --> 00:56:59,940
People who see you as God

897
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,130
will not like you

898
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,930
who are trapped in the dust.

899
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,180
It's so heavy?

900
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:31,260
So this is the Thousand-Year Xuan Iron  used to forge swords.

901
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,950
It's indeed extraordinary.

902
00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:36,690
You need someone to help you forge the sword.

903
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:39,090
You can bring your Green Jade Guardian

904
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:40,290
to the forgery place.

905
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,360
My Green Jade Guardian...

906
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:45,670
Jin Fan.

907
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:48,970
But he swore

908
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,560
he would never enter the back hill again.

909
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,540
I've already applied.

910
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,350
For the trial of this realm,

911
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:57,300
he can enter the back hill with you.

912
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,560
The Council of Elders has sent someone to inform him.

913
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,820
He should be on his way to the Hua Lineage.

914
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,020
This is also on the sake of Gong Zishang?

915
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,670
You're taking such good care of me.

916
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,500
I should say thank you.

917
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:13,880
I hope you can still say this

918
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,400
after you finish the forgery.

919
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,970
I heard

920
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:26,090
Gong Ziyu has passed the second realm.

921
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,020
Father,

922
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:28,570
yes.

923
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:30,070
Humph.

924
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,450
He can't

925
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,700
pass the third trial.

926
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,420
Gong Ziyu has passed the first two trials smoothly.

927
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,080
The third trial is different from the first two.

928
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:50,340
Back then,

929
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,420
I lost to my weakness

930
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,400
on this trial.

931
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:02,010
To use my personal guard as a sacrifice

932
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,900
is not something I can do.

933
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,580
Using your personal guard as a sacrifice?

934
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,020
Father.

935
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:10,900
What do you mean?

936
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,990
Since ancient times, it's said that great weapons come from the souls of talents.

937
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,680
The ancestors think

938
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,230
this soul

939
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,640
comes from the sacrifice of a living person

940
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:27,640
for their faith and believes to be adhered to it.

941
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,470
The soul of a personal guard

942
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:36,850
can represent killing the enemy and protecting the master.

943
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:46,570
Sword Wielder,

944
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:47,380
I'm late.

945
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,100
I've prepared the food and water we need for these few days.

946
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:51,700
See if we need anything else.

947
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:53,620
No need.

948
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,000
Sirs,

949
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,660
the third realm's trial begins.

950
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:59,230
Good luck.

951
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:14,170
Gong Ziyu.

952
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,560
I hope you can succeed

953
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:21,230
but also hope you can fail.

954
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,480
Gold leaf kite?

955
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,110
My god.

956
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:33,070
The family rules are going to be broken again.

957
01:00:58,900 --> 01:00:59,660
Lie down.

958
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:00,320
Don't move.

959
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:13,110
I didn't expect

960
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,280
you'd take the same path as me.

961
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,650
Since you've made your choice,

962
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,030
just stick to it.

963
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:30,190
Do you regret it?

964
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:34,880
Never.

965
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:45,780
Do you know about the Fortnight Flies?

966
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,610
You are very lucky then.

967
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,880
Wufeng hasn't started to

968
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:56,980
control you with the Fortnight Flies

969
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,600
during your generation.

970
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:03,170
You have never experienced the pain of the Fortnight Flies too.

971
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:06,370
But if you were physically and mentally tortured,

972
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,100
and that you knew that once you betray someone,

973
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,660
you will definitely die,

974
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,050
would you have still chosen

975
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,470
to enter the Gong family?

976
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:25,940
Are you afraid of death?

977
01:02:29,110 --> 01:02:30,410
Everyone dies.

978
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:34,530
A worthy death

979
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:39,350
will make their hearts at peace.

980
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:42,650
What we fear is

981
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:45,650
dying for no reason.

982
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,910
I won't change my choice

983
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,510
even if I get to do it again.

984
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:58,070
I don't think you would have either.

985
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:03,230
Ziyu is a trustworthy person.

986
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:05,760
I watched him grow up.

987
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:10,110
I've treated him as my own son.

988
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,340
So I hope you won't let him down...

989
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,020
and hurt him.

990
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:30,280
What about you?

991
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:33,420
When are you going to tell him

992
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,480
you're Anonymous?

993
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:38,590
You are also hurting him

994
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:42,320
by hiding it from him like this.

995
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,130
I'll tell him everything

996
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:55,190
after he passes the Trial of the Three Realms.

997
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,080
The box outside

998
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:03,040
was a gift from the former Sword Wielder

999
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,520
for his daughter-in-law.

1000
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,320
I'll give it to you now.

1001
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,550
Think about what I said.

1002
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,070
Don't let the people who love you down.
