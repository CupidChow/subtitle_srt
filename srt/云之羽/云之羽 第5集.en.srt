[Episode 5]

4
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,040
Tomorrow morning,

5
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,500
Gong Shangjue's messenger pigeon

6
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,960
will fly back into the Gong's residence with the information.

7
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,680
Yes.

8
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,400
I know.

9
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,120
Are you ready?

10
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,170
Just waiting for the result.

11
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,190
There's nothing to prepare.

12
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,180
What if the result is different

13
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,870
from what you expected?

14
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,550
What if we made

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,760
the wrong bet?

16
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,440
It can't be helped.

17
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:35,910
It can.

18
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,490
Take someone as hostage,

19
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,220
and escape unscathed.

20
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,030
Everyone in the Gong family is unfathomable.

21
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,860
Even the Eldest Young Miss

22
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,500
whom we

23
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,700
normally take lightly of,

24
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,010
we may not even be her match.

25
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,210
Then take hostage of someone

26
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,920
that you think will most likely succeed.

27
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,760
Who is that?

28
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,110
Me.

29
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,180
You?

30
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,140
Why do you think

31
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,060
Gong Family would spare

32
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,750
an assassin from Wufeng for you?

33
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,660
Do you think Gong Shangjue chose you

34
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,579
because he really loves you?

35
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:42,640
He doesn't love me.

36
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,290
He only loves himself.

37
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,250
Do you know why he chose me?

38
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Because the jade pendant on my waist

39
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,250
belongs to him.

40
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,890
He must be curious

41
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,770
why I have this jade pendant.

42
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,240
So before he figures this out,

43
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,440
he won't let me die so easily.

44
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,200
You're gambling.

45
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,960
You are, too.

46
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,010
We're all gambling.

47
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,470
What if we lose?

48
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:39,980
Regardless of whether Gong Shangjue

49
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,440
cares about my life or not,

50
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,580
I believe

51
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,500
you won't really hurt me.

52
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,420
Killing me

53
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,790
will do no good to you.

54
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,409
With your ability,

55
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,330
you can't kill me.

56
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,580
At most, you can only hurt me.

57
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,640
If you hurt me,

58
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,270
it's even better.

59
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,380
Run away if you hurt me.

60
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,590
If you can survive after you run away,

61
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,040
count yourself lucky.

62
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,400
If you die,

63
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,670
it's even better.

64
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,270
It can further prove that I have nothing

65
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,920
to do with Wufeng.

66
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,640
You have already planned everything, haven't you.

67
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,150
Two wolves disguised as dogs,

68
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,820
sneaking into a herd of sheep.

69
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,850
If one of the wolves is exposed,

70
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,520
the other wolf

71
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,300
should bite him immediately.

72
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,420
The remaining wolf

73
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,480
will become a dog forever

74
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,980
and become one with the herd of sheep,

75
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,220
eating one sheep a day.

76
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,220
No one will suspect

77
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,450
that fake dog.

78
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,870
Because it once killed a wolf.

79
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,730
You're really amazing.

80
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,120
If your identity is exposed,

81
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,960
before you die,

82
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,860
wouldn't it be good

83
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,250
to protect me?

84
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,880
Besides,

85
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,140
this is just the worst scenario.

86
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,890
If Wufeng had already made necessary arrangements for your identity,

87
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,950
then none of this

88
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,050
would ever happen.

89
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,380
You're so cold-blooded.

90
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,130
I thought you would have emotions.

91
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,930
Why are we at the Gong Residence?

92
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,170
To make friends?

93
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,750
Calling

94
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,610
each other sisters everyday...

95
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,540
Really made you think we are sisters?

96
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,600
Come to your senses.

97
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,270
Are Mei people

98
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,980
so cruel?

99
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,930
That's because you haven't seen

100
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,110
Wang and Liang.

101
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,890
Miss Yun Weishan and Miss Shangguan Qian,

102
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:29,020
please head to the Sword Wielder Hall.

103
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,950
It's late.

104
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,360
Why are you summoning us

105
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,750
in such a hurry?

106
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,280
I heard that the identity of you two

107
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,970
have been sent back to the valley ahead of time.

108
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,140
After verification,

109
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,010
Miss Shangguan Qian from Dafu City's identity is verified.

110
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,470
There is nothing unusual.

111
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,130
After verification,

112
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,530
Miss Yun Weishan from Lixi Town's identity

113
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,030
is inaccurate.

114
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,460
Young Master Shangjue,

115
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,020
what's inaccurate about my identity?

116
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,170
I have a few questions

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
I'd like to ask you first.

118
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,140
Go ahead.

119
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,120
On the day you left home,

120
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,000
did you meet with thieves in your residence?

121
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,250
There was indeed a thief who came to rob.

122
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,270
We lost some gold and silver jewellery.

123
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,410
Fortunately, no one was injured or killed.

124
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,810
Why didn't you report it?

125
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,820
We encountered bad people and evil things on my wedding day.

126
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,550
It felt a little inauspicious.

127
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,770
I was afraid that the Gong Family would not like it.

128
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,570
Also, my family was not injured.

129
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,450
I thought it was a small matter,

130
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,390
so I hid it.

131
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,960
Please punish me, Sword Wielder.

132
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,400
It's human nature.

133
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,790
I understand.

134
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,940
That's all you found?

135
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,540
Just with this trivial matter,

136
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,010
you are saying her identity is not accurate?

137
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,000
The guards from Gong Residence

138
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,700
went to Yun Weishan's hometown,

139
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,430
Lixi Town.

140
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,850
Do you know this Miss Yun Weishan?

141
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,850
With the portrait the painter drew,

142
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,920
they went to ask Yun Family about her.

143
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,400
However,

144
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,760
no one recognized your portrait.

145
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,430
Ziyu.

146
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,270
This...

147
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,820
is not a trivial matter, right?

148
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,230
Miss Yun,

149
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,260
did you really lie to us?

150
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,570
Do it!

151
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,770
Remember what I said.

152
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,310
No matter what,

153
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,940
you have to hold firm to your identity.

154
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,660
I grew up in the Yun family in Lixi Town.

155
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,160
I've seen the portrait by the painter.

156
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,190
The painting and strokes are exquisite.

157
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,360
My neighbors

158
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,820
and the servants in my residence

159
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,650
wouldn't have not been able

160
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,580
to recognize me from the portrait.

161
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,660
I don't understand why they'd say that.

162
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,080
Unless...

163
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,810
Unless it is a different portrait

164
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,740
that you have brought to show them.

165
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,890
If Young Master Shangjue thinks my identity is fake,

166
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,210
you can kill

167
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,940
or arrest me.

168
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,420
I have nothing to say.

169
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,110
But I am the eldest daughter of Lixi Town's

170
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,680
Yun family, Yun Weishan.

171
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,470
Why are you so nervous?

172
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,540
Miss Yun's identity...

173
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,210
Isn't this Miss Yun Weishan?

174
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,740
Nanny, are you getting old?

175
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,600
Is your eyesight deteriorating?

176
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,020
It's painted so well.

177
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,710
Gosh.

178
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,250
It really is Weishan.

179
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:15,810
Gosh.

180
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,880
My goodness.

181
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,600
Miss Yun's identity...

182
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,580
was verified.

183
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,520
It was just a pressure test.

184
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,180
Please forgive me.

185
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:30,610
After all,

186
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
you're the bride chosen by Ziyu.

187
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Of course I should be more cautious.

188
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,460
By the way, Miss Yun.

189
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,820
After you left home,

190
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,950
your mother missed you very much.

191
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,440
My men have already conveyed that

192
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,870
you're doing well in the Gong Family.

193
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,480
Madam Yun wants to pass you a message.

194
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,810
She said...

195
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
being able to enter the Gong Family,

196
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,360
and be chosen by Ziyu,

197
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,320
is your luck.

198
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,800
Miss Yun,

199
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,180
you must serve Young Lord Hanyu

200
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,000
well.

201
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,700
This matter has been concluded.

202
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,110
There is no problem

203
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,550
with Yun Weishan's identity.

204
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,900
Both ladies' identities

205
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,690
are fine.

206
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,070
This matter

207
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,490
will end here.

208
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,140
They are fine,

209
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,620
but I'm not sure about you.

210
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,530
Jin Fan.

211
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,100
Go get Housekeeper Jia.

212
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:38,790
Yes.

213
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,690
Housekeeper Jia,

214
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,170
tell them everything

215
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,760
you've told me before.

216
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,450
Yes.

217
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,610
The person who ordered me

218
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,690
to replace the Ethereal Flowers needed for the Herb Elixir

219
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,830
with Spirit Herb...

220
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:07,890
was...

221
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,270
Young Master Yuanzhi.

222
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,290
Bastard!

223
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,470
What nonsense are you talking about?

224
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,490
Hold it!

225
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,160
How inappropriate!

226
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,860
Who ordered you to frame me?

227
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,340
Speak!

228
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,000
Yuanzhi.

229
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:24,860
Housekeeper Jia.

230
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,660
Make it clear!

231
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,140
When Young Master gave the order,

232
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,620
I thought he had developed

233
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,070
a better prescription

234
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,610
and that there was a replacement.

235
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,470
I didn't know

236
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:37,040
the former Sword Wielder and Young Master would die because of this.

237
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,160
Otherwise, I wouldn't have dared to

238
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,930
no matter how bold I am.

239
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,850
Please be fair.

240
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:46,940
Brother.

241
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,600
I didn't do it.

242
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,330
It's all Gong Ziyue who bribed this bastard servant

243
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:52,990
to frame me.

244
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,800
Both Yuanzhi and Housekeeper Jia have differing statements.

245
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,130
We shouldn't be biased.

246
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,630
This is an important matter.

247
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,310
How about

248
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,680
we imprison Housekeeper Jia to interrogate him first?

249
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,140
See if there was someone

250
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,460
who was trying to set someone up.

251
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,410
We have witness and evidence.

252
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,070
What's there to interrogate?

253
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,860
Besides,

254
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,250
you said we shouldn't be biased.

255
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,870
We should interrogate both of them together.

256
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:18,520
Sure.

257
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,030
I'll leave Yuanzhi to you.

258
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,970
Feel free to interrogate him any way you want.

259
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,290
There are tons of poisons in Zhi Lineage that will make life worse than death.

260
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,690
It's not impossible that you'd end up

261
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:25,570
forcing a false testimony out of him.

262
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,300
Whatever method or poison we use,

263
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,990
you can do the same too.

264
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,820
If you don't have it,

265
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,920
I can get someone to send it from the Zhi Lineage.

266
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,540
-Stop!
-Housekeeper Jia.

267
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,090
Oh no.

268
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,840
Sword Wielder!

269
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,320
Fool.

270
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,420
[Gong]

271
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,329
Gong Yuanzhi!

272
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,930
I'm afraid he'd run away.

273
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,520
You're trying to kill him among the chaos

274
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,490
so the evidence will be destroyed along with him!

275
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,119
Gong Ziyu,

276
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,200
you're someone of the Gong Family after all.

277
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,240
Aren't you afraid

278
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,290
you'd be laughed at for saying something like this?

279
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,340
My secret weapon

280
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,250
is laced with paralysis poison.

281
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,260
It just made his meridians stiff and him unable to move.

282
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,640
He died from the poison pouch between his teeth that he bit.

283
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,700
That's but a one-sided statement!

284
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,220
Send the body to the clinic,

285
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,690
-and you will know after an examination.
-Of course I will.

286
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,200
But before the truth comes out,

287
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,800
you can't be rid of suspicions.

288
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,290
He ran away in fear of his crimes just now.

289
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,550
Isn't that enough to prove my innocence?

290
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,690
Since Gong Yuanzhi is the most suspicious now,

291
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,220
we should arrest him first.

292
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:58,780
Brother.

293
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,300
We'll have to bother the elders

294
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,870
to dispatch Yellow Jade Guardians for the investigation.

295
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,800
If it's proven that it's really done by Gong Yuanzhi,

296
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,540
we can't let him off easily.

297
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,040
But if we find out that

298
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,250
someone is setting up Yuanzhi,

299
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,230
or torture him to get a statement,

300
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,050
or even use poison to murder him,

301
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,000
I will make them pay with his life.

302
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,720
No matter who it is.

303
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:36,700
Brother.

304
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,260
I'll listen to you.

305
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,790
Jin Fan.

306
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,750
Take him away.

307
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,170
Yes.

308
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:50,880
Let go!

309
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,750
I know the way to the prison.

310
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,180
I can walk by myself.

311
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,010
By the way,

312
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,740
if you need any medicine,

313
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,200
I can get someone to have it delivered to you.

314
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,270
What are you angry about?

315
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,720
Gong Shangjue is too overbearing.

316
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,150
No matter what, you're still the Sword Wielder.

317
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,150
He completely...

318
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,610
Disrespects me.

319
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,660
I know.

320
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:15,990
Not only him,

321
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,140
in the eyes of the elders,

322
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:23,050
I don't deserve to be the Sword Wielder either.

323
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,790
In terms of status,

324
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,300
ability,

325
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,560
and morality,

326
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,900
I don't deserve to be the Sword Wielder.

327
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,950
If it weren't for the family rule for the inheritance that can't be breached,

328
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,590
I believe the elders

329
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,130
would have also chosen Gong Shangjue.

330
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,130
Sword Wielder...

331
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,870
When the poisonous smoke exploded just now,

332
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,890
it was Shang Gongjue who

333
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,220
stood in front of the elders immediately.

334
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,210
In his eyes,

335
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,490
family bloodline

336
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,070
always comes first.

337
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,420
And my internal force

338
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:12,660
is not enough to even dispel the poisonous smoke in the hall.

339
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,700
If Gong Shangjue weren't here today,

340
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,050
the consequences would be unimaginable.

341
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,880
It's laughable.

342
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,690
I'm the Sword Wielder,

343
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,130
yet I don't even have the ability to protect everyone.

344
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,050
Father.

345
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,680
I'm cold.

346
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,940
Why isn't Huanyu cold?

347
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,770
You slack off every time you practice.

348
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,630
You don't deserve to be the son of the Sword Wielder.

349
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,290
The elders have taken the Herb Elixir.

350
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,490
They will be fine.

351
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,220
But my father and the others

352
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,730
also took the Herb Elixir.

353
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,430
Take it.

354
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,480
Brother.

355
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,360
Yes?

356
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,020
I really don't like wielding swords.

357
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,450
Fighting and killing all day messes with my mind.

358
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,050
You should at least learn to protect yourself.

359
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,680
Is Wufeng...

360
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,770
really that scary?

361
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,410
Yes.

362
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:52,930
Brother.

363
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,630
You'll protect me, right?

364
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:56,600
Of course.

365
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
What about you?

366
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,810
Don't you have anyone you want to protect?

367
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,680
No.

368
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,650
Don't you want to protect your family?

369
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,100
My family is stronger than me.

370
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,020
They don't need my protection.

371
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,530
You have to protect

372
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,650
the girl you like, right?

373
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,020
I don't have one either.

374
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,610
There will be one.

375
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,740
You don't have to find excuses for me.

376
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,050
Maybe...

377
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,570
I just don't deserve it.

378
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,070
Sir,

379
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,910
there is a secret compartment in the drawer.

380
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,450
You leave too.

381
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:26,260
[Clinic
Housekeeper Jia's room]

382
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,630
Mei...

383
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,490
All these years,

384
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,120
has no one succeeded before?

385
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,650
No.

386
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,460
In the past 20 years,

387
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,310
everyone who sneaked into Gong Residence

388
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,330
has gone missing.

389
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
Not a single news.

390
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,010
No body was found either.

391
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,100
As if they disappeared into thin air.

392
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,780
Except...

393
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,680
Except for Yun Que.

394
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,250
Are you still upset about Yun Que's death?

395
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,580
She's my only sister.

396
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,930
All the more

397
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,530
you have to take revenge on the Gong Family for her.

398
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:54,170
Since you know that there is no chance of winning sending people into the Gong Family,

399
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,290
why do you keep sending people to die?

400
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,490
We thought we had no chance of winning too.

401
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,730
But someone succeeded.

402
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,090
Their success changed everything.

403
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,150
22 years ago,

404
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,690
they successfully sneaked into the Gong Family,

405
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,750
but no one heard from them ever again.

406
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,010
When Wufeng assumed that their identity was exposed and had died

407
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,740
they delivered a message back.

408
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,680
This is the first assassin

409
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,850
since Wufeng's establishment,

410
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,740
that was able to deliver a secret letter from within Gong Residence.

411
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,950
That secret letter

412
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,540
changed everything.

413
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,860
The marriage selection?

414
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,450
Yes.

415
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,290
The Gong Family's marriage selection is quite an event,

416
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,750
but it keeps a low profile.

417
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,030
The gossip among the martial world

418
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,630
are just groundless rumors.

419
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,460
But the letter of Anonymous

420
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,330
proved all speculations.

421
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,770
And

422
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,890
they mentioned the most important thing of all,

423
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,260
that the next marriage selection of the Gong Family

424
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,580
will be in 20 years.

425
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,710
It's been almost 20 years

426
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,770
since I entered Wufeng.

427
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,330
It was also from then on

428
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,630
that all the new members of Wufeng

429
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,370
became women.

430
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,630
Is this person

431
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:28,750
still alive?

432
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,230
I don't know.

433
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,350
Since then

434
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,040
we've never heard from them.

435
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,110
The Gong Family pushed the marriage selection

436
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,470
to be before 20 years.

437
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,240
It seems

438
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,450
this person has been exposed.

439
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,470
Who are they?

440
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,180
Because they're too special,

441
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,300
their identity

442
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:49,990
age,

443
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,740
gender,

444
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,340
and name,

445
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,290
are strictly sealed.

446
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,200
The confidentiality is high.

447
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,930
I'm afraid not many people

448
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,340
knows about them within Wufeng.

449
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,930
So everyone calls them

450
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,370
Anonymous.

451
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,360
I didn't expect Anonymous

452
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,020
is able to live in the Gong Residence for so long.

453
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,100
No matter how long they've lived, they're about to die now.

454
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,960
Since the token has been exposed,

455
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,790
the Gong Family will definitely

456
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,650
continue to trace down this clue.

457
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,860
The Gong Family can think of

458
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:25,750
what we can think of.

459
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,620
It seems

460
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:30,720
this Wufeng spy

461
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,750
has been hiding for many years.

462
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,100
On the night before the marriage selection,

463
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,710
he got a chance

464
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,370
to switch the previous Sword Wielder and

465
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,030
and Young Lord's Herb Elixir.

466
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,630
With Zheng Nanyi, the Wufeng spy that managed to sneak in,

467
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,690
they collaborated

468
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,900
and completed this assassination.

469
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,270
Yes.

470
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,680
Since it's Wufeng who is doing this,

471
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,280
we can't fall for their attempt to sow discord among us.

472
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,800
The Gong Family always prioritizes our bloodline.

473
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:01,010
It is inevitable that we will face instability as we transition between the former and current Sword Wielder.

474
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,080
We shouldn't

475
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,100
doubt each other in our bloodline,

476
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,700
and lose our harmony.

477
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,480
Wouldn't that be exactly what Wufeng wants?

478
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,110
From now on,

479
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,940
the Gong Family should never show anything as disgraceful as internal feuds.

480
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,500
This will be the end of it.

481
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,310
The world has been notified of the change of

482
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,970
Gong Family's Sword Wielder.

483
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,930
It will be taking it too lightly

484
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,600
if were to change it again now.

485
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,230
But

486
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,110
for a useless man

487
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,880
to be taking the position of the Sword Wielder,

488
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,340
will only make Gong Family

489
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,940
a laughing stock in the martial world.

490
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,000
Who are you calling a laughing stock?

491
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,620
All the former Sword Wielders

492
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,120
were selected from the most outstanding

493
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,520
heirs of the Gong Family.

494
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,830
Even I,

495
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,850
and the former Young Lord Gong Huanyu

496
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,060
had to successfully pass

497
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,700
the Trial of the Three Realms at the back hill

498
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,450
to get the

499
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,230
candidacy of the Young Lord.

500
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,380
In terms of martial arts and wisdom,

501
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,350
in terms of expectations of the martial world,

502
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,090
Gong Ziyu

503
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,700
doesn't deserve the position.

504
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,240
He managed to take on this position

505
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,830
taking the advantage of

506
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,760
the ancestral rules due to sudden occurrences.

507
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,570
Elders,

508
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,990
if we want to follow the rules,

509
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,250
the rule that the successor

510
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,090
must pass

511
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:15,910
the Trial of the Three Realms at the back mountain,

512
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,510
should also be adhered, right?

513
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,580
At that time,

514
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,920
it was urgent.

515
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,890
That was the only way.

516
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,590
But now,

517
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,580
we have plenty of time.

518
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,060
If Ziyu can pass the Trial of the Three Realms

519
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,310
in a month,

520
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,140
I'll accept his position as the Sword Wielder.

521
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,310
One month's time.

522
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,310
You might as well just

523
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,740
take away my position as the Sword Wielder.

524
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,220
Why make things difficult for me intentionally?

525
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,550
If you can't pass, it can only mean that it is injustifiable.

526
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,720
And the martial world is dangerous.

527
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,260
Wufeng

528
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,800
is eager to get rid of the Gong Family.

529
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,190
How can a weak Sword Wielder

530
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,310
protect the bloodline of the Gong Family?

531
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,090
It's only natural

532
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,020
for you to pass the Trial of the Three Realms.

533
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,350
How did it become

534
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,790
I'm making things difficult for you?

535
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,780
One month is putting him on a tight spot.

536
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,210
Shangjue,

537
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,670
I remember you took three months

538
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,500
to prepare for the Trial of the Three Realms.

539
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,840
Three months then.

540
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,160
Lest Elder Yue thinks I have bad intentions.

541
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:33,980
Ziyu...

542
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,850
Three months then.

543
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,290
There's no precedent of a Sword Wielder

544
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,950
participating in the Trial of the Three Realms.

545
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,750
What if an accident occurs during the trial?

546
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,040
What are you afraid of?

547
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
We will just follow the ancestral rule

548
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,290
for the heir next-in-line to inherit.

549
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,140
There are many people in the Gong Family.

550
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,820
Wishing you all the best.

551
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,820
You don't need to.

552
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,340
I won't let you down.

553
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,540
I will pass the test.

554
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,250
You should

555
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,040
wait until you get to the back mountain to say that.

556
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:34,700
Hey!

557
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,330
Where are you going?

558
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,460
Just wandering around.

559
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:39,990
Oh...

560
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,900
Liar.

561
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:44,770
You are going to pick up Miss Yun, right?

562
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,760
Why do you ask if you already know?

563
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,240
You're so thirsty.

564
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,930
I'm still mourning now,

565
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,500
I can't talk about marriage easily.

566
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,460
But I can't just...

567
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,520
leave Miss Yun in the Ladies' Hostel.

568
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,090
Her identity has also been verified.

569
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,330
I plan to take her back to the Yu Lineage for a peace of mind.

570
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,820
An unmarried man and woman

571
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:06,060
living together before marriage...

572
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,300
The world is getting worse.

573
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,630
I can't agree with that.

574
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,490
What dirty things

575
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,820
do you have on your mind?

576
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,350
Don’t say that about Jin Fan.

577
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,430
-What?
-Huh?

578
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,090
All I have in my mind is Jin Fan.

579
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,660
You only worry about Jin Fan all day.

580
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,340
You're not worried about your brother who has to go through the trials.

581
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,090
whether he is in danger,

582
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:25,950
or will he fail?

583
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,540
Your conscience has been eaten by a dog.

584
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,900
Why are you talking about Jin Fan again?

585
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,180
What?

586
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,920
Infinite Heat?

587
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:37,880
Yes.

588
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,120
Infinite Heat.

589
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:43,300
The Wufeng assassin that sneaked in among the brides

590
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,500
has been identified.

591
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:45,870
She is...

592
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,300
the second daughter of the Hunyuan Zheng family,

593
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,040
Zheng Nanyi.

594
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,800
When I interrogated her personally just now,

595
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,200
I found something amiss.

596
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,010
Just tell me the result.

597
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,080
I found a secret letter

598
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,310
on Miss Zheng.

599
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,300
The letter mentioned

600
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,739
Infinite Heat.

601
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,070
Are you sure?

602
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,139
Infinite Heat is the top secret of the Gong Family.

603
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,380
How could it be leaked?

604
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,360
Infinite Heat...

605
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,050
If it falls into the hands of Wufeng,

606
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,190
there will never be peace to the Gong Family.

607
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,590
In the front hill,

608
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:52,320
other than the Sword Wielder,

609
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,370
and the three Elders,

610
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,730
the only people who knows about Infinite Heat,

611
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:58,890
is you and me.

612
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,790
You suspect me?

613
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,740
I suspect

614
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,450
anyone possible.

615
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,590
You're not less suspicious than I am.

616
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,050
Enough!

617
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,460
We should not doubt

618
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,730
among the Gong Family bloodline.

619
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:18,830
Have you forgotten

620
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,380
our ancestors' teachings?

621
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,480
We must investigate it immediately.

622
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,030
But!

623
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,000
Don't let anyone know for the time being.

624
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,300
The Zheng Family's trump card is in the hands of Young Master Shangjue.

625
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,160
If Young Master Shangjue investigates it himself,

626
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,390
he should be able to find out the truth.

627
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,290
Shangjue.

628
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,990
Outside the valley,

629
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,660
you're the one most looked up to.

630
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,460
You have the most means and methods too.

631
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,460
I will count on you

632
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:47,350
to make a trip to the Zheng Family.

633
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,450
Understood.

634
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:50,820
Huanyu,

635
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,260
bring the female assassin here now.

636
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,500
I want to interrogate her myself.

637
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:57,880
Yes,

638
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,590
Father.

639
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,370
I can't believe it.

640
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,510
I still don't understand

641
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,520
how a bride who just entered Jiuchen Valley

642
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,810
would know about the Infinite Heat?

643
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,740
Fortunately,

644
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:23,180
the secret letter did not mention too much about Infinite Heat.

645
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,820
I think Wufeng didn't get much information.

646
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,880
It's not a big crisis.

647
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:28,550
No.

648
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,820
I'm sure you elders are aware of

649
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,180
the power of Infinite Heat.

650
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,490
Just by letting the people of Wufeng know

651
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,090
the existence of if,

652
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,940
is already the biggest crisis Gong Family has had

653
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,400
in over hundreds of years.

654
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,120
By the way,

655
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,820
since we've identified Housekeeper Jia's identity,

656
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,810
can I release Yuanzhi

657
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:55,320
from the prison?

658
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:57,710
Of course.

659
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,860
Of course.

660
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,190
Brother.

661
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,160
Let's go.

662
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,800
The Trial of the Three Realms

663
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,280
is essentially the battle of the Young Masters.

664
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,390
It has been difficult in the past years,

665
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,910
and many had suffered casualties and injuries.

666
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,040
Those who can pass three trials at once

667
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,920
are the cream of the crop.

668
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,260
The last people who passed the Trial of the Three Realms

669
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,060
were your brothers Gong Huanyu and Gong Shangjue.

670
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,950
Father told me

671
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,170
Gong Shangjue was the first person

672
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,570
to pass the three trials.

673
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,410
Huh?

674
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,690
Then why was Huanyu

675
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,030
the one who became the Young Lord?

676
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,780
This is the first time I've heard of it.

677
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,140
Because the Sword Wielder and the elders

678
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,620
all thought he was more suitable to inherit the position of the Sword Wielder.

679
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,360
What?

680
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,980
Could Gong Shangjue agree to that?

681
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,210
Of course not.

682
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,880
He had dissatisfied written all over his face.

683
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,190
Can't you see?

684
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,550
Your eyesight is so bad.

685
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:28,880
Jin Fan,

686
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,230
don't say that about yourself.

687
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,600
No matter what,

688
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,980
I have to pass the Trial of the Three Realms as soon as possible

689
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,020
so that no one will doubt me anymore.

690
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,730
I support you.

691
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,050
But,

692
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,460
when did you

693
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,560
become so enthusiastic about being the Sword Wielder?

694
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,630
Do you remember when we were young...

695
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,810
we skipped practice together...

696
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,970
You've changed!

697
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,770
It's not that I've changed.

698
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,650
The more Gong Shangjue doesn't want me to be the Sword Wielder,

699
00:38:56,650 --> 00:38:58,780
the more I want to be the Sword Wielder.

700
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,160
Besides,

701
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,410
I must find out

702
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,690
the truth behind my father and brother's death...

703
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,690
and avenge them.

704
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:08,720
Hey.

705
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:09,760
Hey.

706
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,680
We've already found out the truth.

707
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,450
Wufeng did it.

708
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,340
You didn't tell him?

709
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,370
Think about it.

710
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,330
He has been been hiding for so many years.

711
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,590
Why did we find the Wufeng token only now?

712
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,470
And why was it

713
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,440
Gong Shangjue who found it?

714
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,280
Besides,

715
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,420
why would someone from Wufeng

716
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,130
bring something

717
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,790
as dangerous along with them?

718
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,480
My back is so cold.

719
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,310
-Hold me tight.
-Okay, okay.

720
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,610
But now,

721
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,410
there are no more clues.

722
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,360
I have to pass the Trial of the Three Realms.

723
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,490
Sister.

724
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,050
Yes?

725
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,920
Do you know what the first trial

726
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,900
of the Trial of the Three Realms is?

727
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,180
How would I, a weak lady,

728
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,210
know?

729
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:55,200
I don't even have the right to participate in the trial.

730
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,180
You have no idea at all?

731
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,940
Hahaha.

732
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,110
No idea at all.

733
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,210
I know.

734
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,310
[Jue]

735
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:28,930
Brother.

736
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:30,420
Add in some Shi Hu for me.

737
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:31,800
Okay.

738
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,300
Is that Housekeeper Jia

739
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,810
really someone from Wufeng?

740
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,990
You've worked with him for so many years.

741
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,290
Shouldn't you know better?

742
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,740
Of course I do.

743
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,570
That's why it's strange.

744
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,640
But that Wufeng token

745
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,430
was indeed found in his room.

746
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,850
Could it be...

747
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,270
you made a fake Wufeng token

748
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,660
in order to save me?

749
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,920
Nonsense.

750
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,120
The token is real.

751
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:16,700
But I think

752
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,940
someone left it in Housekeeper Jia's room on purpose.

753
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,730
Who is this person?

754
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,030
I can't find him.

755
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,560
Why did they help me?

756
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,640
Help you?

757
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:36,860
I think they're trying to harm you.

758
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,960
We let Gong Ziyu have the first step this time.

759
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,960
It's so annoying.

760
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,660
And when I think about how

761
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:53,030
I have to greet him as the Sword Wielder in the future

762
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,430
makes me feel nauseated.

763
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,850
A man should learn how to yield.

764
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:57,950
Don't rush it.

765
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,680
He won't be able to pass the Trial of the Three Realms.

766
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,610
Unfortunately,

767
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,330
I wanted to force him to hand over the position

768
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:07,060
of the Sword Wielder in a month.

769
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,200
But Elder Yue pleaded for him.

770
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,730
I couldn't say more.

771
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,940
Elder Yue

772
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,780
always helps Gong Ziyu.

773
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,350
It's really irritating.

774
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,950
Don't talk about the elders.

775
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,780
Among the three elders,

776
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,320
Elder Yue is the kindest.

777
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,710
He's easy to talk to.

778
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,320
He pitied Gong Ziyu for losing his father and brother,

779
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,000
and was assigned to be the Sword Wielder when he was in danger.

780
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,260
Of course he'd support him a little more.

781
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,360
Be it a month,

782
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:39,340
or three months...

783
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,330
It doesn't matter.

784
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,220
As long as the result

785
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,230
is as we expected.

786
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:45,940
Of course.

787
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,550
Back then,

788
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,160
it took you so much to pass the Trial of the Three Realms.

789
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,840
I don't think Gong Ziyu can even pass the first trial.

790
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,160
Just wait to laugh at him.

791
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,260
Yuanzhi,

792
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,250
there's something that's inconvenient for me to do personally.

793
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,340
But I don't trust to

794
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,140
leave it to others.

795
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:15,220
Brother,

796
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:16,480
just tell me.

797
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:19,870
I want you

798
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,860
to bring Shangguan Qian

799
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,890
from the Ladies' Hostel,

800
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:27,450
and have her stay in the Jue Lineage for the time being.

801
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,600
So soon?

802
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,450
It's a marriage that's already been arranged.

803
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:37,580
No matter it's fast,

804
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:38,950
or slow,

805
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,760
is there any difference?

806
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:43,580
No.

807
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,340
Mm.

808
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:47,750
Brother.

809
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,730
I understand that it's inconvenient for you

810
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,710
to pick her up.

811
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,700
But I don't understand why

812
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,130
you can't trust others with this.

813
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,590
What's there to not trust?

814
00:43:58,230 --> 00:43:59,890
Everyone knows you chose her.

815
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,090
In this Gong Residence,

816
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:05,510
could there be someone who would put her on the spot?

817
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:07,080
What danger could she be in?

818
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:08,520
I'm afraid

819
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,670
others will be in danger.

820
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,200
The prettier a woman is,

821
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:19,510
the more dangerous she is.

822
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,120
Is she pretty?

823
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,860
Let me ask you a question.

824
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,520
Who is prettier between

825
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,170
Yun Weishan and Shangguan Qian?

826
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:40,660
They're both...

827
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:41,970
pretty.

828
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,630
They are pretty in their own ways.

829
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,460
That's right.

830
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:49,600
So,

831
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,600
they all have their dangers in their own ways.

832
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,100
Brother,

833
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,350
besides being pretty,

834
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,300
what else do you like about Shangguan Qian?

835
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:31,750
Young Master Yuanzhi.

836
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,140
Thank you for picking me up.

837
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:39,290
Young Master Yuanzhi...

838
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,880
Doesn't talk much, do you?

839
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,540
No wonder the servants in the other lineages

840
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:46,790
were scared

841
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,220
when they see you.

842
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:52,180
It's better to be feared

843
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:53,800
than to be afraid of others.

844
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:56,060
That seems true.

845
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,710
Young Master Yuanzhi!

846
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,570
I want to ask...

847
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:02,280
Ah!

848
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:12,910
What do you want to ask?

849
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,030
I want to ask...

850
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,690
how far is the Jue Lineage from here?

851
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:20,310
I'm afraid Young Master Shangjue

852
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:22,360
will wait too long, and be anxious.

853
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:23,970
He's not anxious.

854
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:27,360
I think you are the one who's more anxious.

855
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:41,270
Miss Shangguan Qian,

856
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,890
where are you going with Young Master Yuanzhi?

857
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,390
I’m here to take Miss Shangguan

858
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,850
to stay at the Jue Lineage.

859
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,640
Gong Ziyu.

860
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,490
Where are you going?

861
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,330
Young Master Yuanzhi,

862
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,280
according to the etiquette,

863
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,410
you should call him the Sword Wielder.

864
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:55,960
Oh?

865
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:58,850
He passed the Trial of the Three Realms

866
00:46:58,850 --> 00:46:59,980
in such a short time?

867
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:02,360
Not yet.

868
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:03,610
I'm sorry then.

869
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,660
I can't call you

870
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:06,130
the Sword Wielder.

871
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,640
Then...

872
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:10,570
call me sister.

873
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:16,260
Sister.

874
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,240
What about brother?

875
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:21,970
That's enough.

876
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:22,900
Enough.

877
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,820
Don’t make it difficult for Yuanzhi.

878
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:26,940
He's right.

879
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:28,890
I'm not the Sword Wielder yet.

880
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:29,800
But

881
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,710
I will be soon.

882
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,200
That's why we are just taking a walk around

883
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,160
to get used to it.

884
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:38,220
This is the way to the Ladies' Hostel.

885
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,620
You're being too obvious

886
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,960
walking around here.

887
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,190
You're going to go pick up Yun Weishan,

888
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:44,730
right?

889
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,480
I didn't plan to do that.

890
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,400
After all, it's inappropriate

891
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:51,780
for an unmarried man and woman to stay together

892
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,180
before getting married.

893
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,180
But now it seems

894
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,270
Gong Shangjue

895
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,360
doesn't really care about etiquette either.

896
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,020
So I'm just learning from him.

897
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:03,220
There's nothing inappropriate about me

898
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,550
picking Yun Weishan up.

899
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,430
There are many things

900
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,910
you still have to learn.

901
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,210
Gosh.

902
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,340
What now?

903
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:38,670
I forgot something important.

904
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,200
I need to go back and get it.

905
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:41,830
There's everything in the Jue Lineage.

906
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:42,630
Don't bother.

907
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:43,390
Let's go.

908
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,500
Jue Lineage...

909
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,190
won't have it.

910
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,390
What is it?

911
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:52,730
It's so rare?

912
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:56,020
A gift I prepared for Young Master Shangjue.

913
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,480
My brother needs nothing.

914
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,270
There are too many people

915
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:00,440
who gives him gifts.

916
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,060
That's different.

917
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,200
Love between two...

918
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:09,020
You are still young.

919
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,600
Of course you don't understand.

920
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:16,630
Forget it.

921
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:18,650
I'll wait for you here.

922
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,150
Go and come back quickly.

923
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,870
Gong Shangjue is always ahead of us.

924
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:32,880
It's as if he's calculated it.

925
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,190
He's even a step ahead of us to pick up his bride.

926
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,230
How annoying.

927
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:40,750
Miss Shangguan.

928
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:45,350
Sword Wielder.

929
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,510
Why did you return?

930
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:49,760
I forgot something.

931
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,510
I'm really sorry.

932
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,830
Sword Wielder.

933
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:56,900
You are here to pick up Miss Yun, right?

934
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,030
I'll get her for you.

935
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,790
No need.

936
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,260
It's such a trivial matter,

937
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,440
I won’t bother you.

938
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,270
Call Miss Yun Weishan for me.

939
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:10,320
Yes.

940
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:17,710
Thank you, Sword Wielder.

941
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:18,900
I was thoughtless.

942
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:52,460
The secret weapons at the Gong Family are laced with deadly poisonous.

943
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,920
So they carry these

944
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,460
special-made gloves

945
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:56,780
soaked in special dye

946
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,620
so they won't come into direct contact with the secret weapon.

947
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:01,950
You can get poisoned even without a wound.

948
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,470
Gong Family's poison is highly toxic.

949
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:05,960
It can enter through

950
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,340
the sweat glands and pores

951
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,800
on the surface of your skin.

952
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,420
And wax

953
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,250
is the simplest and easiest to get.

954
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,020
It can temporarily isolate

955
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,380
the skin pores.

956
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,050
Jin Fan.

957
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,520
Look at them.

958
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,440
How happy they are swimming.

959
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,100
The fishes are just swimming.

960
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,030
How do you know they are happy?

961
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,070
What do you mean?

962
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,070
Why are you acting

963
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,390
all weird today?

964
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:53,080
Miss Yun.

965
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,120
You've already packed up?

966
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,450
Don't worry. I can wait for you.

967
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,930
Don't forget anything.

968
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,140
I didn't have anything much.

969
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,540
You do lack some stuff.

970
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,430
I'll ask the servants tomorrow

971
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,230
to prepare some clothes for you.

972
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,190
There should be

973
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,160
some jewellery in the Yu Lineage.

974
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,540
If you like anything,

975
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,540
you can pick some.

976
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,910
If you need anything,

977
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:20,840
just let me know.

978
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:25,890
Miss Yun.

979
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,390
Don't be shy.

980
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,790
From now on, the Yu Lineage will be your family.

981
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:32,720
You're going to be the wife of the Sword Wielder soon.

982
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:35,100
If you need anything, just ask.

983
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,320
Except for Jin Fan.

984
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,850
Don't look for him.

985
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:40,080
He lacks focus.

986
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:42,380
He can't resist temptation

987
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,800
when he sees beauties like both of us.

988
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,510
What are you talking about?

989
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,160
Miss Yun.

990
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,620
We're not married yet.

991
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,050
I'm afraid you have to

992
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,030
live in the Yu Lineage first as an attendant.

993
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:59,150
That is all right.

994
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,110
You came to pick me up.

995
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,890
I should be happy.

996
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,150
I still like it more

997
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,400
when you call me Young Master Huanyu.

998
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,800
Calling me Sword Wielder

999
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,830
leaves a distance between us.

1000
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,000
Miss Yun.

1001
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,220
If anyone bullies you in the Gong Residence,

1002
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,400
just tell Gong Ziyu.

1003
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,230
If Gong Ziyu bullies you,

1004
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:20,170
just tell me.

1005
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,280
Although

1006
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:22,580
I can't deal with him,

1007
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,640
but I can annoy him.

1008
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:26,540
What are you talking about?

1009
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,610
Just kidding.

1010
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,530
Can't you see Miss Yun is nervous?

1011
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,030
But I'm afraid he will have to put his mind to

1012
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:34,020
the Trial of the Three Realms in the future.

1013
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,950
He won't have the time to bully you.

1014
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:38,870
The Trial of the Three Realms?

1015
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:39,930
What is that?

1016
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:40,440
Oh?

1017
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,450
Miss Yun.

1018
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:48,380
Come along with me if you're done packing.

1019
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:49,730
Thank you, Sword–

1020
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:51,830
Hmm...

1021
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,230
Thank you, Young Master Ziyu.

1022
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:58,460
But...

1023
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,100
Young Master Ziyu,

1024
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:00,740
you didn't have to

1025
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,800
to pick me up from the Ladies' Hostel.

1026
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,320
You could've sent someone to inform me.

1027
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,660
I'm afraid others will gossip

1028
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,240
and cause you trouble.

1029
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,200
If anyone dares to gossip,

1030
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:16,100
I will teach them the rules.

1031
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,240
Besides,

1032
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,290
I'm here to pick up my fiancee.

1033
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:21,340
What’s wrong?

1034
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,390
Miss Shangguan.

1035
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,140
You took what you left behind?

1036
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:33,610
Yes.

1037
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,550
Miss Yun Weishan, it's best you go have a check too.

1038
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,120
Don't be like me.

1039
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,100
I realized I forgot something only halfway there

1040
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,270
and had to come back for it.

1041
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,400
It's a waste of time.

1042
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,990
It's getting dark.

1043
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,630
Sword Wielder,

1044
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,900
I'll take my leave.

1045
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,180
Young Master Yuanzhi is waiting for me.

1046
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,300
Miss Yun?

1047
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,040
In that case,

1048
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,670
I'll go check again.
