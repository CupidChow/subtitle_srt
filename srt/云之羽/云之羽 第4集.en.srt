[Episode 4]

4
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,259
My father was a businessman.

5
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,620
He often sailed out to sea.

6
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:42,930
Once,

7
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,009
he encountered a shipwreck

8
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,210
and never came back.

9
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,780
Today is the anniversary of my father's death.

10
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,840
There is a saying in our hometown.

11
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,140
If people who died at sea

12
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,780
saw a boat,

13
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,490
they would try to fly onto the boat

14
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,060
and see

15
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,820
if it's their family

16
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,590
coming to pick them up.

17
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Your father won't be disappointed.

18
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,010
In this world,

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,570
what father

20
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,340
would be disappointed in his daughter?

21
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,680
Wipe the tears off your face.

22
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,400
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,800
I hurt you today.

24
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,210
I'm fine.

25
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,930
It's okay.

26
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,260
How can you be fine?

27
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,070
It's indeed my fault.

28
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,460
I'm very powerful.

29
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,750
Don't act tough.

30
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,810
I'll inform the clinic

31
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,780
to perform chiropractic treatment on you.

32
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,180
Then take some medicine to soothe your body

33
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,240
and your shoulder should be fine.

34
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,940
Thank you, Young Master Ziyu...

35
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,710
Thank you, Sword Wielder.

36
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,770
It's better to call me Young Master Ziyu.

37
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,480
I'm not used to

38
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,720
the title of Sword Wielder.

39
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,790
You don't like it?

40
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,579
I said I'm not used to it.

41
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,610
But

42
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:44,090
I don't like it either.

43
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,120
Miss Yun,

44
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,630
it's getting late.

45
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,240
I have to take you back.

46
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,580
Sorry.

47
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,000
I must send you back.

48
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,400
But

49
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,170
you're the Sword Wielder now.

50
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,649
If you appear with me alone,

51
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,250
I'm afraid it will cause trouble for you.

52
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,110
Do you really not want

53
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,810
to be seen with me?

54
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,620
Don't worry.

55
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,500
I'm not afraid of trouble.

56
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,540
Besides, I'm going to the side residence.

57
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,500
Why are you going there?

58
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,080
Why are you looking at me like that?

59
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,600
Did I say something wrong?

60
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,930
You didn't say anything wrong.

61
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,750
But Miss Yun, your face...

62
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,650
What's wrong with my face?

63
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,460
I heard you were poisoned last night too

64
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,120
and had rashes all over your face.

65
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,320
But seeing you today,

66
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,770
your features look just as before.

67
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,560
You've already recovered?

68
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,110
Poisoned?

69
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,710
How?

70
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,250
You didn't get poisoned?

71
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,950
I just had rashes all over my face last night.

72
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,220
I heard that Miss Shangguan comes from a family of physicians,

73
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,100
so I asked her for some ointment to relieve the poison.

74
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,480
It's indeed effective after dissolving and drinking it with water.

75
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,230
It went away in one night.

76
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,890
What did you eat

77
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,920
before you got the rashes?

78
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,970
Nothing.

79
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,550
I just visited Miss Shangguan for a while.

80
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,570
We had tea together.

81
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,990
Miss Jiang also fell ill

82
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,340
after drinking the tea

83
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,600
and went to the clinic.

84
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,770
The doctor verified that she was poisoned.

85
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,020
Did the tea belong to Miss Jiang?

86
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,510
Miss Yun,

87
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,730
did the tea

88
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,110
belong to Miss Jiang?

89
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,200
The tea was from Miss Shangguanâ€™s hometown.

90
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,920
Miss Jiang and I

91
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,900
were worried we wouldn't be able to sleep after drinking tea,

92
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,700
but Miss Shangguan

93
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,420
insisted on making it for us.

94
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,100
Take out the tea.

95
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I think...

96
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,110
Yes.

97
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,230
Is everyone here?

98
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,030
Other than Yun Weishan and Shangguan Qian,

99
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,460
all the other girls are here.

100
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,260
What's wrong?

101
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,400
Seal the entire side residence.

102
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,700
Before the Sword Wielder arrives,

103
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,070
no one is allowed to enter or exit.

104
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,780
Yes.

105
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,210
The Sword Wielder is coming?

106
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:06,610
Yes.

107
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,990
Is it appropriate for him to come here?

108
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,240
The Sword Wielder's words are the law.

109
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,090
But this is too...

110
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:12,630
Madam Fu,

111
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,640
do you have a problem with my order?

112
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,860
No.

113
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,460
But Young Master, this is too...

114
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,050
Yun...

115
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,700
Miss Yun Weishan,

116
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,550
why are you with

117
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,590
the Sword Wielder?

118
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,610
I have a secret mission

119
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,409
that Miss Yun Weishan must help me complete.

120
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,470
Follow me.

121
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,690
Search the courtyard and every room.

122
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,060
Yes.

123
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,440
The river lanterns are ready.

124
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,930
The show is about to start.

125
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,790
Sword Wielder,

126
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,080
these tea leaves

127
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,510
were found in Miss Shangguan Qian's room.

128
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,880
This powder

129
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,710
was found in Miss Song's room.

130
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,760
It was contained in this bottle.

131
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:23,840
This is...

132
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:25,970
This is...

133
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,299
If I were you,

134
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,620
I would wash my nails right now.

135
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,090
Halt!

136
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,980
Scrape off the rest

137
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,150
before you wash yourself.

138
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,110
Do you want to leave evidence behind?

139
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,980
If the Gong family can't find any evidence,

140
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,870
they will keep investigating.

141
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,310
It'll be never-ending.

142
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,830
It's time

143
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,520
to put an end to this.

144
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,860
How?

145
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,040
Find a reasonable owner

146
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,350
for this thing.

147
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,680
Give it to me.

148
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,440
I know whose room to put it in.

149
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:40,790
Whose?

150
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,130
Miss Song.

151
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:47,990
Miss.

152
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,480
You are suffering from asthma.

153
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,360
If you have asthma,

154
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,470
it's definitely not suitable

155
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,310
to stay in the valley long-term.

156
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,280
Your condition will worsen.

157
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,480
No.

158
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,520
I just caught a cold last night

159
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,140
and have a cough.

160
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,030
I'll write it down first.

161
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,590
Later,

162
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,150
I will give you a private consultation.

163
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,410
The powder is poisonous.

164
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,920
How could it be?

165
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,300
This is the asthma medicine

166
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,600
I brought from home.

167
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,460
It's not poison.

168
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,100
Those who enter the Gong residence

169
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,680
are thoroughly searched.

170
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,510
No medication is allowed to be brought in.

171
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,470
Where did you hide

172
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,600
this little bottle?

173
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,610
I put it...

174
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:02,760
Put it...

175
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,960
Man up.

176
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,640
You said it is medicine.

177
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,850
Can you take it right now?

178
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,010
Sure.

179
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,120
Of course.

180
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,920
This color...

181
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,780
This color is wrong.

182
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,380
What's wrong?

183
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,760
You can't drink it?

184
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,540
I knew it.

185
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,040
What do you mean?

186
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,520
You have such a beautiful face

187
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,370
but such a vicious heart.

188
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,080
Take her away.

189
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,320
Send her out of the valley

190
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,230
and back to the Song family.

191
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,630
Yes.

192
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,410
It's not me.

193
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,430
You've made a mistake.

194
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,400
It's not me.

195
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,850
We've resolved the red powder issue.

196
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,780
Itâ€™s time to test these tea leaves.

197
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,050
I wanted Miss Shangguan to drink them personally,

198
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,640
but sheâ€™s not here.

199
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,550
Interesting.

200
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,450
Let me try.

201
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,170
Miss Shangguan

202
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,020
drank tea with us last night.

203
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,520
She also drank it herself.

204
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,560
I can testify.

205
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,620
So,

206
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,690
I believe these tea leaves are fine.

207
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,980
Besides,

208
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,630
it was indeed Miss Shangguan

209
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,430
who cured the rash on my face.

210
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,690
Let me do it.

211
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,410
Wait.

212
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,870
Since you're so frank,

213
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,830
you don't need to drink.

214
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,840
Sword Wielder,

215
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,730
I don't think it's a good idea.

216
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,890
You should be fair

217
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
like holding a bowl of water evenly.

218
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,230
This is a bowl of tea,

219
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,570
not a bowl of water.

220
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,820
She doesn't need to drink it,

221
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,700
but

222
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,770
I want to question Miss Shangguan.

223
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,580
Why?

224
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,430
You might not have listened carefully.

225
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,040
All those who enter the Gong residence

226
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,700
must be searched thoroughly.

227
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,820
They cannot bring any medication

228
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,540
or weaponry into the valley.

229
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,090
Miss Yun just said

230
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,030
that last night,

231
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,300
she took Miss Shangguanâ€™s ointment

232
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,600
to relieve the rashes.

233
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:17,820
So,

234
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,860
I want to ask Miss Shangguan

235
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,610
where her ointment

236
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,320
came from.

237
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,170
It's getting late.

238
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,630
Iâ€™ll wait here.

239
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,720
Miss Shangguan

240
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,400
should be back soon, right?

241
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:38,710
Otherwise,

242
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,060
she might not

243
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
be able to return after night falls.

244
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,780
Don't move.

245
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,390
Who are you?

246
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,870
Shangguan Qian.

247
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:18,970
Bride?

248
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:22,070
Yes,

249
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,420
a bride.

250
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,120
You shouldn't have come here.

251
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,470
I know.

252
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,710
Then why did you come?

253
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,200
Why

254
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,480
are you here?

255
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Physician Zhou who checked my pulse

256
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,990
said I have a harsh aura,

257
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,930
and my physique is cold

258
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,130
and humid, blocking the flow.

259
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,460
I don't know if this is why

260
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,120
I only got the white jade token.

261
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,960
I came to him

262
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,220
to see

263
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,360
if there is any prescription

264
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,490
that can cure my physique.

265
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,100
Do you want to be chosen by the Sword Wielder this badly?

266
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,940
I did before,

267
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,180
but not anymore.

268
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,380
Then why did you come?

269
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,570
The doctor said humidity in the body

270
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,270
is not conducive for childbirth.

271
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:17,590
Then, what did you mean

272
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,440
by saying you wanted to before,

273
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,160
but not anymore?

274
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,050
You must be

275
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,340
Young Master Yuanzhi.

276
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,900
In my opinion,

277
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:33,640
Gong Ziyu,

278
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,050
the current Sword Wielder,

279
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,500
doesn't qualify at all.

280
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,150
The most qualified one

281
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,690
is the second young master,

282
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,180
Gong Shangjue.

283
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,350
Do you know me well?

284
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,150
Miss Shangguan.

285
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,580
Miss Shangguan.

286
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,840
Sword Wielder.

287
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,920
Miss Shangguan,

288
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,150
where did you go?

289
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,810
To the clinic.

290
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:08,880
Oh?

291
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,790
Do you feel unwell?

292
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,180
Physician Zhou checked my pulse the other day.

293
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,710
He said that my aura is harsh

294
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,680
and I have humidity in my body.

295
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,380
That's why I only received a white jade token.

296
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,710
I went to him to ask for a prescription.

297
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,130
Maybe

298
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,990
then I could receive the golden token

299
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,200
and become

300
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,780
your bride.

301
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,160
Miss Shangguan,

302
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,390
the Gong residence has a very complex landscape.

303
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,920
How did you find the clinic?

304
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,520
Also,

305
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,430
security was strengthened

306
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,690
after my father and brother were killed.

307
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,890
You managed to come and go

308
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,550
without any obstacles.

309
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,080
It's indeed complicated.

310
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,170
I even got lost.

311
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,400
Luckily, I met a girl

312
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,500
who was going to the clinic to get medicine.

313
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,760
I found the right place by following her.

314
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,310
I had a lot of trouble on my way back too,

315
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,510
so it took a long time.

316
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,020
I don't know the rules of the Gong residence.

317
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,450
Sword Wielder,

318
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,400
please punish me as needed.

319
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,730
No need to punish you.

320
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,760
The ignorant are innocent.

321
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,490
Just be careful in the future.

322
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,310
If you don't understand the rules,

323
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,440
you can ask Madam Fu.

324
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,850
She passed so easily.

325
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,420
Thank you, Sword Wielder.

326
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,340
However,

327
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,410
I have something

328
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,930
to ask you.

329
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,670
Please ask.

330
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,360
I will answer what I can.

331
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,200
Miss Jiang and Miss Yun

332
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,470
had rashes on their faces last night.

333
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,040
Miss Jiang

334
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,840
even fell unconscious.

335
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,270
Miss Yun told me

336
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,740
that they all drank

337
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,940
the tea you brought from your hometown.

338
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,500
So, I wanted to ask...

339
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,300
Sword Wielder, do you want to ask

340
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,880
how I brought the tea into the Gong residence?

341
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,700
It was part of my dowry

342
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,290
and thoroughly inspected

343
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,090
before being brought to my room.

344
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,050
If you're worried,

345
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,420
you can ask the ones

346
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,150
in charge of the brides' dowry.

347
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,390
Besides,

348
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,780
I also drank the tea.

349
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,010
Yes.

350
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,950
Miss Yun

351
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,840
has testified for you.

352
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,940
Thank you, Miss Yun.

353
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,930
Miss Yun wants to thank you too.

354
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,740
Miss Yun,

355
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,470
what do you mean?

356
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,600
Miss Yun wants to thank you

357
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,720
because she used your family's ointment

358
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,120
to relieve the rash.

359
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:51,950
However,

360
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,100
tea can be brought in

361
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:57,180
to the Gong residence

362
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,380
as long as it's proven

363
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,960
to be harmless.

364
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,280
But there are two things

365
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:05,860
that can never be brought in.

366
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,850
That is medication and weaponry.

367
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,460
The ointment is a strictly controlled item.

368
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,390
Miss Shangguan,

369
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,910
how did you bring it in?

370
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:21,970
On my body.

371
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,480
I brought it in on my body.

372
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,230
Later,

373
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,470
Miss Shangguan,

374
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,380
please give the remaining ointment to the guards

375
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,510
and ask them to take them back to the clinic for research.

376
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,720
If it's really harmless,

377
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:41,930
it doesn't matter.

378
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,610
I just hope

379
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,060
you won't do it again.

380
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:47,740
But

381
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,160
if there is something wrong with this ointment,

382
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,650
Iâ€™ll come to you again.

383
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,420
Even if itâ€™s harmless,

384
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,700
it's taboo in the Gong residence.

385
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,630
It can't be fine.

386
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,370
I said it's fine.

387
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,220
Oh, dear.

388
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,510
Thank you for your mercy.

389
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,630
What's wrong?

390
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,140
Did you really go to the clinic today?

391
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:46,730
Yes.

392
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,460
You really went to see a physician?

393
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,570
No.

394
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,960
I made up the cold and humidity.

395
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,830
Like you,

396
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,150
I took medicine for several months

397
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,720
while I was in Wufeng.

398
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,350
My body has already been adjusted.

399
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,070
I went to the clinic to look for Gong Yuanzhi.

400
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,390
I didn't expect

401
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,870
to run into Gong Shangjue instead.

402
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,780
So, your target is Gong Shangjue.

403
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,090
You're quite smart.

404
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,160
Among the Gong family,

405
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,310
Young Master Shangjue is the most difficult to manage.

406
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,220
Everyone in the Gong family is difficult.

407
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,040
Is that so?

408
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,640
I saw that Gong Ziyu

409
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,270
kept staring at you.

410
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,940
You have a hold on him, right?

411
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,470
Yes.

412
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,370
I think so.

413
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,920
What about you?

414
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,420
Me too,

415
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,970
especially after I saw Gong Shangjue today.

416
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,500
I think I'm more confident now.

417
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,610
Gong Shangjue didn't say anything

418
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,860
after seeing my jade token,

419
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:04,580
but I know

420
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,390
it must have aroused his curiosity.

421
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,270
Curiosity is the biggest bait.

422
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,980
He won't let me go.

423
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:18,720
What is this jade token?

424
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,630
By the way,

425
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,980
tell me in advance

426
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,590
the next time you have a plan.

427
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,690
If something like today happens again,

428
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,220
I won't know how to help you.

429
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,940
Help me?

430
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,970
You think that telling Gong Ziyu I have an ointment

431
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:44,430
and having him investigate me is helping me?

432
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,730
With our identities,

433
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,820
do you think

434
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,740
it's better for everyone in the Gong residence

435
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,140
to think that we're very close to each other

436
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,930
or are enemies?

437
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,060
It's better to make people think

438
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,860
we hate each other

439
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,040
and want to kill each other.

440
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,490
The enemy of my enemy...

441
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,690
Is my friend.

442
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,860
You're risking your life.

443
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,130
This is the best solution now,

444
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:19,950
isn't it?

445
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,330
My target is Gong Ziyu.

446
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,720
Your target is Gong Shangjue.

447
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,120
To win their trust,

448
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,740
we must

449
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,710
first acknowledge their enemies

450
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,460
and stand with them.

451
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,680
Gong Shangjue has always been

452
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,300
the most popular successor.

453
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,320
Also,

454
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,970
he has been suspicious of Gong Ziyu's lineage.

455
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,360
Thus, he and Gong Ziyu

456
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,770
will definitely become enemies.

457
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,640
If Gong Ziyu really chooses me,

458
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,390
and Gong Shangjue keeps you...

459
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,130
Gong Ziyu will definitely not give up

460
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,660
on researching the brides,

461
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,330
so he'll definitely investigate me.

462
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,290
On the contrary,

463
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,740
Gong Shangjue definitely won't let you go either.

464
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:11,540
So, you and I

465
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,230
must become enemies.

466
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,310
The more we fight,

467
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,640
the more they'll trust us.

468
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,740
Let's fight then.

469
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,410
Weishan,

470
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:33,390
please show mercy.

471
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,440
Do we have it?

472
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:40,860
What?

473
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:44,390
Mercy.

474
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,750
You just asked me

475
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,420
to show mercy,

476
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:54,960
but do we have it?

477
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,200
Yun Weishan.

478
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,860
If we are both chosen at the end,

479
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,750
our future

480
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:17,480
will be very difficult.

481
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:56,900
Halt.

482
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,840
Jin Fan.

483
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,010
Eldest Young Miss.

484
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,310
Come here.

485
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,960
It's not dawn yet.

486
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,870
The rooster hasn't crowed yet.

487
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,000
Where are you going?

488
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,270
The clinic.

489
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,900
The clinic is over there.

490
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,380
Where are you going?

491
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,940
It's okay. I'll take a detour.

492
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,070
I won't disturb you.

493
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,220
What a loser.

494
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,550
As a man,

495
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,350
there are only some difficulties...

496
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:26,920
Oh no,

497
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,080
some surprises

498
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,130
and you're afraid to face it head-on.

499
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,610
No,

500
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,110
to welcome it head-on.

501
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,490
Your good looks are a waste.

502
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,140
What does this have to do with my looks?

503
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,030
Stop!

504
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,920
I need to go somewhere too.

505
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,250
Where are you going?

506
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:53,810
The clinic.

507
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,480
Herb Elixir.

508
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:20,780
How is it?

509
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,970
These two pills look identical at a glance,

510
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,390
but the one we just took out

511
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,120
has a smooth, glowing surface.

512
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,300
The Young Lord and former Sword Wielder's Herb Elixir

513
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:33,290
is slightly rougher and darker.

514
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,420
Smooth.

515
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,870
Rough.

516
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,120
What is this?

517
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,310
It's to warm it up.

518
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,370
This is what the Young Lord had before.

519
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,250
Hey.

520
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,380
Since you can't see clearly,

521
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,990
and can't feel it with your hands,

522
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,270
let the poison go through my body

523
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:04,520
and leave the truth in my heart.

524
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,140
Only if you take the poison

525
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,340
-can you reach the top.
-Spit it out.

526
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,220
It's just like what I usually eat.

527
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,420
It tastes quite good.

528
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,750
Go get me a cup of tea.

529
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,800
Are you sure no one will find out?

530
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,650
It's not a small issue to import the wrong herbs.

531
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:34,110
Shut up!

532
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,790
Keep your mouth shut.

533
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,310
Burn it all.

534
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,130
Yes.

535
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,740
Burn the bag too.

536
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,430
What are you eating now?

537
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,850
Since it's hard to tell whether it's real or not,

538
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,510
we can only test the medicine.

539
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,650
I found some poisonous herbs

540
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,810
to eat.

541
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,760
You're too reckless.

542
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,870
If I'm fine,

543
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,780
it means

544
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:04,490
there's nothing wrong with the Young Lord and Sword Wielder's Herb Elixir.

545
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,600
If I'm poisoned,

546
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,130
remember,

547
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,370
I died for you.

548
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,480
Spit it out.

549
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,400
Are you really angry?

550
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,620
I lied to you.

551
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,970
How could I take poison?

552
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,510
The Gong family doesn't place poison in the clinic.

553
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,310
The front hall

554
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,440
only contains some functional pills.

555
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,870
Not only can the Herb Elixir prevent poison,

556
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,440
it can also make some functional pills

557
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,640
lose effectiveness.

558
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,190
Were you worried for me?

559
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,540
I was worried you'd die.

560
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,140
You were worried I'd die?

561
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,020
I understand.

562
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,970
You're so sweet.

563
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,500
If you died here,

564
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,770
what would I say to Gong Shangliu?

565
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,190
You're lying.

566
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,400
Bird's Song.

567
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,620
This pill will affect one's vocal chords,

568
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,680
making one's voice narrow and sharp.

569
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:11,050
Men use it when disguising themselves.

570
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,940
Women should not take it.

571
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,010
Does that mean

572
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,520
the Young Lord and Sword Wielder's Herb Elixir

573
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,120
was replaced with ineffective fake medicine?

574
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,810
Then my sacrifice is worth it.

575
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,930
Do you smell...

576
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,470
-My body fragrance?
-A pungent odor?

577
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,540
Stop.

578
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,010
What do this mean?

579
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,280
It means "stop."

580
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,920
You already said it.

581
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,380
Why did you do the gesture?

582
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,860
Why did you say it if you did the gesture?

583
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,150
Wait for me here.

584
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:10,990
Okay.

585
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,920
What are you doing?

586
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,340
Guardian Jin.

587
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,560
I-I'm burning expired herbs.

588
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,700
Expired herbs

589
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,710
are shipped out and destroyed by specified personnel.

590
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,700
How could they be burned

591
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,240
in the clinic for no reason?

592
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,570
These herbs...

593
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,910
[Ethereal]

594
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,150
Thank you, Young Master Jin.

595
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,310
You even prepared a surprise for me.

596
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,070
This is our token of love.

597
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,790
This is the case evidence.

598
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:14,139
According to the medical book,

599
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,370
this is indeed an Ethereal Flower.

600
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:20,710
Then why did the clinic's servant act so suspiciously,

601
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,520
as if they were trying to destroy evidence?

602
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,510
How come I didn't know

603
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,110
that you're familiar with pharmacology

604
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,510
in addition to weaponry?

605
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:34,900
I don't.

606
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:44,290
None of us know pharmacology.

607
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,880
The Gong residence's antidote and drug production

608
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,409
have also been managed by the Zhi Lineage.

609
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,340
But Gong Yuanzhi

610
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,929
would never help me.

611
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,040
I...

612
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,000
I...

613
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,530
I like you too.

614
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,340
I know someone who knows pharmacology.

615
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,630
Lord Sword Wielder,

616
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,630
the three elders request a meeting.

617
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,710
Greetings, elders.

618
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:38,800
Ziyu.

619
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,940
According to etiquette, you should mourn your parents

620
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,120
for three years.

621
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,880
No marriage,

622
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:48,320
drinking or celebrations.

623
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,560
We should have sent all the brides-to-be

624
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,280
back to their hometowns

625
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,080
and apologized with gifts.

626
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:55,900
But

627
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,300
considering the changes this time,

628
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,450
and that Wufeng

629
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,140
has also figured out how to enter the Gong residence,

630
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,000
we believe

631
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,520
for a long period into the future,

632
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,240
it won't be suitable to marry a bride from outside the valley.

633
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,020
So,

634
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,270
after discussing,

635
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,270
we hope

636
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,420
the Lord Sword Wielder

637
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,840
can choose someone you fancy

638
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,030
among the girls brought in this time

639
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,470
and keep her by your side temporarily.

640
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,060
Later, we'll find

641
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,390
another auspicious day

642
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,240
for the official wedding.

643
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:26,820
Yes.

644
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,080
Shangjue,

645
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,360
you are also of age for marriage.

646
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,620
How about

647
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,370
you choose together?

648
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,260
Fine.

649
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:45,020
The marriage selection was set for the former Young Lord.

650
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,950
I've been extremely busy these past few years.

651
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,680
I didn't intend to get married.

652
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,410
But the recent changes

653
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,490
made me reconsider.

654
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:57,240
The Gong family's lineage has always been sparse.

655
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,970
In addition,

656
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,700
various signs show

657
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,650
that Wufeng has started plotting

658
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,720
to attack the Gong residence.

659
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,290
This is a good thing.

660
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,850
Good things

661
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,040
come in pairs.

662
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,670
Ziyu,

663
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,470
what do you think?

664
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,340
If you wish to get married,

665
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,220
that is naturally great news.

666
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:26,540
However,

667
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,650
you've always had high standards

668
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,710
and a unique taste.

669
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:31,960
I wonder

670
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,980
if you're willing to compromise

671
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,380
with a girl that I pass over?

672
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:40,680
Ziyu,

673
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,500
I never compromise

674
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,700
for anything.

675
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,560
Help me keep Miss Shangguan.

676
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,090
Sword Wielder,

677
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,110
do you also want to choose Miss Shangguan?

678
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,520
Miss Shangguan Qian,

679
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:29,130
please go to the Sword Wielder Hall.

680
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,590
Lord Sword Wielder

681
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,490
chose Miss Shangguan?

682
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,740
What about us?

683
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,370
Miss Yun Weishan,

684
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,050
please go to the Sword Wielder Hall.

685
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,650
They have arrived.

686
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,150
Guards,

687
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,100
you may leave.

688
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:29,210
Yes.

689
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,300
Guardian Jin,

690
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,120
you can't enter the back hill.

691
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:09,840
I know.

692
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,110
Please bring this token to Young Master Yue.

693
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,580
Tell him

694
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:18,270
that a Jade Guardian is waiting for him here.

695
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,230
The Sword Wielder

696
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,730
and Young Master Shangjue

697
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,640
have chosen their future brides.

698
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,530
Then,

699
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,220
Miss Yun Weishan and Shangguan Qian

700
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,010
can become attendants starting tonight

701
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,360
and reside in the Jue and Yu Lineages.

702
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,900
No need to rush.

703
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,370
This marriage selection

704
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,740
was used by the Wufeng

705
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:49,480
to help assassins infiltrate the Gong residence

706
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,320
and kill the Sword Wielder and Young Lord.

707
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,310
Although we've found one Wufeng assassin,

708
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,000
there might be another one.

709
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,230
That's why

710
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,370
I chose Miss Yun Weishan.

711
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:07,440
Lord Sword Wielder,

712
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,150
what do you mean?

713
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,700
When I tested the brides that night

714
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,070
by bringing them away from the Underground Palace,

715
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,000
Miss Yun Weishan

716
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,800
tried to escape from the Gong residence.

717
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,300
I met her again yesterday.

718
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,030
She wanted to escape yet again.

719
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,870
Someone who tries so hard

720
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,000
to leave this place

721
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,440
would never

722
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,740
be a Wufeng spy

723
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,560
that worked hard to sneak in.

724
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,140
But...

725
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,030
Shangjue,

726
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,360
how did you choose your bride?

727
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,690
Is it just because

728
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,150
Miss Shangguan is pretty?

729
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,750
I didn't even notice before you mentioned it.

730
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,880
Ziyu, it turns out

731
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,990
that you've paid attention to Miss Shangguan's features.

732
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,320
Elders,

733
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,800
no matter what reasons

734
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,060
Ziyu and I have,

735
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,540
to be sure,

736
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,180
I've already arranged for artists

737
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,910
to draw their portraits later.

738
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,190
Then,

739
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,790
I will send men to Yun Weishan's hometown,

740
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,590
Lixi Town,

741
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,910
and the Shangguan family in Dafu City.

742
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,460
They will verify

743
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,170
the ladies' identities

744
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,730
with the local neighbors

745
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,250
and relatives.

746
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,460
Coincidentally,

747
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,940
Lixi Town

748
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,150
is very close to Dafu City.

749
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,590
Only one trip is needed.

750
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,310
Elders,

751
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,250
and Ziyu,

752
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,850
I believe that it's not too much

753
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,910
to be cautious

754
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,350
in these extraordinary times.

755
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,190
Of course.

756
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:48,350
Of course.

757
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:50,880
So,

758
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:52,640
I ask you two

759
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,750
to stay in the side residence

760
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,570
for the time being.

761
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,440
I will arrange more guards

762
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,770
to protect your safety.

763
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,050
If nothing goes wrong,

764
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,740
you'll become family.

765
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,430
Thank you, Young Master Shangjue.

766
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,470
Dafu City is a bit far from here.

767
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,810
It seems

768
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,260
we will have to stay in the side residence

769
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,710
for quite some time.

770
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,760
We couldn't bring any daily necessities into the mountain.

771
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:26,800
May we

772
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,670
leave the Gong residence

773
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,220
to buy some items in town?

774
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,390
If you need anything,

775
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,330
just ask the servants to buy them

776
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,360
and it will be done within the hour.

777
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,860
No need to personally make the trip.

778
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,540
Besides,

779
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,860
I've already prepared the fastest men and horse

780
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,290
with the fastest pigeon.

781
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:50,510
We will have news

782
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,940
within three days.

783
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,900
[Be Upright]

784
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:36,750
Although we've found one Wufeng assassin,

785
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,060
there might be a second one.

786
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:00,380
We will have news

787
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:02,890
within three days.

788
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:11,140
Eldest Young Miss and Brother Yuanzhi have arrived.

789
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,280
I ask the elders to stay a while longer.

790
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,470
I have something important

791
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,600
to discuss with you.

792
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,650
The three elders are old.

793
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:19,470
Let them go back and rest.

794
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,490
You can tell me

795
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,030
if there are any issues.

796
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,220
Although I'm still young and inexperienced,

797
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,950
I'm already the Sword Wielder.

798
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,370
Young Master Shangjue,

799
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,830
please mind your manners.

800
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,280
This is exactly

801
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,320
what I wish to discuss.

802
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:39,510
You must have noticed

803
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,260
I haven't called you "Sword Wielder"

804
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,350
since you came in, right?

805
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,690
If you want me to call you that title,

806
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,220
Ziyu,

807
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,110
it won't be easy.

808
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,640
It's not hard either.

809
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:57,730
The elders are all here today.

810
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,360
What I want to say is

811
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,990
I, Gong Shangjue,

812
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,390
don't recognize

813
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,410
and even oppose of

814
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,330
Gong Ziyu being the new Sword Wielder.

815
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:13,820
There must be a reason

816
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:14,910
why you object.

817
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,580
Gong Ziyu meets the conditions for succession in the absence of an heir.

818
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,430
Could it be

819
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,420
that you want to go against

820
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,770
the ancestral precept of the Gong family?

821
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:24,990
No one

822
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,140
can violate the ancestral precept,

823
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,580
but does Gong Ziyu

824
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,980
really meet the conditions?

825
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,650
I've copied the ancestral precept more than 30 times.

826
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:35,910
I remember it clearly.

827
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:37,910
Since you've copied it so many times,

828
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:39,240
why don't you recite it?

829
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,460
The successor must have become of age.

830
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,740
In this regard,

831
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,960
Brother Gong Yuanzhi isn't qualified.

832
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:51,460
Second,

833
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:53,330
the successor must be a man.

834
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:54,270
I don't qualify

835
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:55,160
for this.

836
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:56,400
Third,

837
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:57,720
the successor

838
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:00,180
must be a descendant of and present in the Gong residence.

839
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:00,890
For this,

840
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:01,960
Gong Shangjue,

841
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,440
who was outside the valley and unreachable at the time,

842
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,930
doesn't qualify.

843
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,550
You've counted it yourself.

844
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,190
The successor must meet four conditions.

845
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,320
Were you listening?

846
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,480
Of age,

847
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:15,280
male,

848
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,390
and present in the Gong residence

849
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,650
are only three points.

850
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,940
The point of the third condition

851
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,530
is not being in the Gong residence,

852
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,170
but being a descendant of the Gong family.

853
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:30,030
Just say what you want to say.

854
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:31,330
My brother means

855
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,720
that if Gong Ziyu is not a descendant of the Gong family,

856
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,190
then his succession right

857
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,110
is ridiculous.

858
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:40,020
Gong Yuanzhi,

859
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,280
don't speak nonsense.

860
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,180
Who are you?

861
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,580
Are you qualified to speak here?

862
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,600
I think many people here know

863
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,830
that Gong Ziyu was born prematurely

864
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:52,830
before 10 months.

865
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,420
It's always been rumored that Lady Lan

866
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,460
had an inseparable lover before marrying

867
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,620
into the Gong family.

868
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,180
So, was Gong Ziyu really born prematurely,

869
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,650
or was he a normal birth?

870
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,110
It's hard to say.

871
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,350
Gong Yuanzhi.

872
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:06,830
Sword Wielder.

873
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,380
Do not fight in the Hall.

874
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:08,850
Shangjue,

875
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:10,110
control your brother.

876
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,850
Gong Shangjue, are you crazy?

877
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,360
Enough!

878
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:16,700
Ridiculous!

879
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,420
It's fine for you to be lawless

880
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,250
and disrespect the ancestral precept any other time,

881
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,180
but the three elders are here today

882
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:35,710
and you still dare to fight?

883
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:39,580
Gong Yuanzhi is not yet an adult.

884
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,980
He is reckless and ignorant.

885
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,040
He can be forgiven.

886
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:43,760
But you,

887
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,000
Gong Ziyu,

888
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,740
you hurt your own family.

889
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:48,520
Whether it's your identity,

890
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,200
your ability,

891
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:49,800
or virtue,

892
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,430
you don't have any of it.

893
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,890
How can you say

894
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,970
you deserve this position?

895
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:58,750
I must kill the one

896
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,580
who killed my father and brother.

897
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,440
Sword Wielder,

898
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:03,130
do not say such harsh words

899
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,750
if there is no evidence.

900
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:06,250
You are framing someone

901
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,310
without evidence.

902
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:09,950
You don't deserve to be the Sword Wielder.

903
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:11,410
Of course I have evidence.

904
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,210
And Gong Shangjue,

905
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,560
you are also involved.

906
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,180
What's wrong with me?

907
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,700
You were the last person my father met that night.

908
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,030
What did you talk about?

909
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,800
Why were you in such a hurry

910
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,310
that you left overnight?

911
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:26,060
Where did you go?

912
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:26,990
What did you do?

913
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:27,740
Did anyone see it?

914
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,800
Can you explain it?

915
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,710
Of course I can.

916
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:32,250
Naturally,

917
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,600
there are also people who know,

918
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,080
but it's confidential

919
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,520
and ordered personally by the Sword Wielder.

920
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:42,600
I don't need to report it to you.

921
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,320
I am the Sword Wielder.

922
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:46,570
I order you

923
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,420
to report to me immediately.

924
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:54,990
If you don't,

925
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:56,370
you and Gong Yuanzhi

926
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:59,170
will be the suspects who plotted to kill my father.

927
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,750
If I had the intention to usurp power,

928
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:08,000
I would have stayed in the Gong residence that night.

929
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:10,100
If I were in the Gong residence,

930
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,320
you'd never have a chance

931
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:15,550
to be the Sword Wielder.

932
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,230
Do not blame others

933
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,880
if you fail at a task.

934
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,660
If you can't live up to the Sword Wielder position,

935
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:27,320
then don't accuse others of treason.

936
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:32,190
I'll show you

937
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,800
if I'm capable of being the Sword Wielder or not.

938
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:23,950
Don't be angry.

939
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,900
You know

940
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,780
that Shangjue and Yuanzhi

941
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,390
have always been like this.

942
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,280
The older one has an emotionless face.

943
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,410
The younger one has emotionless eyes.

944
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:49,570
Sword Wielder,

945
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,300
the person I mentioned who can help us

946
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,190
identity the herb will be here soon.

947
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:53,650
Okay.

948
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:55,770
Later,

949
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,270
don't ask who he is

950
00:51:58,670 --> 00:51:59,660
or ask me

951
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,570
where I found him.

952
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,240
But his words can definitely be trusted

953
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,840
and he won't harm you either.

954
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:07,730
Where else could he come from?

955
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,470
The Gong residence is only so big.

956
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:10,180
He's either from the clinic

957
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,910
or from Gong Yuanzhi's palace.

958
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:14,010
Hurry and call him in.

959
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,980
I've never realized that he dilly-dallies like this.

960
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:28,920
I think I've lost interest in him.

961
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:31,590
If you go to the Guardian Camp

962
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,140
and peek at him bathing twice,

963
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,140
I promise you'll be interested again.

964
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,670
Don't slander me.

965
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:37,830
-I only went there once.
-I didn't slander you.

966
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:38,690
Sword Wielder.

967
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:48,990
Who are you?

968
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:52,790
You agreed not to ask.

969
00:52:55,830 --> 00:52:56,690
Sword Wielder,

970
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,620
my surname is Yue.

971
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,890
Yue as in "mountains"?

972
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:05,320
Yue as in "the romantic moon."

973
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,690
Young Master Yue.

974
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,690
Brother Yue.

975
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,720
I may be much older

976
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,200
than your brother.

977
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,620
Young Master Yue looks younger than Jin Fan.

978
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:22,300
How old can you be?

979
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,590
If you insist on calling yourself old,

980
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:27,320
I'll call you the old Matchmaking God in the moon.

981
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:41,910
Young Master Yue,

982
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,340
please take a look.

983
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:45,660
Is this

984
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:48,830
the most important ingredient of the Herb Elixir,

985
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,400
the Ethereal Flower?

986
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:58,650
This is not the Ethereal Flower.

987
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,520
It is a Spirit Herb.

988
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,750
If the Ethereal Flower is changed

989
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,110
into a Spirit Herb

990
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:14,430
in the ingredients,

991
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:15,950
would the Herb Elixir

992
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:17,100
still be effective?

993
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,430
Of course not.

994
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,960
The Ethereal Flower is the core of the Herb Elixir.

995
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,310
If the core is switched,

996
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:25,840
the medicine

997
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:27,840
will essentially be useless.

998
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,440
As expected, it's the Zhi...

999
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:32,710
As expected, it's the Zhi Lineage.

1000
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,760
Since I've cleared the Sword Wielder's doubts,

1001
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,060
I will return now.

1002
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:39,220
Wait.

1003
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,900
Sword Wielder, is there anything else?

1004
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,750
You said you will return.

1005
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,680
Return to where?

1006
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:49,730
You agreed not to ask,

1007
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:50,750
you liar!

1008
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,780
Sword Wielder,

1009
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:55,500
I think

1010
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:57,500
we'll meet again soon.

1011
00:54:58,990 --> 00:54:59,720
At that time,

1012
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,860
you will know who I am.

1013
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:03,690
Goodbye.

1014
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,350
Brother Yue,

1015
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,800
let me see you off.

1016
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:18,290
Such a player.

1017
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,670
The books are right.

1018
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,330
All women are bad.

1019
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:26,400
What have you been reading lately?

1020
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,620
Should we first interrogate

1021
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,100
that suspicious servant?

1022
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:38,410
Jin Fan,

1023
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,590
hurry and find him.

1024
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,750
Now?

1025
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,810
It's so late.

1026
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,670
I'm afraid it's already too late.

1027
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:45,000
Okay.

1028
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:13,870
Thank you.

1029
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:15,580
The portraits are done.

1030
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:25,330
Thank you, my lord.

1031
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,670
Thank you

1032
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,540
for drawing me so beautifully.

1033
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:51,120
A few hours ago,

1034
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,050
it was still lively here.

1035
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,170
But in a blink of an eye,

1036
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,680
we are the only ones left.

1037
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,080
By the way,

1038
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,150
Miss Jiang has recovered

1039
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,470
and was sent out of the Gong residence.

1040
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,590
I thought you would care.

1041
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,130
After sitting for so long,

1042
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:14,220
my waist is in pain.

1043
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:16,860
I'm going to bed.

1044
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:18,790
You should rest early too.

1045
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,620
But I still want to chat with you.

1046
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,660
There's no one to talk to

1047
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:31,570
in such a big courtyard.

1048
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,840
It's quite scary.

1049
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,750
That's great.

1050
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:57,850
I asked you to bring the servant here.

1051
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,850
Why did you arrest Housekeeper Jia?

1052
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:00,670
I...

1053
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:01,910
When I went there,

1054
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,570
the servant was already gone.

1055
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,630
I saw the pharmacy's Housekeeper Jia looking sneaky.

1056
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:07,890
He's also suspicious,

1057
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,570
so I brought him here.

1058
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,270
How should we

1059
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:26,900
interrogate him?

1060
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,900
We should use the 18 methods

1061
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:31,110
of torture like, "I'll confess!"

1062
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:34,070
How about

1063
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,020
we go to Gong Yuanzhi's place

1064
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,700
and steal some poison for him?

1065
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,400
Let him speak.

1066
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,020
I'm done.

1067
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,080
I said to let him speak.

1068
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,940
Housekeeper Jia,

1069
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:56,410
you're a senior staff of the Gong residence now.

1070
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,610
For your dignity,

1071
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,210
I'll let you speak for yourself.

1072
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:01,610
What did the Zhi Lineage do?

1073
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:02,740
I don't understand.

1074
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,100
You can summon me if you need help.

1075
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:06,770
Why did you arrest me?

1076
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:09,710
Who ordered you

1077
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,060
to change the Ethereal Flower into the Spirit Herb?

1078
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,320
Sword Wielder, you lost your family.

1079
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,010
I know you need somewhere to vent your anger,

1080
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,170
but you can't slander

1081
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,670
the Zhi Lineage of switching the herbs.

1082
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:34,990
It seems

1083
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:38,370
that we've wronged Housekeeper Jia.

1084
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,260
Jin Fan.

1085
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:41,500
Untie him

1086
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,750
and escort him back.

1087
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,390
What are you waiting for?

1088
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:48,990
Untie him.

1089
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,180
Gong Ziyu,

1090
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,070
what's wrong with you?

1091
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,330
None of your business.

1092
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,770
In a while, everyone will see

1093
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,480
Jin Fan politely escort Housekeeper Jia

1094
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:08,370
out of the gates of the Yu Lineage.

1095
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:09,590
Tomorrow morning,

1096
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,200
I will release the news

1097
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,240
that Housekeeper Jia

1098
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,190
provided a critical clue for the former Sword Wielder's

1099
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,120
poisoning case.

1100
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:18,070
Then we will visit him

1101
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,500
with a grand reward.

1102
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:31,110
Sword Wielder,

1103
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:33,070
please forgive me.

1104
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:36,830
If this news reaches Gong Yuanzhi,

1105
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,030
it'll be the end of me.

1106
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,170
Housekeeper Jia,

1107
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,690
there are only two options in front of you.

1108
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:46,620
Either

1109
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,010
tell me everything you know

1110
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,250
and I can spare your life as the Sword Wielder,

1111
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:53,320
or

1112
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,360
keep playing tricks here,

1113
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,070
and we'll see about it

1114
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,050
in the morning.

1115
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:13,940
Sword Wielder, you are wise.

1116
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,370
I deserve to die.

1117
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:18,140
I was acting under orders.

1118
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,260
I had no choice

1119
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,750
but to switch out the Ethereal Flower.

1120
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:23,900
I...

1121
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,170
I'm willing to testify for you.

1122
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,310
Who is the person

1123
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:37,670
that ordered you?

1124
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,200
Gong Yuanzhi.

1125
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:56,700
What do you want?

1126
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,550
You're so nervous.

1127
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,320
You and I have become enemies.

1128
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,390
You belong to Gong Ziyu.

1129
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,280
I belong to Gong Shangjue.

1130
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,400
So many people are watching.

1131
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,120
Why are you chatting with me?

1132
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,630
What are your plans?

1133
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:13,650
What do you mean?

1134
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,320
What should we do

1135
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:16,980
in three days

1136
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,830
when Gong Shangjue brings back

1137
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:21,570
the information about us?

1138
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,870
Watch them be proven wrong.

1139
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:25,850
What's there to be afraid of?

1140
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:27,910
Could it be

1141
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,990
that you're not Yun Weishan?

1142
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:31,290
Of course not.

1143
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,300
Hanya Si and I

1144
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,490
attacked Miss Yun in Lixi Town

1145
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,590
and I took her place.

1146
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,340
Then, you're in trouble.

1147
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:42,840
What about you?

1148
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,150
Are you really Shangguan Qian?

1149
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:49,070
Shangguan Qian from Dafu City?

1150
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:49,820
Yes.

1151
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:52,760
I am Shangguan Qian.

1152
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,440
Remember,

1153
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,570
no matter what happens,

1154
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:01,530
you must insist on your identiy.

1155
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:03,680
You are Yun Weishan

1156
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:06,280
from Lixi Town.

1157
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:09,930
Then why are you the Mei of Wufeng?

1158
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,880
As a member of the Wufeng,

1159
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,120
you really have naive trust

1160
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:17,860
in a stranger.

1161
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:19,850
Stranger?

1162
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:21,950
Who?

1163
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:25,230
Me.

1164
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:31,030
My family sent me to train in Wufeng since I was a child,

1165
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:33,740
but I always returned during New Years

1166
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,020
or the Lantern Festival

1167
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,620
and showed myself in public.

1168
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,260
I also took advantage of those days

1169
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:42,320
to go on some blind dates with the city's rich families.

1170
01:03:42,790 --> 01:03:43,670
The other days,

1171
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,130
my family would have a sickly maid

1172
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,200
pretend to be me

1173
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:49,030
and ask different doctors

1174
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:51,610
to take my pulse through a curtain.

1175
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:54,620
All kinds of prescriptions

1176
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,280
are brought to my house

1177
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:59,600
and piles of herbal residue are thrown out.

1178
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:00,770
Therefore,

1179
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,620
I can use the excuse of being sick

1180
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,110
to not leave the house

1181
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:08,460
and train in Wufeng.

1182
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,020
So,

1183
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:12,870
even if Gong Shangjue uses my portrait

1184
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,110
to verify throughout the city,

1185
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:17,390
he will only get one result.

1186
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:19,170
I

1187
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,600
am Shangguan Qian,

1188
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,430
a weak and sickly girl

1189
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,760
who doesn't like to go out.

1190
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:31,310
Then you can stay.

1191
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:33,800
I must go.

1192
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:36,550
I can't take the risk.

1193
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:39,120
What are you doing?

1194
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,460
Are you crazy?

1195
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:47,180
If I were you,

1196
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:49,310
I'd take a gamble.

1197
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:52,910
Gamble what?

1198
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:56,080
Gamble whether Wufeng has their hopes on you

1199
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:57,660
or has their hopes

1200
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:59,130
on Miss Zheng Nanyi

1201
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:01,480
who has already died after being exposed.

1202
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:02,730
What do you mean?

1203
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:05,300
With Miss Zheng Nanyi's skills

1204
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:07,870
and her idiotic brain,

1205
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:11,540
she'll at most be a Chi,

1206
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:13,220
just like you.

1207
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,230
Amazing.

1208
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:20,110
You insulted two people in one sentence.

1209
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:23,190
My mission is to get close to Gong Shangjue,

1210
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,360
while Miss Zheng Nanyi's mission

1211
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,500
can only be completed by you now.

1212
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:31,560
If Wufeng doesn't want to break this connection,

1213
01:05:32,190 --> 01:05:32,800
I think

1214
01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:35,800
they will find a way

1215
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:38,370
to prove your identity in Lixi Town.

1216
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:40,640
For Wufeng,

1217
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:42,690
there's nothing they can't do

1218
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:44,860
as long as they want to.

1219
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,320
Remember what I said.

1220
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,270
No matter what,

1221
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,040
you must insist on your identiy.

1222
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:54,450
You are Yun Weishan

1223
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:56,580
from Lixi Town.

1224
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,600
[Jue]

1225
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:31,620
What are you looking at?

1226
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,570
The pigeon brought back

1227
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:38,110
the investigation on Yun Weishan and Shangguan Qian

1228
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:38,910
early.

1229
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,010
Is it as you expected?

1230
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,000
Did you bring the hidden weapon?

1231
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:48,040
Yes.

1232
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:50,440
Let's go.
