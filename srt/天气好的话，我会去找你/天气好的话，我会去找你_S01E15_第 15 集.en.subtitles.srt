1
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,332
Sorry, have you seen a young woman here?

2
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,709
Yes, I think she was sitting over there.

3
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,627
Thank you.

4
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,122
Hae-won.

5
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,515
I'm so scared.

6
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,691
I have no idea who people truly are.

7
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,616
It feels like I'm being deceived.

8
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,417
I can't trust anything.

9
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,467
Not even what I see…

10
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,888
nor what I trusted.

11
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,005
Do you want to go home?

12
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,300
No.

13
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,346
Then where do you want to go?

14
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,827
I just got a call from Eun-seop.

15
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,329
He said he'll go get Hae-won.

16
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,040
So don't worry and go to bed.

17
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,549
THE SISTERFIELD MAZE

18
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,342
SIM MYEONG-YEO

19
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,645
Myeong-yeo.

20
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,189
Is this why you agreed to write this?

21
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,530
I still want to pay the price
for my wrongdoing.

22
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,116
It was something

23
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,119
I had to tell Hae-won one day.

24
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,162
So?

25
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,038
Are you saying you'll turn yourself in?

26
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,177
Then what does that make me?

27
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,930
I was in jail for seven years.

28
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,892
What does that make me?

29
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,396
So why did you go?

30
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,441
How many times did I tell you?
I went because it's not your fault!

31
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,400
Myeong-ju.

32
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,361
Do you…

33
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,657
really think this is your fault?

34
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,658
Isn't that obvious?

35
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,952
How is this your fault?

36
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:19,999
I killed him.

37
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,386
Myeong-yeo.

38
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,680
If it weren't for me…

39
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,726
you wouldn't have been there.

40
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,646
If I hadn't met…

41
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,274
a husband that beats me like that,

42
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,820
you wouldn't have seen what you saw.

43
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,115
What's more,

44
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,368
if it weren't for me…

45
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,292
you would've never had a reason
to step on the gas.

46
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,420
The day you turn yourself in…

47
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,509
I'll feel like
I'm being punished all over again.

48
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,887
Then what about me?

49
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,976
Do I just keep living like this?

50
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,648
Is this life so hard?

51
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:26,566
Yes.

52
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,317
It's hard.

53
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,320
I think I can only live
if I confess and get condemned.

54
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,366
I think I'll feel better
if someone would condemn me.

55
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,369
Then just write the book
and say it's fiction!

56
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,287
No.

57
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,872
I got greedy while writing it.

58
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,625
I figured I should
turn myself in at this point--

59
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,335
-Sim Myeong-yeo!
-Myeong-ju!

60
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,045
Myeong-ju.

61
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,714
I…

62
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,176
dream every night.

63
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,264
What do you dream about?

64
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,604
Ju-hong.

65
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:09,859
Why?

66
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,403
Does your brother-in-law
appear in your dreams

67
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,572
and blame you for it?

68
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:16,907
No.

69
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:19,869
He's good to me.

70
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:21,829
Myeong-yeo.

71
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,205
Have a cup of coffee.

72
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,666
You like coffee, right?

73
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,422
He's so good to me.

74
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,635
That…

75
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,056
That drives me even crazier.

76
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,314
Everybody, move!

77
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,744
Hey! Stop right there!

78
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,580
Im Hwi!

79
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,081
-I said stop!
-Goodness!

80
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,875
Hey, stop!

81
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,710
Stay away! Don't come close!

82
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,545
Hey, stay away!

83
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,380
You're dead meat if I catch you!

84
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,966
-Im Hwi!
-Don't come close!

85
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,094
-Don't follow me!
-I said stop!

86
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,097
-Hello!
-Did you eat with Eun-sil yesterday?

87
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,932
No.

88
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:47,850
-What?
-I didn't.

89
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,438
We went to a deserted place.
How did he know?

90
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:55,941
Jang-u.

91
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,819
I'm glad I ran into you.
I'm on my way to file a complaint.

92
00:12:58,903 --> 00:12:59,987
About what?

93
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,031
Someone keeps throwing out their trash
in front of my home.

94
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,116
-Is that so?
-Unbelievable.

95
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,659
They just leave it there.

96
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,703
But there's nothing I can do about that.

97
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,038
Jang-u.

98
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,790
Did you know Eun-sil is leaving today?

99
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,042
What? Leave?

100
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,835
She's going to Gangneung
because her leave is over.

101
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,338
But she didn't mention it
during dinner yesterday.

102
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,299
That's what I heard.
Her mom is packing side dishes for her.

103
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,717
Is that so?

104
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,720
But why are you telling me that?

105
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,098
I heard you like Eun-sil.

106
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,768
How on earth do you know this stuff?

107
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,269
I know everything.

108
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,189
Including the fact that
you liked her since high school.

109
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,399
I heard Eun-sil's going to take the bus.

110
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,609
What time was it again?

111
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,402
She said it was the 3:00 p.m. bus.

112
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,987
Right, there you go.

113
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,157
Are you not coming?

114
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,242
I'll get going then!

115
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,827
I need to install a CCTV or something.

116
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,095
Goodness.

117
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,683
What are you doing there?

118
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:12,977
Go ahead then.

119
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,311
With what?

120
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,274
Turning yourself in.

121
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,820
If this is so hard for you, do it.

122
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,043
I thought wrong.

123
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,381
I thought…

124
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,051
that if I left like that…

125
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,141
Mok Hae-won and Park Huin-dol.

126
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,476
-You'd like to send these back?
-Yes.

127
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,061
I have one more.

128
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,233
Sim Myeong-yeo.
Are you sending this back too?

129
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,194
No.

130
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,952
I thought at least you'd be happy.

131
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,670
Myeong-ju, it's me.

132
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,088
How are you doing?

133
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,841
Hae-won is doing well.

134
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,680
The same goes for me too.

135
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:36,936
MYEONG-JU, IT'S ME.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

136
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:43,943
No.

137
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,403
I'm not doing well.

138
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,198
I can't.

139
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,617
I…

140
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:05,839
I thought you'd forget about everything
and go your own way.

141
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,931
I'm doing well too.

142
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,436
Seeing Hae-won adapt so well
without complaining

143
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,648
makes me feel a little better.

144
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,485
All the neighbors are kind to us too.

145
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:28,988
A couple of days ago,

146
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,699
the lady next door
brought us a box of tangerines.

147
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,786
We have no worries here.

148
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,833
So don't worry about me
and Hae-won anymore, Myeong-ju.

149
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,211
As long as you're okay…

150
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,715
that's all that matters.

151
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:50,926
I never thought…

152
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,221
that you'd be so miserable.

153
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,203
I'm really…

154
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,752
sorry.

155
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,142
It's my childhood home.

156
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,607
The day my dad got into an accident…

157
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,702
That was my last day.

158
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,834
I heard the house is in ruins.

159
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,308
Do you want to go in?

160
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:27,940
Nobody will be inside anyway.

161
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,184
This is still here.

162
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,815
KOREA ELECTRIC POWER CORPORATION
TO: SIM MYEONG-JU

163
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,109
Did you leave something here?

164
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,236
You should've told me.

165
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,406
I could've sent it.
It would've been more convenient.

166
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,493
Although, it's not like
I have any idea where you live.

168

00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:32,689
I have to.

170
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:35,817
What about Ju-hong?

171
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:41,031
You came here for his birthday last time.

172
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,499
I can't commemorate the day of his death.

173
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,794
Be well.

174
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,298
Let me know when you turn yourself in.

175
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,760
All right.

176
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,098
Hey, Myeong-ju.

177
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,475
Where do you live?

178
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,728
Where exactly are you living now?

179
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,731
Paju.

180
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,649
What?

181
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,192
Since when?

182
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,445
Ever since I got out.

183
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:23,991
I mean,

184
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,868
I don't have any other options.

185
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:29,830
I'm leaving.

186
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,340
I think my mom still lives here.

187
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,761
How could this be?

188
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,473
Only I was kept in the dark again.
Everyone knew except…

189
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:52,519
Maybe…

190
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,191
she thought it would be better
if you didn't know?

191
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,655
Because if you find out…

192
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,327
you'd be in too much pain.

193
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,878
Maybe she's trying to
endure this as long as possible.

194
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,466
Then tell you…

195
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,303
after enduring it until the very end.

196
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,348
But I'm family too.

197
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,983
Is all of this really something
I could've lived without knowing?

198
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,241
Because the truth would hurt you.

199
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,124
Because she didn't want you to be in pain,

200
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:58,960
she probably…

201
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,007
carried the burden for you, Hae-won.

202
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,185
I'm sure that was the case.

203
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,057
My saddle.

204
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:58,854
Hey!

205
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,775
You're pretty good at riding.

206
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,320
I'm sorry, Je-in,

207
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,823
but can you not talk to me?

208
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,618
I haven't yet
reconciled with you emotionally.

209
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,247
Right here. The spot where you
pulled my hair out still hurts.

210
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,754
I'll see you again tomorrow.

211
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,591
No, I don't want to.
I'm going on a date with Yeong-su.

212
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,093
Hey! Yeong-su is mine!

213
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,931
By the way, Im Hwi.

214
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,392
I heard you're the SO.

215
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,061
Yes. Did you have anything to do with it?

216
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,564
Well, I know I'm graduating,

217
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,858
but I'll put in a good word
for you to my juniors.

218
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:45,817
Don't worry.

219
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,323
You should be grateful.

220
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:55,368
Yeong-su asked me,
so I'm making a very special exception

221
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,078
for you.

222
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,459
A selfie for proof that we made up.
One, two.

223
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,920
We look pretty.

224
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,174
You don't need to thank me.

225
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,681
No. I'm not grateful at all.

226
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,725
Seriously, not one bit.

227
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,101
I'm not scared at all.

228
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,482
This hurts my pride.

229
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,651
My pride is hurt.

230
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:31,321
My pride is so incredibly hurt!

231
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,123
Hi, Eun-sil. I found this on the way here.

232
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:44,960
You lunatic.

233
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,964
You're prettier than this flower.

234
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,800
Yes, this will work.

235
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,183
Eun-sil.

236
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,601
Hi, Eun-sil. Have you been well?

237
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,020
Where are you going? Shall I drop you off?

238
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,522
From where to where?

239
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,232
From here to Gangneung.

240
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,441
What? You don't even have a car.

241
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,193
I have a car.

242
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,820
-My dad's car.
-Really?

243
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:12,904
-Yes.
-I'd love that!

244
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,030
-Let's go.
-Okay.

245
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:16,408
-Where do I go?
-Is this all your stuff?

246
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,285
-Yes, just this one.
-Okay. Here.

247
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,996
It's yours. I found it…

248
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,126
Why?

249
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:27,335
What? What is it?

250
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,337
You don't really blush now.

251
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,964
-What?
-Your face.

252
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:34,050
You used to turn bright red
the second you saw me.

253
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,135
But now…

254
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,888
you instantly turn red.

255
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,228
All right, shall we go? Where's your car?

256
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,522
What are you eating?

257
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,190
Rice cake!

258
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,651
We had the rice cake festival.
It was tasty.

259
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,028
Why did that come out of your pocket?

260
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,113
Well, it wouldn't come out of my shoe.

261
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,823
-Do you want some?
-No, thanks.

262
00:26:57,574 --> 00:27:01,328
Can I pig out at the rest stop later?

263
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,204
I haven't had breakfast yet.

264
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,081
My mom was rushing me out of the house.

265
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,208
Okay, I'll buy you food.

266
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,293
Thank you.

267
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,419
Let's go. Where's the car?

268
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,337
Over there.

269
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,508
Hey, so,

270
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,303
I heard you broke up with your boyfriend.

271
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,679
I did.

272
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,433
Everyone magically finds out
and comes running to ask about it.

273
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:27,187
Did someone post it online
that I broke up with my boyfriend?

274
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,398
Now, all we need is a banner about it.
Everyone knows.

275
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,026
The thing is,
my mom is all about getting married young.

276
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,028
So she wants a grandkid pretty quickly.

277
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,072
-Why are you telling me this?
-What?

278
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,873
What do you want to do?

279
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,668
I can go in.

280
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,469
Then…

281
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,556
-when you go in--
-I'll have to ask her.

282
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,311
I will ask.

283
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,653
I'll ask my aunt directly…

284
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,448
why she didn't tell me.

285
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,994
Why she kept it from just me
this whole time.

286
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,040
If she really did it to spare me the pain.

287
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:33,837
If it turns out to be…

288
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,590
as you said,

289
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:40,635
then maybe…

290
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,018
I'll be able to understand.

291
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,069
All right.

292
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,559
It must be very nice to be you.

293
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,229
How so?

294
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,649
Because you're this warm.

295
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,048
MY FIRST EVERYTHING
A NOVEL BY CHA YUN-TAEK

296
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,134
"'Do you know what warmth is?'"

297
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,013
"She asked this, and I answered,

298
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,852
'It's when my cold hands
touch your cold hands

299
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,021
and we both become warm.'"

300
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,151
"'It's when loneliness meets loneliness
to become coziness,

301
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:25,156
and when sadness meets sadness
to become happiness.'"

302
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:30,328
"'It's when a cold breeze
crashes into another cold breeze

303
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,374
and becomes soft snow. That's warmth.'"

304
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,381
So you are home.

305
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,220
We need to talk.

306
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,403
What about Mom?

307
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,738
Did she leave?

308
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,074
Yes, she left.

309
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,410
Then you explain to me.

310
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,039
How this all happened.

311
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,711
I killed your dad.

312
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:27,302
Is that all?

313
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,973
I'm sure you read what I wrote.

314
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:39,814
I'm sorry.

315
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,037
I'm so sorry, Hae-won.

316
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,343
Why did you hide it from me?

317
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,262
Why only me?

318
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,892
It would've hurt you.

319
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,647
Me,

320
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,565
your mom,

321
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,110
and your dad.
The three of us knowing is okay.

322
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,280
But if you knew,

323
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,533
you would've been so hurt.

324
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,911
We couldn't do that to you.

325
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,415
If that's the reason, then why now?

326
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,333
Why are--

327
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,960
Because I'm turning myself in now.

328
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,294
What?

329
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,053
Don't you think it's time
that I pay for my crimes now?

330
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:04,732
I really didn't want to write novels.

331
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,820
But I was at a loss
as to how to make a living.

332
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,073
Not for me, but for you.

333
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:18,287
I needed to make some money
for you to live comfortably.

334
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,916
So I decided to write one more book.

335
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,834
And right then,

336
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,130
Cha Yun-taek asked me
to write a book based on my life.

337
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,631
It was the perfect opportunity.

338
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:31,884
I thought, "Great."

339
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,554
"I can run away after I finish the book."

340
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,140
"No one has
a more shocking story than me."

341
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,100
"It'll sell well."

342
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,186
"That way, I can make money,

343
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:47,567
be harshly criticized,
and turn myself in too."

344
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,695
Are you really turning yourself in?

345
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,491
Your mom has been
adamantly against it until now.

346
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,037
But I won this time.

347
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,124
She gave me her approval.

348
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:06,753
So it's set.

349
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,548
Go to bed now.

350
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,066
HYANGCHON RESTAURANT

351
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,983
Goodbye.

352
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,169
If that's the reason, then why now?

353
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,253
Why are--

354
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,880
Because I'm turning myself in now.

355
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,299
What?

356
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,594
Don't you think it's time
that I pay for my crimes now?

357
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:57,512
Aunt.

358
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,555
Aunt!

359
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,598
Aunt!

360
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,933
Aunt! Open your eyes!

361
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,697
Have I ever asked you anything?

362
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,660
Where you live, who you live with,

363
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,037
whether you live alone,
why you don't live with me.

364
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,455
Why…

365
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,000
why you never accepted my visit requests

366
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,961
and never once replied to my letters.

367
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,881
I never ask you this stuff, do I?

368
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:39,262
So I feel very awkward and uncomfortable
when you suddenly show up like this.

369
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,180
So leave tomorrow.

370
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,975
Hae-won, it's--

371
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,726
Answer me now!

372
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:51,858
No, it's…

373
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,068
-Let me go!
-Hae-won.

374
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,667
Hey, Mok Hae-won!

375
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,294
Mok Hae-won!

376
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,129
Mok Hae-won!

377
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,132
Hey, Mok Hae-won! You little brat.

378
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,425
Hey, Mok Hae-won!

379
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,010
How…

380
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:32,940
Hey.

381
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,944
Why did you want to die?

382
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,578
Don't die.

383
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,250
If you die, I'll die,

384
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,420
your mom will die,

385
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,715
and my mom will die too.

386
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,343
That's how it is.

387
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,972
We may not look it, but that's how we are.

388
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,019
We will all die.

389
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,332
THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS

390
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:08,596
Are you up?

391
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,688
Eat.

392
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,065
I'm sure your stomach hurts.

393
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,736
The teachers and I
went to get noodles last night

394
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,738
but you were passed out at the restaurant.

395
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,949
So I brought you back.

396
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:33,996
Why did you drink so much?

397
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,925
Did you fight with Eun-seop?

398
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,059
Kim Bo-yeong.

399
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,523
I liked you too.

400
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,445
I liked you.

401
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,825
That's why I got hurt by what you did.

402
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,078
Because that's how much…

403
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,540
I trusted and liked you.

404
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,044
However,

405
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,005
everything I had to endure back then…

406
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,759
was because of you,

407
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,428
so I couldn't forgive you easily.

408
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:40,438
That said, I don't think
we can go back to what we used to be.

409
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,987
Can a relationship not have its cracks?

410
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,702
A table doesn't have to be perfect
for you to eat on it.

411
00:40:57,204 --> 00:41:00,624
Whatever it is,
there will be wear and tear over time.

412
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,252
I don't believe
any relationship is flawless.

413
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,925
So what if there's a little crack?

414
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,595
So what if we hurt each other a little?

415
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,474
None of us are perfect.

416
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,769
That's why we end up
doing wrong to each other.

417
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,189
Then we apologize
and put the pieces back together.

418
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,608
That's how we live.

419
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,569
I…

420
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,949
know I gave you a permanent scar,

421
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,784
but I really…

422
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,788
wanted to earn another chance.

423
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,544
If you still feel the same,
then I'll wait.

424
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,635
Who knows, maybe with more time,

425
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,763
it might get a little better.

426
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,496
It's really pouring.

427
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,116
-Are you not cold?
-No.

428
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,537
The bus isn't coming.

429
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,454
Hey.

430
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,666
Make sure the braids look neat and pretty.

431
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,377
Back when I was in school,

432
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:13,299
I used to braid my hair
in long pigtail braids.

433
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,593
I guess I'll be a student again.

434
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,428
Mom.

435
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,637
We're done, Mom.

436
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,306
Take a look. Isn't it so pretty?

437
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,517
My goodness, what?

438
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,685
What is this?

439
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,478
Am I an alien?

440
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,064
No cute boys will come after me.

441
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,525
-No guys will like me.
-Hey, good job!

442
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,237
-Hey, come here!
-Now, your mom. Let's do hers.

443
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,281
-No, don't.
-Come here. Hold her.

444
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,491
-We'll braid your hair, Mom.
-No, don't do it.

445
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,035
-Come on.
-Hold still!

446
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,704
-Myeong-ju! Hold her tight, Hae-won!
-Don't do it.

447
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,206
Hold onto your mom! Come here.

448
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,916
-I'll do it.
-No!

449
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,001
-You can't!
-Get her!

450
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,003
-No, stop, Mom!
-Get her.

451
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:55,424
Myeong-ju, it's your turn now!

452
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,450
Because…

453
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,536
I'm turning myself in now.

454
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:34,755
Aunt.

455
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:35,798
Aunt.

456
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,842
-Sir, can we talk?
-Pardon? About what?

457
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,553
No. It's not true.
So let's talk about this. It's--

458
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,846
What do you mean?

459
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,516
It's not true, you're mistaken.
Please let's talk--

460
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,226
-Why can't they cooperate?
-Hurry!

461
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,104
-Put the middle one in here.
-Aren't you cold?

462
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,106
-Have the other two stand there.
-Yes, sir.

463
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,690
-Yes, sir.
-Gentle! It hurts.

464
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,818
-Where'd the rest go?
-You're hurting me.

465
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:58,654
-Get in quickly.
-What's wrong with you people?

466
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,406
Sergeant Kim.

467
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,032
-Hello.
-What's all this?

468
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,119
Some residents reported

469
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,205
a nude party being held
in the guest house over there.

470
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,207
But they came running this way.

471
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,375
What?

472
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,253
Anyway, what were you saying earlier?

473
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,170
Never mind.

474
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,884
-It was at the guest house?
-Yes.

475
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,762
I was thinking it was unusually loud.

476
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,597
-Did you talk to the owner?
-Yes.

477
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,182
-Don't let them off easy.
-Okay.

478
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,268
-Thanks for the hard work.
-Goodbye.

479
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,086
Were you startled because you thought…

480
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,797
I'd already turned myself in?

481
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,096
Why did you put that there?

482
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,809
It wasn't there when I lived here.

483
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:14,688
It certainly wasn't there
when Grandma was alive.

484
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:17,941
After Mom passed away,

485
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:20,986
you didn't visit.

486
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,865
I missed her.

487
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:33,499
Aunt.

488
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:35,709
Go on.

489
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,837
I hate you a little.

490
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:42,925
I understand.

491
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,761
You didn't tell me
out of fear that I'd be hurt?

492
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:51,433
To be honest, I thought hearing that
would make me understand you.

493
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:52,351
But it didn't.

494
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,811
I still don't understand you.

495
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,273
Why not?

496
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:03,737
If we're family…

497
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,661
I think it's right that we share our pain.

498
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,875
Let's share the pain, Aunt.

499
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,671
Don't turn yourself in.

500
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:27,177
You endured ten years for Mom.

501
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:30,097
I want you to endure another ten for me.

502
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,390
Mok Hae-won.

503
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,391
You once said…

504
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,519
that if I die, then you,

505
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,521
Mom, and Grandma will die too.

506
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,900
It was hell for me too back then.

507
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,320
I know I wasn't
the main character of that case,

508
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,197
but it was hell for me too.

509
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,451
If you turn yourself in now,

510
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,038
I'll be thrown back into hell.

511
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,629
So just continue living
like you have been.

512
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:06,842
But…

513
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,262
I don't think I can see you
the way I did before.

514
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,390
At least for now.

515
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,730
I need time to sort out my feelings.

516
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,032
I'll leave.

517
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,911
What?

518
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:40,667
I'll leave, Aunt.

519
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,065
Eun-seop.

520
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,955
Do you have a moment to talk?

521
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:03,875
Of course.

522
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,265
Do you want coffee?

523
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,192
Are you okay?

524
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,079
Aunt said she was
going to turn herself in.

525
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,376
So I told her not to.

526
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:51,214
I see.

527
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,343
But…

528
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:01,224
I can no longer look at her properly now.

529
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,272
That's why…

530
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:12,694
I'm leaving.

531
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,208
Spring is here.

532
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,262
I hope your bookstore does well.

533
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:45,602
I hope you'll always stay warm too.

534
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,189
Also…

535
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:56,947
there wasn't a single moment
where my feelings were insincere.

536
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,450
You know that, right?

537
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,422
Then…

538
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,591
goodbye, Eun-seop.

539
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,255
I'm back.

540
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:52,687
Tell me, Eun-seop.

541
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:55,732
Is what we have…

542
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,610
love?

543
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,114
Yes.

544
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:05,909
It's love.

545
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:13,541
Me too.

546
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,696
The bookstore will be closed
for a few days.

547
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,246
Think about it carefully, Hae-won.

548
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,417
If Eun-seop disappeared at this hour,
where would he have gone?

549
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:53,391
Hae-won.

550
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:57,187
I understand…

551
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,275
you'll be leaving this place someday.

552
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,405
I'm sorry, Eun-seop.

553
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,618
I'm preparing for it all.

554
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,127
However,

555
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,589
when you leave this place,

556
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:28,885
I hope your heart won't feel too heavy.

557
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:35,642
I just hope you'll leave smiling happily.

558
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:38,937
I hope…

559
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,732
you won't be hurt even a little bit.

560
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,072
I'm sorry.

561
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,373
I truly hope for this.

562
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:22,063
Eun-seop.

563
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,277
I'm going to leave now.

564
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,940
You're disappointed by
how I just do as I please, right?

565
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:12,405
No.

566
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,920
I still love you.

567
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,563
Goodbye, Hae-won.

568
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,262
BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

569
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,597
POSTED BY SEOP

570
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:47,727
If you keep recording,
entries for the same date grow in volume.

571
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:52,398
The accumulation of my daily life
doesn't present me with much change.

572
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:57,612
But when she came to me this winter
and we shared our love,

573
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:02,617
those dates no longer piled up
as the same comfortable days,

574
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:07,497
and today's volume
is different from before.

575
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:12,585
It'll change even more by next winter.

576
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:17,632
A volume of winter
that I've never experienced.

577
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,302
I put up a notice saying the bookstore
will be closed for a few days.

578
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,137
My nerves feel like a tight bowstring.

579
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:29,268
I decided to lay things down
for a moment and rest.

580
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:37,360
I have a feeling that you're doing well.

581
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,071
I'm also doing well.

582
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:41,406
When are you going?

583
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,366
-A week later.
-Are you never coming back?

584
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:46,160
Wouldn't that be better
for both of us if possible?

585
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,538
-Ji Eun-sil.
-I've fallen for Jang-u.

586
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,415
-What?
-I said I've fallen for you, Jang-u.

587
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:53,626
How did you know that what I said
about liking you for a long time

588
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,920
wasn't one hundred percent true?

589
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,255
It's because…

590
01:01:57,338 --> 01:02:00,591
I know the eyes of someone
who has liked me for a very long time.

591
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:08,891
