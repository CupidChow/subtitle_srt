1
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,318
So this view was only an hour away.

2
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:15,992
It's nice.

3
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,544
To be honest…

4
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,802
I can't look you straight in the eyes.

5
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,435
I just need to accept…

6
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,857
the fact that you don't like me.

7
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,408
But it's hard. I'm sorry.

8
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,288
Don't be.

9
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,838
You were so warm.

10
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,427
You were so warm to me.

11
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,101
So I kept on suspecting.

12
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,654
But I won't anymore. I will stop.

13
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,826
You told me not to,
so from now on, I won't.

14
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,416
I should stop.

15
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,302
But Eun-seop.

16
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,864
Never mind. I should go.

17
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,310
Who are you?

18
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,111
From that moment until now,

19
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,615
I have always loved you.

20
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,536
If I tell you that,

21
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,082
how would you react?

22
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,012
Hold my hand.

23
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,395
I like you.

24
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,364
Then…

25
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,325
I'll call you when I'm in Seoul.

26
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,243
Okay.

27
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:35,997
Bye.

28
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,124
Goodbye.

29
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:19,624
Aunt, you're back.

30
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:20,917
Where are you coming from?

31
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,668
Gunbam!

32
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,172
Gunbam.

33
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,924
Where are you going?

34
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,595
You're such a good boy, Gunbam.

35
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,266
Did you bite me?
It's okay, bite this finger too.

36
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,936
Why are you so handsome, Gunbam?

37
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,687
Who called this handsome boy shabby?

38
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,356
Who said that? Tell me.

39
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,358
I'll give them a good talking to.

40
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:06,921
But…

41
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,466
you see, Hae-won…

42
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,414
Warm and friendly things…

43
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,291
They always made me uneasy.

44
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,304
I was afraid
my precarious moment of happiness…

45
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,226
would disappear in an instant.

46
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,918
-Okay.
-Drive safe.

47
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,630
-Hi, there.
-Hi.

48
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,007
I'm in a hurry, so I have to run.

49
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,216
All right, bye.

50
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:43,726
Hey!

51
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,686
Hi!

52
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,701
Drive safely.

53
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,745
-I will, thanks.
-The road is very frozen.

54
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,664
Have some coffee.

55
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,040
Have a cup of coffee.

56
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,249
WATCH OUT FOR CROSSING

57
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,709
It's freezing today, isn't it?

58
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,544
Everyone, move!

59
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,133
That hurts.

60
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,803
Can you please do your job as a saddle?

61
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,888
Why are you acting up these days?

62
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,099
Please get it together.

63
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,682
Mok Hae-won.

64
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,239
You must be in a good mood.

65
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,700
Yes, why wouldn't I be?

66
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,870
By the way,

67
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,372
why did you suddenly pick up cooking?

68
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,040
What?

69
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,709
You started cooking these days.

70
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,795
Just eat.

71
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:36,589
There's a deep meaning behind it.

72
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:58,235
Hello?

73
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,532
Yes.

74
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,118
It's the electrical company.

75
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,079
Can you come by next week?

76
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,040
Yes, someone will be home.

77
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,708
Okay.

78
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,009
You haven't been here in a while, right?

79
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,136
Yes, it's been about a year.

80
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,388
We have a lot of new books
since it's the new year.

81
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,641
It's when books sell best.

82
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:29,558
That's true.

83
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,686
By the way, the chief editor
was asking about you.

84
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,605
About what?

85
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,856
About your book.

86
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,151
He asked if you really
have no intention of publishing it.

87
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,280
Not yet.

88
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,865
Why not? Is it not ready?

89
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,159
But I heard it's ready for publication.

90
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,830
There are already so many good books
out there without my contribution.

91
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,123
Don't be silly!

92
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,544
Your book will join
the other good books and play a part too.

93
00:13:58,921 --> 00:13:59,797
Later.

94
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,091
Why don't you just give it to us?

95
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,260
I thought your dream was to write novels.

96
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,012
Your dream will come true
if you just hand it to us.

97
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,138
What's stopping you?

98
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,852
Give me a minute.

99
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,646
The book you want must be
in the other storage.

100
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,981
-I'll go look for it.
-Okay.

101
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:28,868
Then…

102
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,079
I'll call you when I'm in Seoul.

103
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,990
Everyone, move! Out of the way!

104
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,618
Everybody, move!

105
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,744
Get out of the way!

106
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,365
Everyone, move.

107
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,783
What?

108
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,870
Hey! Kim Yeong-su!

109
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,334
He's so annoying!

110
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,964
This darn saddle! It's killing me!

111
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,870
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

112
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,802
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

113
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,022
When did you get here?

114
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,858
Just now.

115
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,362
Didn't you take the train to Seoul?

116
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,280
I did.

117
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,408
I parked my car at the station
and drove it back home.

118
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,619
-I see.
-Yes.

119
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,961
-I'll get going, then.
-I need to leave soon.

120
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:12,007
-Where are you going?
-Jang-u planned an event.

121
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,509
He pleaded that I go to it.

122
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,345
I see.

123
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:17,971
Have fun.

124
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,105
But I guess that's an event I can't go to.

125
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,107
What?

126
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:29,858
I mean…

127
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,653
since you're not asking me to go with you.

128
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,155
No, you can go too.

129
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,116
Go get ready. Let's go together.

130
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,618
No, I don't want to go.

131
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,786
Why not?

132
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,621
Because I don't want to.

133
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,208
-Hae-won.
-Yes?

134
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,253
Come here.

135
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:51,880
I don't want to.

136
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:54,800
Come here.

137
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,180
Why?

138
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,350
-What's with the attitude?
-I'm not giving an attitude.

139
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,771
-You are.
-I am… No, I'm not.

140
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,484
Let's go together.

141
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,280
No, I'm not going.

142
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,197
Why not?

143
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,367
Because…

144
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,537
it seems like
you're uncomfortable being with me.

145
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,040
Do I?

146
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,459
Yes.

147
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,172
I feel like you're regretting it.

148
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,301
Regretting what?

149
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,473
What we did on the mountain.

150
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,772
If you think it was a mistake,

151
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,899
then let's say it was.

152
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,483
I don't like things being uncomfortable.

153
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,444
I'm really okay with that.

154
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,573
It wasn't a mistake.

155
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:03,994
How can I believe that?

156
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,632
Then let's do it again
to confirm it wasn't a mistake.

157
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,091
I thought you didn't like me.

158
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,469
That's impossible.

159
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,487
I'm sorry.

160
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:22,823
No, I'm sorry.

161
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,919
LEAPING TOWARDS CHANGE,
HYECHEON, THE GREAT CITY

162
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,812
AUTHOR SHIN YEONG-CHUN
MEET AND GREET

163
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,940
We'll begin Hyecheon's
afternoon cultural event now.

164
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,651
If you could all please get seated.

165
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,911
-Hello.
-Hello.

166
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,165
A cultural event
for the people of Hyecheon.

167
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,418
Afternoon in Hyecheon,
a Meet and Greet with Shin Yeong-chun.

168
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,587
It's an honor to get to host this event.

169
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,629
Nice to meet you.

170
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:29,222
Nobody knows what this author looks like.

171
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,602
You're curious to know what
Shin Yeong-chun looks like, right?

172
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,686
-Yes!
-Yes!

173
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,814
I feel like the host of a TV show.

174
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,319
We have prepared this surprise event

175
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,863
because the author

176
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:49,493
was more than willing to show their face

177
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,162
if everyone puts their phones away
for a brief moment.

178
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,289
A lot of people came.

179
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,916
That's true.

180
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,213
-What is it?
-All right.

181
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:04,758
-Aunt.
-Let's bring out Author Shin Yeong-chun.

182
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,718
Please give a big round of applause!

183
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,141
SHIN YEONG-CHUN,
THE AUTHOR WITH AN UNKNOWN FACE

184
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,851
AUTHOR SHIN YEONG-CHUN
MEET AND GREET

185
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:21,233
I imagined it would be an old man
because of the name.

186
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,026
-Me too.
-Right?

187
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,904
I have a question.

188
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:29,908
Why didn't you introduce yourself?

189
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,664
I'm Cha Yun-taek,
Chief Editor of Dahui Books.

190
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:42,629
-She's quite sexy.
-Right.

191
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,758
Hello, I'm sure you've all been curious.

192
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,051
-Yes!
-Yes.

193
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,469
That wasn't loud enough.

194
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,181
Hello, everyone.

195
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,225
I'm Shin Yeong-chun.
It's nice to meet you.

196
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,685
AUTHOR SHIN YEONG-CHUN
MEET AND GREET

197
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:05,360
Ms. Sim. You went to school
with Chief Editor Cha Yun-taek, right?

198
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,782
Yes, what about it?

199
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,535
It's nothing much.

200
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,745
I heard Cha Yun-taek
will be releasing a book

201
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,290
around the same time as yours.

202
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:19,916
Is that so?

203
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,336
All of Mr. Cha's books
always sell over 50,000 copies.

204
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,840
We were wondering if you had
any information on his new release.

205
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:32,095
His publication just released
a novel by Shin Yeong-chun, right?

206
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,973
Yes, it's only been two weeks,
but it's already a best-seller.

207
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,183
Already?

208
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,145
I'm sure ours will sell even better.

209
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,606
By the way,

210
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,735
is the rumor about Shin Yeong-chun
and Cha Yun-taek dating true?

211
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,613
What? Shin Yeong-chun is a woman?

212
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,407
Yes, apparently. A young woman at that.

213
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,370
Myeong-yeo.

214
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,228
Hey.

215
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:22,854
Yes, Min-jeong.

216
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:23,897
Hey, look at this.

217
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,106
Look at all the leftovers.

218
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,734
Isn't it such a waste?
I said we shouldn't order food.

219
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,945
-What a waste--
-I think I saw your friend.

220
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:30,862
My friend?

221
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,032
You mean Eun-seop? Yes, he was here today.

222
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,493
-I wanted to say hi to him.
-I see.

223
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,661
So why didn't you?

224
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,829
-Hey, you saw Eun-seop today?
-Yes.

225
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,040
Did you also see who he came with?

226
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,210
The really pretty woman?

227
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:48,797
Yes, Hae-won's pretty.
She dressed up today.

228
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,924
They looked like they were dating.

229
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,552
Then it'd be weird
to ask him out to dinner.

230
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,470
They're dating?

231
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,223
No, they're not.

232
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,267
No, they're not dating.

233
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,810
It's fine. You can eat with him.

234
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,062
They're not dating. There's no way.

235
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,356
Hold on.

236
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,233
I always get a call when I'm with you.

237
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,567
Just a second.

238
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,986
Yes, sir.

239
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,237
The noodle place?

240
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,031
Yes, I know it.

241
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,867
Okay, I'll head over right now.

242
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,582
You cleaned up well, Cha Yun-taek.

243
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,547
You've aged a lot, Myeong-yeo.

244
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,966
Do you still cry a lot?

245
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,427
Do you still swear in public places?

246
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,636
I heard you got divorced.

247
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,762
Yes, it's my third one.

248
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:40,557
It must be nice being sleazy.

249
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,474
Sleazy?

250
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,185
What are you talking about?
I loved all of them.

251
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,648
Why did you ask to talk?
You're ruining my evening.

252
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,027
You came to Seoul recently, right?

253
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,824
I thought I saw you in front of my house.

254
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:58,908
Was I mistaken?

255
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,911
What are you, a hawk?

256
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,251
Did you ever think
your outfit is a bit peculiar?

257
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,088
I just wanted to see.

258
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,550
Since everyone was talking about
how successful you were.

259
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,802
I just wanted to see for myself.

260
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,013
Like how big of a house you live in.

261
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,182
It was big. Is it a monthly rental?

262
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,225
No, I own it.

263
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,186
Good for you, you jerk.

264
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,146
Just get to the point.

265
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,743
At least now

266
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,994
You're leaving now?

267
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,371
Yes, I'll be back.

268
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,623
-Wait.
-Why?

269
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,042
Wear a scarf.

270
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,419
-A scarf?
-Yes, it's cold.

271
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:53,171
Come here.

272
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:56,091
No, it's fine.

273
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,258
It's not even cold.

274
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,469
I'm fine.

275
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,514
You are meeting
the other store owners today, right?

276
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,848
That's right.

277
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,893
Can you please talk to them?

278
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,479
Tell them to stop…

279
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,899
asking Eun-seop to help

280
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,444
when someone goes missing
in the mountains.

281
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,491
But that's a little…

282
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,201
Talk to them, please.

283
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:28,331
You have to tell the store owners
so that others won't ask him either.

284
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,376
But still…

285
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,795
The police officers
and first responders are enough.

286
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:36,881
Why do they need Eun-seop too?

287
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,428
That's true, but it's…

288
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:47,058
The last time he disappeared.

289
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,978
Do you know why he went to the mountain?

290
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,443
He said he saw that woman.

291
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,405
That woman?

292
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,406
Yes.

293
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,993
He saw a vision of that woman
and followed her.

294
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,871
He said he couldn't help but follow her.

295
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,623
But that woman is…

296
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,543
dead.

297
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,128
Exactly.

298
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:25,013
I was worried the mountains
would possess him.

299
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,017
I was scared.

300
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,193
All right. I'll tell them.

301
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,862
Really?

302
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:43,865
Yes, I'll go and tell them.

303
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,367
Thank you, honey.

304
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,911
There's no need to thank me.

305
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,414
You should put this scarf on.

306
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,374
No, it's fine. I'll just lose it again.

307
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,464
I heard you're releasing a book.

308
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,132
And?

309
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,134
I'll be releasing a book too.

310
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,303
So what?

311
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:07,222
It seems like your publishing company

312
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,184
is trying very hard
to find out my release date.

313
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,730
I was meaning to ask about that
since we're here.

314
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,565
When's the release of your book?

315
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,275
I'll release it with yours.

316
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,072
I finished writing my book.

317
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,534
So I can release it whenever I want.

318
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:29,369
Lucky me, right?

319
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,375
I'm going to release it
the day you release yours.

320
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,293
If this is revenge,

321
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,462
it's really petty.

322
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,757
I never imagined this to be
the way you'd get back at me

323
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,260
for being less talented
and less acknowledged than me.

324
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,514
You can't do this when you own a house
in the heart of Seoul.

325
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,599
That's low of you, Cha Yun-taek.

326
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,186
You were no good back then
and you're no different now.

327
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:00,775
Then release your book with our company.

328
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:03,862
What?

329
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:06,906
Your book.

330
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,825
Release it with our company.

331
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,160
I'll publish it for you.

332
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:12,745
But in return,

333
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,165
you have to write about
your life from college until now…

334
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,543
as a novel.

335
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,504
What do you say?

336
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,138
The wise man in the saying

337
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,350
soothed his stomach
with noodles after a drink.

338
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,896
That's why the writing reads,
"Alcohol first, noodles second."

339
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,356
It's nice to meet you.

340
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,901
I've only heard about you.
It's nice to finally meet you.

341
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,903
Me too. It's nice to meet you.

342
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,155
You resemble your mother a lot.

343
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,406
I do?

344
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,366
But our personalities are very different.

345
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,785
I don't think so.
Your personalities seem similar too.

346
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,870
Really?

347
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,873
Goodness, I'm sorry.

348
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,542
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

349
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,712
I guess Hae-won has her pros and cons.

350
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,547
Although I never met her mother--

351
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,382
Wait, is that you, Jang-u?

352
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,718
My gosh, hello!

353
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,138
Hello, sir.

354
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,892
-It reeks of alcohol.
-People will think I drank a lot.

355
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,478
-Although I never met her mother--
-Hey.

356
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,562
Is your father doing well?

357
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,564
-Yes, of course. He's well.
-Really?

358
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,482
Yes.

359
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,733
-Enjoy your meal.
-Okay.

360
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,110
All right.

361
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,989
I reek of soju.

362
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,618
Excuse me, you two.

363
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,537
So what I saw earlier was for real?

364
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,290
What's this…

365
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,084
chemistry between you two?

366
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,961
Why would you ask them that?

367
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:47,090
Even an old man like me can tell
there'll be wedding bells ringing soon.

368
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,633
-Come on, Mr. Park.
-Pardon?

369
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,762
Hey, what's with you?

370
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:54,389
What?

371
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,100
I can't believe you.

372
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,559
You're such a rascal.

373
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,144
Just drink, Jang-u.

374
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,021
-Don't mind them.
-Okay.

375
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,317
Then is this the end of that story?

376
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:08,736
That story? What story?

377
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,614
What else? The story of
when he fell for you.

378
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,824
Really?

379
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,326
Why? Should I tell you?

380
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,328
This sounds interesting.

381
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,830
No, Mr. Park. He's talking nonsense.

382
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,832
-Tell us. I'm curious.
-No, Hae-won--

383
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:24,085
I think it started
at the Mugunghwa train station.

384
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,003
Hey!

385
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,171
-Stop it.
-"Stop it."

386
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,562
TO JECHEON AND CHEONGNYANGNI

387
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:16,471
The Mugunghwa train and maple tree.

388
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,520
To be honest,
I can't exactly remember when that was.

389
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,274
I went to the train station
so often back then.

390
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,694
My guess is

391
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,656
that it was the day
you ran away from home.

392
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,037
Hey, hurry up! Mr. Park is waiting.

393
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,663
Come on.

394
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:47,794
Let's go.

395
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:56,636
Then was that the moment you fell for me?

396
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,180
No.

397
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:00,973
Then when?

398
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:07,188
I fell for you a few times before.
That was one of them.

399
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,611
You scared me.

400
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,385
Hey.

401
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,265
Do you want this?

402
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,311
Put your hand out.

403
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,701
-I don't want it.
-What?

404
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,536
I don't want it. Take it back.

405
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:11,752
But…

406
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,546
Wait… Hey!

407
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,603
It's so cold.

408
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:46,871
What is it?

409
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,289
Nothing.

410
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,293
-What do you mean?
-Nothing.

411
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,131
I was worried about what I'd do
if you suddenly disappeared.

412
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,683
There you are, Eun-seop.

413
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,478
The market is a mess right now!

414
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,939
What kind of mess?

415
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,109
-Why are you doing this?
-Come out quickly!

416
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,904
-We can't drink because of the ruckus!
-Don't be like this!

417
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,656
-What!
-Please stop!

418
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,407
So what if we get his help?

419
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:26,494
What then?
Should we have just let her die?

420
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,246
Whoever can save her should do it!

421
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,791
My kid can get hurt in the mountains too!

422
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,793
I had him go
because I know he won't get hurt!

423
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,337
Besides, it's not like
this was the first time.

424
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,257
You were always fine with it,
so what's your problem now?

425
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,634
Okay, fine!
I'll let it go when it comes to people.

426
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,136
But that time you lost your dog,
you called him out

427
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,264
in the middle of the night
to go up the mountain!

428
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,640
That's not right!

429
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,101
What's wrong with asking him
to look for my dog?

430
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,769
He found the dog just fine!

431
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,562
He came back safely.
That's all that matters!

432
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,232
And what if he gets hurt?
What will you do?

433
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,402
If Eun-seop gets hurt,
who will rescue him?

434
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,654
-That's enough!
-Please stop!

435
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,155
-Stop.
-Just because he's not your kid,

436
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,573
you shouldn't use him like that!

437
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,492
Is my kid the village lackey or what?

438
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:10,079
My goodness. "My kid"?

439
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:14,292
-It's a mess, Eun-seop.
-People might think he's your real kid.

440
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,501
Try to stop him.

441
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,420
-Hey, you can't say that.
-Come on.

442
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,255
It's true, though!

443
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,881
-You might fool someone
-What's with you?

444
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,050
into believing he's really your son.

445
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,845
I had forgotten about that.

446
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,973
-The fact that he's not your real kid.
-Hey, stop.

447
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:33,227
Good grief. He's just some scum
you got from the streets.

448
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,812
-Stop.
-That's enough.

449
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,189
Father!

450
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,441
-Father!
-Oh, my gosh.

451
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,526
-Father.
-Stop.

452
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,902
Don't do this, Father.

453
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,487
Let's go out. Come on.

454
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,531
I'm sorry. Let's go, Father.

455
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,782
Take your father out.

456
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:49,952
-Let's go out.
-Go on.

457
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,917
-I've known you for 30 years!
-Goodness.

458
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,003
-How could you do this to me?
-That punk--

459
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,422
-Just get in.
-Please get in.

460
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,591
-Get home safely, sir.
-Hurry up and go home.

461
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,927
-I'm sorry, Hae-won.
-It's okay.

462
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:08,763
I'm sorry.

463
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,574
They caused a whole scene again.

464
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,327
Are they trying to make it
a quarterly activity or something?

465
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,540
How's Eun-seop's father? Is he okay?

466
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:41,921
Hey, Jang-u…

467
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,992
Don't rebuke your father.

468
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,669
He said he was going out
to see the store owners.

469
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,588
So I pushed him to tell them.

470
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,718
Not to send you out
into the mountains again.

471
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,688
I won't rebuke him.

472
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,283
Thank you.

473
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,059
It was in the second
or third grade of elementary school.

474
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,228
One day,

475
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,732
a kid with an eerie aura
suddenly came to school.

476
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,571
It was Im Eun-seop.

477
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,254
What are you doing?
We were going to play soccer today.

478
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,091
I forgot to tell you.

479
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,511
I heard a wolf brought him here.

480
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,889
According to the rumors,

481
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,974
he used to live in the mountains

482
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,352
-or he was raised by a beast.
-Let's go. Quick.

483
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,229
Hurry! Hey.

484
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,813
Why did they say that about him?

485
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,693
-I think a fight broke out.
-Let's hurry.

486
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,621
My mom said your dad is a vagrant!

487
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,039
He's not!

488
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,417
She said you were abandoned by a beast.

489
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,835
You're a beggar!

490
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,921
I said I'm not!

491
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,176
Eun-seop's biological father…

492
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,263
was a vagrant living in the mountains.

493
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,890
A vagrant living in the mountains?

494
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,350
Yes.

495
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,063
That's why…

496
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,441
Yes, that's why.

497
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,446
Then what happened to him?

498
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,326
I would think he passed away.

499
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,122
I don't know much about that either.

500
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,292
As you know,
Eun-seop isn't one to talk about that.

501
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,215
I've never seen a wooden tombstone.

502
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,175
Do you know who it belongs to?

503
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,929
Kim Gil…

504
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,931
The Wolf's Silver Eyebrow.

505
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,520
He's the one who told me that story.

506
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,039
Dad!

507
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:45,956
Dad!

508
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,083
Buy me a new bike!
One that goes 80km an hour.

509
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:49,752
I'm going to ride it super fast.

510
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:52,171
Or at least change the saddle of my bike.

511
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,673
My butt has been hurting these days. Dad!

512
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,343
What are you looking at?

513
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,347
Right.

514
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,103
So you had this.

515
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,523
I've been taking wallets for 18 years,

516
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,359
but I've never seen someone like you.

517
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,736
Your wallet disappeared,
yet you don't look for it.

518
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,572
Let me know next time.

519
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,809
Is that…

520
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:48,977
your dad?

521
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,484
He just looks like you.

522
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:01,824
Hey, Eun-seop.

523
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:04,827
About the picture.

524
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,870
Can't you throw it away?

525
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,415
What?

526
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:13,210
It's just that knowing you carry around
a picture of a stranger

527
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,628
makes me jealous.

528
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:17,256
Jealous…

529
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:20,717
Excuse me.

530
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,845
I'm serious right now.

531
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,055
Okay.

532
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,643
What's with him? Has he gone mad?

533
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,728
Dad! Eun-seop is acting weird!

534
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,188
He's smiling all by himself.

535
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,732
What's wrong with him? That ugly punk.

536
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,661
Did I happen to tell you?

537
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:55,210
That I…

538
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,548
I was really happy.

539
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,649
Dad. Hurry up.

540
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,985
When did you get so fast, you punk?

541
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,697
I can't catch up with you now.

542
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,475
Hey! There's a wild boar!

543
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,185
Where?

544
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,603
I'm kidding!

545
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:56,647
Dad!

546
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,488
I'll teach you how to chop firewood today.
Let's go.

547
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,657
-Really?
-Of course.

548
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,368
You'll become a man today.

549
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,203
It's cold, so wear your jacket.

550
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,539
Let's go. Come on.

551
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,636
Dad!

552
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,806
I caught a beetle.

553
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,563
Dad!

554
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:52,869
And then one day…

555
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:00,294
that happiness disappeared in an instant.

556
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,690
At least now

557
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:58,602
You're so handsome
now that you're all clean.

558
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,189
What's your name? What do you want to eat?

559
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,691
What should I make you? Tteokbokki?

560
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,401
Gosh, it's cold.

561
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,154
-I bought some clothes.
-Goodness, close the door quickly!

562
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,531
-He's going to catch a cold.
-Let him try it.

563
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,325
I don't know if it'll fit.

564
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,660
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

565
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:17,287
I should've gone with you.

566
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,498
It'll do for now.

567
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,417
We can go out tomorrow morning
and get him some proper clothes.

568
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,378
It should've led to immediate misfortune.

569
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,174
But it didn't, which made me more afraid.

570
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,302
Which is why

571
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,389
I've become afraid

572
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,100
of all the happiness in this world.

573
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,242
How can you roam around there so freely?

574
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,704
Do you know your way around?

575
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,873
Because I'm familiar with it.

576
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,671
That's why.

577
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,841
Don't ever come up the mountain again.

578
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,512
Even if I never go back down.

579
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,809
You should never come up here.

580
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,196
He's just some scum
you got from the streets.

581
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,615
-Stop.
-That's enough.

582
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:37,617
Father!

583
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,161
-Father!
-Oh, my gosh.

584
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,746
-Father.
-Stop.

585
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:49,254
There was a boy
who was often hurt by others.

586
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,261
At times, he watched people
through the wolf's silver eyebrow.

587
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,266
It was so that he could find
the real humans…

588
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,269
among the many fake ones.

589
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:18,116
However, no matter where
the boy looked in the world,

590
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,869
there weren't any real humans.

591
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,124
The boy was lonely.

592
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:31,004
He found it hard to open up to anyone.

593
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,683
Listen.

594
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,103
People will only try to deceive you.

595
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,649
That's why we need to
read their expressions…

596
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,027
and find out…

597
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:56,738
their real intentions.

598
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,241
Why are people

599
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,828
trying to deceive us?

600
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,791
Because

601
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,460
no real human

602
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,672
exists in the world.

603
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:26,601
No.

604
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:30,981
You were wrong, Eun-seop.

605
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,607
Hi, Hae-won. My name is Im Hwi.

606
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,526
We don't look alike, but I'm his sister.

607
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,821
Why did you ask Eun-seop to come?

608
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,783
-You know how he is.
-Come on, honey.

609
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,754
BOOKS

610
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:37,130
You're wrong, Eun-seop.

611
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,355
About the story
of the boy with the wolf's silver eyebrow.

612
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,942
Remember what you said?

613
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:58,944
That the boy

614
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:03,239
fails to find a village with real humans.

615
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:06,368
But you're wrong.

616
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:11,164
The boy eventually finds the village.

617
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:13,875
Then he lives there…

618
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,670
happily ever after.

619
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,007
Just like you are now.

620
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,149
You were…

621
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,443
that boy.

622
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:44,781
You were…

623
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,450
also that boy.

624
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,955
You were just as cold as I was.

625
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:02,424
Then you know what?

626
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,886
I will hug you now.

627
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:16,730
Can you hug me back with all your might?

628
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,239
Hug me so that it won't disappear…

629
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,076
or melt away in an instant.

630
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:33,955
Come to me…

631
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:36,207
and hug me.

632
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,334
And I'll hug you back.

633
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,757
Can you hug me…

634
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:51,264
so that we'll be warm forever, Eun-seop?

635
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:50,824
BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

636
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,283
POSTED BY SEOP

637
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:57,080
Looking back now,
the Mugunghwa train was the problem.

638
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:02,210
It was an early morning in the fall.
There was a maple tree on the platform.

639
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:07,507
She was standing there,
where the early morning train stopped.

640
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:12,512
So how could I not fall for her?

641
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:17,308
The truth is,
my history with Irene dates far back.

642
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:22,188
I ran into her when I was around ten.

643
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:27,193
I thought Irene was a boy.

644
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:34,075
Yes, we probably spent many more pages
together than we thought.

645
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:39,998
Why is that man looking for you?

646
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:43,376
He probably just wants to know
where Eun-seop is.

647
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,462
He might've already gone to the bookstore.

648
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,131
You better get it straight.
I'm the one related to you by blood.

649
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,675
What will you do about the contract?

650
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:53,970
Winter is almost over.
Didn't you say you'll go back in spring?

651
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,264
Regardless, I can't let him go.

652
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,559
Hwi said you'll be leaving
this place soon.

653
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,020
Mom! Eun-seop ran away!

654
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,771
Im Eun-seop is going to leave.

655
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,732
Somewhere far away.

656
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:12,113
