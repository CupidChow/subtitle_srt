1
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,000
She has returned.

2
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,710
How long will you be staying this time?

3
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,921
I plan to stay here for a while
and work part-time.

4
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,007
He has a girlfriend now.
Her name is Irene.

5
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,092
I mentioned Bo-yeong the other day, right?

6
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,470
She said you two have a misunderstanding.

7
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,305
It's been so long, right?

8
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,057
Everything burst.

9
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,559
I'm escaping from here, just like this.

10
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,519
I'll just go back to Seoul.

11
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,188
Just stay here for five days.

12
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,607
With a little fixing up,
it will be as good as before.

13
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,233
Eun-seop!

14
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,611
If he's not at the other places,
he's probably there.

15
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,570
Why would he go there?

16
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,072
He sometimes goes there like a lunatic.

17
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,533
How can you roam around there so freely?

18
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,160
Because I'm familiar with it.

19
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,037
That's why.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,830
It's complete chaos right now.

21
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,334
Someone went missing in the mountains,
so the whole town is going crazy.

22
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,170
Why does everyone assume it's okay
to ask Eun-seop to do this?

23
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,173
Some people never share their worries.

24
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,593
They can't say they're struggling
or that they're in pain.

25
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,472
Maybe even until they die.

26
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,566
What is this?

27
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,277
Did you harvest sweet potatoes?

28
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:55,406
No, my sister-in-law gave me some.

29
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,325
Lucky you.

30
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,494
I wish I had someone
to give me sweet potatoes.

31
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,050
Don't eat them all by yourself.
Share some with me, okay?

32
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,345
Of course, I'll call you over.

33
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:21,266
Good, you better.
I'll buy a bottle of makgeolli for us.

34
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,268
BUKHYUN-RI, HYECHEON, SEOHYEON

35
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,772
I feel carsick.

36
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,984
It's because you were
chatting so much on the bus.

37
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,695
That makes no sense.
Chatting doesn't make you carsick.

38
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,405
It's possible.

39
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,124
By any chance, are you Myeong-ju?

40
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,751
Hello.

41
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,713
You've aged quite a bit.

42
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,369
Mom!

43
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,045
Mom!

44
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,680
Wait for me.

45
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:36,818
Grandma!

46
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,710
Did you suddenly accelerate?

47
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,881
Was it an accident?

48
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,426
Did the car not stop
even when you hit the brakes?

49
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,430
No.

50
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,851
I never stepped on the brakes.

51
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,733
Despite the fact that
your husband was in front of the car?

52
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,283
Yes.

53
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,579
Despite that.

54
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,373
Is it because you panicked,

55
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,708
or did your legs cramp up?

56
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,625
No.

57
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,173
I saw my husband in front of the car.

58
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,844
But I had…

59
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,351
no desire to step on the brakes.

COURT RULING

63
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,080
I sentence the defendant Sim Myeong-ju
to seven years in prison.

64
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:17,251
However, I deem this an accident,
as the incident happened

65
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,755
while the defendant was running away
from the victim's violent outburst.

66
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,382
Considering that the defendant
was trying to escape

67
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,843
physical abuse from the victim,

68
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,263
and that the victim's family
doesn't wish for…

00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,067

You should eat.

00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,692
-I think that's the eldest daughter.
-Is it her?

77
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,446
I think you're right.

81
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,242
Hello?

82
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,040
Okay.

83
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,098
Let me explain what happened, Mom…

84
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,644
Sir, there's no need to be gentle.

85
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,562
It's fine if it gets damaged.

86
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,440
It's out of business,
so it doesn't need to be pretty.

87
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,566
Just tear it all down--

88
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,922
We're doing construction
because the pipes burst.

89
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,466
He said it'll take two weeks…

90
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,509
You have three days.

91
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,847
That's impossible.
He said it'll end in ten days.

92
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,807
Shall I end it for you?

93
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:25,851
No.

94
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,355
I'll talk to the contractor.

95
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,233
Where are you two staying?

96
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,984
She's at Eun-seop's. I'm with Su-jeong.

97
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,612
-Eun-seop?
-He's a guy and Su-jeong's a girl.

98
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,406
We sleep in separate rooms.

99
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,251
-Then what about me?
-You?

100
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,964
I'll try to ask Su-jeong.

101
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,508
She'll let you stay for one or two days.

102
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,097
Next question.

103
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,808
Did you close down the cottage?

104
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,896
How do you plan on making a living?
You've got some nerve.

105
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,649
Right, Myeong-yeo?

GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

107
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,996
Did you stop by your place?

108
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,124
Yes, my mom's here.

109
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,792
Your mom?

110
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,877
Yes.

111
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,484
My mom and I meet twice a year.

112
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,113
Welcome.

113
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,156
There's a wait.

114
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,908
Take a seat here. It won't be long.

115
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,495
It's hot now.

116
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,707
Here are your noodles. Enjoy.

117
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,545
We meet once in the summer.

118
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,175
- Hi.
- Hi. One without seaweed, please.

119
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,594
-Sure. One order with no seaweed!
-Okay.

120
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:08,847
It's cold now.

121
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,309
Then once around when winter comes.

122
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,652
Guess what we do when we meet?

123
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,075
We eat a meal and get tea.

124
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,708
See you next time.

125
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:55,436
Then we part ways.

126
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,939
It's because we have
nothing to talk about.

127
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,988
My mom has always been
indifferent toward her family.

128
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:09,867
I see.

129
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,120
I wonder why she came here.

130
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,211
Did she suddenly show up without notice?

131
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,589
Yes.

132
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,344
There must be another reason.

133
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,015
What's more, she hates
coming back to her hometown.

134
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,225
She says it reminds her of my dad.

135
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,728
Then why…

136
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,940
Why…

137
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,109
did she suddenly show up?

138
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,531
Hold your arms up.

139
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,497
Hey, you! Your skirt!

140
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,422
Hey, Yeong-su.

141
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,841
Excellent.

142
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,261
Try and learn from him, kids.

143
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,431
My gosh, we meet again, Yeong-su.

144
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,225
How do we always meet at this time?

145
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,810
Is this what they call fate?

146
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,687
So, what did you do yesterday?

147
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,155
I read a book. A novel.

148
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,741
The title was
Natasha, the White Donkey, and Me.

149
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,704
So what?

150
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,248
You mean, what did I think of the book?

151
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,000
I didn't enjoy it, but Jang-u did.

152
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,627
-Not that.
-Then the price of the book?

153
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,255
I think it was 12,800 won.
Or maybe it was 11,500 won.

154
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,341
-Aren't you a junior?
-Yes, I am. My name is Im Hwi.

155
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,969
"Im" like important,
and "Hwi" like the sound of a whistle.

156
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:52,886
Sure.

157
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,057
What is it?

158
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:01,103
Don't tell me you regret that you said
you didn't like me last time?

159
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,063
No, I don't regret that.

160
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,149
Then what?

161
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,068
It's irritating because I'm a senior.

162
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,279
What about that?

163
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,657
You're talking to me informally right now.

164
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,744
That's because
I don't like using honorifics.

165
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,622
You like to speak informally
because you don't like honorifics?

166
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,832
Yes.

167
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,586
Then I'll reject you
because I like rejecting people.

168
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,296
What?

169
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,964
Don't talk to me until I graduate.

170
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,051
By the way,

171
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,724
Natasha, the White Donkey, and Me
isn't a novel.

172
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,769
-It's a poem.
-What?

173
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,646
You'd know if you actually read,

174
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,733
but a novel is a literary form of prose
where the author

175
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,652
makes up a fictional story
based on facts or their imagination,

176
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,822
whereas poetry is when one expresses
their emotions and thoughts

177
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,284
about nature or life
using connotation and rhythm.

178
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,661
-What?
-Forget it.

179
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,124
It was a poem?

180
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,127
I thought it was a novel
because it was so long.

181
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:12,049
Shouldn't the author have given me
a heads-up about the length?

182
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,554
Did he just reject me again?

183
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,641
Hwi.

184
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,268
I'll tell you the type of girl
a top student likes.

185
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:27,189
Yes, tell me. Who is it?
What kind of person?

186
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,275
It's no one.
They have no interest in girls.

187
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,736
-What?
-There's no top student out there

188
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,447
who can keep the title
while also being interested in girls.

189
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,907
Then Jang-u,

190
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,827
what about the guys who are smart,
but also popular with girls,

191
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,120
and good at sports too?

192
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,704
What do you call them?

193
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,375
We have a word for those guys.
It's "unicorn."

194
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,127
Did you say unicorns?

195
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,504
The flying horse with a horn on its head?

196
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,757
I'm saying it's an imaginary creature.

197
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,720
Wait, seriously? It can't be.

198
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,431
He really has no interest in girls?
He's a red-blooded youth--

199
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,349
Hey!

200
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,060
You kids barely have time to study,
let alone date.

201
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,062
It's impossible to be interested in girls.

202
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,898
Why is the bus taking forever?

203
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,191
Are you being serious?

204
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,818
Were you like that too?

205
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:13,735
No, I was a unicorn.

206
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,489
But I am being serious.

207
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,033
The school's top student will never…

208
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,661
Right. He said they don't like girls.

209
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,497
Yeong-su obviously rejected me
because he doesn't like girls.

210
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,999
-Why? Because I'm a girl.
-Hey!

211
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,710
-He would've rejected anyone.
-Big news! Je-in has a boyfriend!

212
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,128
-Who?
-Kim Yeong-su!

213
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,130
Is it the Kim Yeong-su I know?

214
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,047
No way.

215
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,966
Je-in probably just has her eyes on him.

216
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,427
That basically means they're dating.

217
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,137
Gosh, I feel bad for Yeong-su.

218
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,889
Did Je-in hit him?

219
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:44,099
I know, right? She has interesting taste.

220
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,351
-I can't believe it.
-That's crazy.

221
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,401
I don't know what it's like
in the orchestral music industry,

222
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,030
but in the literature field,
there were so many lunatics.

223
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,116
They all thought they were Virginia Woolf,
Natsume Soseki,

224
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,368
Svetlana Alexievich, Patrick Süskind,

225
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,371
Alexander Sergeyevich Pushkin,
Milan Kundera, and so on.

226
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,334
Bunch of narcissists who took themselves
for great thinkers or geniuses.

227
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,251
That's not all.

228
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,837
They think everything they spit out
is a poem or novel.

229
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,758
It was such a mess,
I could barely stomach it for four years.

230
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,385
But there was one person
who was the craziest among them.

231
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,429
-Guess who it was.
-I'm not sure.

232
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,347
You.

233
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,057
Correct.

234
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,393
The craziest of them all.

235
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,187
The craziest of the craziest.

236
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,731
The best of the nutjobs was who?

237
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,734
Me. It was me.

238
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,029
I was by far the strangest student
at Leesin University.

239
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:43,075
However, there was still one person
who beat me in terms of craziness.

240
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,785
Do you know who that was?

241
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,869
Is it…

242
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:46,787
Mom.

243
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:48,830
Correct.

244
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,794
That's right. It was your mom.

245
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,338
Your mom is the weirdest
no matter where she goes.

246
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,049
Common sense and words
don't get through to her.

247
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:02,511
She's cold, mean, and scary.

248
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,762
Aunt.

249
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,055
All right, we got it.

250
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,057
That's enough. We all know this about her.

251
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,268
You do?

252
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,727
So what's your point?

253
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,485
Get up. We must go out.

254
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,654
Go out? Why?

255
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,741
Your mom wants to get lunch together.

256
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,577
Why does she want to get lunch?

257
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:28,996
Who knows.

258
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,833
We just do as she says.

259
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,710
Let's go.

260
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,048
Shall I drop you off?

261
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,718
You better hurry up, Hae-won.

262
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,052
Let's go.

263
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,410
So why did you come here?

264
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,041
What did you say?

265
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,481
SANDEUL BOOKSTORE

266
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,574
I heard from somewhere…

267
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:49,659
Yes?

268
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,828
…that Sim Myeong-ju is here?

269
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,540
Yes.

270
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,835
I've had multiple people
ask me that on my way here.

271
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,379
That's no surprise.

272
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,925
Myeong-ju was quite well-known.

273
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:06,510
It seems like it.

274
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,011
Myeong-ju,

275
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,640
she was a year younger than me.

276
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,393
She was so pretty.

277
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,814
Yes, she is beautiful.

278
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,237
But she's cold.

279
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,032
That's her charm.

280
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,743
Hey, come on!

281
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,037
Hurry up!

282
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,421
Back then,

283
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:47,467
all the boys in this town liked Myeong-ju.

284
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,846
My gosh. Did you see her?

285
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,764
-Hey, it's her.
-It's Sim Myeong-ju.

286
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,891
-It's Sim Myeong-ju.
-No way.

287
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,726
-Where?
-There.

288
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,688
The bus will depart now.

289
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,900
I always wondered
who she'd end up marrying.

290
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,824
To my surprise, she married the guy

291
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:13,410
who chased after her the most tenaciously.

292
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,708
She got pregnant.

293
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,513
But still,

294
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,685
I had no doubt that she'd be happy.

295
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,360
-I'll take these books.
-Okay, these here?

296
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,698
With the 20 percent discount,

297
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,077
the total is 102,200 won.

298
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,495
I'll wire you the money.

299
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,668
Do you still get self-published books?

300
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,794
Yes, sometimes.

301
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,881
I gathered them up over there.
Come by and take a look sometime.

302
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,926
-Okay.
-Take whatever looks interesting.

303
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:31,780
Hello?

304
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,532
Hey, Hae-won.

305
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,035
I'm done. Where are you?

306
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,164
I'm done too,
but I have another engagement.

307
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,835
Yes. Around an hour.

308
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,049
Sure, you head back home first.

309
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,760
All right.

310
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:54,803
Okay.

311
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,820
It's me, Eun-seop.

312
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,157
Where should we meet?

313
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,037
Are you going home?

314
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,456
-Yes.
-Bye then.

315
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,625
Bye.

316
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,200
Welcome.

317
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,661
Do you have camellias by any chance?

318
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,663
Camellias? Hold on.

319
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,263
I have some leftovers
from another customer's order.

320
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,973
How many would you like?

321
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,267
I'll take half of these, please.

322
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,268
All right.

323
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,020
Shall I mix in some other flowers?

324
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,063
No, that's fine.

325
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,135
-Have you been well?
-Yes. Hi.

326
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,639
What do you want to drink? I'll get…

327
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,599
What's up?

328
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,353
I thought it might be urgent.

329
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,605
Is something going on?

330
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:19,531
TTEURAK FLOWER SHOP

331
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,701
-You look pretty today.
-Hey, did you hear?

332
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,245
Hae-won snatched the guy
that Bo-yeong likes.

333
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,372
-For real?
-I heard that too.

334
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,541
Bo-yeong says she's the victim.

335
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,042
She must feel wronged.

336
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,170
Who does Bo-yeong like anyway?

337
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,939
Hae-won snatched Bo-yeong's crush.

338
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,234
It's Im Eun-seop. Look.

339
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,333
Guess what?

340
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,211
I have a crush on someone!

341
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,713
Who is it?

342
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,091
The loner in our class
who's always reading!

343
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,803
The loner who's always reading?

344
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,929
Yes!

345
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,765
I like him so much!

346
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,703
Hey.

347
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,252
-When did you get here?
-Just now.

348
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,181
Mom.

349
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,059
Why did you really come here?

350
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,397
You had no particular reason to come.

351
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,649
I'm sure you're not here
to see me or Aunt.

352
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:44,527
It's neither Grandma's
nor Dad's memorial day.

353
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,154
There's no reason for you to come.

354
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,577
Did you leave something here?

355
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,746
You should've told me.

356
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,832
I could've sent it.
It would've been more convenient.

357
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,086
Although, it's not like
I have any idea where you live.

358
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,049
Are you…

359
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,384
trying to pick a fight with me?

360
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,804
Why would I do that?

361
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,598
Have you ever fought with me?

362
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,935
I don't think I've ever fought with you.
Don't you agree?

363
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,187
No, I haven't.

364
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,564
Why did you come?

365
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,945
Are you not going to tell me?

366
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,785
It's because it has nothing
to do with you.

367
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:42,794
Why are you laughing?

368
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,673
"It's because it has nothing
to do with you."

369
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,135
I've heard that so many times from you.

370
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,681
But you know what's hilarious?

371
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:59,435
That's not something
a parent says to their child.

372
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,897
It's usually the other way around.

373
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,820
But you don't only do this to me.

374
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,990
You do it to Aunt and Grandma.
You even did it to Dad.

375
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,161
That has--

376
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,747
Nothing to do with me? I know.

377
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,463
But then,

378
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,176
what exactly can I talk to you about, Mom?

379
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,762
I'm truly curious.

380
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:40,101
What can I ask you? What do I say to you?

381
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,231
I've never asked you anything until now.

382
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,275
Have I ever asked you anything?

383
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,445
Where you live, who you live with,

384
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,822
whether you live alone,
why you don't live with me.

385
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,409
Why we say we're family,
yet we only see each other twice a year.

386
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,660
I don't ask you those things.

387
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,079
Why…

388
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,750
why you never accepted my visit requests

389
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,835
and never once replied to my letters.

390
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,421
Why you…

391
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,009
why you did that to Dad back then.

392
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,511
Whether the reason I know is true.

393
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,096
That's enough.

394
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,307
Whether you really killed him,

395
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,224
or…

396
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,935
whether it just somehow happened,

397
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,396
but you went to jail
out of your guilt towards Dad.

398
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,108
I never ask you this stuff, do I?

399
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,235
Stop it.

400
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,696
It was tough for me too back then.

401
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:39,577
I was also hurting at that time.

402
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:44,248
I'm sure it was worse for you,
but I really wanted to die.

403
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,921
I wanted to go crying to anyone,

404
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:53,800
asking why I deserved to
be punished like this.

405
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,387
But I didn't do that.

406
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,432
I had no one to ask.

407
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,104
Everyone abandoned me
to tend to their own pain.

408
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,856
I was left alone.

409
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:20,868
So I feel very awkward and uncomfortable
when you suddenly show up like this.

410
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,745
So leave tomorrow.

411
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,374
And make sure to let me know
the next time you come.

412
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,443
I'm back.

413
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,290
Myeong-yeo! Do you want one or two eggs?

414
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:53,878
Where did my sister go?

415
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,215
I don't know. She was gone when I woke up.

416
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,725
Watch out for cars, you punks!

417
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,060
-Hello!
-Hello!

418
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,563
Seung-o, Ha-yun, and Yu…

419
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,357
han!

420
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,697
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

421
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,341
Hey, you.

422
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,683
You're Hae-won's mother. Hello.

423
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,227
Just call me Ms. Sim.

424
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,772
Okay, Ms. Sim.

425
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:59,568
Do you have a moment?

426
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,737
Me?

427
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,073
Yes, you.

428
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,161
You also asked her why she came?

429
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,414
-Yes.
-What did she say?

430
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,583
I don't know.
But she said she's leaving tomorrow.

431
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,002
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

432
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,505
Then why did she come here unannounced?

433
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,590
I just don't get it.

434
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,302
All right.

435
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,096
Can I help with anything?

436
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,681
No.

437
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,559
Hey, the construction finishes tomorrow.
You know that, right?

438
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,394
Yes, I know.

439
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:39,150
-Excuse me.
-I'm sorry.

440
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,777
What should we do with the kitchen?

441
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,904
Just destroy it. Tear it all down.

442
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,479
You're not going to sit?

443
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,397
No.

444
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,276
Are you friends with Hae-won?

445
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,447
Yes, since we were kids.

446
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,994
Has Hae-won perhaps…

447
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:33,829
Yes?

448
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,250
Forget it.

449
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,505
It's nothing. My point is…

450
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,298
I'm listening.

451
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,761
Myeong-yeo told me…

452
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,972
that you know Park Huin-dol.

453
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,101
Yes, I know him.

454
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:01,440
I wanted to ask…

455
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,236
if you could give these to him.

456
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,323
RECIPIENT: SIM MYEONG-JU

457
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,995
I can't deliver them myself.

458
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,582
I don't even know his address
because he didn't write it.

459
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,334
SENDER: PARK HUIN-DOL

460
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,087
I'll deliver these to him.

461
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,590
I have a message for him too.
Should I tell you?

462
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,885
No, I don't think I can relay it.

463
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,055
Is that so?

464
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,308
It's nothing nice, is it?

465
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,352
Of course not.

466
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,857
Then I'll just deliver these.

467
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,782
Then my business here is done.

468
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,423
-Goodbye then.
-Bye.

469
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,468
By the way,

470
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,846
haven't you seen me somewhere?

471
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,770
I think I've seen you somewhere.

472
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,233
Yes, I've seen you before.

473
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,029
So it is you.

474
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,615
Yes, it is.

475
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,161
You grew up well.

476
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,621
Why were you with my mom?

477
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,083
It just happened.

478
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,795
Do you know my mom?

479
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,506
No, but I met her once.

480
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,758
When?

481
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,554
I think…

482
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,474
I was around ten years old.

483
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,271
It was at the Intercity Bus Terminal.

484
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:49,692
HYECHEON INTERCITY BUS TERMINAL

485
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,451
What is it, kid?

486
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,747
Do I look interesting to you?

487
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,000
Yes.

488
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,752
What's so interesting?

489
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,005
You're pretty.

490
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,924
And that's cool too.

491
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,554
This?

492
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,056
This is something

493
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,976
fashionable people wear.

494
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:26,937
They're like glasses.

495
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,315
I see.

496
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,278
What is it?

497
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,489
Are you a pretty person?

498
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,960
Yes, I am.

499
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,590
Why?

500
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,261
Do you want to see my eyes too?

501
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:01,263
Yes.

502
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,059
I think your eyes behind that thing
will be very pretty too.

503
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,560
You think so?

504
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,563
Well then…

505
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,026
if that's what you want, cutie.

506
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,363
I'll show you.

507
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,711
What was my mom like?

508
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,422
What do you think?

509
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,342
Am I pretty?

510
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,182
She was a beautiful woman.

511
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:50,562
I see.

512
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,491
To be honest,
I was in a bad mood yesterday.

513
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:04,868
Why?

514
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,580
I saw you downtown.

515
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,458
I saw you with Bo-yeong.

516
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,593
Can I ask you something?

517
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,681
Hi.

518
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,478
Have you been well, dear?

519
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:09,826
It's your favorite flower.

520
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,371
It's your birthday gift.

521
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:05,215
You carried this all the way here?

522
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,175
It's my birthday today.

523
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,303
I'll make you happy forever.

524
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,560
Please marry me.

525
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,546
Regardless,

526
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,176
I still hate you.

527
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,765
I also hate this day,

528
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,560
which marks the start of my misfortune.

529
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:23,085
So you came here for that? Clothes?

530
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:25,170
Yes.

531
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,047
You should've told me.

532
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,966
I could've sent them to you.

533
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,930
I had specific clothes in mind.

534
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,268
Call in advance next time,
so I can prepare some stuff.

535
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,938
It's hard to remember
because he goes by the lunar calendar.

536
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,653
What's more,

537
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,199
you never really celebrated
his birthday to begin with.

538
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,913
He only celebrated
your birthday and Hae-won's, not…

539
00:49:59,996 --> 00:50:01,540
-Hey.
-What?

540
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:08,588
I'm leaving.

541
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,298
Fine.

542
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,299
By the way,

543
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:16,096
Hae-won's angry at me.

544
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:18,890
She's been angry at you
for the past 30 years.

545
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,728
But Myeong-ju,

546
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,399
she won't be angry anymore
if you do just one thing.

547
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,488
What is it?

548
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,323
A letter.

549
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:41,955
Write her a letter.

550
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,292
Like you did for me.

551
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,784
She suddenly asked to meet.

552
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,375
Hello?

553
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,462
Eun-seop. It's me, Bo-yeong.

554
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,298
Hi.

555
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:36,218
Do you have time today? I wanted to talk.

556
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,389
I have a favor to ask.

557
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,009
-Have you been well?
-Yes. Hi.

558
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,556
What do you want to drink? I'll get…

559
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,516
What's up?

560
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,395
TTEURAK FLOWER SHOP

561
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:42,534
I was hoping you could help me.

562
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,248
What can I help you with?

563
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,713
I want to be friends with Hae-won again.

564
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,926
But she doesn't even want to hear me out.

565
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,887
She keeps misunderstanding me.

566
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,565
I want to get along with Hae-won.

567
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,317
Even if it's been ten years,

568
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,736
I don't think it's right
for friends to be like this.

569
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:19,321
That's how I feel.

570
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,328
Can you help me?

571
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,978
I never liked the people

572
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,940
who would come over
even though they weren't welcome.

573
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,570
Some say that's romantic,

574
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,073
but I disagree.

575
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,201
That's an act of disregard
for my feelings.

576
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,163
They're saying
they'll do whatever they please.

577
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,879
They should respect my rejection too.

578
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,676
She needs to respect my decision
to not accept her apology.

579
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,677
Don't you agree?

580
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:27,847
I agree.

581
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,310
I feel pressured by Bo-yeong's actions.

582
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,312
I don't like it.

583
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,321
Hae-won.

584
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,325
How about we do something
that will lift your mood?

585
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:12,720
Eun-seop.

586
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,098
Yes?

587
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:19,727
It's nothing.

588
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:12,530
Yes, Grandpa.

589
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,284
I'm on my way. I'm almost there.

590
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,495
Are you at the town hall?

591
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,915
You should ask Father
about his matters, not me.

592
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:24,542
Okay, Grandpa. I'll see you in a bit.

593
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,673
Where am I?

594
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:34,719
I think it was over there.

595
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,057
There's a time

596
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:42,143
when something very small
and trivial enters your body.

597
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,731
Watch where you're going!

598
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:49,943
You little…

599
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,445
What are you doing?

600
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,658
It could be the scratchy seed
of a cocklebur.

601
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:04,832
What?

602
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:09,671
Or Min-seok's finger
slightly touching my underarm.

603
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,381
Song Je-in is looking for you.

604
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,472
Or a toothache you forgot about
that comes back

605
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,934
and puts you in terrible pain.

606
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,771
Wait!

607
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:31,401
It's like the smell of jjajangmyeon
after classes are over.

608
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,871
There's a time

609
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,333
when something very small
and trivial enters your body.

610
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:53,548
The very small and trivial thing

611
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,259
enters my body,

612
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,428
not knowing it's a prison.

613
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:03,182
There's a time it comes inside
and embraces me passionately.

614
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,146
That was a poem called

615
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:11,733
A Very Small and Trivial Thing
by An Do-hyeon.

616
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,947
Jang-u. Doesn't that go there?

617
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,490
-No, it goes here.
-Goodbye.

618
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:22,076
I've been dying to use the bathroom.

619
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,412
Why did you hold it in?

620
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:25,538
I loved the poem.

621
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,042
I had another wonderful time today.

622
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,712
-Please take a piece of pie, everyone.
-You didn't have to.

623
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,005
It's not the same without it.

624
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:35,715
-What's with your sister?
-It's big.

625
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,133
I don't know. She came in like that.

626
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,969
She's so scary.
I'm terrified of your sister.

627
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:43,139
She's always so bubbly,
so seeing her angry is terrifying.

628
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,474
I feel the same way.

629
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:45,933
You too, right?

630
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,353
-I'll see you all next week then!
-Okay!

631
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,146
-See you next week!
-Goodbye.

632
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,481
Bye, Uncle.

633
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,024
Bye, Hwi.

634
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:55,068
Hey, Hae-won. Bye.

635
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,579
That was terrifying. I was really scared.

636
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,956
I think I have a phobia of angry women
because of my mom.

637
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:11,751
Anyway, I'm off.

638
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:12,710
See you tomorrow…

639
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,879
or I'll see you again someday.

640
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,214
Why are you always so busy?

641
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:19,258
The Hyecheon High reunion, remember?

642
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,677
Is that really happening?

643
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,136
Didn't you get the text?

644
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,972
You know the 50th anniversary
reunion is in two days, right?

645
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,599
Everyone needs to attend.

646
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,686
But why are you preparing for that alone?

647
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,855
It's because I said something
completely unnecessary

648
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,691
when I met with
the former student council presidents.

649
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,652
I said it'd be nice to have
an all-alumni reunion

650
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:40,405
so everyone can meet,
so they're making me plan it.

651
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,490
I've been so busy planning
that I'm losing sleep.

652
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:43,616
It's been really rough.

653
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,618
It's exhausting,
but I still have tons left to do.

654
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,536
Goodbye, then.

655
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,830
-Good luck.
-Bye.

656
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:49,747
All right.

657
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:55,044
Let's go upstairs.

658
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,263
-He must've left something.
-Right.

659
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,062
Excuse me, I…

660
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,674
Look who it is.

661
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,385
It's Mok Hae-won.

662
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,228
Do you know me?

663
01:02:58,399 --> 01:02:59,233
Look who it is.

664
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:01,903
It's Mok Hae-won.

665

BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

666
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,162
POSTED BY SEOP

667
01:03:53,955 --> 01:03:58,626
I looked back on the things
I have said to Irene.

668
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:03,047
"All first loves are over in the past."
Why did I say that at the time?

669
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:06,092
Thanks to the repair work
being done at the Walnut House,

670
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,302
she and I have ended up
sharing the same space.

671
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:13,975
If she asks me again, I might say,

672
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:18,229
"Most first loves are over in the past,
but I'm the exception,"

673
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:23,234
and that nothing is over for me

674
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:26,195
PS: Irene bought flowers.
I asked her, why camellias?

675
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,906
She said they were her father's favorite
when he was alive.

676
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,409
I'm starting to feel closer to her

677
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:34,537
with each story she tells me
about her family from time to time.

678
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,251
I came because of you.

679
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,711
Just to see you.

680
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,462
Go upstairs first and rest.

681
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:44,463
I'll wrap it up.

682
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,173
I'm going home today, though.

683
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:47,800
Tonight at ten,

684
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,427
the Hyecheon High School all-class reunion

685
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,095
will be held in the schoolyard.

686
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:52,930
Did you see? Oh Yeong-woo's here too.

687
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,557
He showed up with Mok Hae-won.

688
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,183
Does it bother you?

689
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,644
Whatever kind of feelings
you have for me right now,

690
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,355
I don't want to know.
It doesn't matter to me.

691
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:03,858
Do you have someone you like?

692
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:12,909
