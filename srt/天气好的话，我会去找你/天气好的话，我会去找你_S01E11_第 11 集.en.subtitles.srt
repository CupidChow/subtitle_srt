1
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,335
You even came to see me off.

2
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,546
What an honor.

3
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:50,842
Hey.

4
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,220
Maybe you can finally tell me about it.

5
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,014
About what?

6
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:57,849
About that day.

7
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,311
Why you broke up with me.

8
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,231
I broke up with you so many times.

9
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,442
About a thousand times.

10
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,360
The very last time.

11
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,907
On September 5th, 2010 at 9:23 a.m.

12
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,700
You texted me, "Let's break up."

13
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,912
I want an answer to that, Myeong-yeo.

14
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:21,372
Why on earth did you do that?

15
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,368
Let's break up.

16
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,507
I said let's break up.

17
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:18,972
Myeong-yeo.

18
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,559
Class is over. We have to go now.

19
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,185
Everyone left.

20
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:34,195
How could you wear a sweater
with a dog on it?

21
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,793
Higher.

22
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,755
Let's break up.

23
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,260
Don't stop pushing, though.

24
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,346
-Go on!
-Okay.

25
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,474
More! Higher!

26
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,105
Keep pushing.

27
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,524
Okay.

28
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,070
-Stop crying!
-I'm not crying.

29
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,533
-Hey.
-Yes?

30
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,827
Don't you think you walk too upright?

31
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,996
Right.

32
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,540
I'll walk like this.

33
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,634
I'm getting a headache.

34
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,571
Let's break up.

35
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:03,993
Why?

36
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:23,930
Answer me.

37
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,185
There's no reason.

38
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,956
COME TO HYECHEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL,
CANCER WARD ROOM NUMBER 803

39
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,750
"Cancer ward."

40
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,390
Why is it always tangerines?

41
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,850
I know you got them for yourself.

42
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:09,976
I got them for us both.

43
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,520
I don't want them. You ate them yesterday.

44
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,355
Eat the tangerines. They're in season.

45
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,733
I asked you to buy me peaches.

46
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,485
I should just plant
a peach tree at this rate.

47
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,779
I want to eat peaches

48
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,073
-that look like you.
-I don't have any right now.

49
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:26,617
Sim Myeong-yeo!

50
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,088
You bought peaches.

51
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,262
What's your deal?

52
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,890
You're showing your face
now that I'm about to die?

53
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:53,436
You never came to any of our reunions
no matter how much I asked.

54
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,688
I'm here.

55
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,733
That's all that matters. Get off my case.

56
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,860
-Ms. Choi Sun-yeong.
-Yes?

57
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,779
You asked to move to a six-person room?

58
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,363
-Yes.
-It'll be a bit of a wait.

59
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,157
Okay.

60
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,493
Are you really dying?

61
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,787
Yes.

62
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,413
That's what I was told.

63
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,624
Hey.

64
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,460
Watch out for breast cancer, you two.

65
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,420
You need to get checked regularly.

66
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,553
What the heck?

67
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,181
What's wrong with her?

68
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,308
Who knows.

69
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,939
You really are an old lady.

70
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,525
Seeing how you bought canned peaches.

71
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,111
Who does that these days?

72
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,868
Hey.

73
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,787
What happened to your eyes?

74
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,665
So?

75
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,417
Does it make you feel better?

76
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,588
-What?
-They say misery loves company.

77
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,340
What are you saying?

78
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,342
So do you like it?

79
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:15,309
Myeong-yeo!

80
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,438
Explain this to me.

81
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,774
Sim Myeong-yeo. Tell me!

82
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,901
It's as you can see.

83
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,570
So what am I seeing?

84
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,779
It's glaucoma.

85
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,494
-Did you see a doctor?
-I told you earlier. It's a hassle.

86
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:38,249
-Are you out of your mind?
-Lower your voice. We're at a hospital.

87
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,419
I'm okay.

88
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,254
It doesn't hurt.

89
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,590
I'm in zero pain. Isn't that good enough?

90
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,008
Let's go.

91
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,968
-You should at least get examined.
-Gosh…

92
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,720
-It's too late for that.
-Hurry.

93
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,055
It's not too late! Let's get it checked.

94
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,849
I can no longer see.

95
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,810
Su-jeong.

96
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,438
I'm already blind in one eye.

97
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,815
Myeong-yeo…

98
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,029
So what if I can't see out of one eye?

99
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,698
I still have the other one.

100
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,618
Don't follow me out. Take care of her.

101
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,329
Hey…

102
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:17,872
Hey!

103
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,167
You should at least get it checked!

104
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,303
Hello?

105
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:34,805
Yes.

106
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,309
I see.

107
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,354
One moment.

108
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,316
Hello?

109
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:49,570
Yes.

110
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,292
So the landlord said that himself?

111
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,381
Okay, I understand.

112
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,885
What is it?

113
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,138
It was the landlord's daughter.

114
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,725
She wants me to move out right now

115
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,894
if I'm not going to pay rent.

116
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,229
What?

117
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,695
You're going to go now?

118
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,071
Yes.

119
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,240
The landlords live in Suncheon.

120
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:39,245
I think it'll be best to
talk to them in person.

121
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,582
Then those people

122
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,167
let you stay here for free?

123
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,961
Yes.

124
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,672
It was a deserted house.

125
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,258
I'll be back.

126
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,032
Then I want to go too.

127
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,868
-What?
-We'll close the bookstore for a day

128
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,120
since we sold
a lot of books at the flea market.

129
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,668
Are you uncomfortable with me joining?

130
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,714
No, not at all.

131
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,216
Let's go together then.

132
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,801
Okay.

133
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,345
-It's cold, right?
-Yes.

134
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,850
Raise the temperature to 28 degrees.

135
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,063
The temperature has been adjusted.

136
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,731
It'll warm up.

137
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,793
Yes, Mother, I just got here.
I'm on the second floor.

138
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,710
Yes.

139
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:19,220
Mother, you've gotten much younger
since we last met.

140
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,805
Which was this morning.

141
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,348
You should tell me beforehand--

142
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,811
Hello.

143
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,979
-Are you Lee Jang-u?
-Yes…

144
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,356
I'm Cho Yeong-mi.

145
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,441
Hello.

146
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,758
But why did you take the train that day?

147
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,763
The day I was standing
under the maple tree.

148
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,391
I realized that means
you took the train too.

149
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,726
Right.

150
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,147
I ran away from home that day.

151
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,064
What about you?

152
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,234
I'm certain it was a weekday.

153
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,903
Why did you cut school to take the train?

154
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,527
Hello?

155
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,032
Hello?

156
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:05,576
Are you…

157
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:07,870
Jin-ho?

158
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,290
It's me.

159
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,251
Your mom.

160
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,716
Kim Jin-ho.

161
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,970
Kim Jin-ho is your name.

162
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,933
I gave you that name.

163
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,811
I guess your father didn't tell you.

164
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,022
My name is Eun-seop.

165
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,984
Im Eun-seop.

166
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,154
Listen, Jin-ho.

167
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,159
I'm very sick.

168
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,037
So…

169
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,709
I was hoping you could come and see me.

170
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,420
I really…

171
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,425
want to see you.

172
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,430
I'm in Andong.

173
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,100
Could you come?

174
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,895
HYECHEON HIGH SCHOOL

175
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,011
So, did you meet her?

176
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,179
No.

177
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,140
I didn't go that day.

178
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:52,975
Why not?

179
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,648
TRAIN TICKET

180
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:01,984
It felt like…

181
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,989
I would be betraying
my current parents if I went.

182
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,082
Also,

183
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,586
I saw you there that day.

184
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,264
What?

185
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,224
Nothing.

186
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,445
Please enjoy.

187
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,575
Usually, servers wear masks these days.

188
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,535
Day drinking?

189
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,996
Yes, I have my reasons.

190
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,586
I heard you signed a deal
with Myeong-yeo, honey.

191
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,631
Yes.

192
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:07,299
What about it?

193
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,717
Call it off.

194
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,303
I don't like it.

195
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:12,805
No, thanks.

196
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,226
Why not?

197
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,145
You used to date her.

198
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,313
For 20 years, at that.

199
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,150
What idiot doesn't know that in our field?

200
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,613
So cancel the contract now, Mr. Cha,

201
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,199
if you want to continue working with me.

202
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,870
I have to publish her book.

203
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,957
There's something I have to find out.

204
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,711
"Grandpa Hamil."

205
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,006
"Can people live without love?"

206
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,091
Then we're done.

207
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,595
Is there something you want?

208
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,640
Something I want?

209
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,933
You see,

210
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,144
I really need you as a writer.

211
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,563
So tell me.

212
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,066
What must I do for you
to publish your next book with me?

213
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,866
"Instead of answering the question,

214
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,660
Grandpa Hamil simply took a sip
of healthy peppermint tea."

215
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,380
We're here.

216
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,178
I know you're not asleep.

217
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,389
"The old man looked at me in silence."

218
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,809
Get off.

219
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,483
I don't want to.

220
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,777
"It seemed he thought I was too young

221
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,530
to know about many things in life."

222
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,616
-Hurry up.
-What?

223
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,035
Okay.

224
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,795
-I'm going.
-No, don't. Sit down.

225
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:10,089
I'll do it.

226
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,186
"Grandpa Hamil, why won't you answer me?"

227
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,762
"Sir, can someone live without love?"

228
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:10,023
So this was what you wanted?

229
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,402
Yes.

230
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,487
This is everything to me.

231
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,576
"They can."

232
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,217
MY FIRST EVERYTHING
A NOVEL BY CHA YUN-TAEK

233
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:53,358
DEDICATED TO MY LADY

234
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,743
"The old man looked down
as if he was ashamed."

235
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,710
"I suddenly burst into tears."

236
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,486
It must've been a long drive.

237
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:38,862
Come on in.

238
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,161
You two must be tired from the long drive.

239
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,963
We could've just spoken over the phone.

240
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,633
I thought it would be best
to discuss this in person.

241
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,550
So,

242
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,514
it seems like our daughter
happened to pass by the store.

243
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,768
She said your bookstore is doing well

244
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,231
and that we shouldn't have given
the house away to a stranger.

245
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:21,697
The town held an event,
which caused a lot of foot traffic.

246
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,949
She must've misunderstood.

247
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,909
If the two of you are upset,

248
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,037
I can pay rent starting this month.

249
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,706
Forget it.

250
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,003
Come with me to my library.

251
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:37,879
Pardon?

252
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,798
Quick.

253
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,435
I knew he'd do this.

254
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,063
He wants to show off.

255
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,107
Show off what?

256
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,191
His books.

257
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:03,238
When he heard the bookstore lad
would be coming in the morning,

258
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,949
he organized all his old books.

259
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,368
I see.

260
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,296
Does someone play the piano?

261
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,213
Yes.

262
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,299
I do.

263
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:23,842
Really?

264
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:27,262
I've been learning these days. It's fun.

265
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:44,071
Do you happen to know the anthology
Deer by Baek Seok?

266
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,240
Yes, sir.

267
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,327
Only a hundred copies were
originally released,

268
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,162
which made it very rare.

269
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,916
POETRY ANTHOLOGY: DEER
BY BAEK SEOK

270
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,167
This is…

271
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,712
Even the poet Yun Dong-ju
couldn't get a copy,

272
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:03,090
so he had to transcribe it by hand.

273
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,091
How did you…

274
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,718
Through the black market.

275
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,555
It might be a fake.

276
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,100
But I stared at it for a while
because I was so happy.

277
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,906
"In a room where the light was off,

278
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,367
a white garment was on a hanger."

279
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,204
"It looked cold."

280
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:38,250
"I can hear horse bells
ringing out in the open."

281
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:43,004
"When I opened the door
into the crimson night sky,

282
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,716
I smelled the scent of pine mushrooms."

283
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:51,138
Don't worry about what my daughter said.

284
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,433
But, sir…

285
00:23:55,517 --> 00:24:00,063
I'm happy that you're using
the house I abandoned as a bookstore.

286
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,399
Yes, but--

287
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,359
I showered my daughter with love.

288
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,696
But that meant nothing
when it came to money.

289
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,200
Everything in the world changes.

290
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,202
It changes and leaves.

291
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:16,580
Even your kids.

292
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,793
However, books are different.

293
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,713
It holds so much,

294
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,381
yet it doesn't change.

295
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,805
Please take good care of the bookstore.

296
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:44,900
Didn't I tell you

297
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,569
I'm fine with however you use it
as long as it's a bookstore?

298
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:50,322
You did.

299
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,412
-I had a great time.
-Okay.

300
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,915
Where are you headed now?

301
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,750
I need to get back to the office.

302
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,211
You should go eat.

303
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,046
We can meet next time.

304
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,131
Yes, I'll see you again.

305
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,049
Okay.

306
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,552
-Goodbye, then.
-Yes, goodbye.

307
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,314
Hello there, friend.

308
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,733
A friend who is older than me.

309
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,362
What are you doing right now?

310
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,405
What? What do you mean?

311
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,073
I knew you'd play dumb.

312
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,117
Playing dumb about what?

313
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,079
Will you still play dumb even with this?

314
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,123
Explain yourself, friend.

315
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,542
My friend, who is much older than me.

316
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,876
I'll explain, Hwi.

317
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,796
I was just saying hi.

318
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,339
-I see. Is that so?
-Yes.

319
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,758
I ran into a long-lost friend.

320
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,471
I guess you greet
your long-lost friends very politely

321
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,432
with an awkward smile and a handshake?

322
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,560
I didn't know that about you, Jang-u.

323
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,313
Delete the picture now.

324
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,568
You…

325
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:54,487
Who taught you this despicable act?

326
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,656
You're nothing like your brother.

327
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,659
You're a good judge of character.
Eun-seop doesn't even compare.

328
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,249
Listen, friend.

329
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,961
I pay Kwon Hyeon-ji 10,000 won for
every piece of information she gives me.

330
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,506
Seriously?

331
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,391
My gosh, Mr. Jang-u.
I meant 10,000 won was enough.

332
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,309
No! Thank you!

333
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,771
I'll call you Mr. Jang-u
to express my gratitude.

334
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,564
That's weird. Just call me Jang-u.

335
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,234
-I'm sending it now.
-Don't send it!

336
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,613
I'd be grateful if you just deleted it.
Thank you.

337
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,531
Deleting.

338
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,325
Hey, you…

339
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:41,951
Why aren't you at school?

340
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,995
It's lunchtime, so I came out for a bit.

341
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,789
You should be at the cafeteria then.

342
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:49,918
You were smiling like this instead of
eating at your workplace too.

343
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,503
That's because I--

344
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,754
It's the same thing, friend.

345
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,173
My friend, who is much older than me.

346
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,302
I'm busy, so I'll get going now, friend.

347
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,304
-Bye.
-Just hurry up and leave. Go.

348
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:12,232
Didn't I just tell you to go, friend?

349
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,735
I meant that you can go
after you drop me off at school.

350
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,322
I'm in a rush, Mr. Jang-u.
We need to hurry.

351
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,824
My lunchtime is almost over.

352
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,450
It might already be over.

353
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,160
Do you want me to get penalized?

354
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,539
I've already gotten penalized
because of Eun-seop recently.

355
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,873
-Jeez.
-Let's go.

356
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,128
I don't have much time either.

357
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,754
Let's go, friend.

358
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,673
Why are you so heavy, Hwi?

359
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,633
Pedal harder, my friend.

360
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,636
What can you do with those weak legs?

361
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,645
You know that day.

362
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,606
The day…

363
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,818
that I took the Mugunghwa train.

364
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,872
I really wanted to die that day.

365
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,045
That's all I could think about back then.

366
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,475
A MURDERER'S DAUGHTER SITS HERE

367
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,145
Waking up and going to school
felt like hell back then.

368
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:36,274
I debated about how I should die.

369
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,032
I decided to go to a station with a river

370
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,910
and kill myself there.

371
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:18,191
But I felt like I wouldn't die
if I simply jumped in.

372
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,277
So I thought to myself,

373
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,823
"Maybe I should at least
put some rocks in my pocket."

374
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,244
But I was starving.

375
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,918
I figured I'll die after having a meal.

376
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,692
But once I finished eating,

377
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,611
I was sleepy.

378
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,049
So I decided to take a quick nap.

379
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,950
Half the day had passed.

380
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,910
Then a thought came to my mind.

381
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:36,871
"You know what?"

382
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,707
"I won't be able to die at this rate."

383
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:44,921
"No."

384
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,423
"I have to die."

385
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,931
"I have to die…

386
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,227
and make everyone who bullied me
regret what they did."

387
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,763
Hey, Mok Hae-won!

388
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,182
Mok Hae-won!

389
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,268
Mok Hae-won!

390
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,104
Mok Hae-won!

391
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,066
Mok Hae-won!

392
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,652
That hurts.

393
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,779
Hey, Mok Hae-won!

394
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,864
You little brat.

395
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,323
Hey, Mok Hae-won!

396
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,742
How…

397
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,537
Mok Hae-won!

398
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,663
It still baffles me.

399
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,834
I wonder how my aunt knew I was there.

400
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,839
Is that why you decided not to die?

401
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,424
Yes.

402
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,849
If you want to die…

403
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,188
I'll gladly die with you.

404
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,485
What are you saying?

405
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,240
Let's just die together. It's not hard.

406
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:37,450
Stop it!

407
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,496
Why? Are you scared?

408
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:55,635
My desire to die vanished completely.

409
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,017
It felt like my aunt
would nag me even when I'm dying.

410
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,441
I'm glad you lived.

411
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:20,118
Thank you for not dying, Hae-won.

412
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,211
Tell me.

413
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,800
Tell me, Eun-seop.

414
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,427
Tell you what?

415
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:40,930
Is what we have…

416
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,771
love?

417
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,322
Please answer me.

418
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,492
Is it love?

419
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,289
Yes.

420
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,167
It's love.

421
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:16,132
Me too.

422
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:44,202
WALNUT HOUSE

423
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:56,714
Gosh, you scared me.

424
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,425
What?

425
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,179
Hey, how far are you
on writing your novel?

426
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,057
What's the meaning of this?

427
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,725
How far have you written?

428
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,018
Excuse me.

429
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,478
Listen, sir.

430
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,563
It hasn't even been four days.

431
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,564
Hey.

432
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,524
What crazy editor of a publishing company

433
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,485
rushes over to the home
of a newly-signed writer

434
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,403
to pressure them about
how much they've written?

435
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,488
Are you mad?

436
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,949
You must've written the opening line.

437
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,784
The opening line?

438
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,285
You wrote it, right?

439
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,203
The opening line?

440
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,330
Yes, I wrote it.

441
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,916
Don't tell me you came here
to ask me that.

442
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,377
Of course, I came here to ask you that.

443
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,463
You have a lot of time
on your hands, crybaby.

444
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,258
The editors do all the work.
All I have to do is approve.

445
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,134
What work would I have, right?

446
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,929
Really? It works out

447
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,347
then. What does?

448
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,349
You know Sun-yeong, right?

449
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,768
Yes. Choi Sun-yeong?

450
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,770
Yes, she's dying soon.

451
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,438
What?

452
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,940
She has terminal breast cancer.

453
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:57,858
It's spread too far.
Chemo isn't an option.

454
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,568
She doesn't even have a month left.

455
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,072
You're talking as if
this doesn't concern you.

456
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,073
It doesn't.

457
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,491
She was in Seoul

458
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,994
but wanted to die in her hometown,
so she's at the city hospital.

459
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,996
I need to go there now.

460
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,539
Take me to the hospital.

461
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,999
Come on. Unlock the car door.

462
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:15,835
Hey.

463
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,671
I'm tired from driving all the way here.

464
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:19,880
Can't you drive instead?

465
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,841
No, I can't. I don't drive.

466
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,468
Why not? You used to drive well.

467
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,137
What? Just drive.

468
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,561
Amazing. Is it like this
only when I'm not around?

469
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,271
- It was huge. Look.
- Awesome.

470
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:36,981
Hey.

471
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,858
Look at how much hair he lost.

472
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,027
I can't even recognize him.

473
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,574
-Cha Yun-taek!
-No way.

474
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,491
Hey, Sun-yeong.

475
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,410
She likes peaches.

476
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:50,995
Really?

477
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,914
What?

478
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:54,832
-Why?
-What?

479
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,459
You two look good.

480
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,337
-What are you saying?
-That looks expensive, Yun-taek.

481
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,133
-Hey.
-What?

482
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,053
What is it?

483
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,430
I hear your family owns a bookstore.

484
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:12,183
Yes. You know,
I changed my bicycle saddle.

485
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,684
I'm super fast now.

486
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,603
It'll probably shock you.

487
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,355
Hey.

488
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,151
I want to go there.

489
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,570
-I know the location,
-Look at it.

490
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,155
-but I can't go alone.
-It's soft.

491
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,406
More so than that…

492
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,035
Did you hear what I said?

493
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,628
I want to visit your family's bookstore.

494
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,296
The truth is…

495
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,964
What? What is it this time?

496
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,760
Yeong-su likes reading books.

497
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:48,928
What?

498
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:55,893
I heard there's a book club too.

499
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,691
-What's wrong with you?
-No. Don't come.

500
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,448
Don't come. Or you'll die.

501
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,042
Actually, you can come.

502
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,254
-What?
-As long as…

503
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,465
you abide by the conditions I set.

504
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,144
You're tired, right?

505
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,937
A little.

506
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,898
You should go up and rest. I'll stay here.

507
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,736
-It's fine.
-Go on, I know you're tired from driving.

508
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:57,705
-Go!
-Okay.

509
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,211
What is it?

510
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,672
I have some stuff to do.
There are lots of books too.

511
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,633
I should organize this.

512
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,274
What is it?

513
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,276
Nothing.

514
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,030
Hey, Eun-seop.

515
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,072
Yes?

516
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,408
I want to sleep with you.

517
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,213
-What did you say?
-I want to sleep with you.

518
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,594
I see.

519
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,031
This…

520
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:23,749
Is…

521
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,418
Is this right?

522
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:28,420
Yes.

523
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,934
If this is love…

524
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,774
it would be nice if you said to me…

525
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,323
"Please don't leave."

526
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,789
"Stay by my side,

527
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,252
just like snow that never melts."

528
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,888
Hey, Cha Yun-taek.

529
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,599
-Yes?
-You've got a lot cooler.

530
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,516
Gosh.

531
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,853
Was I that uncool back then?

532
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:08,771
-Yes.
-Yes.

533
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,190
Did you really not know that, crybaby?

534
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:12,775
"Crybaby."

535
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:13,734
I got it.

536
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,987
Go on then. We won't see you out.

537
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,742
Let's meet again, Sun-yeong.

538
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,329
It was good seeing you.

539
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,587
-Hey, but…
-Yes?

540
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,923
It's been bothering me.

541
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,634
What's with the bruises on your face?

542
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,469
What?

543
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,681
Do they give shots in the face nowadays?

544
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:45,766
Why are there bruises on your face?

545
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,726
This?

546
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,020
I bumped into something.

547
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,731
Isn't that right, Su-jeong?

548
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,068
Yes, that's right.

549
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,445
You bumped into something
while in the wheelchair.

550
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,030
That's what happened.

551
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:03,075
It wasn't even that hard,
but I bruise easily these days.

552
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:06,870
It's true.

553
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,270
Choi Sun-yeong.

554
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,065
She must still get beaten up.

555
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,486
She's about to die.
She should've divorced him first thing.

556
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,737
What's stopping her?

557
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,240
I really can't understand.

558
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:47,161
Maybe it's the same for Sun-yeong too.

559
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,540
It doesn't happen all the time,

560
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,625
so she puts up with it.

561
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,543
What?

562
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,128
Honey.

563
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,463
Take a look at this.

564
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,756
What do you think?

565
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,009
What's worse, when she's not getting hit…

566
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,760
It's pretty.

567
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,345
It's pretty, right?

568
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,515
What about Hae-won?

569
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,392
She should be here soon.

570
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,187
I prepared bulgogi, Hae-won's favorite,

571
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,022
and rice balls, which you like.

572
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,652
It doesn't look like enough.

573
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,072
Maybe I should've prepared more food.

574
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,158
It's fine.

575
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:27,576
Okay.

576
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:32,247
…he's the sweetest
and warmest guy in the world.

577
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:37,628
What?

578
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,631
Why are you so angry about that?

579
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,675
-Do you not know what you said?
-I didn't say it to you!

580
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,516
"Right,

581
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,061
he just can't control
his sudden rage in the moment."

582
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:57,773
Honey, I am truly sorry.

583
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:02,528
I must've lost it.

584
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,863
Honey, just once.

585
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,782
This is really the last time.

586
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,534
I'm really sorry, Myeong-ju.

587
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,702
"He's begging forgiveness from me."

588
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,374
So she believes him
and keeps forgiving him.

589
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,085
She believes in those false hopes.

590
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,504
They don't keep their promises, though.

591
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,006
They break them and continue to hit.

592
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,758
Sudden rage?

593
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:27,094
Everyone gets angry.
They just hold it back.

594
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,555
So why would she hold back
when he refuses to?

595
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,683
Yes, you're right.

596
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,185
Even if it's once in a while,
it's still hitting.

597
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,478
But the man is still warm?

598
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:38,730
How does that make sense?

599
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:41,316
No, it doesn't.

600
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,693
How could she…

601
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,072
What's there to like about him?

602
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,162
I feel bad for him.

603
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:57,040
Is that why you married him?

604
00:47:58,458 --> 00:47:59,418
No.

605
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,131
It's because he was good to me.

606
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,800
He was the best to me.

607
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,682
But he beats you.

608
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,684
Yes.

609
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,938
But now I pity him.

610
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,818
Please come to your senses, Myeong-ju.

611
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,530
Hae-won will find out when she's older.

612
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,990
You need to hurry before that.

613
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,248
I pity him.

614
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,967
Hurry up, Aunt!

615
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,848
Hurry up, honey!

616
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,108
Idiot.

617
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,362
Let me out.

618
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,241
-Now?
-Yes.

619
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,503
Thanks.

620
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,896
I really pity him.

621
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:45,774
How can I abandon him?

622
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:51,113
He just hits me once in a while
when he gets angry.

623
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,409
I can't leave him.

624
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:57,994
If I leave him,

625
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,330
who would take him?

626
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:04,042
Good night, then.

627
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,378
-Goodbye, sir.
-Yes, have a good night.

628
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,409
-Hey, Mr. Jang-u.
-Yes?

629
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:40,120
Did you go on a blind date
during your lunch break?

630
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,251
How do you know about that?

631
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,628
Goodness, don't you know
this neighborhood?

632
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:52,841
The chief probably knows
what I had for lunch by now.

633
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:55,886
So? How was it?

634
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,305
Well, I'm not sure…

635
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,724
Did you like her? What did you think?

636
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,184
Was she okay?

637
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,645
She seemed like a nice person, but…

638
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:13,945
You must've been a little flustered
if you didn't know beforehand.

639
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:18,158
Actually, no, because this isn't
the first time.

640
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:22,662
Please eat.

641
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,707
No, thank you. I'm on a diet these days.

642
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,627
You're on a diet?

643
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,836
Yes.

644
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,965
What's your hobby
if you're a civil servant?

645
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:38,011
-Pardon?
-All my friends who are civil servants

646
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,638
have at least one hobby.

647
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,850
Having to sit
and work in an office all day

648
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,227
is pure torture.

649
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,521
What about you, Jang-u?

650
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,815
Isn't work no fun?

651
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,775
And boring too.

652
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,488
Or is it not?

653
00:51:58,782 --> 00:51:59,783
How should I say this?

654
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,203
I think I struggle to
find a woman charming

655
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,873
when I meet them in that setting.

656
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,335
That's understandable.

657
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:12,087
It's a shame though.
I heard she was pretty.

658
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,465
How on earth do you know about this stuff?
Did you take a picture?

659
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,968
We have our ways.

660
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,055
Jang-u, then what's your ideal woman like?

661
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,640
-Me?
-Yes.

662
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,475
Are you interested in anyone?

663
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,562
This looks delicious too!

664
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,230
-That's the tenderloin.
-Right.

665
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,610
I'm not sure.

666
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,114
She has to have a pretty smile

667
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,741
and a big appetite too.

668
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,952
A girl with a big appetite
who also has a pretty smile?

669
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:47,163
-Yes.
-That's too hard.

670
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:48,999
Is it?

671
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,209
-Get back to work, then.
-Okay.

672
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,335
Yes, get back to work.

673
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:54,713
What a shame.

674
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,098
You know,

675
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,312
when the sunlight hits
the surface of the lake and sparkles,

676
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,855
what do we call that phenomenon?

677
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,778
Sun glitter.

678
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,099
I want to sparkle like that too.

679
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,393
I should've died instead.

680
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:33,687
Get it together. You're the host here.

681
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,898
I basically killed her.

682
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,735
Even in death.

683
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,625
I'm sorry.

684
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,295
Who do you think you are?

685
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,674
Who do you think you are?

686
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:06,261
Why do you always do this to me?

687
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:08,763
Let go of me!

688
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,765
I said, let go!

689
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:14,686
Hey, how dare you do that to me?

690
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,814
Darn you.

691
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,367
How dare you!

692
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,916
Answer me!

693
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,543
How dare you? Let go.

694
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,795
Let go! Let go of me!

695
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,673
How dare you do that to me?

696
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,685
Hey! What gives you the right?

697
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,480
What gives you the right to hit my sister?

698
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,356
-Myeong-yeo!
-What gives you the right?

699
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,484
-You--
-What the hell do you know?

700
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,612
-No. Stop.
-You. Get over here!

701
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,030
-How dare you!
-Myeong-yeo.

702
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,866
-Myeong-yeo! Don't do it.
-How dare you!

703
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,619
-Stop it!
-What the hell?

704
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:14,954
Damn it!

705
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:18,958
Hey!

706
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,798
"My sister got hit once in a while."

707
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:30,220
"By her husband who is the sweetest
and warmest in the world."

708
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,847
Divorce him.

709
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,351
Just get a divorce!

710
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,561
Divorce him!

711
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,315
What are you lacking
to have to live with a loser like him?

712
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,567
Myeong-ju.

713
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,737
-Divorce him. You don't deserve--
-Myeong-yeo!

714
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,280
No, stop!

715
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,698
-Stop it!
-Let go!

716
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,951
Who are you to tell her to get a divorce?

717
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:55,328
Who are you to tell her what to do?

718
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,353
Myeong-yeo.

719
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,981
Let's go. Let's get out.

720
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,661
Stop right there, damn it!

721
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,468
Hey! Get out!

722
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,427
Get out!

723
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,195
This is where my story starts.

724
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,998
This is the opening line of my novel.

725
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,482
You know, Eun-seop…

726
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,366
Nothing.

727
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,868
What were you going to say?

728
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,914
Nothing. I'll tell you next time.

BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

738
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,735
POSTED BY SEOP

739
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:16,696
I was the son of a vagrant
who lived in the mountains,

740
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,364
and one day, I was abandoned.

741
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:23,578
My adoptive parents raised me.

742
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:28,333
Though I did not view it as a weakness,

743
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,212
there were some people
who wished that this would hurt me.

744
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,673
"Aren't you unhappy?"

745
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:38,593
"Didn't you use to live in a cabin
in the back mountains?"

746
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:43,431
"Wasn't your father a vagrant?"

747
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:48,311
Should I be as unhappy and sad
as they wished I were?

748
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:53,399
I thought long and hard about it, but no.

749
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:56,319
I concluded that I have
no reason to be unhappy

750
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:58,529
when I have people
I'm grateful for in my life.

751
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:05,411
Anyway, it's all in the past now.

752
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,627
I'm sleepy.
But I want to keep looking at you.

753
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,586
Is this Eun-sil?

754
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,673
Actually, I have something I want to ask.
Is that okay?

755
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:20,301
This is a new member of the book club.
Round of applause!

756
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:21,844
What is this? Explain.

757
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,180
I'm talking about
the fax you sent yesterday.

758
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,973
Did you come to return that?

759
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,141
This was an excuse.

760
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,643
The truth is, I liked you.

761
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,729
I liked you first for a very long time.

762
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,106
What am I going to do?

763
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:36,776
I don't think I'll ever forget
the way you look right now.

764
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:43,825
