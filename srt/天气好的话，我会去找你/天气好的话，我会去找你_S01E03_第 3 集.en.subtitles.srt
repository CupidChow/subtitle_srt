1
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,000
She has returned.

2
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,377
I didn't know you owned a bookstore.

3
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,671
I didn't know this was
a real bookstore either.

4
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,465
How long will you be staying this time?

5
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,425
I'm thinking of staying until spring.

6
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,844
Do you plan to just keep bumming around?

7
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,221
No, I plan to stay here
for a while and work part-time.

8
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,514
There's not much to do.

9
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,141
I rarely get customers.

10
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,893
He has a girlfriend now.

11
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,269
Her name is Irene.

12
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,854
Is it this lady, perhaps?

13
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,066
Did you or did you not like someone here?

14
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,359
I liked Mok Hae-won.

15
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,653
I hope you're not upset…

16
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,114
about what I said to the group.

17
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,575
I should have just said a random name.

18
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,368
I regretted it on my way home.

19
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,287
Mok Hae-won.

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,414
I mentioned Bo-yeong the other day, right?

21
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,208
She said you two have a misunderstanding.

22
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,752
I'm not sure
what the misunderstanding was.

23
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,670
All I know is that she was in the wrong,

24
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,340
and she didn't apologize in any way.

25
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,175
Where are you going so early?

26
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:33,676
To my part-time job.

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,804
I'm so glad you're here.

28

GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

29
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,217
-Hi.
-You're here early.

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,219
Yes, I woke up early.

31
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,431
Do you want some coffee?

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,101
Sure.

33
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,520
-Here.
-Thanks.

34
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,082
By the way, you're really a lightweight.

35
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,210
Yes, you're right.

36
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,423
You fell asleep after one drink.

37
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,426
I recall things up until I fell asleep,

38
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,887
but I completely blacked out after that.

39
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,809
You were sleeping so soundly.
Didn't you say you have insomnia?

40
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,021
I do. Maybe I should drink more.

41
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,575
Right, you also said something.

42
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,076
Said what?

43
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,538
"I'm so glad you're here, Irene."

44
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,542
What?

45
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,423
You said, "I'm so glad you're here."

46
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,594
-I did?
-Yes, you did.

47
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,349
You said it quite lovingly.

48
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,478
How have you been, Hae-won?

49
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,453
It's good to see you.

50
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,382
It's me, Bo-yeong.

51
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,346
It's been so long, right?

52
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,080
Hae-won.

53
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,112
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,948
That hurt.

55
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,014
Of course, he's dead.

56
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,557
-I can't believe it.
-I'm sure.

57
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,673
I sentence the defendant Sim Myeong-ju

58
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,801
to seven years in prison.

59
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,137
Although the defendant, as a spouse,

60
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,808
has the duty to faithfully carry out
the conjugal relationship,

61
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,059
she has failed to do so,

62
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,188
and then used a car to murder the victim.

63
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,356
Taking the method of her crime

64
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,942
and her relationship with the victim
into consideration,

65
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,277
a severe penalty is inevitable.

66
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,674
I can't imagine your pain.

67
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,223
I won't tell anyone.

68
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,725
Your secret's safe.

69
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,353
Not a single soul.

70
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,398
No, not a single soul.

71
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,660
Don't cry.

72
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,330
I heard that Hae-won's mom…

73
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:37,999
is a murderer.

74
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:39,000
-What?
-What?

75
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,377
On top of that,
I heard she killed her own husband.

76
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,963
-Hae-won's dad?
-Are you serious?

77
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,007
Yes, that's why she came here.

78
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,341
Her mom went to prison.

79
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,385
-Who told you?
-Who told you?

80
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,179
Tell us.

81
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,767
Kim Bo-yeong.

82
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,728
-Kim Bo-yeong?
-Kim Bo-yeong?

83
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,566
No wonder Hae-won always has
that gloomy vibe around her.

84
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,984
No wonder.

85
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,695
But aren't Bo-yeong and Hae-won close?

86
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,031
Yes, that's exactly why we can--

87
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:12,700
What is that?

88
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,350
Hae-won!

89
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,102
Hae-won, hold on! Please hear me out.

90
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,022
You're mistaken.
It's all a misunderstanding.

91
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,690
Please, Hae-won.

92
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,067
-Hold on…
-Let go.

93
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,361
Hae-won, please.

94
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,656
I didn't mean to tell anyone.

95
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,366
Ju-hui told everyone…

96
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,492
I mean, our classmates…

97
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,202
I didn't mean to.

98
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,914
-I said, let go.
-Hae-won, just a minute.

99
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,457
Hae-won, please--

100
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,667
Let go!

101
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,170
Hae-won!

102
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,588
Hae-won…

103
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,522
I heard that she beat Bo-yeong up.

104
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,608
Unsurprising behavior
of the daughter of a murderer.

105
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:28,943
Right?

106
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,069
Her mom's a murderer?

107
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,488
She's so scary.

108
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,906
How can she stomach her food?

109
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,744
Don't hit me.

110
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,788
It was an accident.

111
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,708
You need to hit him intentionally
for you to get charged with manslaughter.

112
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,501
No. Then I'll have to go to prison
like Mok Hae-won's mom.

113
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,836
You're so right.

114
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,051
I don't like the look in Hae-won's eyes.

115
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,429
Isn't it creepy?

116
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,346
Goodness.

117
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,932
Hey, your eyebrows are uneven!

118
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,477
Right? I told you countless times.

119
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,021
No way. They're the same.

120
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,897
-The bottom part.
-It's not the same.

121
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,940
-Look.
-Hey.

122
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,859
-This is the second point.
-You're crazy.

123
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,361
-Then you draw to the third point.
-This is hilarious.

124
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,364
You need to trace this line here.

125
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,618
Hey, how do you think Mok Hae-won feels?

126
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,244
Like absolute crap, of course.

127
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,290
It's disgusting the more I think about it.
Can't she just drop out?

128
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,249
Right?

129
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,335
I don't want to see her at school.

130
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,904
Hey, Hae-won!

131
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,239
Hae-won!

132
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,120
Come in.

133
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,171
You forgot your bag.

Do you really see ghosts?

in front of the house again.

-Welcome home, Dad.

Hey, soccer's on tonight, right?

145
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,301
Should we order some fried chicken?

146
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,802
No, thanks. I'll be back.

What? Where are you going?

-My book club meeting.
-All right.

00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,766
-Hey, be careful, all right?
-Okay.

150
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,059
I'll be back.

The temperature tomorrow morning

152
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,440
is expected to feel like
negative 20 degrees Celsius.

A powerful cold wave is expected.

to minus 15 degrees Celsius
in the central part…

156
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,741
Is it that difficult to eat your dinner?

157
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,036
I'm always cooking for you.

00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,874
I made you some stew.

160
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,627
Eat it if you're hungry, I guess.

and to your agricultural products.

Don't forget to take care of your health.

165
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,597
You too.

166

The two of us live together
Let's just say we will forever

167
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,247
Goodness, it's cold.

168
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,712
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

169
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,216
There once was an old couple
who lived in the mountains.

170
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,468
One day, the grandpa rescues
an injured crane.

171
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,764
A few days later, a maiden appears
and says she'll be their adopted child.

172
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,724
Then…

173
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,851
I know this.
She weaves something every night.

174
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,811
It's cloth, isn't it? Hemp cloth.

175
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,729
Correct.

176
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,440
She weaves the beautiful cloth every night

177
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,150
and she beseeches the old couple

178
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,319
to never look inside the room.

179
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,487
The Crane Maiden had swagger.

180
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,656
Swagger. And then?

181
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,869
At first, they sold the cloth
she had weaved at the market.

182
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,455
-They were a happy family of three.
-Right.

183
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,708
But curiosity got the best of the couple

184
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,627
and they secretly peeked into the room.

185
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,129
In the room, the old couple saw

186
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,090
the crane they had once saved,

187
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,761
plucking her own feathers with her beak
and weaving them into cloth.

188
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,678
And…

189
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,764
Once her secret was exposed,

190
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,974
the crane was disillusioned with humans,

191
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,061
so she immediately flew
far away into the sky.

192
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,771
The end!

193
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,693
How do you kids know this story?

194
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,403
I can barely recall it.

195
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,280
We learned it in school today.

196
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,367
My grandpa told me that story.

197
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,287
I have a question related to this story.

198
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:56,830
What is it?

199
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,918
Why is it that if you tell people
not to do something, they do it even more?

200
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,670
You're like that too.

201
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,338
What? Me?

202
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,757
-Just today, with Kim Yeong-su--
-I have no idea.

203
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,300
-Yeong-su?
-What did you say?

204
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,136
-Who's that?
-Seriously, why do people do that?

205
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:15,307
I'm curious too.
All they had to do was not look.

206
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,226
They just needed to follow instructions.

207
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,813
-Right?
-Rules are always difficult to abide by.

208
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,606
True.

209
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,609
I wonder if there's another
injured crane around here.

210
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,280
All right, is it my turn?

211
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,407
-Yes, it is.
-Yes.

212
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,326
It's the folktale of
Yeoni and the Willow Bachelor.

213
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,371
On a cold winter night, much like today,

214
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:42,334
Yeoni's stepmother kicked her out
and had her search for herbs.

215
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,171
But no matter how much
she searched the fields,

216
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,842
it was impossible to find herbs
in the winter.

217
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,679
I think I know this story.

218
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,140
Then please take over, Geun-sang.

219
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,057
Me?

220
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,103
Then she runs into the Willow Bachelor.

221
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,149
He went into his cave
and brought out herbs for her.

222
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,110
This sounds like the start of a rom-com.

223
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,696
So? Do they end up together?

224
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,740
The Willow Bachelor dies.

225
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,241
What? Why?

226
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,286
The stepmother was jealous,

227
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,997
so she went to his cave and killed him.

228
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:21,707
It's a horror story.

229
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,542
That's the end?

230
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,712
What kind of folktale is that?

231
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,759
Then Yeoni finds a flower.

232
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:39,433
She makes medicine with that flower.

233
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,393
The bachelor came back to life

234
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,897
and the two lived happily ever after.

235
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,899
That's the folktale.

236
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,152
Goodness, you startled me.

237
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,196
This story had so many twists.

238
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,615
I got a bit worried
it might not be a happy ending.

239
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,786
What's your favorite folktale, Eun-seop?

240
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,662
Me?

241
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,122
We're sharing folktales today.

242
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,541
So which one do you like?

243
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,669
I…

244
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,839
I like the tale of
The Wolf's Silver Eyebrow.

245
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,384
Sounds interesting.
Tell us the story, Eun-seop.

246
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,234
See you tomorrow.

247
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,486
Okay.

248
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,704
Once upon a time, there was a boy.

249
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:30,210
He was often hurt by others.

250
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,604
People took advantage of his innocence

251
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,982
by constantly deceiving and betraying him.

252
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,635
Then one day,

253
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,679
the boy met a wolf in the mountains.

254
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,104
The wolf plucked
one of his eyebrows and said,

255
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,028
"Would you like to see people
through this silver eyebrow?"

256
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,203
"It will allow you to see people
for who they really are."

257
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,958
A cunning monkey,

258
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:52,918
a sly fox,

259
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,128
a mean pig,

260
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,714
and a wicked raccoon.

261
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,136
There were no real humans
in the world that the boy saw.

262
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,014
So the boy

263
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,601
decided to leave to look
for a place with real humans.

264
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,771
Did such a place exist?

265
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:15,941
No.

266
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,403
It didn't exist?

267
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,740
No, it didn't. Not anywhere.

268
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,462
Hey, Hae-won!

269
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,099
The water pipes froze. Turn the faucet on.

270
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,354
Is it working?

271
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,482
-No.
-Darn, this won't do.

272
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,526
Is there anything stronger?

273
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,779
I heard the best way to
defrost a water pipe is

274
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,614
to cover it up with a warm, wet towel.

275
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,868
And how will we wet a towel with no water?

276
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,582
Just call a plumber. I can't fix it.

277
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,794
It's two in the morning. Who would come?

278
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,182
Did the boiler shut off?

279
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,643
It's no surprise
that this isn't working either.

280
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,272
So what do we do?

281
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,816
It's minus 17 degrees out.

282
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,651
Please work.

283
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,451
This is definitely not going to work.

284
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,119
It's totally dead.

285
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:52,996
Let's go.

286
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,215
All right.

287
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,925
Call a taxi.

288
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,845
A taxi won't let us in with Gunbam.

289
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,348
Then let's borrow a car.

290
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,642
Then what?

291
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,311
We'll go to a motel downtown.

292
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,980
You think they'll allow dogs?

293
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,024
I allowed dogs.

294
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,069
You can't compare our cottage to a motel.

295
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,405
How about…

296
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,451
we just stay at
that guest house over there?

297
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,702
That's not happening.

298
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,870
Why not?

299
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:37,124
They're the reason we closed down.
Have you no pride?

300
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,335
You're right.

301
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,798
Then reach out to anyone you know.

302
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,718
I don't have a phone.

303
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,178
How come?

304
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,596
I threw it away.

305
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,355
Here.

306
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:03,817
What?

307
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,318
There.

308
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,239
No, you call him.

309
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,658
You work part-time for him.

310
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,703
We're not that close yet.

311
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,497
Come on.

312
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,083
Don't give me that.
Aren't you two friends? You do it.

313
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,669
-Quickly.
-Call your best friend.

314
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,462
Hurry, I'm cold.

315
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:25,964
I'm cold too.

316
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,354
MYEONG-YEO

317
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,398
Do you happen to be home?

318
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,320
If you are, can you open the door?

319
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,780
-Where do you think he is?
-He's probably home.

320
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,575
-Knock on the door.
-Why me?

321
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,619
-You work for him.
-So? It's not my home.

322
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,495
My goodness.

323
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,629
You can sleep here tonight.

324
00:25:06,504 --> 00:25:08,256
Thanks. Sorry for inconveniencing you.

325
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,383
No, it's fine.
I'll just sleep at my parents'.

326
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,762
One of you can sleep in there,

327
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,263
and the other can sleep here.

328
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,474
I'll sleep inside with Gunbam.

329
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,517
Thanks, Eun-seop.

330
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,656
I'll get you some fresh blankets.

331
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,098
How's this?

332
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,101
Is that enough?

333
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,854
Yes.

334
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,411
Thank you for letting us stay here.

335
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:20,745
No worries.

336
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,665
I raised the heat,
but let me know if you're cold.

337
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,501
-I'll get going.
-Wait.

338
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,715
I wanted to ask you something.

339
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,133
Yes?

340
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:37,137
-This morning…
-She didn't say much.

341
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,180
What?

342
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,225
She left without saying much.

343
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,394
I see.

344
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:47,939
All right, then…

345
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,192
Hurry up and go to bed.

346
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,986
-You too.
-Good night.

347
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,462
A MURDERER'S DAUGHTER SITS HERE

348
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,796
Hey, that's her, right?

349
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,590
-The murderer's kid?
-Yes.

350
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,425
I'm so scared of her.

351
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,843
She disgusts me.

352
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,721
-I wish she would transfer again.
-Me too.

353
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,823
Look at her.

354
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,914
Let's go.

355
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,339
-Should've put more strawberries in there.
-We didn't use enough.

356
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,052
What the hell?

357
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,720
What's your deal?

358
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,263
You little…

359
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,433
Let go!

360
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:07,894
I said, let go!

361
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,771
You better let go!

362
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,356
Stop!

363
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,195
I'm sorry.

364
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,365
My apologies, ma'am.

365
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,868
I'm sorry.

366
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,121
I failed to discipline my granddaughter

367
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,581
because I'm old and weak.

368
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,918
I'm sorry.
Please forgive her just this once.

369
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:35,547
Look here, this is unforgivable!

370
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,882
She hit my daughter's face with a shoe!

371
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,968
What did you do to raise her this way?

372
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,720
How could she beat her up like this?

373
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,974
Hae-won. Hurry up and beg for forgiveness.

374
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,017
Tell them that you were wrong.

375
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,187
-Her mom is a murderer.
-She's obviously messed up.

376
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:58,653
Where is she…

377
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,030
Hae-won.

378
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,324
You see, Grandma?

379
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,996
They said the same thing.

380
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,290
They called Mom a murderer

381
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,334
and spread baseless rumors.

382
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,503
They said I needed to be punished.

383
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,256
So they vandalized my desk,

384
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:21,134
put leftover fruit in my sneakers,

385
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,387
hid and threw away my gym clothes…

386
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,305
Hae-won.

387
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,188
Neither the prosecutor
nor the judge blamed me.

388
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,275
Not even my dad who died blamed me!

389
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:41,279
So who are they to do that?
What gives them the right…

390
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,324
to condemn me…

391
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,327
and point fingers at me?

392
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,750
Isn't it so strange, Grandma?

393
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,149
I read that I can use a torch
to defrost the water pipes.

394
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,318
I saw it online.

395
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,531
But instead of it melting,
it caught on fire.

396
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,118
-So…
-The tragedy didn't end there.

397
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,623
All the water pipes at home
started exploding.

398
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,421
Is this funny to you?

399
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,548
The cold weather isn't all to blame.

400
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,593
Seeing how bad the leakage is,

401
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,970
I doubt it was just due to the cold.

402
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,098
It's probably because it's old, like me.

403
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,184
Hae-won,

404
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,186
everything burst.

405
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,940
I suggest you remove whatever's valuable.

406
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,817
Did you get your valuables out?

407
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,611
I own nothing of value.

408
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,280
So I'm escaping from here, just like this.

409
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,449
-Escape?
-Yes, escape.

410
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,118
I'll be going to
the Holy Land of Su-jeong.

411
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,578
Where's the Holy Land of--

412
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,165
WALNUT HOUSE

413
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,250
Hi, Hae-won.

414
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,462
Get in, Myeong-yeo.

415
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,173
You're going to Aunt Su-jeong's?

416
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,509
Yes, it's very warm there.

417
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,052
She never turns off the heat.

418
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,887
Then what about me?

419
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,682
That's for you to figure out.

420
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,141
You're old enough.

421
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,226
What?

422
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,814
I'm leaving, my beloved niece.

423
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,024
Aunt!

424
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,943
You know what?

425
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,405
I just wanted to die
because of my splitting headache.

426
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,825
I can't believe this happened.

427
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,328
It worked out for the best!

428
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,914
Now that everything is in the gutter,

429
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,125
I'll just be homeless forever.

430
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,586
-Your head hurts?
-Yes.

431
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,964
The pain is driving me insane.

432
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,716
But you said it didn't hurt!

433
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,509
I was lying!

434
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:33,928
Bye, my niece.

435
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,014
Let's go.

436
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,349
Aunt!

437
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,769
-Bye, Hae-won.
-Bye.

438
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,188
Aunt!

439
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,232
Aunt!

440
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,276
You're really leaving?

441
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,862
Sim Myeong-yeo!

442
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,364
Are you kidding me?

443
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,329
Yes, all the water pipes burst.

444
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,665
Yes.

445
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,251
A week later?

446
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,130
Won't the house be
completely frozen by then?

447
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,592
Yes, I understand.

448
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,221
What did they say?

449
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,516
Apparently, the whole city
is going through it.

450
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:30,026
Hi, I'm calling from
the Walnut House in Bukhyun-ri.

451
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,779
So you've heard.

452
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,906
Are you available to come by?

453
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,578
I see. Goodbye.

454
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,430
-Goodness.
-Hi, there.

455
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,808
It's completely frozen.

456
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:03,601
Gosh.

457
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,977
You should look inside, sir.

458
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,813
Water was spurting out everywhere,

459
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,940
but it's frozen solid
because it's so cold.

460
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,942
Is it salvageable?

461
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,777
I'm sure it's possible

462
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,571
once the repairmen come
and work their magic.

463
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,116
Jeez, that's going to hurt her pocket.

464
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:20,993
Say cheese!

465
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,163
-Okay.
-Goodness, stop running around.

466
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,623
Let her be.

467
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,003
They're not available, right?

468
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,591
The earliest one available
is five days later.

469
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,136
Will the house survive until then?

470
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,849
-As long as it doesn't get worse--
-Hey, Eun-seop!

471
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,267
This is unbelievable.

472
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,895
The head of the village went in just now
and hammered a pipe to fix it.

473
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,022
Now there's water spurting out
from there too.

474
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:53,693
-What?
-You should go and take pictures.

475
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,610
Hurry up.

476
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,320
Do you have an Elsa costume?

477
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,698
A picture dressed up as Elsa
would've been perfect.

478
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,338
No, I don't think that's right, Eun-seop.

479
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,048
My father was fine with it too.

480
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,509
You should stay here.
I'll go stay with my parents.

481
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,720
Do you know what Hwi said?

482
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:24,557
She said because you stayed over,
she had to sleep with her parents.

483
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,975
-She told me--
-Hey, Eun-seop!

484
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,768
You better not come. Don't test me!

485
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,944
Then I'll use the first floor.

486
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,529
It's warm and comfortable here.

487
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:42,241
I'll just find another place to stay.
There's a motel downtown.

488
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,702
That's a long commute.

489
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:45,953
I'll take the bus.

490
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,331
It takes two hours there and back.

491
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,127
Then I'll stay at a guest house…

492
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:56,881
Scratch that.

493
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,716
I'll just go back to Seoul.

494
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:00,968
What?

495
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,762
I have a place in Seoul.

496
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,931
I was planning to go back
around spring anyway.

497
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,643
My aunt keeps pressuring me to work too.

498
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,144
It's for the best.

499
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,729
The house is ruined,

500
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,898
and my aunt gets headaches.

501
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,525
This is all probably a sign
for me to return to Seoul.

502
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,402
-Once I get back…
-Calm down, Hae-won.

503
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,113
This is nothing.

504
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,284
-What?
-I mean, it's not a big deal.

505
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,953
How is this not a big deal?

506
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,996
Just stay here for five days.

507
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,998
Then we can call a repairman.

508
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,542
With a little fixing up,
it will be as good as before.

509
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,546
That's true, but…

510
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,260
I told you, it's warm here.

511
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,806
I sometimes even fall asleep
while organizing books.

512
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,898
Then I'll stay on the first floor.

513
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:56,941
No, it's cold here.

514
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,776
You just said it was warm.

515
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,197
It is, but the sofa is uncomfortable.

516
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:08,452
-You just said it was comfortable.
-It's comfortable for me, not for you.

517
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,831
You're saying it's cold
and uncomfortable for you too.

518
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,374
Forget it. I'll go back to Seoul--

519
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,792
Then I'll sleep upstairs too.

520
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,210
What?

521
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,337
There are two rooms.

522
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,218
What do you say?

523
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,268
So?

524
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,859
Okay, let me stay for just five days then.

525
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,736
Okay.

526
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:47,950
What a long day.

527
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,578
I can't agree more.

528
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,460
-Shall I put this here?
-That goes over there.

529
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,131
He better not come home.

530
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,109
Has your aunt seen a doctor?

531
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,152
She had an excruciating headache.

532
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,779
I heard you have headaches.

533
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,782
I just wanted to die
because of my splitting headache.

534
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,660
-Your head hurts?
-Yes.

535
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,620
The pain is driving me insane.

536
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,913
But you said it didn't hurt!

537
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,832
I was lying!

538
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,629
What are we looking for?

539
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,341
A medicine packet or a prescription.

540
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,260
What for?

541
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,430
My aunt said she has a splitting headache.

542
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,559
What if she has a terminal illness?

543
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,772
Who knows? Maybe she even wrote a will.

544
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,823
You didn't have to come though.

545
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,783
It's dark.

546
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:02,019
RECIPIENT: SIM MYEONG-YEO

547
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,438
SENDER: SIM MYEONG-JU

548
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,195
Who is that?

549
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,198
My mom.

550
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:16,825
Let's go.

551
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,356
Here.

552
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,629
Some people never share their worries.

553
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,301
Not even to family?

554
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,221
No.

555
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,310
They can't say they're struggling

556
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,021
or that they're in pain.

557
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:30,816
They keep it to themselves.

558
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,194
Maybe even…

559
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,448
until they die.

560
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,499
They build a cabin in their hearts

561
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,003
and never step foot outside of it.

562
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,257
They don't ever voice their loneliness.

563
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,637
In fact, they prefer the loneliness.

564
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,932
They prefer it over their families.

565
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,441
Maybe Myeong-yeo is one of those people.

566
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,879
DOWNTOWN HYECHEON BUS STOP

567
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,094
Wasn't the lesson
on the Pythagorean theorem difficult?

568
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,606
What are you doing? Why are you downtown?

569
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:53,732
Be quiet.

570
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,777
It's time for delusions,
fantasizing, and daydreaming.

571
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,530
That's some stalker swagger.

572
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,533
No, don't laugh.

573
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,411
Think! I want you to be in anguish.

574
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,081
Yes, exactly. That's the look I like.

575
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,418
Just go and talk to him.

576
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,795
I did, but he turned me down.

577
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:21,218
That's why I need to regroup.

578
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,095
"One must know their opponent to win."

579
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,180
I have zero information on him.

580
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:28,016
I need information to talk to him.

581
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,228
I told you that he wants to go
to Seoul National University.

582
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,479
That reminds me.

583
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,107
I want a refund for that info.

584
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,401
I thought about it
and it's totally useless.

585
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,903
He's the top student.
Of course he wants to go there.

586
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,989
It's the best university in Korea.

587
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,198
That's a no-brainer.

588
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,201
I want new information.

589
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,913
Can you turn around, please?

590
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,207
Like this. I want to see you.

591
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,460
Try walking this way.

592
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,840
Oh, my goodness. He's moving! No way.

593
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,222
Why is he waving to me?

594
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,724
Hey, hurry up.

595
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:09,766
Why is he approaching?

596
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,893
-I like this distance.
-Hurry.

597
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,311
Oh, my goodness. I'm leaving!

598
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,814
Hey! We have to take that…

599
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,358
Wait for me!

600
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,695
Goodness, that's heavy. Hey!

601
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:32,623
Do you want to go to Aunt Su-jeong's
since we're going downtown?

602
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,041
You can see Myeong-yeo too.

603
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,461
No, I don't want to go.

604
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,049
I actually have to
attend a meeting in that area.

605
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:43,592
Go ahead.

606
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,429
It's a meeting with other
bookstore owners.

607
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:48,847
It'll take around two hours.

608
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,474
-Really?
-Yes.

609
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,644
Then I'll wait at a café nearby.

610
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,521
All right.

611
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,984
-Eun-seop.
-Yes?

612
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,571
There's something
I've been meaning to ask.

613
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:07,616
Why do you call my aunt by her first name

614
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,576
but call Aunt Su-jeong "Aunt"?

615
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:14,915
They're the same age.

616
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,293
Oh, that…

617
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,588
Myeong-yeo told me…

618
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,049
to call her by her first name.

619
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:24,967
I see.

620
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:28,887
I apologize on her behalf.

621
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,102
-Take this. I'll call you when I'm done.
-Okay.

622
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,440
-Can you not tell Myeong-yeo--
-It's a secret.

623
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:42,568
I'm sorry.

624
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,695
No. I like it.

625
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,530
Liar.

626
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,348
Hey, Eun-seop.

627
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,685
Eun-seop's in a meeting.

628
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:19,313
If you give me your name,
I'll tell him to call you back.

629
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:22,608
Hello?

630
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,444
You're Hae-won, right?

631
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,865
I'm glad it's you.

632
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,992
I was calling Eun-seop
to get a hold of you.

633
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,586
I think…

634
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:46,173
we never resolved our misunderstanding.

635
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:53,055
When are you free?

636
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,390
I'd like to grab coffee with you.

637
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,611
I think…

638
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:13,325
it's too cold out these days, Bo-yeong.

639
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,209
Next time.

640
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,256
Let's meet when the weather is nice.

641
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,011
You want to meet when the weather is nice?

642
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,305
Yes.

643
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:41,395
I'll meet you…

644
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:44,815
when the weather is nice.

645
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,800
The heavy snowfall during the cold wave

646
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,386
disrupted flight and train schedules,

647
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,848
and hundreds of schools
across the country were ordered to close.

648
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,892
It's expected to get colder from now.

649
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:24,813
In the Yeongseo region,
the temperature will drop below minus 20.

650
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:27,899
The powerful cold wave is
expected to continue for a while.

651
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,777
We suggest you refrain from
going out as much as possible.

652
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:34,531
The Ministry of Health and Welfare says
if one's skin is exposed to this cold,

653
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,992
it can lead to frostbite
in a matter of minutes.

654
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:40,245
They urge everyone
to take extra care of their health.

655
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,414
The Yeongseo region of Gangwon Province

656
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,542
is expected to receive a maximum of
15cm of snow this weekend.

657
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,378
Im Eun-seop.

658
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:49,963
Eun-seop!

659
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,174
Eun-seop.

660
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,636
-Hae-won.
-You scared me.

661
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,722
I have a crush on a guy
named Kim Yeong-su.

662
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,225
But shockingly, he doesn't like me.

663
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,978
Isn't that messed up?
There's nothing wrong with me, right?

664
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:08,398
-Right.
-Also, I'm the SO at my school.

665
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,275
Take a seat here.

666
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,987
What does SO stand for?

667
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:14,988
School Outcast.

668
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,742
None of the kids at school like me.

669
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,579
All the more reason why
at least he should like me!

670
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,831
Is that how it works?

671
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,625
Yes, of course, Hae-won.

672
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,170
Why doesn't he like you?

673
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,838
Who knows.

674
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,591
I don't even know why I'm the SO.

675
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,511
How would I know why he doesn't like me?

676
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,432
What should I do, Hae-won?

677
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,812
By the way, Hwi.
Did Eun-seop go to your house?

678
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,564
Eun-seop? I don't know, he wasn't there.

679
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,984
Try calling him.

680
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,659
I wonder where he went.

681
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,747
Why are you looking for him though?
Does he owe you money?

682
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,043
He's not one to take off without a word,
but he suddenly disappeared.

683
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:11,628
Come on, don't worry.

684
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:16,007
The only places he'd be are here,
home, the ice rink, or the mountain.

685
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,551
Just those four.

686
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,261
-The mountain?
-Yes.

687
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,179
If he's not at the other places,
he's probably there.

688
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,514
Why would he go there?

689
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,391
He sometimes goes there like a lunatic.

690
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,561
-Which mountain?
-The one back there.

691
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:30,105
-The one back there?
-Yes, that one.

692
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,108
Is that so?

693
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,527
Wait, Hae-won.

694
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,780
-You're going there?
-Yes, why?

695
00:52:39,364 --> 00:52:42,284
You must have no fear.
You shouldn't go there at night.

696
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,744
But Eun-seop did.

697
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,830
That's because he's a wild beast.

698
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,916
They say if humans like us
go to the mountain at night, we'll die.

699
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:54,940
Once upon a time, there was a boy.

700
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,279
He was often hurt by others.

701
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:08,995
People took advantage of his innocence

702
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,290
by constantly deceiving and betraying him.

703
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:16,962
So the boy

704
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,924
decided to leave to look
for a place with real humans.

705
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:23,969
Did such a place exist?

706
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:26,721
No.

707
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,519
He couldn't find real humans anywhere.

708
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,773
So the boy ended up

709
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:41,486
living a lonely life until he died.

710
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:06,261
I took about 500 steps from the entrance.

711
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,013
So I should turn around…

712
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:05,487
Hae-won,

713
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,530
what are you doing here?

714
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,245
I feel so bad for him.

715
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,165
Why?

716
00:56:22,003 --> 00:56:24,714
The boy with the wolf's silver eyebrow.

717
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,679
He must've been lonely.

718
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,433
So terribly lonely.

719
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:41,231
How cold must he have been?

720
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,779
What could we do for that boy?

721
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,244
We have to give him a hug.

722
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:58,289
A really big one.

723
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,170
We have to squeeze him
with all our might so he can warm up.

724
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,924
We have to hug him tight.

725
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:55,346
BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

726
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,473
POSTED BY SEOP

727
00:57:57,182 --> 00:58:02,103
She is asleep under the same roof as me.

728
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:07,025
She came into my room earlier
and said my old lamp was beautiful.

729
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:10,236
I felt so happy that all of a sudden,

730
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,655
I wanted to kneel, take her hand,

731
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:17,368
and passionately confess my love for her…

732
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:22,624
But I simply thanked her,
for fear that I may startle her.

733
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:29,255
Unbelievable things
are bound to happen, everyone.

734
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,178
What is it?

735
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:37,805
They're shoes.
I don't want you to wear those.

736
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:38,723
Mok Hae-won.

737
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,184
"There was a misunderstanding."
Explain the next part.

738
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,894
What was it that I misunderstood?

739
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,729
It's complete chaos right now.

740
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:48,024
Someone went missing in the mountains,
so the town is going crazy.

741
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:51,027
Why does everyone assume it's okay
to ask Eun-seop to do this?

742
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,362
Don't go up the mountain.

743
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,155
Nor to that house. Ever again.

744
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,533
How can you roam around there so freely?

745
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,661
Because I'm familiar with it. That's why.

746
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:05,833
