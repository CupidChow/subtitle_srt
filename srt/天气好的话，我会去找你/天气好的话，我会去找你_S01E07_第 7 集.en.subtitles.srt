1
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,555
There's a warm person.

2
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,852
When I'm with him,

3
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,481
he warms me up like a kettle on a stove.

4
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,779
The lights-out ceremony
with the City of Hyecheon will begin soon.

5
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:14,949
Please gather in the schoolyard
to watch the lights-out ceremony.

6
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,745
And as I mentioned earlier,
if you make a wish during the ceremony…

7
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,456
Who knows?

8
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:23,666
Your wish might come true
after the lights turn back on.

9
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,765
Hae-won!

10
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,284
The event will start in ten seconds.
Let's start the countdown.

11
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,536
Ten,

12
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:02,872
nine,

13
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,209
eight,

14
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,754
seven,

15
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,341
six,

16
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:16,928
five,

17
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:20,014
four,

18
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:23,768
three,

19
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:26,896
two,

20
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,733
-Is something…
-one.

21
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,651
wrong?

22
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,403
Lights out.

23
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:48,960
I like you.

24
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,176
I like you, Eun-seop.

25
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,279
All right, did everyone make a wish?

26
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,948
We'll turn the lights back on.

27
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:21,910
Lights on.

28
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,653
I said I like you, Eun-seop.

29
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,159
Eun-seop.

30
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,247
Okay.

31
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,457
What?

32
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,420
Hey, Eun-seop!

33
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,464
Mr. Park is here. Why aren't you at…

34
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,715
Oh, hey, Hae-won.

35
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,677
What are you two doing here?
I said to come to the field!

36
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,845
-Let's talk there.
-Why? I need to go this way.

37
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,931
-Okay, we'll talk there.
-Where are we going?

38
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:26,766
What's wrong?

39
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,520
Hae-won.

40
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,315
Did you just confess your feelings
to Eun-seop and get turned down?

41
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,484
No, that's…

42
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,027
Why on earth would you like him?

43
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,571
I can't believe it!

44
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,296
It's crazy it started raining
right when it ended.

45
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,422
Right?

46
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,175
Wasn't Lee Ho-jun hilarious earlier?

47
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,177
"Hi. Hey, guys."

48
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,889
How is it that
they all haven't changed one bit?

49
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,683
When was the last time you visited?

50
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:09,851
Me?

51
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,020
I didn't come last year,
so maybe two years?

52
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,481
Hae-won. You come every year
during the holidays, right?

53
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,651
-Hae-won!
-What?

54
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:20,945
Yes.

55
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,363
What? No, you don't.

56
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,489
From what I've heard,

57
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,242
Hae-won didn't visit
for about three to four years.

58
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,660
Well…

59
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,331
I came when my grandma passed away,

60
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,499
for Chuseok, and now this trip…

61
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,919
Right, Hae-won. How was Yeong-woo?

62
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,671
-What?
-Right!

63
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,257
You were privately talking
to Yeong-woo earlier.

64
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,300
He said…

65
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,928
-What did he say?
-What did he say again?

66
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,556
-What?
-What's going on?

67
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,766
-What did he say?
-What's this?

68
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,559
Why won't you tell us?

69
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,098
I like you.

70
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,974
Okay.

71
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,434
I like you.

72
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,520
Okay.

73
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,188
I like you.

74
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,774
Okay.

75
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,687
Hae-won. It's me, Hwi.

76
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,897
Are you free today?

77
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,109
Hey, Mok Hae-won!

78
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,988
Mok Hae-won!
Go and sweep the yard if you're up!

79
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,700
There's a bunch of stuff
that needs to be swept up.

80
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,036
Consider it as exercise.
Isn't it nice when I give you work…

81
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,296
Have a drink, Hae-won.

82
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,850
You should consider yourself very lucky,
Hae-won.

83
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:58,603
I am?

84
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,566
I caught you red-handed
being rejected by Im Eun-seop.

85
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:06,235
That's lucky?

86
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,654
I may not look like one,

87
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,450
but I'm something of an expert
when it comes to getting rejected.

88
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,077
How can I put this? I have my know-how

89
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,455
and a great system too.

90
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,458
You have know-how?

91
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,087
Hae-won.

92
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,758
Most people who get
their feelings rejected

93
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,968
have one thought.

94
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,265
What exactly did I do wrong?

95
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,936
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

96
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,814
Do you think so?

97
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,235
Of course, not. What did you do wrong?

98
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,279
What's wrong with confessing
your feelings to someone you like?

99
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,572
It's not our fault.

100
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,283
Even if we say that it is our fault

101
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,913
and we go to our crush
with our problems fixed,

102
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,790
is there any guarantee
that he'll like us back?

103
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,707
There isn't!

104
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,293
Even if I become
the prettiest girl in the world,

105
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,795
Yeong-su still won't like me back.

106
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,924
-Really?
-Of course not, Hae-won.

107
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,551
Those who reject someone once

108
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,302
have a habit of never looking back.

109
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,305
Is this our fault or theirs?

110
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,267
It's their fault! Which means, we?

111
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,226
Have no fault.

112
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,647
Now you get it.

113
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,569
All right then.

114
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,988
Gently place your self-esteem
which has plummeted

115
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,740
in a distant drawer inside your heart

116
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,243
and enjoy this yogurt drink with me.

117
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,160
Cheers.

118
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:40,871
Hey, Mok Hae-won!

119
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,584
Get in.

120
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,630
-Hello. Have you eaten?
-I did.

121
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,300
-We just need to hand that over, right?
-Yes, hold on.

122
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,927
-Did you get your payment?
-Yes.

123
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,728
Is this why you kidnapped us, Jang-u?
To help you clean up?

124
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,272
Yes, Ms. Ji-yeon. I'll buy you beef.

125
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,690
A lot of it.

126
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,401
Do we need to pack up all these tents?

127
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,112
No, you two just need to
take down the frames inside.

128
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,531
Hey, Jang-u. Don't we need more people
for all this work--

129
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,325
Yes, we do.

130
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,621
Then should I call for backup?

131
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,582
Yes, you should.
Someone close to you will be good.

132
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,043
Better yet, call the pretty individual

133
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,420
who took days off from work
to attend this reunion.

134
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,172
I see.

135
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,090
I understand.

136
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,592
Head in with Hae-won first.

137
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:35,509
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,346
What do you want to eat, Hae-won? Beef?

139
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,139
Tenderloin, sirloin, chuck flap,

140
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,349
or skirt steak? What do you want?

141
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,728
Hey, you're not back in Gangneung, right?

142
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,023
Come on out.

143
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,328
Eun-seop! Im Eun-seop!

144
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,746
Where are you, Eun-seop?

145
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,707
Hey, Mr. Popular of Bukhyun-ri!

146
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,671
-Hi!
-Hello.

147
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,965
You probably know, Jang-u.

148
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:15,883
About what?

149
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,344
Why Eun-seop wasn't
in the graduation photo.

150
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,556
The graduation photo?

151
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,477
-Park Sang-won.
-Here.

152
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,020
-Kang In-hwan.
-Here.

153
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:28,938
Im Eun-seop.

154
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:30,940
Im Eun-seop?

155
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,360
-Eun-seop's not here again?
-No, sir.

156
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,320
Hey, hush.

157
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,156
You know not to chat during assembly.

158
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,992
-Park Jung-hui.
-Here.

159
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,286
Eun-seop didn't come
to school very often back then.

160
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:45,621
Why not?

161
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,456
I don't know.

162
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,377
What's more, I think he disappeared
for around three years.

163
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,795
You know the guy next door?

164
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,089
He seems like a different person.

165
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,341
-A different person?
-Yes.

166
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,137
Like someone who went missing
and came back.

167
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,054
Right.

168
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,434
Now that I think about it,
I didn't see him around for a few years…

169
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,351
Right?

170
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,771
Then he suddenly came back,
went to the military,

171
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,939
and then opened a bookstore.

172
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,066
You don't know why he disappeared?

173
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,861
No, I don't know.

174
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,864
If I'm being honest, we're close,

175
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,240
but I know little about him.

176
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,410
What Eun-seop likes, wants,
what his dreams are.

177
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,578
I don't really know.

178
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,371
I understand. In the past…

179
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,001
I don't have anything precious.

180
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,170
What did you say?

181
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:36,672
I…

182
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,550
don't have anything precious.

183
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,260
You have nothing precious?

184
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,387
Not even one thing?

185
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,515
No, sir.

186
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,809
You rotten punk. Sit down.

187
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,523
Is Jung-hui here? Jung-hui…

188
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,484
I thought he was a bit peculiar.

189
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,321
"He's a little different from others."

190
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,329
He has nothing precious?

191
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,415
He really doesn't.

192
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,709
He never cared if he lost something.

193
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,545
Wait, there's one thing he likes.
The keychain.

194
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,590
You know, the one hanging in his car.

195
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,724
He lost it once.

196
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,769
Hey, Eun-seop. Tell me what you lost,

197
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,562
so I can help you or something.

198
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,439
Gosh.

199
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,612
You lunatic.

200
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,074
Let's go, Eun-seop.
I don't think it's here.

201
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,492
I'm going!

202
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,161
He ran around
looking for it like a madman.

203
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,496
Whatever, I'm leaving.

204
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,248
-Ji Eun-sil!
-Hey.

205
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,056
You know the one, right?
He always had it with him.

206
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,393
I wouldn't know that.

207
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:17,731
What is it?

208
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,441
Is it some sort of doll?

209
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,778
No, I think he made it
during metalworking class.

210
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,656
-Metalworking class?
-Yes.

211
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,995
SEPARATE

212
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,544
We're supposed to give it
to our seatmate afterward.

213
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,674
Look how fast
we got things done with three people.

214
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,010
Now that we're done here,
let's go to the cafeteria--

215
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:46,927
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

216
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,345
That wasn't our deal.

217
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,598
We have a ton of leftover ingredients--

218
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,100
-Hey, are you trying to piss me off?
-I have to go.

219
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,144
-What? Where are you going?
-Sorry, Jang-u!

220
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,645
-Where are you going?
-Hae-won!

221
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,563
-Hae--
-Hey.

222
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,148
It's Eun-sil. Hi, Eun-sil.

223
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,357
You're here too, Jang-u.

224
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,109
I'm here too. I need to get going.

225
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,694
There's a bunch of leftovers
in the cafeteria.

226
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,778
Take care of that.

227
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,363
I'm in a rush, so I'll get going.

228
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,656
-Bye!
-Hey!

229
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,533
-Where are you going?
-What's with him?

230
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,703
Why did he ask me to call you over then?

231
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,621
Me?

232
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,208
Yes. I think he likes you…

233
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,251
but he's also scared of you.

234
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,174
Follow me.
You have work to do at the cafeteria.

235
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,509
Why? You said we were getting drinks.

236
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,448
Your mom said to stop sending letters.

237
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:05,589
Do the bare minimum.

238
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:09,760
We're supposed to give it
to our seatmate afterward.

239
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:10,678
What?

240
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,180
You didn't know, did you?

241
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,687
-Hey.
-Hey, stop it! Give it back!

242
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,980
Who was my seatmate?

243
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,815
What?

244
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,361
MOK HAE-WON

245
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,405
I'm not sure.

246
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:32,741
Isn't it Im Eun-seop?

247
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,512
Eun-seop.

248
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,978
I made this during metalworking class.
I have to give it to my seatmate.

249
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,081
Sorry.

250
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,585
-Hold on…
-I'll get it.

251
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,010
-By the way, Eun-seop.
-Yes?

252
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,763
You said Hwi is Irene, right?

253
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,766
Yes. The thing is…

254
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,142
I didn't think so.

255
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,603
It sounded like you were saying it
to someone you love.

256
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,313
Right. The thing is…

257
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,565
-It isn't Hwi, is it?
-Come on…

258
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,079
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

259
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:12,925
I like you.

260
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,804
I like you, Eun-seop.

261
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:38,992
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

262
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,505
Today's your day off…

263
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,632
I remembered something.

264
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,261
It's about…

265
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:59,763
the keychain in your car.

266
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,516
Was it perhaps…

267
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,394
the one I gave you?

268
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,857
From metalworking class our senior year?

269
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,402
We made keychains
to swap with our seatmates.

270
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,238
I was wondering
if it was the one that I gave you.

271
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,701
I didn't recognize it at first
because of the writing, but--

272
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,161
It's not the one you gave me.

273
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,871
What?

274
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,374
It's not from you.

275
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,337
Wait, but you were my seatmate back then.

276
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,339
-I'm certain I gave it--
-That's true, but…

277
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,552
I didn't give one to you.

278
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,515
-Yes, that's true.
-It's that.

279
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,062
So the one in your car is…

280
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,272
Yes, it's…

281
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,403
It's the one that I made
which I didn't give to you.

282
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,072
Oh.

283
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,284
I see.

284
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,538
But did you maybe--

285
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,456
Eun-seop.

286
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,885
Should I go wait inside?

287
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,096
Yes, sure.

288
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:24,848
Okay.

289
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:36,985
I guess you made plans.

290
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,280
Yes.

291
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,578
Get to it then. I'll get going.

292
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,527
You're early.

293
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,154
Yes, I had some time left.

294
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,244
TRAVELS OF A SEPARATING COUPLE

295
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:28,662
Here.

296
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,415
That's my gift.

297
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,958
Thanks.

298
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,007
Feel free to start reading.

299
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,354
Hey, Eun-seop!

300
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,942
Eun-seop! Are you busy right now?

301
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,987
Can you help me? Goodness.

302
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,448
My gosh, this is killing me.

303
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,909
-Goodness, that's heavy.
-Okay, Mother.

304
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:14,791
Gosh, why didn't you wear a scarf?

305
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,960
-It's cold.
-Give it to me.

306
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,671
-Did you eat?
-Yes. Where should I take this?

307
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,423
Over there. To the ice rink.

308
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,717
You should zip up your jacket.

309
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,136
I just packed up and got out.

310
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,345
Yes.

311
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,847
That place is really expensive, though.

312
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,100
Okay, fine. I'll be there. I'm hanging up.

313
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,187
Jang-u, everyone's waiting at
the raw fish place across the street.

314
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,314
What? What do you mean?

315
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,941
The chief is treating us to a meal
because the event went well.

316
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,486
No, I can't go.

317
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,530
Why not? Let's just grab a quick bite
and then leave.

318
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,532
It's the weekend. I want to go home too.

319
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:49,659
Oh, come on.

320
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:52,913
By the way,

321
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,166
where did your friends from earlier go?

322
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,085
-They were pretty.
-Pardon?

323
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,586
Bring them along.

324
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,589
I'll pour them a drink
for all the hard work they did today.

325
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,299
-I don't want to.
-What?

326
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,719
I don't like raw fish.

327
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,221
-You don't like raw fish?
-No.

328
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,764
But you enjoyed it last time.

329
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,390
I did? But I'm a vegetarian.

330
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,600
Since when?

331
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,103
I saw you eating a sausage yesterday.

332
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,397
Since this morning.

333
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,870
Gosh, the meat's color looks different.

334
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,664
Did they butcher it today? Eat up.

335
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,290
What was this?

336
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,792
-Chuck flap.
-Right, that's it.

337
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,919
This looks delicious too!

338
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,254
-That's the tenderloin.
-Right.

339
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,177
That one's sirloin.

340
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,931
I see you brought skirt steak.

341
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,519
Just because I asked you if you wanted
tenderloin, chuck flap, or skirt steak,

342
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,230
how could you think of getting all three?

343
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,023
It's delicious! Have some, Jang-u.

344
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,442
I have no appetite. Zero.

345
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,236
Nonsense. Just eat.

346
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,244
Hey, Jang-u. You don't have a girlfriend?

347
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,121
What?

348
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,708
Me? I don't have one.

349
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,835
What about the girl
you were dating last time?

350
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,879
You dated for a year or two.

351
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:28,300
What about Jung Hyeon-a?
The part-timer at the grocery store.

352
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,634
I thought it was going well.

353
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:30,552
No.

354
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,305
I thought it was though.

355
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,265
Eun-sil.

356
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,058
When are you leaving town again?

357
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,311
I'm dying not to go back!

358
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,812
Just the thought of work kills me!

359
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,441
You're a civil servant
at Gangneung City Hall.

360
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,109
Stop whining.

361
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,944
You better be grateful and do your best.

362
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:51,364
Instead of taking a bunch of days off
to roam around town.

363
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:55,327
Speaking of roaming.

364
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,662
That's similar to what I've been planning.

365
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,580
Roaming Trail.

366
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,582
We can make Hyecheon look like…

367
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,125
- Hey.
- like Jeju Olle Trail…

368
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,126
That's enough.

369
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,586
You were just complaining

370
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,505
about not having time to eat
because of the all-class reunion.

371
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,507
The event just ended, you lunatic.

372
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,760
Jang-u, you must be a workaholic.

373
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,220
I guess you love working.

374
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,971
Yes, I do.

375
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,224
I think it's really fun.

376
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:21,144
The fact that people enjoy
what I had imagined.

377
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,612
Excuse me! Can we get
one more order of the skirt steak?

378
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,529
Okay.

379
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:34,241
This place is self-service.
You have to get it yourself.

380
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,952
You both have such a big appetite.

381
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,371
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

382
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:42,374
TRAVELS OF A SEPARATING COUPLE

383
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,071
Travels of a Separating Couple.

384
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,491
I went to Sandeul Bookstore
to buy that book

385
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:18,243
and Mr. Park said

386
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,412
you had bought that book.

387
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,498
Yes, I did.
You mean the self-published book, right?

388
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:24,416
Yes.

389
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,334
I want that book.

390
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,589
I think it's around 18,000 won.
I'll check and let you know.

391
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,008
If you text me your address, I'll-

392
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:33,925
No.

393
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,929
I want to go
and see it for myself before I buy it.

394
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,434
Is your bookstore open on the weekend too?

395
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,020
Yes, it is.

396
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,275
Then I'll go around Sunday evening.

397
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,776
Will that be okay?

398
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,613
Sure, you can.

399
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,033
I'll see you then.

400
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,702
Right. Eun-seop.

401
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,247
Does…

402
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,168
Hae-won also work on the weekend?

403
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,880
No, she doesn't.

404
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,133
That's a relief.

405
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,428
Hae-won hates me so much.

406
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,931
So I was worried
it'll be uncomfortable if I see her.

407
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,936
I'll see you on Sunday.

408
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,605
Okay.

409
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,047
Are you back?

410
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,176
I'm sorry for the long wait.

411
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,471
It's a very thoughtful book.

412
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,765
Maybe it's because
there's only one in the world.

413
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,518
I read the first part and it's pretty fun.

414
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,398
TRAVELS OF A SEPARATING COUPLE

415
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:13,817
Could you tell me more about this book?

416
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,152
I'm curious.

417
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,045
A couple that's broken up goes on a trip.

418
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,966
They made a savings account as a couple

419
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,135
to travel together.

420
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,222
They went together
even though they were broken up?

421
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,140
No, separately.

422
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,892
Is that so? Then what?

423
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,018
What happens?

424
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,734
The bookstore was warm.

425
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,237
Beyond the glass window,
the view of the winter fields at night

426
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,698
filled the panes like a picture.

427
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,204
The things in the darkness remained dark.

428
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:19,924
Mok Hae-won.

429
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,676
Come eat, Hae-won!

430
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,021
The things that glittered
continued to glitter.

431
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,523
They were all peaceful.

432
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,193
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE INTRODUCTION

433
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,445
What do you think?

434
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,699
THEY WERE ALL PEACEFUL

435
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,785
It's good.

436
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,036
-It is?
-Yes.

437
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,746
Then it's decided.

438
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:52,165
This will be the introduction
of the bookstore's website.

439
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,669
-Hae-won.
-Yes?

440
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,671
Can you add a sentence at the end?

441
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,589
What sentence?

442
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,176
So everyone,

443
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,430
I sincerely hope you have a good night.

444
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:00,859
Everyone, move!

445
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:03,611
Hello.

446
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,738
-Be careful!
-Okay!

447
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,576
Out of the way!

448
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:20,837
Get out of…

449
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,380
Thanks.

450
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,468
Excuse me.

451
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,264
As of two days ago, I no longer like you.

452
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,141
This is me giving you notice.

453
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,602
Then goodbye. Off I go.

454
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:36,519
Freeze.

455
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,485
Why the sudden change of heart?

456
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,780
It's complicated, but simply put,

457
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,491
you can see it as a matter of pride.

458
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,118
I see.

459
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,453
What?

460
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:57,332
Is it slightly disappointing
to find out I don't like you anymore?

461
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:02,045
No. It's slightly strange,

462
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,421
but not disappointing.

463
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,339
Thanks.

464
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:14,849
Everyone, move!

465
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,488
Hello?

466
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:11,823
It's me. Eun-seop.

467
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,243
-What is it?
-Don't…

468
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,123
Don't come in today.

469
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:21,749
What?

470
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,753
I don't think I can
open the bookstore today.

471
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,049
Probably…

472
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,469
not until tomorrow or the day after.

473
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:38,891
Okay.

474
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:40,601
Talk to you later.

475
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,189
Im Eun-seop.

476
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,319
Eun-seop!

477
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,431
Darn it.

478
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,604
Hey, Mok Hae-won.

479
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,064
Hae-won!

480
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,068
Seriously?

481
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,367
Where did you go this early?

482
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,539
What's wrong with you?

483
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,582
What?

484
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,500
Why do you…

485
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,339
Why do you have a dog?

486
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,091
What are you saying?

487
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,051
Did you forget how sad
we were when Hodu died?

488
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,886
So how could you get another dog?

489
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,098
He's Hodu's son.

490
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,268
So what?
Do you have to raise all her sons?

491
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,687
My mom didn't even raise me.
So what about it?

492
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,565
And why did you name him Gunbam
of all things?

493
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,401
What's wrong with his name--

494
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,403
Why is the dog's name Gunbam?

495
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,654
I bet Gunbam hates it too.

496
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,781
Why is it Gunbam? It's so shabby!

497
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,992
It's shabby! So terribly shabby!

498
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,251
What's wrong with her?

499
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,384
Hey…

500
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,345
Jeez.

501
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:26,767
Ms. Kim.

502
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,313
What are you doing here?
You're not going to the office?

503
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,106
I'm in between classes.

504
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,817
I see. I'm heading out after I get my tea.

505
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,694
Okay. Goodbye then.

506
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,280
What's this book?

507
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,908
It looks interesting.
The title is unique too.

508
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,786
I haven't finished reading it yet.

509
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:46,871
Is that so?

510
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,164
Well, I'll head to the office first.

511
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,291
-I'll see you later.
-Okay, see you.

512
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,715
TRAVELS OF A SEPARATING COUPLE

513
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,041
Yes, bookstore owner?

514
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:35,586
Every eight hours, okay?

515
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,964
Goodbye, then.

516
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,508
I'll get going.

517
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,343
Yes, this is Hanim Pharmacy.

518
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,261
Hi, Ms. Choi.

519
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,058
-Excuse me, Mr. Bae.
-Yes?

520
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:52,395
The book club meeting tonight
has been canceled.

521
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,234
Seung-ho.
Your grandpa will be here in an hour.

522
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,444
-Wait here with me, okay?
-Okay.

523
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,532
Seung-ho!

524
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,244
The book club meeting tonight
has been canceled!

525
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:09,745
Tell your grandpa too.

526
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,539
Okay, sir!

527
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,835
Wait, Mr. Bae!

528
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,837
Why is it canceled?

529
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,715
Ms. Kwon!

530
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,632
Yes.

531
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,801
Does Hae-won know?

532
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,928
I'm sure she does. She works there.

533
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,306
-Okay.
-By the way, Myeong-yeo.

534
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,516
I went to the reunion

535
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,687
and Sang-ho said that
Yun-taek got divorced.

536
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,940
-So what?
-What?

537
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:41,610
So what if Yun-taek got a divorce?
What does it have to do with me?

538
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,821
I'm hanging up.

539
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:00,838
Eun-seop.

540
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,260
Goodness.

541
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:07,762
Eun-seop.

542
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,222
You're still in bed?

543
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,269
Mother…

544
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,063
Hi, Mother.

545
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,526
Eun-seop!

546
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,320
My gosh, you darn punk.

547
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,406
Get up right now! Let's go home.

548
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,324
I'm fine, Mother.

549
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,827
How could you not call me
and let it get this bad?

550
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,913
-You drive me insane.
-Mother…

551
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,887
Why are you doing that?
We have enough firewood.

552
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,892
Hey. The book club meeting today
has been canceled.

553
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,310
I know.

554
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,231
But why was it canceled?

555
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,441
Because Im Eun-seop is sick.

556
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,151
What?

557
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,069
He's sick?

558
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,239
Yes, he caught a bad cold.

559
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,825
Darn it.

560
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,373
Darn it!

561
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,002
My goodness.

562
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:04,753
Mom!

563
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:05,713
Mom!

564
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,924
Hey, Mom! Where are you?

565
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,229
Come on.

566
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,693
Is it bad?

567
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,653
What's wrong with him?
Did something happen?

568
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,739
I don't know.

569
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,326
How could he not tell me
and let it get so bad?

570
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,703
That crazy punk.

571
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,832
Mom, are you making
herbal medicine for Eun-seop?

572
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,751
What else can I do?

573
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,378
He won't go to the hospital
or even take medicine.

574
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,173
He's so obedient with everything else,

575
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:51,217
but why won't he ever take medicine?

576
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,595
Well, that's the same thing as
how Dad would rather die

577
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,931
than ask someone for directions.

578
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:57,848
Also,

579
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,392
you ignored me when I asked you
to make me some brain tonic.

580
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,978
-But you're making Eun-seop--
-That's different!

581
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,480
How is it different? It's the same!

582
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:08,150
Honey, Hwi, Dad's home.

583
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,318
I'll tell Dad everything.

584
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,611
You can't just throw your bike down

585
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,447
-Sure. Go tell him.
-in front of the house.

586
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,741
Dad! Mom keeps scolding me.

587
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:18,452
Why? What is it now? Go in first.

588
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,164
She always sides with Eun-seop.

589
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,916
Gosh, it's so depressing.

590
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,502
-I always come second.
-Why? Did something happen?

591
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,506
She's pouting like a baby.

592
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:34,426
This just…

593
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,013
reminds me of that time.

594
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,395
When Eun-seop disappeared

595
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,022
and came back long after.

596
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,487
He won't take any medicine

597
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,406
or go to the hospital.

598
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,576
It's the same.

599
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,960
I thought he was going to die back then.

600
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,298
Don't try too hard.

601
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,718
He's never going to say

602
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,304
what you want to hear.

603
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,767
He won't.

604
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,687
He's not one to express his feelings.

605
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,232
He doesn't have to.

606
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,943
But you wanted to hear it from him.

607
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,904
No, I don't. Nor do I need to hear it.

608
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,390
Hey.

609
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,225
Are you not working today either?

610
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:07,978
No, I'm not.

611
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:11,899
How is the food?

612
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,276
What about it?

613
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,114
It's been a while since I cooked,
so I wasn't sure about the taste.

614
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:21,575
I don't know.

615
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,121
It's good.

616
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,544
What?

617
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,506
I've been meaning to ask…

618
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,385
since yesterday.

619
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,719
Can you answer my question?

620
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,429
Go ahead.

621
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,684
Are you sick?

622
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,774
No, I'm not.

623
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,662
AN ERA OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY IN GANGWON

624
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:12,543
Darn it.

625
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,671
This is driving me nuts.

626
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,590
I'll have another meeting next week
and let you know.

627
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,217
-Okay, good job.
-Thank you.

628
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,010
-Go ahead with the project.
-Okay.

629
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:40,028
Ji-yeon went to her in-laws',
so I'm giving it to you instead.

630
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,530
Memorize it perfectly, got it?

631
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,535
This is spicy cucumber and dried pollack.
These are yours.

632
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:50,038
This is seasoned spinach and bracken.
This is for Ji-yeon.

633
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:51,373
Next is Hae-won's.

634
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,126
It's mustard greens kimchi and something…

635
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,252
Whatever.

636
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,504
And these three are for So-min.

637
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,090
These four here are for Jung-hui.

638
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,718
Then these three are for Eun-seop.

639
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,055
Are you listening?

640
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,432
Did you memorize everything?

641
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:10,809
Yes.

642
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,522
The spicy cucumber
and dried pollack are mine.

643
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:19,109
Then the seasoned spinach
and bracken are for Ji-yeon.

644
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,695
The mustard greens kimchi
and something are for Hae-won.

645
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:24,823
These three are for So-min
and these four are for Jung-hui.

646
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,241
Then these three here…

647
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,702
are for Eun-seop.

648
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,289
I guess getting into SNU wasn't a fluke.

649
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:35,250
All right. Deliver these safely to them.

650
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,544
I'll get going.
Sorry for bothering you at work.

651
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,171
Load it up in this.

652
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,172
-Here.
-Okay.

653
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,509
Is there anywhere to store this, though?

654
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,678
I'm going home now, so no worries.

655
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,180
You're off already?

656
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,098
I'm taking the afternoon off.

657
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:52,434
Why? Are you sick too?

658
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,856
You don't look sick to me.

659
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,861
I'm not sick.
But I want to go home and rest.

660
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,656
Be careful not to catch a cold.

661
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,826
Everyone in town has been talking about
how sick Eun-seop is from a cold.

662
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,119
He's sick?

663
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:12,996
Okay, bye then.

664
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,415
-Right, Jang-u.
-What is it?

665
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,377
What did we eat yesterday?

666
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,297
Thin flank and chuck flap.

667
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,799
Yes, I remember now.

668
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:28,178
If you go around spreading lies
that I liked you ever again,

669
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:32,391
then you better watch
your chuck flap and thin flank.

670
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,893
I'll get going. Bye.

671
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,604
Okay, bye.

672
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:52,911
She's scary. Just terrifying.

673
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:48,383
Jin-ho.

674
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,688
Ms. Yoon. It's me.

675
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,856
-Hi, Jang-u.
-Hi.

676
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,275
-Eun-sil got you some side dishes.
-Yes.

677
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,696
-Her mom called me about it.
-I see.

678
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:56,326
Hey, you should introduce a nice girl
from your office to Eun-seop.

679
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,705
Eun-seop isn't the type to date.

680
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,207
Eun-seop! Jang-u is here!

681
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,125
Hey, Eun-seop!

682
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,297
Why won't he answer?

683
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,215
Hey, Eun-seop!

684
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,808
Ms. Yoon. Eun-seop isn't here.

685
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:27,941
Eun-seop!

686
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:31,445
Are you inside, Eun-seop?

687
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,947
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

688
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,241
Eun-seop!

689
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:39,786
Im Eun-seop!

690
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,664
What, is Eun-seop inside?

691
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,502
Hey, Hae-won. Well…

692
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,090
It seems like he's not inside, right?

693
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,091
What the heck?

694
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,972
-He disappeared?
-Yes, suddenly.

695
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,975
Did you maybe meet him today?

696
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:03,685
No, I didn't.

697
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,854
Then where did he go?

698
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:09,608
I heard he was sick.

699
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,359
Yes, apparently.

700
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,153
He's not one to get sick.

701
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:15,572
But he disappeared?

702
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,408
Yes. Where did he go?

703
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,327
Have you tried calling him?

704
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,038
No. I think he left his phone behind.

705
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,208
Maybe he went to the mountain.

706
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,306
PARK HUIN-DOL, OWNER OF SANDEUL BOOKSTORE

707
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:48,480
Hello? Yes, hello, Mr. Park.

708
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:53,527
Yes, I was wondering
if Eun-seop is with you?

709
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:56,738
I see.

710
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,991
Yes, okay.

711
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,123
I told you, Mom.
He probably went to the mountain.

712
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:09,167
What if he didn't?

713
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,670
He did. I'm a hundred percent sure.

714
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:12,671
Think, Mom.

715
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:16,299
Where did he always go
whenever he disappeared like this?

716
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,759
To the mountain.

717
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,388
Hi, is this Ji-yeon?

718
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,266
Yes, this is Eun-seop's mom.

719
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:27,477
Did you happen to see Eun-seop today?

720
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,481
I see. You're at your in-laws?

721
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:38,446
Okay. If you see Eun-seop,
please let me know!

722
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:42,367
My gosh.

723
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,495
Lower the volume! Now!

724
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:48,707
Why are you even worried?

725
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,543
You have nothing to worry about, Mom.

726
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,879
I bet he's all better now.

727
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,505
That's why he went there.

728
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,425
Old habits die hard.

729
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:01,344
"Hi, there. I'm Eun-seop.
I love going to the mountain."

730
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,681
Then later when your dad gets home,

731
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:09,019
let's go to the mountain together.
You, me, and your dad.

732
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,438
Why? I don't want to.

733
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,232
Aren't you worried at all
that your brother disappeared?

734
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,942
I'm sure he'll be back just fine!

735
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,819
-He goes there all the time!
-My gosh!

736
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,071
You little brat. I ought to just…

737
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,452
Can you please pay before you leave?

738
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,287
Let's all eat together.

739
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:30,332
He thinks he's the owner.

740
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,541
It's my wife.

741
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,127
Hello?

742
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,505
You want to go now?

743
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,798
Jong-pil.

744
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,550
The village chief said to wait.

745
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,302
-He's right.
-You'll get in trouble.

746
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,261
Say it's urgent.

747
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,181
Now's not a good time.

748
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:49,100
-Why would you drink until you get drunk?
-You can't go.

749
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,394
-I can't believe you.
-He's going to leave us.

750
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,897
Why else would I drink
if not to get drunk?

751
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,024
I said he disappeared.

752
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:59,319
He's gone. I can't reach him either!

753
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,239
How much did you drink?

754
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,660
You can't even walk?

755
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:11,289
-Why would you drink that much?
-Rain check for the claw machine arcade.

756
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,166
-Eun-seop went to the mountain again.
-If you can't walk

757
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:15,627
-My mom will faint if I leave.
-it means you're wasted!

758
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:20,298
-Why does he always have to worry us?
-You saw how bad his fever was.

759
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,467
So how can you
be downing drinks like that?

760
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,513
I'm not sure.

761
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:30,016
I want to rest but why did the chief
have to call me out at night to work?

762
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,185
Good evening.

763
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,649
I'll probably be here
for around two to three hours.

764
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,903
What do you think? Should I ask the chief?

765
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,280
No, I think that's a bad idea.

766
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,908
Don't worry, okay?

767
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,577
I'm sure he went to the mountain.
He'll come back just fine.

768
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,579
Going to the mountain is
a sickness of his.

769
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:53,707
He's fine. He's a grown adult--

770
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,709
Yes, ma'am. I'm a City Hall employee.

771
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:56,793
-I suggest you call
-What?

772
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,169
the airport's support center.

773
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,839
Yes, that's right, ma'am.
Have a good night.

774
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,424
What's he saying? I'm hanging up.

775
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,511
Hwi?

776
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:53,516
You know the cabin that Eun-seop is in?
Is it far?

777
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,020
No, just follow the trail from the start.

778
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,813
Then it's about a 30-minute walk.

779
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,776
But the path is a bit rough.

780
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:06,738
Hae-won, don't tell me
you're going to go there.

781
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,282
You shouldn't go, Hae-won.

782
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:12,702
Look at the sky.
It looks like it'll rain at any moment.

783
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:16,414
If you go up alone and it rains,
you could die.

784
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,334
Yes, don't worry.

785
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,213
I won't go.

786
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:25,590
I promise.

787
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:34,349
Eun-seop!

788
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,774
Im Eun-seop!

789
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:50,949
When I was young,

790
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:53,910
my mom wasn't at home from time to time.

791
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,247
Oddly, on those days,

792
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:01,000
I'd feel anxious all day.

793
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,211
Im Eun-seop!

794
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,382
I suddenly got the feeling

795
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,385
when I was looking for you earlier.

796
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:18,768
Im Eun-seop!

797
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,908
Some people never share their worries.

798
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:40,331
They build a cabin in their hearts

799
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,294
and never step foot outside of it.

800
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:50,717
They don't ever voice their loneliness.

801
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,931
In fact, they prefer the loneliness.

802
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:00,685
They prefer it…

803
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,272
over their families.

804
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,500
Humans are dumber than animals.

805
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:25,877
How so?

806
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,339
They become stupid when they like someone.

807
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,426
Does that book say so?

808
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,434
They jump, knowing that they'll die,
just because they like someone.

809
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,437
They're so stupid.

810
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:46,981
Idiots.

811
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,405
Then you don't have to like anyone.

812
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,324
Eun-seop!

813
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,329
Just don't give anyone your heart.

814
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:07,835
Just deny yourself the happiness
you feel from liking someone.

815
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,891
Happiness and unhappiness
are like two sides of the same coin.

816
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,856
If you don't become happy,

817
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,526
you can't become unhappy.

818
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,781
If you don't gain anything,

819
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,158
then there's nothing to lose,

820
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:40,702
Hae-won.

821
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,302
You can just…

822
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,766
disappear from that person forever.

823

BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

824
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,892
POSTED BY SEOP

825
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:51,314
Irene said to me, "I like you."

826
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:55,985
I froze and wasn't able to say anything

827
01:00:56,736 --> 01:01:00,990
Is this what eternity feels like?

828
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:06,079
That one sentence she said made
both me and the universe come to a halt.

829
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:10,792
I pulled myself together,
but all I could say was, "Okay."

830
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:16,881
What have I done? What a cruel night.

831
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:23,388
Don't ever come up the mountain again.

832
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:24,389
Even if I'm sick

833
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,973
or I never go back down.

834
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:30,228
I just need to accept the fact
that you don't like me.

835
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,396
But it's hard.

836
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,856
-I'm going somewhere today.
-Where?

837
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,858
I have some business in Seoul.

838
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:38,361
Why is your face so pale?
Did you catch a cold?

839
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:39,779
It will go away soon.

840
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:40,822
Take the medicine.

841
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,115
What will you do for me?

842
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,158
Must I do something for you?

843
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,702
I wish you would.

844
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,870
Maybe you could respond to my confession.

845
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:53,876
