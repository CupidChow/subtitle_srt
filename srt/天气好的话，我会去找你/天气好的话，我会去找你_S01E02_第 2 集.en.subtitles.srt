00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,944
Dear members of the Goodnight Club,

2
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,531
the longest-running
anonymous nocturnal organization,

3
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,617
are you all asleep?

4
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,770
As for me…

5
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,487
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

6
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:59,369
Sorry, I just wanted to ask you something.

7
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,996
-No.
-What? What do you mean, "no"?

8
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,958
About earlier. It's all in the past.

9
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:12,090
Are you talking about
when you said you liked me?

10
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,259
Yes. Those feelings are over.

11
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,649
As for me…

12
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:31,860
I'm screwed.

13
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,071
Totally screwed.

14
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,519
HYECHEON STATION

15
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,000
HYECHEON HIGH SCHOOL

16
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,114
No running.

17
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,743
The teacher is coming!

18
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,581
-Good morning.
-No running.

19
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,791
-Walk.
-Yes, sir.

20
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,299
Sir, he broke the locker.

21
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,177
-Su-min, I'll see you after class.
-It's fine, man.

22
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,512
It really wasn't me.

23
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,847
We have a transfer student.

24
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,561
Her name is Mok Hae-won
and she transferred from Seoul.

25
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,813
Anything you want to say?

26
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,442
As you all know,
our school does not tolerate bullying.

27
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,860
Please be kind.

28
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,570
-Yes, sir!
-Go ahead and sit.

29
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,908
You know we have
a mock exam next week, right?

30
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,496
Let's all score five points higher
than you did the first semester.

31
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,873
Mok Hae-won, you can sit there.

32
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:56,587
If you have class duty this week,
stop by the teacher's office after class.

33
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,797
Got it?

34
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,087
So…

35
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,050
What were you going to ask?

36
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,894
I wanted to ask if I could borrow this.

37
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:54,937
I see.

38
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,606
Sure.

39
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,942
Sorry. It was nothing important.

40
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,111
No, it's…

41
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,072
You can borrow it.

42
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,618
Okay.

43
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,661
THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS

44
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,040
By the way,
which one is your favorite among these?

45
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,002
I like them all.

46
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,633
Oh…

47
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,593
I see.

48
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,762
Then I'll get going.

49
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:29,722
Okay.

50
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,924
It's dark out.

51
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,954
You don't have to walk me home.

52
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,791
Just in case.

53
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,044
But it's so close.

54
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,468
But it's still quite dark at night.

55
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,473
I hope

56
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,601
you're not upset about…

57
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,189
what I said to the group.

58
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,068
It's nothing to get upset about.

59
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,739
I should have just said a random name.

60
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,158
I regretted it on my way home.

61
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:18,247
It's all in the past anyway.

62
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,374
Right?

63
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,222
It changed.

64
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,058
-What?
-The drawing.

65
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,353
Oh, this?

66
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,939
It's henna.

67
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,690
I drew it because I couldn't fall asleep.

68
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,192
Can I take a look?

69
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,195
Sure.

70
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,576
Willow leaves, right?

71
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,078
Yes.

72
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,792
How long does it last?

73
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:07,171
I'm not sure. About a week
unless you remove it on purpose.

74
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,006
I see.

75
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,175
It's pretty.

76
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,361
Doesn't it hurt when you draw it on?

77
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:31,904
-This?
-Yes.

78
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,948
Of course, it hurts a lot.

79
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,576
You have to brand it with a hot iron.

80
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,286
-What?
-You didn't know?

81
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,620
You're lying.

82
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,664
You're messing with me.

83
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,011
Mom.

84
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,639
Hae-won doesn't want to go to Seoul.

85
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,021
She quit her job
when the unemployment rate is so high.

86
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:05,938
Darn it.

87
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,482
She's such a spoiled brat.

88
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,026
Grandma, Aunt smokes.

89
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,485
You little…

90
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:15,031
The house is a mess,
and she shut down the cottage business.

91
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,451
And she's always wearing her sunglasses

92
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,161
for no reason.

93
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,079
It's a fashion statement.

94
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,581
And Grandma, Aunt keeps…

95
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,543
-What?
-She keeps…

96
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,731
Hey!

97
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,319
My goodness.

98
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,572
Why in the world
did you stick that up my nose?

99
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,282
Whatever!

100
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,452
My love, are you all right?

101
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,916
Grandma, I miss you so much.

102
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,066
PHARMACY

103
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,109
Hello.

104
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,778
I have a terrible headache.

105
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,696
Can you describe the headache?

106
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,076
Ever since this morning,
it's felt like my brain is being squeezed.

107
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,581
You can take this.

108
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,959
Thank you. Here you go.

109
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,214
It's been a while since you last came.

110
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,216
Do you know me?

111
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,676
Of course, I do.

112
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,637
The granddaughter
of the Bukhyun-ri guest house.

113
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,555
Right.

114
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:08,686
By the way,
wasn't there a little kid here before?

115
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,606
That kid? She's no longer here.

116
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,567
Sorry?

117
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,027
She's no longer here.

118
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,489
As for Ms. Kwon Hyeon-ji,

119
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,702
the fiery-eyed 18-year-old
whose heart is filled with rage,

120
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,203
who knows?

121
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,290
I suppose she's
roaming the streets of Hyecheon.

122
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,250
I see.

123
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,464
Thank you.

124
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,800
Has your aunt seen a doctor?

125
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,927
She had an excruciating headache.

126
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,972
-My aunt?
-Yes.

127
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,766
For that bad of a headache,
she must see a doctor.

128
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,188
If she collapses, she may never recover.

129
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,179
Mok Hae-won,
you haven't gone back to Seoul.

130
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,389
No, not yet.

131
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,850
Do you have time for coffee?

132
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,813
HYECHEON CITY HALL
AN ERA OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY IN GANGWON

133
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,235
Here we go.

134
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,278
Hey, you want some coffee?

135
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,113
-No, thank you.
-No? Okay.

136
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,909
Our vending machine coffee is the best.

137
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,411
What would have become of you
if you hadn't gotten a job here?

138
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,330
I guess I would've found something else.

139
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,541
When are you heading back to Seoul?

140
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,833
I'm not sure.

141
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,128
Do you plan to stay here
for a while this time?

142
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,214
Perhaps until spring.

143
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:01,799
I see.

144
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,845
By the way, you know Kim Bo-yeong, right?

145
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,264
What?

146
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,559
Kim Bo-yeong.
You used to be close in school, no?

147
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,688
Yes, we used to be.

148
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,648
She was very curious about you.

149
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,942
She wanted to come that day, but couldn't.

150
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,777
She was very sad to miss you.

151
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,779
Is that so?

152
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,991
Let's all meet up again sometime.

153
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,159
Our classmates all still live here.

154
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,370
Not many transferred to Seoul like you.

155
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,915
You went to college in Seoul too.
Seoul National University, at that.

156
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,001
But I returned

157
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,337
to work as a proud civil servant
for the city of Hyecheon.

158
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,715
Let's meet up again.

159
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,093
I'll make sure to get everyone
who missed the last gathering too.

160
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,434
Now that I'm older, I see that
nothing is better than old friends.

161
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,561
They remember me in my glory days, right?

162
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,812
Then they talk…

163
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:57,730
One second.

164
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,945
-Hey, Hae-won.
-Yes?

165
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,322
What are you doing tonight?

166
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,033
-Tonight?
-Yes.

167
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:10,993
Nothing in particular.

168
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,703
Then…

169
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:17,333
I know a fun place.
Do you want to go with me?

170
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,002
Mom!

171
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,171
Where are my neon socks?

172
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,757
I don't know. Did you check your drawers?

173
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,593
They aren't there, Mom.
Why else would I be asking?

174
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,679
Then I don't know either.
Look for them carefully.

175
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,723
I told you
I have something important today.

176
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,892
Come on, Mom. Find them for me, please?

177
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,560
PHARMACY

178
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,187
Hey, Kwon Hyeon-ji!

179
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,942
Hyeon-ji, aren't you going?

180
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,568
You're going to be late!

181
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,155
Goodness, where did she go this time?

182
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,912
Why are you running away?
What did you take?

183
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,789
-Hot packs? You brat!
-Whatever!

184
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,666
Who are you giving those to?

185
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,127
And who did she give the supplements to?

186
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,255
LIGHTING, ELECTRICITY

187
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,007
Listen.

188
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,927
Let me tell you about this lighting.

189
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,763
Once you build it into the ceiling,

190
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,306
you'll never have to change it.

191
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,309
It's basically semi-permanent.

192
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,562
My goodness. It's such a great product.

193
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,690
If you'd like to buy it, please call me.

194
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,150
Sorry, I must rush out.

195
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,403
Please call me, okay?

196
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,446
But…

197
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,741
-Grandpa!
-Yes, Seung-ho.

198
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,202
Seung-ho, you need to turn off the lights.

199
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,120
Oh, right.

200
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,583
That's it. Good job.

201
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,962
We're late, Grandpa. Let's hurry.

202
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,381
We'll tell stories about winter today.

203
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,175
-Is that right?
-So I read The Winter Guest.

204
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,138
-What's that?
-Tangerines.

205
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,681
You'll roast them too?

206
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:58,267
Whatever I roast will end up tasting good.

207
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,520
Move!

208
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,274
Move!

209
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,084
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

210
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,878
Okay, here we have…

211
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,713
-Hwi, come sit down quickly.
-Hello.

212
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,631
This is Mok Hae-won, our new member.

213
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,550
Hi, Hae-won. My name is Im Hwi.

214
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,469
We don't look alike, but I'm his sister.

215
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,804
-Let's shake hands.
-Hello.

216
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,141
As you already know, I'm Lee Jang-u,

217
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,269
the hidden treasure and talented resource
of Hyecheon City Hall.

218
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,729
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

219
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,565
Jang-u, why are you trying
to be funny these days?

220
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,150
Are you an aspiring comedian now?

221
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,070
It's not easy to become a comedian.

222
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,196
Right?

223
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,282
Eun-seop, is it okay if I hit them?

224
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,992
Sure, but they'd beat you up after.

225
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,118
Right, they sure would.

226
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,454
That's right.

227
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,414
Hae-won, you know me, right? I'm Su-jeong.

228
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,125
-Yes, I do.
-It's so good to see you.

229
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:07,961
My name is Kwon Hyeon-ji. I'm 18.

230
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,172
Oh, it's you. The pharmacist's daughter.

231
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,925
My name is Bae Geun-sang.

232
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,301
I run a LED lighting shop.

233
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,678
If you need to fix
or change your lighting,

234
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,847
please call me whenever, forever.

235
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,099
-Please dial 010--
-Stop.

236
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,267
My name is Seung-ho. Jung Seung-ho.

237
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,268
I'm nine.

238
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,521
That's my grandpa over there.

239
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,984
Hello, sir. Is your hip joint okay?
You seemed injured last time.

240
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,071
So what we're doing here today is…

241
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,989
Something very fun.

242
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,032
Something fun?

243
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:41,286
Shall we kick off
our reading club for the new year?

244
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,913
A round of applause.

245
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:44,915
Here.

246
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,458
Careful, it's hot.

247
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,502
Thank you.

248
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,134
I'd like to hear a passage
from our new member Mok Hae-won.

249
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,385
-Good idea.
-Me?

250
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,679
Yes. What comes to mind
when you think of winter?

251
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,894
I don't think Hae-won
had time to prepare anything, so…

252
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,646
"Above the waves of Hyecheon Lake,

253
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,232
sleet started to fall."

254
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,571
"The moments of their love
from the night before

255
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,867
melted away as if they had been a lie."

256
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,621
"Y thought about the man
she left behind in the meadow."

257
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:29,376
"'How much longer do I have to
roam around the edges of pain

258
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,464
to kill off those memories completely?'"

259
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,428
"If the memory
of loving someone is like sleet

260
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,641
or a lost snowman
that came in the wrong season,

261
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,229
I wish not to regret it,
but only for it to disappear."

262
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,984
"Disillusionment is what's left
in the lonely meadow."

263
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:59,489
"A past love disappears
into oblivion and beyond."

264
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,451
"If only I could also

265
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,580
cross this futile field."

266
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,501
Where is that from?

267
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,964
An Empty Meadow by Sim Myeong-yeo.

268
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,175
That was so great.

269
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,844
I'm not sure if you all know this,

270
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,847
but it's a novel
that Hae-won's aunt wrote.

271
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:28,435
Ms. Sim Myeong-yeo was once
a very famous best-selling author.

272
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,605
Hae-won, how did you memorize all that?

273
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,107
My point exactly.

274
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,069
It's been a while since I felt so moved.

275
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,071
Thank you.

276
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,159
My grandpa roasted some tangerines for us.

277
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,536
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

278
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,163
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

279
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,540
They're well-roasted.

280
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,792
Why does he roast them?

281
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,836
My grandpa always roasts everything.

282
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,630
He says it makes things taste better.

283
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,508
He's right. It does smell really tasty.

284
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,094
-Right.
-It smells so good.

285
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,389
What is this white stringy stuff
on tangerines called?

286
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,683
What? That has a name?

287
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:10,102
Yes, it's called the pith.

288
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,771
He has a lot of useless knowledge.

289
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,816
Right, Eun-seop does have
a lot of useless knowledge.

290
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,068
But you don't even have that much.

291
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,366
That's not true.
I was always the top student at school.

292
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,910
You know that, don't you?
I was always the top…

293
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,245
Eun-seop, tell them.

294
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,080
I had no idea. I've never heard that.

295
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,581
What are you talking about?

296
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,459
I was always one of
the top three students, you know?

297
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,503
-When?
-What do you mean, "when"?

298
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,756
-I'm a historical figure at Hyecheon High!
-Since when?

299
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,587
Hyeon-ji, what's your dream?

300
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,006
Gosh, I'll be hearing this
for the thousandth time.

301
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,050
I want to become a rapper.

302
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,719
But I'll never go on an audition program.

303
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,847
I plan on having fame,
but I don't want the inconvenience.

304
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,809
I want to write lyrics
that are popular and relatable,

305
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,728
but I hate trite and overused sentiments.

306
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,606
What do you mean?

307
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,359
What else? It's just nonsense.

308
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,654
Are you guys even close?

309
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,739
Isn't it obvious we aren't?

310
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,074
Then why do you hang out?

311
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,535
Because I have no friends.

312
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,037
I'm being a friend to her.

313
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,539
Because I pity her.

314
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,332
Hey, I don't need your pity.

315
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:39,084
Why don't you eat alone then?

316
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,128
I can't do that.

317
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,130
Okay. Hwi, go on in.

318
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,715
Okay. Good night, Mr. Bae.

319
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,759
You keep walking with me.

320
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,718
See you later.

321
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,554
Whatever. Maybe.

322
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,890
-By the way, Hyeon-ji.
-Yes, Mr. Bae.

323
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,350
Does the lighting…

324
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,936
of your pharmacy sign work properly?

325
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,896
Shouldn't you change it to LED lighting?

326
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:04,109
Goodness, Mr. Bae.
Talk to my mom about that, not me.

327
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,698
You can borrow that too.

328
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:22,919
To be honest,

329
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,923
I haven't read any books in a while.

330
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,259
Why not?

331
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,890
Books contain certain stories, you know?

332
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,392
I found it a bit hard

333
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,897
to struggle with the lives
of the people in the stories.

334
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,068
My own life is busy enough.

335
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:51,323
I couldn't take on other people's burdens.

336
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,411
That's understandable.

337
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,919
But I became a little curious today.

338
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,922
Is that a good thing?

339
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,302
This book of poems in particular.

340
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,981
I'm still reading The Wind in the Willows.

341
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:26,775
I'll finish it soon and return it.

342
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,193
It's okay. Take your time.

343
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,822
Ji-yeon said it's fascinating

344
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,493
how the two of us weren't close,
even though we were neighbors.

345
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:43,375
But I do remember things.

346
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,628
About what?

347
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,880
About you.

348
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,258
Me?

349
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,010
What you were like as a student.

350
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,596
It's not much,

351
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:58,890
but I do remember.

352
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,101
What about you?

353
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,373
But I do remember things.

354
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,751
About you.

355
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,241
We have a transfer student.

356
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,705
Her name is Mok Hae-won
and she transferred from Seoul.

357
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,623
Anything you want to say?

358
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,460
As you all know,

359
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,962
our school does not tolerate bullying.

360
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,380
Please be kind.

361
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,725
Hey, Eun-seop! Are you going home?

362
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,939
Hey! Wait up, Im Eun-seop!

363
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,023
What's wrong with him?

364
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:12,941
Hae-won!

365
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,984
Mok Hae-won, hurry.

366
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,277
Okay.

367
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,068
Okay, that's it for today.

368
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,196
Make sure to memorize the rest
by the next class.

369
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,115
-No way!
-Come on!

370
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,159
All right, settle down.

371
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,244
Well, we have about five minutes left.

372
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,416
I hear the new transfer student
in Class Three plays cello very well.

373
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,667
Shall we ask her to play?

374
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,634
But I didn't bring my cello today.

375
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:25,597
Well, do you play anything else?

376
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,525
-That's unexpected.
-She's good.

377
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,277
She's really good.

378
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,009
I heard you have headaches.

379
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:32,682
The pharmacist at Hanim Pharmacy
told me about it.

380
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,852
Who doesn't have a headache?

381
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,187
On top of that, I'm a writer.

382
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,149
But you don't write at all now.

383
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,110
I wrote too much before,
so it still hurts.

384
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,239
-Then go see a doctor.
-I did.

385
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,575
-What did the doctor say?
-There's nothing wrong.

386
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:53,161
By the way,

387
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,956
do you plan to just keep bumming around?

388
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,083
No, I plan to stop.

389
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,877
Really? That's good.

390
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:03,129
Go back to Seoul next week.

391
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,342
No, I plan to stay here
for a while and work part-time.

392
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,259
What?

393
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:11,971
I'm sure I can find someone
who wants music lessons.

394
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:12,889
No, you won't.

395
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:14,849
I've lived here for 20 years.

396
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,770
I've never met a single person
who wants to take music lessons.

397
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,649
Maybe the piano,
but definitely not the cello.

398
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,609
I play the piano well.

399
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,111
Oh, do you really?

400
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,031
I can dance too.

401
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,283
My goodness.

402
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,459
URGENTLY HIRING FOR A PART-TIME JOB
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

403
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,664
BUKHYUN-RI RICE PADDY ICE RINK
SKATES AND SLEDS

404
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,137
So the job requires skating skills.

405
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,433
Do you know how?

406
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,768
I see.

407
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,315
Do you have any use
for someone who plays the piano…

408
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,067
What? Piano?

409
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,485
Probably not.

410
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,070
Forget it. Bye.

411
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:53,865
Wait.

412
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,286
Do you want to work at the bookstore then?

413
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,706
-What?
-I'll work here instead.

414
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,585
-Why?
-"Why?"

415
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,504
Because…

416
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,215
I know how to skate.

417
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:15,553
How does that sound?

418
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,484
PRACTICING LISTENING TO YOUR HEART
A DRUNKEN NIGHT WITH YOU

419
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,695
There's not much to do.
I rarely get customers.

420
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,989
Then how do you make a living?

421
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,867
I sell books online too.

422
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,453
I need to ship these out today.

423
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:41,996
I see.

424
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:46,250
Customers do come by once in a blue moon.

425
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:50,004
I just need to watch the place, right?

426
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,882
-Yes.
-Got it.

427
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,555
-I'd better get to the ice rink.
-Okay.

428
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,016
Let me know if you have any questions.

429
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,689
-Eun-seop.
-Yes?

430
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,732
Can you get something from home?

431
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,943
I left the gochujang there.

432
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,251
-I want to go too. I'm bored.
-Goodness.

433
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,461
-Don't bother your brother.
-Let's go.

434
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,130
-He'll be back soon.
-Go!

435
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,757
-Let's go!
-Ta-da! Where are you going?

436
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,634
I got some raw chestnuts.

437
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,186
You have one too, honey.

438
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,147
-Hey, ride safe.
-Hey!

439
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,067
-You took all the chestnuts!
-Where do you think you're going?

440
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,404
-Hi.
-You're my first customer today.

441
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,742
Sometimes no one comes at all.

442
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,452
"Sometimes"?

443
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,705
Actually, nearly every day.

444
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,504
Thank you for your hard work.
You can go now.

445
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,880
I'll get going then.

446
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,677
Hey, where are you going?
The night starts now.

447
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,178
Here we go.

448
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,186
Darn it. This only happens to me.

449
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,739
I get indigestion
every time I talk about this.

450
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,408
She keeps making a fuss.

451
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,578
Just because she wants
to have a grandchild soon,

452
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,665
she's pressuring me to get married
when I should still be dating.

453
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,292
Who gets married by 30 these days?

454
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,586
On top of that, I'm still in my twenties.
I'm only twenty-seven.

455
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,505
But Ji-yeon told me

456
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,259
that people in this town
tend to get married young.

457
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,428
You're right. That's the problem.

458
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,723
Who on earth is advocating that?

459
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,934
Who could it be?
Your mom? It's her, isn't it?

460
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,937
My mom wants me
to get married as late as possible.

461
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,650
That's true.
Eun-seop's mother really adores him.

462
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,902
She's always so affectionate towards him.

463
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,116
You punk. You're still nursing that can?

464
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,452
Hurry up. I'm on my fourth can.

465
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,495
Okay. I'll drink it myself.

466
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,166
Good job.

467
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,544
Hey, Hae-won.

468
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,213
Who annoyed you the most in school?

469
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,840
As for me, it was him.

470
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,969
How should I put it?
He was so indifferent about everything.

471
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:09,972
That's my pet peeve. He was exactly that.

472
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:16,187
To be honest, I worked really hard
to appease my parents.

473
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,732
Receiving my good grades and accolades

474
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,318
may have appeared easy to others,

475
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,237
but I used to pull all-nighters to study

476
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,740
and would go around
trying to impress the other kids.

477
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,534
You worked hard and made it
into the top three of our class.

478
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:33,704
Right. I worked that hard
and became one of the top three.

479
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:36,082
-Are you laughing?
-"The top three."

480
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,502
Is that funny to you, punk?
Say you're sorry.

481
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,753
-Sorry.
-Are you sorry?

482
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,421
-Yes.
-You punk.

483
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,467
I mentioned Bo-yeong the other day, right?

484
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,179
She wants to talk to you.

485
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,973
She said you two have a misunderstanding.

486
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,475
She really wants to resolve it.

487
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,364
I really despise that word,
"misunderstanding."

488
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,658
What misunderstanding?

489
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,743
If you did something wrong,

490
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,121
just say that it was your fault
and apologize.

491
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,040
That word is just an excuse.

492
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,378
What kind of excuse?

493
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,800
It means she doesn't think
she did anything wrong.

494
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:31,554
It means, "I didn't do anything wrong,
but you misunderstood."

495
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,932
It means,
"Because you lack communication skills,

496
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,143
you misunderstood my actions."

497
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:42,565
It's an absurd excuse to give
so that you can keep blaming others.

498
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:47,736
I see. It's just an absurd excuse…

499
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,364
She's tough.

500
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,241
Really tough.

501
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,869
I'm not sure
what the misunderstanding was.

502
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,287
I didn't misunderstand.

503
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,247
All I know is that

504
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,375
she was in the wrong,
and she didn't apologize in any way.

505
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,086
I see.

506
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:18,017
My taxi just arrived,
ending this awkward moment.

507
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,853
My sincere thanks to the taxi driver
for such amazing timing.

508
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,814
Hae-won, you can be
quite scary when you're mad. Bye.

509
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:32,406
Bo-yeong asked for your number,
so I gave her the Walnut House's number.

510
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,783
She might call you.

511
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,660
I'll get going, Eun-seop. Bye.

512
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,412
Hey!

513
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:41,749
Darn it.

514
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,013
Is there…

515
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,016
anything else you want to say?

516
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,830
Hi, I'm Kim Bo-yeong. Nice to meet you.

517
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,751
I'm Mok Hae-won.

518
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:27,545
I hear you play the cello?

519
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,964
Yes, I do.

520
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,383
That's so cool.

521
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:34,426
I know nothing about music.

522
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,348
Will you play it for me sometime?

523
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,851
I've never seen anyone play the cello.

524
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,106
Sure.

525
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,110
Where do you live?

526
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,028
I live near the Bukhyun-ri Post Office.

527
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,866
Well, I live in a place
called the Walnut House…

528
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:02,162
I know that place.
The Walnut House is very famous.

529
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,914
It's that gorgeous vacation cottage.

530
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,043
And I heard that
the owner's daughter is a writer.

531
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,545
A very famous one at that.

532
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,547
Is she your sister?

533
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,633
No, she's my aunt.

534
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,555
You're so cool.

535
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,891
Your aunt is a writer
and you play the cello.

536
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,853
You're so different from me.

537
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,440
What's so different?

538
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,233
It's quite clear.

539
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,195
My family operates a mill.
A rice cake mill.

540
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:42,453
How is a mill so different
from a vacation cottage?

541
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,793
You speak so kindly.

542
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,214
Gather around!

543
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,258
Come quickly!

544
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,511
Get into pairs of two.
We're going to do some stretching.

545
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,473
You need to stretch well to live a smooth…

546
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,225
Hey, get over here now!

547
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,397
You need to stretch well
to live a smooth life.

548
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,524
-Pair up. Quickly.
-Okay.

549
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,194
-You go with Ji-u.
-Okay.

550
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,947
Hae-won.

551
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,284
Do you want to be my partner?

552
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,431
The rain looks so refreshing.
Don't you think?

553
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,019
Take this.

554
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,983
My house is close. I can just run home.

555
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,279
Bo-yeong!

556
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,825
See you tomorrow, Hae-won!

557
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,161
Bo-yeong!

558
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,794
Oh, that girl Hae-won?
The one who plays cello?

559
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,337
Yes, that one.

560
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,717
Do you know why she came here
to live with her aunt?

561
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,012
I did hear that she's living
with her grandma and aunt

562
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,388
over at the Walnut House.

563
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,765
You sat over there earlier. Look there.

564
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:13,770
You're right. Isn't it strange
that she doesn't live with her mom?

565
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,397
She must have her reasons.

566
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:18,150
Where's my phone?
Can you look over there for me?

567
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,110
My point exactly.

568
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,988
Aren't you curious about
what that reason must be?

569
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,490
You know something, don't you?

570
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,742
What is it? What's the reason?

571
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,995
I heard that Hae-won's mom…

572
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,580
is a murderer.

573
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,624
-What?
-What?

574
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,250
A murderer.

575
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,628
On top of that,
I heard she killed her own husband.

576
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,422
-Hae-won's dad?
-That's crazy!

577
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,132
That's insane. Are you serious?

578
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,676
Yes. That's why she came here.

579
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,844
Her mom went to prison.

580
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:49,014
No way. That's so ridiculous.

581
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:51,350
Are you making this up? Who told you?

582
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,393
Hey, who else?

583
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,146
-Who?
-Who?

584
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,941
-Who told you?
-Tell us.

585
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:00,776
Kim…

586
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:04,863
Bo-yeong.

587
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,406
-Kim Bo-yeong?
-Kim Bo-yeong?

588
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:11,620
No wonder Hae-won always has
that gloomy vibe around her.

589
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:12,788
No wonder.

590
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,582
But aren't Bo-yeong and Hae-won close?

591
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,544
Yes, that's exactly why
we can be sure it's true.

592
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,547
-You're right. How scary.
-Doesn't it give you goosebumps?

593
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,340
It really does.

594
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,676
Then we're classmates
with a murderer's daughter.

595
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,011
No wonder every time I saw her eyes--

596
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,681
What is that?

597
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:49,968
So what I'm saying is…

598
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,929
that the word "misunderstanding"

599
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,099
is complete nonsense.

600
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:00,520
I…

601
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,568
Eun-seop, are you asleep?

602
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,322
What?

603
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,911
You're drunk after two cans of beer.

604
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,082
You really can't hold your liquor.

605
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,417
I'll get going then.

606
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,961
Wait. I'm not drunk.

607
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,342
Let me see.

608
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,805
You are drunk.

609
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,936
I guess I'm really a lightweight.

610
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,523
Yes, totally. Much worse than me.

611
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:46,400
Yes.

612
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:54,533
It's raining.

613
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,718
I'll really get going then.

614
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,052
Irene.

615
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,305
What?

616
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,853
I'm so glad you're here,

617
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:08,774
Irene.

618
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,314
Aunt, do you have an eyebrow pencil?

619
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,734
Where are you going so early?

620
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,945
Me? To my part-time job.

621
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:19,297
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

622
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,863
-Hi.
-You're here early.

623
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,991
Yes, I woke up early.

624
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,203
Do you want some coffee?

625
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,288
Sure.

626
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,333
-Here.
-Thanks.

627
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,854
By the way, you're really a lightweight.

628
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,982
Yes, you're right.

629
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,194
You fell asleep after one drink.

630
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:26,489
I recall things up until I fell asleep,

631
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,700
but I completely blacked out after that.

632
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,581
You were sleeping so soundly.
Didn't you say you have insomnia?

633
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,792
I do. Maybe I should drink more.

634
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,346
Right, you also said something.

635
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:51,848
Said what?

636
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,310
"I'm so glad you're here, Irene."

637
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,314
What?

638
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,195
You said, "I'm so glad you're here."

639
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,365
-I did?
-Yes, you did.

640
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,120
You said it quite lovingly.

641
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,124
How have you been, Hae-won?

642
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,225
It's good to see you.

643
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,028
It's me, Bo-yeong.

644
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,284
It's been so long, right?

645

BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

646
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,877
POSTED BY SEOP

647
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,756
Irene borrowed the book,
The Wind in the Willows.

648
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:53,887
It would be nice if she likes it,
but it's okay if she doesn't.

649
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,306
Actually, my favorite version of that book

650
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,933
is the version
with Patrick Benson's illustrations.

651
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:04,272
But I don't say it in front of the books,
since books and pictures can hear too.

652
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:07,484
It's getting late.
I've gone on for too long

653
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:11,362
because the nighttime is a good time
for having conversation.

654
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,077
Some people never share their worries.

655
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:22,040
They can't say they're struggling
or that they're in pain.

656
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:23,833
Everything burst.

657
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,835
I'm escaping from here, just like this.

658
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,462
Then what about me?

659
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,005
That's for you to figure out.

660
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,965
I'll just go back to Seoul.

661
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,383
Just stay here for five days.

662
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,136
With a little fixing up,
it will be as good as before.

663
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,054
Eun-seop!

664
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,556
I'd feel anxious all day.

665
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,227
I thought she might not come back.

666
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,022
