00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,771
Uncle.

10
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,856
Are you back from school?

11
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,651
Did you see something?

12
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,738
What did you see?

13
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:00,573
A ghost?

14
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,243
-No.
-Uncle.

00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,890
Aunt, it's me.

17
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,148
Aunt?

18
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,199
What brings you here unannounced?

19
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,369
Why?

20
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,162
Am I not allowed here?

21
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,500
I ask because you don't have
a reason to be here.

22
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,045
Want some pie?

23
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,006
Where did you get this?

24
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,343
It's from Su-jeong.

25
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,266
It's cold. Warm it up in the microwave.

26
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,019
You do it then.

27
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:20,815
So?

28
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,443
Did you take time off from work?

29
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,257
That's me.

30
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,852
Didn't you know I was in this picture?

31
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,937
No.

32
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,359
You can see this
every time you do the dishes.

33
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,403
So?

34
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,406
Are you on vacation?

35
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,785
Until when?
When are you going back to Seoul?

36
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,204
I'm not sure.

37
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,709
I don't intend to go back for a while.

38
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,055
Do you mean it?

39
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,145
Are you really not going back to Seoul?

40
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,318
What about your mom?

41
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:54,283
By the way, I noticed
two new guest houses on the way here.

42
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,370
Is that why ours is going out of business?

43
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,665
Are you really going to live here?

44
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,292
You're joking, right?

45
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,714
I'm not joking.

46
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,177
That's hot.

47
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,140
I'm seriously considering
living here for a while.

48
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,520
You can't survive here.

49
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,442
I'll just live aimlessly, like you.

50
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,781
What about the academy?

51
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,244
I don't think…

52
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,999
I deserve to teach anyone.

53
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,127
Nobody has the right to teach.

54
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,880
No one does something
because they deserve to do it.

55
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,216
It's work. They just do it.

56
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,177
To earn money.

57
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,306
All the more reason why I can't do it.

58
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,606
Are you done eating?

59
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,649
No.

60
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,445
Finish up and go to bed.

61
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,033
You know,

62
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,703
one shouldn't quit their job so easily.

63
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,958
And I'm not living aimlessly either.

64
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,386
What did you just say to me, Ms. Mok?

65
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,096
Answer me.

66
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,224
What were you so worried about
that you cut Si-yeon's cello strings?

67
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,852
That brat said that
all I have going for me is my nice cello!

68
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:46,103
She's not wrong.

69
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,021
Hey!

70
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,857
What? How dare you say that!

71
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,276
How on earth is this acceptable?

72
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,779
It's unbelievable. Explain yourselves!

73
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,365
How could a teacher hit a child? Back off!

74
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,451
Nowadays, teachers don't even
hit children in school.

75
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,161
Do you think teachers hold all the power?

76
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,704
You're wrong! We hold the power!

77
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,665
You're right, of course, the parents--

78
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,166
Yet she hit my child?

79
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,918
A mere music tutor at that.

80
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,170
Give us a refund immediately!

81
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,631
Where did she hit you, Na-gyeong?

82
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,216
My cheek.

83
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,511
-Hey! Come here, you little…
-No!

84
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,721
-Come here!
-Oh, my goodness.

85
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,098
-Please calm down.
-Let go of me!

86
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,141
-Apologize to her now!
-How dare you hit my daughter?

87
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,477
I'll shut this place down.
You'd best be prepared.

88
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,563
-Goodness, hurry up and apologize.
-I can't believe this.

89
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,524
WAKE UP AND MAKE A CUP OF HOT TEA

90
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,110
IT WILL EASE ALL YOUR SORROWS
FROM THE LAST NIGHT

91
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,774
Hi.

92
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,778
Hi.

93
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:49,787
You know…

94
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,793
those things that look like marshmallows.

95
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:57,878
What are they called?

96
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,214
Do you know?

97
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:08,722
Bales.

98
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,852
Or silage.

99
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,772
Right.

100
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:19,859
That's the name.

101
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,687
Testing.

102
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,522
Come in, Im Eun-seop.

103
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,274
Come in. Over.

104
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,904
Father, I can hear you
without that from here.

105
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,572
But I can't.

106
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,532
Can't hear you. Over.

107
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,286
I can hear you just fine without it--

108
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,456
Use your walkie-talkie. Over.

109
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,375
Yes, Father, what…

110
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,391
Bring a rake to the ice rink later,
Im Eun-seop. Over.

111
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,809
Come down. Over.

112
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,646
Okay.

113
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,481
End it with "over." Over.

114
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,359
Over.

115
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,570
Why are you here?

116
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,323
I needed to borrow that.

117
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,189
Is that all?

118
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:23,691
Yes.

119
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,819
How long will you be staying this time?

120
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,699
I'm thinking of staying until spring.

121
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,745
Spring?

122
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,331
Probably.

123
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,173
Bye then.

124
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,636
Let me know if you need anything.

125
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,346
If I need anything?

126
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,308
Like a car or something,
since Myeong-yeo doesn't have one.

127
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,812
Right.

128
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,150
Could I borrow it now?

129
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,277
What?

130
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,654
I mean, can you lend me your car now?

131
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,531
Can I borrow it?

132
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,876
Bye.

133
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,360
Aunt.

134
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,448
You know the guy next door?

135
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,742
Who?

136
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,535
Im Eun-seop.

137
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,370
What about Eun-seop?

138
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,499
I feel like he's changed.

139
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,375
How so?

140
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,753
How do I put this…

141
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,006
Bye.

142
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,884
He seems like a different person.

143
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,678
-A different person?
-Yes.

144
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,015
Like someone who went missing
and came back.

145
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,226
What are you saying?

146
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,769
What? It's possible.

147
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,146
Right.

148
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,234
Now that I think about it,
I didn't see him around for a few years…

149
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,151
Right?

150
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,238
He didn't go missing though.

151
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,864
No?

152
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:39,910
Aunt.

153
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,914
What is it now?

154
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,042
Why does he call you by your name?

155
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,502
What?

156
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,505
You're way past 40.

157
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,216
What did you say?

158
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,218
And why don't you
ever take your sunglasses off?

159
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,304
Did you get work done
on your eyes while I was gone?

160
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,195
"That day, Irene asked…"

161
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,823
Hey, Im Hwi!

162
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,575
Come on, Eun-seop.

163
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,036
I told you not to touch my stuff
without permission.

164
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,623
"Those things that look like marshmallows.
What are they called?"

165
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,084
Hey, who's Irene?

166
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,462
-Don't follow me.
-Come on, who's Irene?

167
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,756
-Stop.
-Tell me about Irene!

168
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,018
Did he engrave it himself?

169
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,404
Your glasses are
the best-looking thing about you.

170
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:41,782
Excuse me.

171
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,498
What did you need to buy?

172
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,088
A flexible faucet hose, a door handle,

173
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,090
an electric drill, some screws,

174
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,301
a caulk gun, and a snow shovel.

175
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,304
Please.

176
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,599
What kind of shovel…

177
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,517
Plastic.

178
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,019
Also, do you happen to have
mint green paint?

179
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,451
My goodness, you scared me.

180
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,634
WALNUT HOUSE

181
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,678
You're even painting the place?

182
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,014
It'll look so pretty, right?

183
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:29,973
Not at all.

184
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,518
You're quite pessimistic.

185
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,604
I think you're just overly optimistic.

186
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,106
Isn't the color so pretty?

187
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:39,733
No, it's not pretty.

188
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,863
This is the least we can do
to attract customers.

189
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,534
I get a feeling the paint will peel off
when the temperature drops.

190
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,286
It won't drop anymore. I checked.

191
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:56,166
You actually believe the weather forecast
when they say it won't get any colder?

192
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,084
You're naive.

193
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,794
It's the weather.

194
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,921
I'd rather trust a meteorologist
over some stray dog.

195
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,006
I'd rather trust a stray dog.

196
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,346
Just watch. They said there won't be
any snow or rain for a while.

197
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,975
WALNUT HOUSE

198
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,991
"There won't be
any snow or rain for a while."

199
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,622
Our house is going to be dripping.

200
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:37,791
In mint green.

201
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,932
It's ruined.

202
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:42,856
What?

203
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,161
Aunt.

204
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,413
Aunt!

205
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,208
Aunt!

206
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:02,918
Aunt!

207
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,082
Aunt, open the door.

208
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,168
Aunt!

209
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,964
What is she doing? Aunt!

210
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,302
It's freezing.

211
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,394
Who is…

212
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,659
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

213
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:17,052
I didn't know you owned a bookstore.

214
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,763
I didn't know this was
a real bookstore either.

215
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,723
Yes. It's been about three years.

216
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:24,851
I see.

217
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,537
Do you sell used books too?

218
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:46,790
No.

219
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,042
What's this then?

220
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:51,086
It's on reserve.

221
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,921
On reserve?

222
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:58,259
Customers will come here to read
and leave a bookmark if they don't finish.

223
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,679
Like holding a bottle of whiskey at a bar.

224
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,183
It's a system I tried out
so people can read more conveniently.

225
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,687
You can do it too
if there's a book you want to read.

226
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:12,899
Okay.

227
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,745
Why is the bookstore called Goodnight?

228
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,998
I've been wondering
ever since I saw the sign.

229
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:33,044
Eating and sleeping well
is harder than it sounds.

230
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,213
Is it?

231
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,261
It's a basic part of life,
yet people struggle with it.

232
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:43,972
I named it…

233
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,892
in hopes that people
would eat and sleep well.

234
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,228
That's the meaning of it.

235
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,778
"Eat and sleep well."

236
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,241
Is that all there is to life?

237
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,123
What else is there?

238
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,681
Thanks for the coffee.

239
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,058
Hey.

240
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,188
You should…

241
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:34,856
wear this.

242
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,713
Eating and sleeping well.

243
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,599
"Because sleeping well is a good thing."

244
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,229
"Waking up, eating,

245
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,689
working, resting,

246
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:19,776
and sleeping well."

247
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,737
"That's a great life."

248
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,741
"So good night, everyone."

249
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,496
Hae-won!

250
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,456
Mok Hae-won, hurry.

251
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,374
Okay.

252
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,536
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

253
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,301
WALNUT HOUSE

254
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,811
Aunt, I'm cleaning out the storage today.

255
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,561
Eat this, Eun-seop.

256
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,774
-Here, Father.
-No, you eat it.

257
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,108
Your father ate a lot.

258
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,777
Okay, Mother.

259
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,196
Eat this, Dad. This is good too.

260
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,739
-Eat up.
-Okay.

261
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,366
Mom.

262
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,117
He has a girlfriend now.

263
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,953
-Really?
-What?

264
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:35,912
Who?

265
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,163
I don't. Ignore her.

266
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,623
Her name is Irene.

267
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:39,540
What?

268
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,460
Is she a foreigner? Where is she from?

269
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,587
It's not true. Please eat.

270
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,506
As if. I saw it.

271
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:49,842
Mom, look at him lying so nonchalantly.

272
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:50,760
Eat and get out.

273
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,554
Eun-seop isn't even 30 yet.
I'm not ready to let him go.

274
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,932
My goodness. Unbelievable.

275
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,311
Right, Eun-seop.
Are you free in the afternoon?

276
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:04,148
I think it'll be good
if we sell tteokbokki at the ice rink.

277
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,150
Shall we go grocery shopping?

278
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,443
That's a great idea.

279
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,612
Tteokbokki is the best snack
for ice skating.

280
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,532
I hope this will bring in more customers.

281
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,577
How can nobody believe me?
Are you my real parents?

282
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:20,415
-Mother.
-Yes?

283
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,668
My car isn't…

284
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:27,588
What about it? Is it broken?

285
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,508
No, I lent it to someone.

286
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:33,052
You lent your car? To whom?

287
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,554
-I…
-Hold up.

288
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,850
Would you look at this guy?
You lent it to your girlfriend, right?

289
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,184
-Does Irene have it?
-Eat.

290
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,853
You see? I told you so.

291
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,813
Then she needs
an international driver's license.

292
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,106
No, it's not like that.

293
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,734
-I'm sure she has one, right?
-Yes, of course.

294
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,485
I wonder where she's from.

295
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,029
My guess is Europe.

296
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,161
I'm back.

297
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,526
Come on, just once.

298
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:35,073
Just take a class for one month
at the academy next door.

299
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,908
What's so hard about that?

300
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,119
You just need to blend in as a student
and play a few times.

301
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,789
And I'll cover the tuition fee.

302
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:46,834
-I…
-Ms. Mok.

303
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,545
Do you view this as snooping?

304
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,424
Because it's not. We're just researching.

305
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:54,967
You understand, right?

306
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:27,250
Goodness, you're fantastic.

307
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,544
How are you so good?

308
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,005
Come here, Min-ji.

309
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,757
It's your turn.

310
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,015
All right, give it a go.

311
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,481
Ready. Start.

312
00:35:56,404 --> 00:36:00,324
Don't you think the director
only cares about her own health, Ms. Mok?

313
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,827
-Right, she always takes supplements.
-Exactly.

314
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,079
Ms. Mok, did she ever give you any?

315
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,123
You also ordered a taro bubble tea, right?

316
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,295
Ms. Mok, are you listening to me?

317
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,009
Also, we're a classical music academy,
but her outfits are so old-fashioned.

318
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,596
-Like her outdated floral print dresses?
-Exactly.

319
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,264
I can't believe you got caught.

320
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,641
I look like an idiot because of you.

321
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,311
You should've been more careful.

322
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,024
The director of the other academy
views me as a total joke now.

323
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,485
You've put me in a bad spot, Ms. Mok.
It's all your fault.

324
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:43,284
I'll be watching you, Ms. Mok.

325
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,871
Your teaching methods are boring too.

326
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,164
Pardon?

327
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,375
You should find something funny

328
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,003
and make it so that
the students have fun in class.

329
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,380
All you do is teach and explain theories.

330
00:36:56,881 --> 00:37:00,218
That's why I told you to go to
that academy and learn something.

331
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,847
Shouldn't you show them some
comedy programs at the very least?

332
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:14,440
LESSON ROOMS

333
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,486
Hello!

334
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,197
-What are you wearing?
-It's me, Mozart.

335
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,407
You said my class was boring.

336
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,743
So I'm going to make sure
you all have fun today.

337
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,079
-That's why I'm dressed like this.
-It's not fun at all!

338
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,498
I want to finish eating this first.

339
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,357
Aunt.

340
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,318
What should we eat for…

341
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:06,826
Hello?

342
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,414
You'd like to make a reservation?

343
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:12,832
Yes, you can.

344
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,375
What dates were you--

345
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,255
Who said you could take reservations?

346
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,882
We need reservations to make money.

347
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,926
-We don't need to make money.
-Why not?

348
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,928
We've been closed for a year.

349
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,388
-What?
-Happy now?

350
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,351
Who said you could do that?

351
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,062
I did. It's my home.

352
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,607
Yes, it's your home.
But it's Grandma's too.

353
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,401
She passed the business down to you.

354
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:43,321
Who gave you the right to close it down?

355
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,824
Would you like me
to open up her casket and ask her?

356
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,243
How can you say that?

357
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,579
I'm too old for this now.

358
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,750
You're only 48 years old now.

359
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,045
And it's very exhausting to be 48.

360
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,882
How do you plan on making a living then?

361
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,469
I think that question is more for you.

362
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,179
Aunt.

363
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:11,515
Stop caring about this house.
I'll take care of it.

364
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,852
How can I not?
This place is falling apart.

365
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,687
Right.

366
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,148
Tell me how much you spent on repairs.

367
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:22,193
I'm sure you have no money.
I'll pay you back.

368
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,362
Pay me back?

369
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,697
Nobody forced me to do it.

370
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:30,785
And it wasn't just for the business.
I was worried about you too.

371
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:32,995
Worried, my foot.

372
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,415
Let's get things straight.
You don't worry about me.

373
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,043
What do you mean?

374
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,671
Weren't you just fixing things
to distract yourself?

375
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,840
What?

376
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,137
You came running back to calm your anger,

377
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,223
then started hammering away
as a distraction.

378
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,557
Am I wrong, Hae-won?

379
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,604
No, you're right.

380
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,651
But do you always
have to call me out like that?

381
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,582
WALNUT HOUSE

382
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:05,713
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

383
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,511
Hey, Eun-seop!

384
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,472
Who's Irene? Tell me.

385
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,474
Spill!

386
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,354
Are you not going to tell me?

387
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,066
Is it this lady, perhaps?

388
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,193
What?

389
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:14,823
Testing.

390
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,910
Hello, everyone.

391
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,962
Dear members of the Goodnight Club,

392
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:31,423
the longest-running
anonymous nocturnal organization,

393
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,638
she has returned.

394
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,187
Uncle.

395
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,565
Did you see something?

396
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,483
A ghost?

397
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,026
No.

398
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,640
There is only one good thing

399
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,559
about winter.

400
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,022
It's when the leaves
that were blocking my window fall

401
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,859
and I can see your window
across from mine.

402
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,947
When Christmas comes

403
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,366
and New Year's Day approaches,

404
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,830
you return to this village for a few days.

405
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:58,844
You know…

406
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,977
those things that look like marshmallows.

407
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,605
What are they called?

408
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,279
Do you know?

409
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,580
Bales.

410
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,291
Or silage.

411
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,549
That day,

412
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:39,885
Irene asked,

413
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,726
"Those things that look like marshmallows.
What are they called?"

414
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,819
Could it be insomnia?

415
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,704
Then should I ask her too?

416
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:12,334
If she wants to join the longest-running
anonymous nocturnal organization,

417
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,755
the Goodnight Club?

418
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,851
WALNUT HOUSE

419
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:41,071
Come in, Im Eun-seop. Over.

420
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,823
Yes, Father, what…

421
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,502
No.

422
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,256
I bet I won't be able to say anything.

423
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,847
-Here.
-Thank you.

424
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,524
I won't be able to say anything,

425
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,234
even if she's right in front of me.

426
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,953
Is coffee okay?

427
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:54,436
I didn't know you owned a bookstore.

428
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,855
I didn't know this was
a real bookstore either.

429
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,789
Why do you have
multiple copies of this book?

430
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,707
-The Wind in the Willows?
-Yes.

431
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:18,377
The story is interesting.

432
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,631
I bought other editions to see
if the story was the same.

433
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,049
Was it?

434
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,843
Yes, almost.

435
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,899
But why is the bookstore called Goodnight?

436
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,069
"Why is the bookstore called Goodnight?"

437
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,113
To which I answered…

438
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,366
Because sleeping well is a good thing.

439
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,370
Waking up, eating,

440
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,330
working, resting,

441
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,916
and sleeping well.

442
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,544
That's a great life.

443
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,797
So good night, everyone.

444
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,466
Im Eun-seop, pay attention!

445
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,304
-Okay, look.
-A good night

446
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:12,639
has been my life's biggest interest.

447
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,768
I'll never be able to
give her that answer.

448
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,981
That's because

449
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,068
I'm a fool who doesn't know
how to comfort others.

450
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,506
A fool who didn't know

451
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,426
what to say to her when she cried.

452
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:51,803
Hey, Eun-seop!

453
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,181
Who's Irene? Tell me.

454
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,849
Spill!

455
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,976
Are you not going to tell me?

456
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:00,646
Is it this lady, perhaps?

457
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,105
What?

458
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,152
-It's you.
-It's her?

459
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,654
No, it's you, Hwi.

460
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,990
Who? Me?

461
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,283
Yes, you.

462
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,410
Me?

463
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:18,080
Why am I Irene?

464
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,706
I don't know, it's you.

465
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:23,460
Why would you call me that
and write about rice…

466
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,295
-Just go.
-Why are you coming close?

467
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,297
Goodness, don't come close.

468
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,424
-Just go. Scram.
-Stay away!

469
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,219
You're disgusting. You're gross, Eun-seop!

470
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,811
So the Irene of "Goodnight Irene" is…

471
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,772
Yes, it's her.

472
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:46,483
My sister.

473
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,695
She has insomnia, just like me.

474
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,281
Would you like more coffee?

475
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,408
No.

476
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,412
Yes, I'm screwed.

477
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:18,724
Hello?

478
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,728
Yes.

479
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,441
Now?

480
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,332
Are you sure about this?

481
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,255
It's just that…

482
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,384
I've never been to
one of our high school reunions.

483
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,470
I didn't even know we had them.

484
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:01,433
They've regularly gathered for ten years.
I didn't attend all of them either.

485
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,521
I hope I'm not dragging you into this.

486
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,732
No.

487
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:12,694
I mean, I think it'll be nice.

488
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,707
We just opened up.
How could the electricity not be working?

489
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,584
Please fix it as soon as possible.

490
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,085
All right.

491
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,464
This is why you shouldn't hire locals.

492
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:34,341
GRAND OPENING

493
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,510
-Don't be ridiculous!
-I'm serious!

494
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,137
-Just believe me.
-No, I don't want to.

495
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,473
-Remember you liked Eun-sil?
-Hey, that's enough.

496
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:44,100
-You've got the story all wrong.
-Jang-u.

497
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:47,270
Remember how you bought 100 roses
for Eun-sil to profess your love?

498
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,564
-Hey! I didn't do that.
-A hundred roses?

499
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,483
-I never liked Ji Eun-sil.
-Remember?

500
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,985
-Stop, that's enough.
-You liked her.

501
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:56,196
-You see?
-You were so dramatic about it.

502
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,572
You're twisting the story.

503
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,491
There's something I haven't told you.

504
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,408
What is it?

505
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,828
She's actually the one who liked me.

506
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,371
-You're pathetic.
-Come on.

507
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:08,250
You all know I was her best friend, yes?
He's totally lying.

508
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,836
She talked about how big of a pain he was

509
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,588
when he chased her around
professing his love for her.

510
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:16,466
Is this how it's going to be?
Who has Eun-sil's number?

511
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,093
-We need to fact-check this.
-Jeez.

512
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:22,138
Is this your scheme to get her number?
You don't give up, do you?

513
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,849
-That's not what I'm doing!
-That's enough.

514
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,517
It's time you give up, Jang-u.

515
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,521
Hae-won, aren't you training
to teach at a cello academy in Seoul?

516
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,689
How's that going?

517
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,316
It's fine.

518
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,735
Is it fun living alone in Seoul, Hae-won?

519
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,737
I'm sick and tired of farming.

520
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,614
-I want to live alone in Seoul.
-Me too.

521
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,075
Just stay here and farm.

522
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:45,287
-Seoul is for pretty girls like Hae-won.
-Don't say that.

523
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,789
Hey, you're not the one
to judge someone's looks.

524
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,250
-We're in the same boat.
-Don't kid yourself.

525
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,044
-Who invited him?
-Calm down.

526
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,964
-Hey, Ji-yeon's here.
-Hurry up, Ji-yeon.

527
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,550
Isn't it freezing these days?

528
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,051
Hi there, little Jun-yeong.

529
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,513
How could you come here by yourself?
I told you to go together, didn't I?

530
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,015
He's gotten so big.

531
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:06,725
My goodness. Hae-won!

532
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,061
Can you switch?

533
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,857
Oh, my goodness.
Attending these reunions has paid off.

534
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,358
I finally get to see you.

535
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,735
This is great.

536
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,570
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

537
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,448
-That's how you earn money.
-How did you end up marrying him?

538
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,533
Oh, that.

539
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,452
I'll tell you later.

540
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,454
Eun-seop came too?

541
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,789
-How's your bookstore doing?
-Not bad.

542
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:33,168
Hey, Ji-yeon. I need you to clear my name.

543
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:36,129
They're saying I liked Eun-sil,
but I didn't, right? She liked--

544
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,881
No, you liked her.

545
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,758
You see? I told you.

546
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,594
-You liked her.
-I won't go down alone. Be prepared.

547
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,388
Did you get a tattoo, Hae-won?

548
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,682
-What? You got a tattoo?
-What is it?

549
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,226
Oh, this? It's a sticker.
It peels right off.

550
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,146
-A sticker?
-They have those? It's pretty.

551
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:55,023
-It's really not a tattoo?
-It's pretty.

552
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,734
Oh, right! So enough about me.

553
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:01,196
Is there anyone who liked someone here?

554
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,405
Let's just call Eun-sil.

555
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,448
Right.

556
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:05,241
-Then he'll shut up.
-Yes.

557
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,578
No, hold on. I have my reasons for asking.

558
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:10,914
Right?

559
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:13,083
-What's going on?
-What do you mean?

560
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:14,459
Eun-seop,

561
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:17,796
did you or did you not like someone here?

562
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,007
As if--

563
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,843
-Who?
-Stop it. You'll make him cry.

564
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,595
-No, he won't.
-He's right.

565
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,389
Eun-seop always stays under the radar.

566
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,516
-What if he stops coming?
-Where are you going?

567
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,434
-Bathroom.
-I won't go down alone.

568
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,020
-Eun-seop, answer or drink.
-Cut it out.

569
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,438
Who did you like among us?

570
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,318
-No one.
-You see? He can't say it.

571
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,446
That's proof that he used to like someone.

572
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:50,078
I'm going to say it.
I'll tell them myself.

573
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:54,249
You see? He can't say it.

574
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,334
Just tell us.

575
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,215
I liked Mok Hae-won.

576
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,516
No way.

577
00:55:13,351 --> 00:55:14,519
Right.

578
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,276
Hae-won is pretty.

579
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,994
-Where did Jun-yeong go?
-What's wrong?

580
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,038
-What is it?
-Where did he go?

581
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:34,789
-Where is he?
-Where's my son?

582
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,000
-Why didn't you watch him properly?
-Jun-yeong.

583
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,251
-Jun-yeong.
-Jun-yeong!

584
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,961
-Jun-yeong!
-He's like a magician.

585
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,963
-Stop it.
-He should become a magician.

586
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,882
-Jun-yeong disappeared.
-Wait, what?

587
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,091
-Jun-yeong!
-What?

588
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,968
-Jun-yeong!
-Hey, Jun-yeong's here!

589
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:47,886
-What?
-What?

590
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,012
Gosh.

591
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,097
Goodness, Jun-yeong!

592
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,392
He should do shows as a magician.

593
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,394
Magic is in these days.

594
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,981
He should do shows all across the country.

595
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:02,609
Starting from Gwangju,
hit all of the rest stops.

596
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,569
Then he can go to Jeju Island

597
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,362
and eat perch.

598
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,114
-You're listening to me, right?
-Yes.

599
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:12,452
Parents need to raise their kids
to become the next Houdini.

600
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,182
Dear members of the Goodnight Club,

601
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,602
the longest-running
anonymous nocturnal organization,

602
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,147
are you all asleep?

603
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,713
As for me…

604
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:06,608
Sorry, I just wanted to ask you something.

605
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:09,235
-No.
-What? What do you mean, no?

606
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:11,905
About earlier. It's all in the past.

607
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:19,287
Are you talking about
when you said you liked me?

608
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,372
Yes. Those feelings are over.

609
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,589
As for me…

610
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:35,887
I'm screwed.

611
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,807
Totally screwed.

612
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:41,726
Roger.

A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

POSTED BY SEOP

616
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:02,265
There is only one good thing about winter.

617
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:05,310
It's when the leaves
that were blocking my window fall

618
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,021
and I can see your window
across from mine.

619
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:12,692
When Christmas comes
and New Year's Day approaches,

620
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:19,866
you return to this village for a few days.

621
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:27,415
I hope you're not upset
about what I said to the group.

622
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:31,085
It's all in the past anyway. Right?

623
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,463
-Move!
-What are you doing tonight?

624
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,382
I know a fun place.
Do you want to go with me?

625
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,383
It changed.

626
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,385
Willow leaves, right? It's pretty.

627
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:42,347
-Where are you going so early?
-To my part-time job.

628
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,475
There's not much to do.
I rarely get customers.

629
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,935
I just need to watch the place, right?

630
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,729
I'm so glad you're here.

631
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:56,611
