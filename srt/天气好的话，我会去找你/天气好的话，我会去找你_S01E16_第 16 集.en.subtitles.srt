1
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,629
-Don't water it too much.
-Here!

2
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,302
-I'm coming!
-She asked you to bring it over.

3
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,597
-Okay.
-Snacks are here!

4
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,808
-Let's have some snacks!
-We also have some makgeolli.

5
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,061
-All right.
-Come over here!

6
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,188
-Come have some snacks.
-Let's go.

7
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,815
-Come for some snacks! Quick!
-Coming!

8
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,444
-Hurry up!
-Quick, come have some snacks!

9
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,034
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

10
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,437
You know what, Hae-won?

11
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,691
I have a feeling…

12
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,863
that you're doing well.

13
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,627
AFTERNOON MUSIC TOUR

14
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,801
All right, we'll be going inside.

15
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,304
You can leave your belongings here.
Just bring your instruments and follow me.

16
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,647
Wait! Can you give us another 30 minutes?

17
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,732
-We're not done with the rehearsal.
-Okay.

18
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,235
I'm sorry, but please wait here
for a bit longer.

19
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,153
We're sorry.

20
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,846
This is Goodnight Bookstore.

21
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,725
Yes.

22
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,021
Please hold.

23
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,360
Yes, we have it in stock.

24
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,656
Five copies?

25
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,075
All right.

26
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,920
Are you doing well, Hae-won?

27
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,885
I'm also…

28
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:23,846
doing well.

29
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,061
-Is this stew?
-Yes.

30
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,110
Why is there seaweed in it?

31
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:38,987
It's seaweed stew.

32
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,906
There's also sausage.

33
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,492
It's sausage seaweed stew.

34
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,998
Did you ask me to take care of Hae-won
when you're this bad at cooking?

35
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,835
You don't remember?

36
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,879
-When are you going?
-A week later.

37
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,051
-Goodbye.
-Okay.

38
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,596
Are you never coming back?

39
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,309
Wouldn't that be better
for both of us if possible?

40
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,937
Do whatever you want.

41
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,445
The publishing industry has already been
in decline for a few years.

42
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,656
However, you successfully
published best sellers

43
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,034
that have sold more
than 50,000 copies every time.

44
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,994
Where do you get this ability?

45
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,289
Let's see.

46
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,208
I don't think it has to do
with my ability.

47
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,629
I would think it's a gift
sent from up above.

48
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,715
Is that so?

49
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,677
Let's end our official interview here.

50
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,554
Yes.

51
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,934
Off the record,

52
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,146
I heard you're dating Ms. Sim,
whose book you'll soon be releasing.

53
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,690
Is that true?

54
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:02,987
No.

55
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,075
We were once in a long-term relationship.

56
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,118
But we aren't together now.

57
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,083
But the two of you collaborated this time?

58
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,797
Well, we broke up
after being together for so long.

59
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,718
Our relationship then turned into one
where we root for each other's future.

60
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,803
I see.

61
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,889
Thank you so much
for your interview today.

62
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,849
Don't mention it.

63
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,937
By the way, please write
a nice article for Ms. Sim.

64
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,606
I can see how much
you're really rooting for her future.

65
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,028
MYEONG-YEO

66
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,114
Hello?

67
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:48,866
Yes, where are you?

68
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,994
Gunbam.

69
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,288
Myeong-ju.

70
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,833
Do you know where the ziplock bags are?

71
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,227
SENDER: SIM MYEONG-JU
RECIPIENT: SIM MYEONG-YEO

72
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,109
Myeong-ju.

73
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,492
-What's this?
-A letter you wrote to me.

74
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,163
Okay. So what?

75
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,789
Write something like that.

76
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,250
To whom?

77
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,335
To your daughter.

78
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,253
Why?

79
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:46,883
Listen, Myeong-ju. Hae-won knows nothing.

80
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,719
She has no idea
why you rejected her visit requests,

81
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,014
sent back all her letters,

82
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:54,640
and don't live with her.

83
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,518
You were so cold to her every time,

84
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,353
and she doesn't know anything.

85
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,440
That's why…

86
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,776
you should try to write it down.

87
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,403
Listen, sister.

88
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,657
Some things go unrecognized forever
unless they are said explicitly.

89
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,413
Dear Yeong-su.

90
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:22,043
Yeong-su, are you enjoying
your university life?

91
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,339
I'm at this school
where you're no longer around.

92
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,305
Today I walked through the dry,
plain hallway by myself,

93
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,349
feeling lonely and empty
like any other day.

94
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,394
I'm doing a good job of putting up

95
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,522
with this boring, dull school life.

96
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,066
All right, let's begin our class.

97
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,445
Hey, the teacher's here.

98
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,740
Quiet down.

99
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,034
We have a new student.

100
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,827
His name is…

101
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,829
-Im Hwi?
-Yes?

102
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,500
What? So your name is Im Hwi too?

103
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,417
Yes, it is.

104
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,337
What are the odds?
It's not even a common name.

105
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,506
Her name is Im Hwi too.

106
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,610
So?

107
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,280
You're insane.

108
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,782
It's only been a month
since Yeong-su graduated.

109
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,325
Don't you think it's too soon?

110
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,413
Hyeon-ji, I'm sure Yeong-su is happy.

111
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,708
-What?
-He has Song Je-in.

112
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:44,875
Goodness.

113
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,336
I pray for Je-in's happiness.

114
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,255
Please, I beg for Je-in's happiness.

115
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,215
This is ridiculous.

116
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,176
Anyway, I'm really going to
be in a relationship this time.

117
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,763
You see, it's not something you can do
just by saying you're going to.

118
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,307
Do you think life is that easy?

119
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,351
I see. By the way, Hyeon-ji.

120
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,479
Are you jealous of me?

121
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,065
What did you say?

122
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:13,154
Once things go well between me
and the hot, handsome new student,

123
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:15,448
I might not sit with you at lunch.

124
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,782
Is that making you jealous?

125
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,075
Don't do that.

126
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,785
What?

127
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,913
I know. I love you too.

128
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,626
Anyway, I'm now in love
with the new Im Hwi.

129
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,002
Excuse me.

130
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,171
You're in your senior year of high school,

131
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,006
and with your grades,

132
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,008
you can barely get into a local college--

133
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,843
There's Im Hwi! Bye!

134
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:37,970
Excuse me?

135
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,722
Im Hwi!

136
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,308
Hi, Im Hwi. I'm also Im Hwi,

137
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,602
the best girl there is. Do you like books?

138
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,104
Who was I talking to all this time? Gosh.

139
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,356
What does your name mean?

140
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,442
Mine is "Im" like important,
and "Hwi" like the sound of a whistle.

141
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,110
-Look!
-What? What's going on?

142
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,196
Im Hwi, wait up!

143
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,533
The books are here.

144
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,328
-You're here.
-Yes.

145
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,956
-Thanks.
-You have more than usual today.

146
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:10,294
By the way, this book here
seems to be very popular.

147
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,879
It's in great demand.

148
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:15,007
Even the downtown bookstore bought
many copies of this one.

149
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,343
Yes, it's selling pretty well.

150
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,887
I heard

151
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,015
the writer of this book lives
at the Walnut House.

152
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,100
Is that true?

153
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,684
Yes, that's right.

154
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,604
I'll get going. Take care.

155
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,865
THE SISTERFIELD MAZE

156
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:30,124
Hae-won. Are you doing well?

157
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,045
I'm doing very well.

158
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,214
-More kimchi, please.
-Sure.

159
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,678
The weather is nice.

160
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,603
I don't have more to say.

161
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,443
Do you still hate me?

162
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,781
I don't want to make excuses

163
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,658
for how you feel about me.

164
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,248
But Myeong-yeo said

165
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,543
some things go unrecognized forever
unless they are said explicitly.

166
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,679
I was the same age
as when you graduated from university

167
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,515
when I had you.

168
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,186
When I was your age,

169
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,023
I was already a mom to a six-year-old.

170
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,411
And that was when your dad,

171
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,916
whom I believed to be
the sweetest man in this world,

172
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,127
had already started abusing me.

173
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,348
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE

174
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,814
My life was horrible.

175
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,988
I didn't know how to console myself…

176
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,492
and I was cold to you.

177
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,207
I only thought about myself,

178
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,128
and I only took care of myself.

179
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,340
Despite everything,

180
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,470
there was never a moment
when I didn't love you.

181
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,474
I was simply not good…

182
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,313
at expressing how I feel.

183
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:07,781
Also,

184
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,576
Myeong-yeo is leaving…

185
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,621
for a faraway place.

186
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,291
So could you come to visit us before then?

187
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,527
The weather has…

188
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,617
The weather has gotten very nice, Hae-won.

189
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,069
Mom! I'm off to make some money.

190
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,916
Eun-seop!

191
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,292
I need some money.

192
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,837
-Hurry! I'm in a rush.
-All right.

193
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,674
-How much do you need?
-Hand it over here.

194
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,467
Let's see. 10,000 won will do.

195
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,178
So listen, Eun-seop.

196
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,264
We have a new student in our class.

197
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,683
And the student's name is Im Hwi.
Just like me.

198
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,810
I really like this person.

199
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,647
Is this a boy?

200
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,982
Yes, of course, it is.

201
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:08,652
Eun-seop, I like boys. I really like them.
I'm already into them.

202
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,820
I'm going to date him.

203
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:13,615
But Hwi, is it right for you
to already start dating…

204
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,411
Okay.

205
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,204
Be careful when you go out.

206
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,873
Call me so I can join.

207
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,042
What? Are you out of your mind?

208
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,877
Should I take more of your money?

209
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,754
Get going.

210
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,757
All right, Eun-seop.
Thank you, Eun-seop. Sleep well, Eun-seop.

211
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,008
Good night, Eun-seop.

212
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,778
LOVE COMES AGAIN,
AS SPRING COMES AFTER WINTER

213
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,912
Goodness, hello.

214
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:45,082
Hi. Those flowers look pretty.
Did someone give them to you?

215
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,334
As if. I bought them myself.

216
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,961
Seems like you're going somewhere.

217
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,546
I'm also off to see some flowers.

218
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,801
Grandpa, I'm going to school!

219
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,221
Seung-ho! You should turn off the lights.

220
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,139
You're right!

221
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,600
Good job.

222
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,643
-Grandpa.
-Yes?

223
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:05,894
I'll get a new seatmate today.

224
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,021
I hope I get to sit with Ji-yeon.

225
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,691
Please make a wish
so she can be my seatmate.

226
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,942
Of course.

227
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,111
-Please!
-Yes, of course.

228
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,821
I hope Ji-yeon becomes my seatmate.

229
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,996
"Come to the garden in spring."

230
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,333
"If you don't come,
what purpose would these have?"

231
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,877
"And if you do come--"

232
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,420
Welcome!

233
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,463
We want to decorate our newlywed home.

234
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,424
With this lighting,

235
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:38,051
once you have it installed
on your ceiling,

236
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,805
you won't need to replace it.
It will last forever.

237
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,640
This is a long-lasting,

238
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,517
-semi-permanent item.
-We'll come back.

239
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,145
-But this is a fantastic product.
-We'll come back later.

240
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,106
But excuse me, if you're interested
in purchasing, please call…

241
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,693
How far did I get?

242
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,987
Kwon Hyeon-ji!

243
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,698
Aren't you going to school?

244
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,660
It's almost ten o'clock!

245
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,454
Where did she go this time?

246
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,418
Hey! What are you
running away with this time?

247
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,878
Whatever.

248
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,255
Anthelmintics? For who?

249
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,885
Right, spring is the time
to take anthelmintics.

250
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,724
Out of my way!

251
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,690
Get out of the way!

252
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,317
THE SCENT OF SPRING FLOWERS MOVES YOU
TO REMINISCE IN THE SUMMER

253
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,902
WELCOME TO OUR SCHOOL
HYECHEON HIGH SCHOOL

254
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,570
Get out of the way!

255
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,447
For one last time, out of the way!

256
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,201
Let's finish up and have a snack.

257
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,953
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

258
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,666
MAY THIS SPRING COME WITH MANY BLESSINGS

259
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,219
AND BE FILLED WITH AUSPICIOUS OCCASIONS

260
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,559
Goodness.

261
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,812
How many times does he need
to change in a day?

262
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:40,817
He could wear the same clothes for the day
and change his underwear at night.

263
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:45,572
But this morning, he got mud on himself,
so he had to change.

264
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,910
At lunch, he got gochujang on his clothes,
so he had to change.

265
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:50,827
Goodness.

266
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,747
It's not like he ever does any laundry.

267
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,290
Mother.

268
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,794
Hello, son. Come on in.

269
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,630
Have you eaten?

270
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,715
Yes. Here.

271
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,010
What is it?

272
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:10,430
It's your birthday.

273
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,099
Goodness.

274
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,978
Right, it is my birthday today. Goodness!

275
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:21,942
So did you get this
for me because it's my birthday?

276
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,610
I just…

277
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,488
Goodness.

278
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,533
Son, you're truly the best.

279
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,952
My daughter and my husband
are both useless.

280
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:35,288
I bet they don't even know
about my birthday.

281
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,709
Let's see.

282
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:45,257
DEAR MRS. YOON YEO-JEONG

283
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,475
THE MOM I LOVE

284
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,692
It's just something I bought from a store…

285
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,570
I see.

286
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,323
You should get going, son.

287
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,785
I'd like some time alone.

288
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,413
Yes.

289
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:39,144
DEAR MRS. YOON YEO-JEONG
THE MOM I LOVE

290
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,223
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

291
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,445
Please enjoy.

292
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,002
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

293
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:47,796
This suits you.

294
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,217
-Doesn't the coffee taste good?
-It's good.

295
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,096
But the name of this coffee shop…

296
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,098
Yes, you're right.

297
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:00,475
It's named after
the song you played that day.

298
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:05,146
What? You're making it sound
as if you've liked me for a long time.

299
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,983
But I have liked you for a long time.

300
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,116
You caught me.

301
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,201
Yes, I did.

302
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:20,870
How did you know?

303
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:25,000
How did you know that what I said
about liking you for a long time

304
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,543
wasn't one hundred percent true?

305
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,755
Well, let me think.

306
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,593
It's just…

307
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,701
Hi.

308
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,039
Did I do something to give it away?

309
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,124
No.

310
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:12,797
It's because…

311
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,094
I know the eyes of someone
who has liked me for a very long time.

312
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,525
This is bad!
You should redo the entire thing.

313
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,403
Gosh, we already lack customers.
This is annoying!

314
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,451
Guys!

315
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,661
Hey, listen up.

316
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,164
My plan is to make something
like Jeju Olle Trail

317
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,458
-in Hyecheon, so--
-Hey, stop.

318
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,876
Not this again.

319
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,003
But what else would he talk about?
Let him be.

320
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,422
-Right.
-Think about it.

321
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,966
-For the city of Hyecheon--
-There's Eun-sil.

322
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,885
-Guys! Sorry I'm late.
-Hello.

323
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,136
-Hello!
-Take a seat.

324
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,055
-Welcome!
-Why didn't you come the other day?

325
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,640
You had work, didn't you?

326
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,017
Eun-sil. You just came?
What about work tomorrow?

327
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,143
Are you on leave again?

328
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,312
No. Actually, I quit.

329
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,981
-In times like these?
-You're nuts.

330
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,402
You were complaining over nothing
and ended up quitting?

331
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,861
Gosh, this is upsetting.

332
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,863
It's late when you think it's late.

333
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,116
That's when you immediately have to quit.

334
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,493
Guys, don't you remember
how hard of a time I had?

335
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,578
-Right, Jang-u?
-What? Me?

336
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:26,871
-Right?
-Good for you.

337
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,541
-Whatever. Give me a glass.
-Here.

338
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,251
Hey, Jang-u.

339
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,254
-Yes?
-You seem pretty close to Eun-sil.

340
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,131
-Right?
-Yes, what's going on? Something's fishy.

341
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,134
It's not what you guys think.
As a civil servant to Hyecheon,

342
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,343
it's my job to enhance--

343
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:42,679
Right, Eun-sil.
When you were not here last time,

344
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,640
-Jang-u said you used to like him
-Wait…

345
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,350
-and went on…
-Tell me about it!

346
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,103
Be honest. Did he hit on you
during the class reunion?

347
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,855
-Let me think.
-Stop asking.

348
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,607
-There was something…
-Gosh, I miss Eun-seop.

349
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,317
What? Eun-seop is here!

350
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,278
-He is!
-Hello!

351
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,612
-Great timing.
-Hello.

352
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,239
Handsome Eun-seop can sit here.

353
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,658
Just have a seat.

354
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,536
-I knew this would happen.
-Nice one.

355
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,829
How is the bookstore?

356
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,038
Things are okay.

357
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,083
Now that you're here,
I've always wanted to ask.

358
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,794
Eun-seop and Jang-u,
how did you two become friends?

359
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,463
-It's a weird match.
-Right?

360
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,882
You guys didn't know?
Eun-seop saved Jang-u.

361
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,885
Guys who used to bully Jang-u
took him up the mountain

362
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,428
and tied him up with a rope and…

363
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,764
Hey, but how do you know about this?

364
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,182
You told me.

365
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,391
-I did?
-You did!

366
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,809
I did? When?

367
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:32,187
How did he get into SNU
with a memory like that?

368
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,105
I don't know. Maybe he won a bet.

369
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,025
No, but when did I tell you about this?

370
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,986
It was in the letter you gave me
with 100 roses.

371
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,198
"I'm Lee Jang-u,
the student council president."

372
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,200
"I know I look very decent on the outside,

373
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,701
-but to be honest--"
-Stop.

374
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,286
-What was his name?
-Jae-hyeong!

375
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,079
"I'm being bullied by Jae-hyeong…"

376
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,331
Cut it out!

377
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,210
-That's funny.
-Don't laugh.

378
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,753
But isn't it funny?

379
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,087
-Come on, stop.
-All right.

380
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,756
Guys, he's telling us to stop.

381
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,218
Okay, this is all my fault.

382
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,014
Hey, I'll split the total amount
and get back to everyone.

383
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,390
-Send it to me then.
-Thanks.

384
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,184
-Thanks for treating us.
-Thank you.

385
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,354
-You guys have to send me the money.
-Thank you for the meal.

386
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,941
Let's try another place next time. Please?

387
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,443
Do you know how hard it is
to reserve a large table?

388
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,111
-Right.
-Why don't you try?

389
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,739
Can't you two stop arguing?
I'm getting tired of it.

390
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,699
Guys, why didn't Hae-won come?

391
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,244
-I really miss her.
-Same.

392
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,287
-Should we call her?
-No. What for?

393
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,914
-She's busy in Seoul.
-We should.

394
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,332
-Forget it.
-Why?

395
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,835
-You're all dismissed.
-It was fun. Let's go now!

396
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,294
-Bye.
-Let's have a second round.

397
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,463
The second round is going home.

398
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,589
-Just go home.
-Another round?

399
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,383
-Bye.
-Let's go home.

400
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,635
-I'll get going.
-Get home safely.

401
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,136
-Let's go.
-Are you okay?

402
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,848
-How about another round?
-Of course.

403
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,307
-Go home.
-I'm going for another drink.

404
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,685
-You'll get fat, you pig.
-Did you call me a pig?

405
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,020
-He keeps calling me a pig.
-Are you two dating?

406
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,730
-What?
-No way.

407
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,024
-How could you say that?
-I'm offended.

408
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,193
-We're not dating.
-That's never happening.

409
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,495
Myeong-ju, have you seen
the nail clippers?

410
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,872
I can't find them.

411
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,709
You…

412
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,795
You're still here.

413
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,798
I thought you had left already.

414
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,676
-What?
-It's me, of course.

415
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,471
Hey, Mok Hae-won.

416
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,104
We can't give any more free fried eggs.

417
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,564
-All right.
-Don't ask for them again!

418
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,613
When are you going back this time?

419
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:12,865
Maybe after a week?

420
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,202
How did the interviews go?

421
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,578
I failed all of them.

422
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,539
I see.

423
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,874
So I'm thinking of getting together

424
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,585
with my university friends
to open an academy.

425
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:31,759
I realized I don't have
any other talent than teaching.

426
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,724
You said you weren't
qualified to teach anyone.

427
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,227
-That's true.
-But?

428
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,606
Well, I still don't know if I'm qualified.

429
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,276
But going back to teaching

430
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,945
reminded me that
what I have done so far wasn't too bad.

431
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,657
I don't follow.

432
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,451
What I'm saying is…

433
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,413
I think my life in Seoul
was so lonely and stressful

434
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,875
that I ended up hating
even the job I have.

435
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:10,006
Then I tried again after warming up.

436
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,009
It helped me to see my work properly.

437
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,303
So how did it look?

438
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,432
It wasn't all that bad.

439
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:24,312
There were some happy moments too.
That's about it.

440
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:25,229
Good.

441
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,026
When are you opening the academy?

442
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,028
Nothing's been decided yet.

443
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,032
So Mom, are you here for good?

444
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,576
Yes. I sold the house in Paju.

445
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,371
That's good.

446
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:46,000
But were you living there?

447
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,377
Yes.

448
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,963
I took good care of it and sold it well.

449
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,758
That's nice.

450
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,100
There are so many people.
There might not be any seats left.

451
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:11,192
Hi, Hae-won. When did you come down here?

452
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,610
Just now.

453
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,403
Did you come to eat?

454
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,823
Yes, but I don't see any empty tables.

455
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,907
Those are all empty.

456
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,158
No, thanks.

457
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,953
I'd like to sit in the sun while I eat.
Such nice weather.

458
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,496
Hae-won, I'll see you later.

459
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,456
Let's get in touch.

460
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:29,335
Hello. Please enjoy your meal.
Two pairs of sunglasses…

461
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,296
See you later. I'll be in touch.

462
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,801
They don't have any empty tables.

463
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,010
What? It looks like they do.

464
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,346
No, I was just inside to take a look.

465
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,681
All the tables are taken.

466
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,934
-There's a table--
-No. There are no available tables.

467
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,353
Should we eat noodles? What do you want?

468
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,669
Bye.

469
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,796
-Bye.
-Bye, Aunt.

470
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,631
Okay.

471
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,258
Hey, get that.

472
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,218
Wait. That's it?

473
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,474
I didn't see any lingering there.

474
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,809
We'll get going.

475
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,227
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

476
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:35,151
Hey, why did you say goodbye like that?

477
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,195
What did I do? That was more than enough.

478
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,256
Are you coming back here?

479
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:58,966
No.

480
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,594
I'm not.

481
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,137
Forever.

482
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:08,577
-How about something steamed?
-How about stew?

483
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,664
Stew sounds good.
There's a good place we know.

484
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,623
-Right.
-Yes.

485
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,044
-Please go ahead. I'll catch up later.
-Okay.

486
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,175
Ji Eun-sil.

487
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,303
-Eun-sil!
-Gosh, you scared me.

488
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,096
What? Where did you come from?

489
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,056
Me? I was over there. What's up?

490
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,767
I'm jobless, so not much.
I just wanted to get out of the house.

491
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,394
-I see.
-What about you?

492
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,354
Me? Nothing much.

493
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,689
What? But you…

494
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:38,691
Right. I was going to take a half day off.

495
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,277
Go ahead.

496
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,778
I'm going to do that right now.

497
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,947
-Okay.
-What are you doing later?

498
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,782
Nothing. I have nothing but time.

499
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,617
Why? Do you want to do something?

500
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,786
Let's think.

501
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,704
See a movie?

502
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,914
We could go hiking.

503
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:56,876
No? Then how about grabbing a bite
at the market?

504
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,628
How about a convenience store?

505
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,922
-What?
-I actually ate, so I'm really full.

506
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,674
I ate too, so I'm full.

507
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,302
The thing is, I'm craving some milkshakes.

508
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,262
But no one sells them in this area.

509
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,388
They've died out.

510
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:14,643
So would you like to join me in finding
a milkshake-flavored ice cream, at least?

511
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,022
Sure. I can go with you.

512
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,316
You're so awesome.

513
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,233
Really? Tell me what I did.

514
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,779
Forget it. Stop your face from turning red
and go submit your leave.

515
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,113
I'll wait here.

516
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,032
Okay. I'll be back soon.

517
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,840
Thank you, Yun-taek, for driving me.

518
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,136
Aren't you going to cry?

519
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,347
I don't cry now.

520
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,268
Myeong-yeo.

521
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,854
Are you really not coming back?

522
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,107
No, never.

523
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,234
But can't you come visit sometime?

524
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,278
You know, at times

525
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,448
you might miss it all so much
and come back in between.

526
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,291
I don't want to.

527
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:21,961
I won't.

528
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,458
-Run!
-What?

529
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,919
Just run! Why aren't you running?

530
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:06,213
Why are you in such a rush?
Okay, I'm coming.

531
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,132
Hurry up if you don't want to die.

532
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,177
-Were you able to hear me?
-No, not at all.

533
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,012
-Why you…
-What's wrong?

534
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,097
You said it'd only be a minute.

535
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,641
Listen.

536
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,686
You said it won't take long.
Do you know how long I waited?

537
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,814
It was because of my boss.
He's got a pretty bad temper.

538
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,816
Let's go. It's my treat.

539
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,901
Really?

540
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:34,825
Thank you.

541
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,295
-But Jang-u.
-Yes?

542
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:49,340
Why did you come back here
after graduating from SNU?

543
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,010
-That's random.
-I just couldn't wrap my head around it.

544
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,805
Well, because I like my hometown.

545
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,850
I mean, I like it here too.

546
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,812
But with your education, isn't it common
to work for a big company in the city?

547
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,898
It was my parents' idea.

548
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,526
They suggested I come back
and work at City Hall.

549
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,738
I didn't see you as the type to dream…

550
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,281
-Small?
-Right.

551
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,075
But for me,

552
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,786
it ensures my happiness.

553
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,081
That ensures your happiness?

554
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,123
That's right.

555
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,669
So let me get this straight.

556
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,546
You're born into this world.

557
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,839
Not of your own will,
but of your parents' will,

558
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,132
you eat, sleep, and study

559
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,969
to become the top student in school
for 12 consecutive years,

560
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,929
then get into Seoul National University.

561
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,265
From there, you don't go out
into the bigger world

562
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:42,017
but return to your hometown
to take the civil service exam

563
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,561
like your parents wanted, then pass it.

564
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,604
Then you're confined
to the City Hall building

565
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,566
to work from nine to six,
then go home to sleep. This life--

566
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,692
Eun-sil.

567
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,152
Well,

568
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,573
it could feel like living
on a treadmill to you

569
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,283
or not mean much.

570
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,368
But to me,

571
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,580
that everyday life means happiness.

572
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,081
What?

573
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,792
Someone might dream of graduating from SNU

574
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,627
and going to space.

575
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,087
But for me,

576
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,550
graduating from SNU,
then having an ordinary daily life,

577
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,219
and living each day one by one…

578
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,763
That's my dream.

579
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,225
I'm happy when I live diligently
in my ordinary life.

580
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:25,644
I tend to know that about myself.

581
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,403
Why didn't you write this in the letter?

582
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,113
What?

583
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,407
Rather than an episode
about how you got bullied,

584
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:43,203
"I know what makes me happy."

585
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,416
I would've liked you better
if you had written that instead.

586
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,922
Is something like that kind of cool?

587
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:54,923
Yes.

588
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:59,136
Not many people in the world know
what makes them happy.

589
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:05,225
So I may have come across
as attractive to you just now, right?

590
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,354
Gosh, I'm hungry.

591
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,858
We just ate and had ice cream for dessert,

592
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,693
but you're hungry? What should we do?

593
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,695
How long is your intestine?

594
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:19,073
Didn't you get
five rounds of food that day?

595
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,033
I didn't know about your good appetite.

596
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,576
The more I know you,
the more I find you my type.

597
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,577
I've fallen for Jang-u.

598
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:25,621
What?

599
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,710
I said I've fallen for you, Jang-u.

600
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,174
Look at you blushing again.

601
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,650
I'm hungry.

602
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,908
-So…
-Hey, so what are we now?

603
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,576
Are we an item?

604
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,663
Where did you learn
to say things like that?

605
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,498
Then are we not labeling it?

606
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,709
-Let's go with "item."
-Right?

607
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,462
Just so you know,
my mom wants me to get married soon.

608
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,048
But you haven't thought
about marrying me yet, have you?

609
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,175
Well, let's take it one step at a time.

610
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,722
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

611
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:35,858
Are you heading out?

612
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,250
Yes, I have a place to be.

613
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,468
It's the anniversary of my mother's death.

614
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,150
I'll get going.

615
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,533
What is it?

616
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,453
No, I just…

617
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:14,706
Just this once.

618
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,086
I want…

619
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,423
to hold you just once.

620
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,345
Can I?

621
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:13,890
It's dark out.

622
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,479
I'm so glad you're here,

623
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,191
Irene.

624
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,031
Hae-won!

625
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,303
Sorry.

626
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,057
I was going to pretend I didn't see you,

627
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,434
but I couldn't after I saw your face.

628
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,441
Sorry. I'd better go.

629
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,238
How long…

630
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:57,994
are you staying this time?

631
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,794
Until when…

632
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:10,465
are you planning to stay?

633
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:54,509
I thought I could forget.

634
00:50:57,345 --> 00:50:58,263
"I'm very certain."

635
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,016
"I only dated you for one winter."

636
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:08,148
"I will completely get over you."

637
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,120
But it was foolish of me
to think this way.

638
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:25,999
Because you're different.

639
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:48,230
You're…

640
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,485
someone who will stay with me,
like the heavy winter snow,

641
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:59,574
and never leave.

642
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,329
I had forgotten that.

643
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:16,091
HYECHEON LAKE SPRING FLOWER TOUR

644
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,191
Did you send me the letters?

645
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:36,945
Yes, I did.

646
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,865
Let me ask you now.

647
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,367
Why did you do that for seven years?

648
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,246
Well,

649
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,041
reading good passages…

650
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,878
makes one feel better.

651
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,722
-Is it too big?
-Everyone's here.

652
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,682
-Yes.
-Hello.

653
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:07,893
-What do you think?
-I want one. Give me one.

654
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,645
This looks pretty. I want this one.

655
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,563
Spring is here.

656
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,820
The weather is very nice.

657
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:20,655
-Right?
-It sure is. It's springtime.

658
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,241
-That's right. Flowers have bloomed.
-Look over there.

659
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,243
-This looks pretty too.
-Leave one for me.

660
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,871
Chief, let's go look at the flowers
in these clothes.

661
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,250
-Ma'am, one soup with rice, please.
-Sure.

662
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,585
We have a new order.

663
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,170
-Coming.
-One soup with rice.

664
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,923
Are the chickens big today?

665
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,008
Yes, we have the best ones.

666
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:51,144
Hello, can I get this one?

667
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:53,897
Yes. Take the freshly made ones instead.

668
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,814
Sure.

669
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,484
Is this for your son?

670
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,446
Do you like him that much?
I can even see it in your eyes.

671
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,740
Your daughter would be upset.

672
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,575
I didn't give birth to him.

673
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:07,077
So?

674
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:12,707
So I wanted to raise him
and my biological child the same way.

675
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,543
I pretended to like him
a lot more on purpose.

676
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,212
So what happened?

677
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,631
I've grown

678
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:22,175
to genuinely love him more.

679
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,886
Goodness.

680
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,849
-Look here.
-What is it?

681
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,353
My son made this for me.

682
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:35,021
DEAR MRS. YOON YEO-JEONG
THE MOM I LOVE

683
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,690
"Dove"?

684
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,942
It says, "love."

685
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,319
Goodness.

686
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,946
It says he loves me.

687
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:43,863
Lucky you!

688
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,455
-Hurry up, will you?
-Okay.

689
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,041
Are you going to stay up all night?
Come plant potatoes.

690
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,636
Goodness.

691
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,599
Hey, do you have a lot left to do there?

692
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,892
I have a long way to go.

693
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,186
But we are meeting
at the billiard club later.

694
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,272
-You think we can make it?
-We should go.

695
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,151
I'll pull an all-nighter if I have to,
to get this done and go.

696
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,986
What's the point if we can't make it?

697
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,196
-Hurry up, will you?
-All right.

698
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:26,906
Goodness.

699
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,908
THE HEART THAT IS LEFT UNTIL THE END

700
00:55:30,744 --> 00:55:32,245
The other day, Hae-won told me…

701
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,414
about happiness.

702
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,338
She said it is hard
to notice happiness on your own.

703
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:48,678
Even if you do, it takes a lot of work

704
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,805
and effort to make it yours.

705
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,060
She's right.

706
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,854
WE SAT FACE TO FACE…

707
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:02,108
All of us try hard to become happy.

708
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,818
WE SAT FACE TO FACE
SMILING AND TALKING UNDER THAT TREE

709
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,072
Happiness becomes yours…

710
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,575
only after you have struggled
and strived for it,

711
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,620
and it does not stay without effort.

712
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:20,794
Goodness.

713
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,466
Even if you put in a lot of time and work,

714
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,719
things might not work out.

715
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:33,556
-Make me some coffee.
-Coffee?

716
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,725
Coffee?

717
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,394
Okay, I'll make one right now.

718
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,230
-Can I take off my jacket first?
-Okay.

719
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,857
One, two, three.

720
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,950
Okay. Let's go get a cup.

721
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,621
-This one?
-Yes.

722
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,280
However,

723
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,324
no one knows what the future holds.

Out of my way!

726
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:36,995
Out of my way!

727
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,123
If we keep moving forward nonstop,

728
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,668
Im Hwi!

729
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:48,256
Hi, I'm "Im" like important,
and "Hwi" like the sound of a whistle.

730
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,382
Want to bike together?

731
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,676
Let's be friends!

732
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:54,095
Wait up!

733
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,143
…keep trying,

734
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:09,486
THE WEATHER IS NICE, BO-YEONG

735
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,076
and keep living,

736
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:33,801
I believe…

737
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,431
the day will come.

738
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:48,650
Yes, I also believe…

Hae-won.

741
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,397
…such a day will come.

742
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:32,944
-Like that.
-Like that.

BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

744
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,562
POSTED BY SEOP

745
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:12,483
I met Irene again after a long time.

746
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:17,488
I waited and longed to see her so much,

747
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,950
but I kept my feelings to myself
as I gazed at her,

748
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,493
then stupidly turned away.

749
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:27,415
Yet, she came running into my arms.

750
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:32,420
It melted my frozen heart once again.

751
01:00:33,379 --> 01:00:37,592
I had spent days with my mind blank.
Sleepless nights were back in my life.

752
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:42,430
I can't believe these moments
are now all behind me again.

753
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:44,724
It's late at night.

754
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:47,518
She's had a tiring day
and has fallen asleep in my arms.

755
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:52,565
She is light and has a pleasant scent,
like grass in the spring breeze.

756
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,402
Dear all, the air is filled
with the scent of acacias in full bloom.

757
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,528
Roger.

758
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,282
PS: She was half asleep
when she opened her eyes to kiss my nose

759
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,744
and went back to sleep with her head
buried in my chest. It feels too nice.

760
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:18,716
Happiness is as such.

761
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:24,180
It's hard work.

762
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:29,227
But you

763
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,854
opened your eyes this morning

764
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,190
to start the day

765
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:36,984
and live today doing your part.

766
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,028
That's enough.

767
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:44,033
When it's so difficult to find happiness,

768
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:48,788
your work

769
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:54,085
is giving happiness to someone.

770
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:59,173
We are all appreciated by someone

771
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:01,926
as we help others find happiness

772
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,178
without even knowing it.

773
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,639
For simply continuing to live on

774
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:09,016
from wherever you may be,

775
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:14,147
you have done a great job.

776
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:19,110
I'm grateful to you.

777
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:26,200
I sincerely wish you a good night.

778
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:31,956
