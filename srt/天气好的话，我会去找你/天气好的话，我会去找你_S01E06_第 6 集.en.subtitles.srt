1
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,546
Hey, give me the ball!

2
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,386
Hae-won, take these to the gym for me.

3
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,723
Hey, don't play with the ball
in the hallway!

4
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,977
Hey, no dismissal meeting!
We can just go home!

5
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,439
-All right!
-Let's go!

6
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,217
Look who it is.

7
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,803
It's Mok Hae-won.

8
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,855
Do you know me?

9
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
You got tricked, you fools!

10
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,244
-Hey!
-Darn it.

11
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,053
Look who it is.

12
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,223
It's Mok Hae-won.

13
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,770
You're…

14
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,280
I got lost.

15
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,449
Where is the town hall?

16
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,451
It's not over here.

17
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,495
I see.

18
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,122
Then which way?

19
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,460
I'll show you. Come with me.

20
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,312
Hae-won! Mok Hae-won!

21
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,523
What? Choi Yeong-hun asked you out?

22
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,944
-Yes.
-So? What did you say?

23
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,489
What? But he's pretty decent.

24
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,909
His dad is a doctor
at Hyecheon Municipal Hospital.

25
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:03,910
A department head.

26
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,080
You really know everything, don't you?

27
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,959
Do you know about
the top three of our school?

28
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,835
-Top three?
-Yes.

29
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,546
Choi Yeong-hun is number three among them.

30
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,173
You rejected quite a good catch.

31
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,802
He didn't seem that great.

32
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,804
Don't you want to know
who the top two are?

33
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,806
-Not really.
-Come on.

34
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,558
You should still remember it.
It's a must-know.

35
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,978
First of all, he's number two.

36
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,564
-Lee Jang-u.
-Hello, sir.

37
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,401
He's the school president
and always gets the highest grades.

38
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,944
His father is a city councilman.

39
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:40,238
I see.

40
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,782
Hey, isn't this interesting?

41
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,117
No, not really.

42
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,660
Not really?

43
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,412
I think it totally is. Come on.

44
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,581
Well, then let me tell you
who number one is.

45
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,542
He's always around here.

46
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,503
Over there. There he is.

47
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,841
-You little…
-Hit him there.

48
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,552
He's a little scary.

49
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,679
Isn't he? I'm a little scared of him too.

50
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,973
But he's number one.
His name is Oh Yeong-woo.

51
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,184
Oh, right. He transferred from Seoul too.

52
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,894
He became number one immediately.

53
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,897
I don't really know what his parents do.

54
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,400
But what's important is
that he's incredibly handsome.

55
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,236
-Is it good?
-Yes.

56
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:24,866
Well, anyway,
I have a crush on someone else.

57
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,243
Really? Who is it?

58
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,122
Come on. Tell me.

59
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,624
-It's a secret.
-Seriously?

60
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,795
Be patient. I'll tell you later.

61
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,965
Forget it. I don't want to know anymore.

62
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,425
Hey, are you mad at me?

63
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,342
Why would I be?

64
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,306
Hey, Mok Hae-won!

65
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,023
Let's go.

66
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,654
Hey, Mok Hae-won!

67
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,216
-Yes, it's true.
-Really?

68
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,134
-Yes, it is.
-Are you serious?

69
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,224
Hey, Mok Hae-won!

70
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,731
Who keeps calling you?

71
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,735
I have no idea. What the heck?

72
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,530
-It happened before too, right?
-Yes.

73
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,202
-Bo-yeong, did you do the ethics homework?
-No.

74
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,537
-Did you?
-Yes, here.

75
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,247
Mok Hae-won! He wants to see you.

76
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:56,541
-Who?
-Oh Yeong-woo.

77
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,417
-You punk.
-Ouch! Hey!

78
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,753
Oh Yeong-woo? That Oh Yeong-woo?

79
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,548
The number one guy in our school?
Why would he?

80
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,049
Why?

81
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,801
It beats me.

82
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:09,971
This is insane.

83
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,692
DO NOT ENTER

84
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,027
-Let me have some.
-Let go.

85
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,238
-But I paid for it.
-It's still mine.

86
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,573
-Hey.
-That hurts.

87
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:29,991
You punk.

88
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,909
-Hey, Mok Hae-won's here.
-Give it to me.

89
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,077
You came.

90
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,329
-Give it to me.
-Did you have to take that?

91
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,415
-I said give me one.
-Give me one, man.

92
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,499
Come up here.

93
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,669
-I won't let you slide.
-Give me one.

94
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,171
-Ten won.
-No way.

95
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,839
-For a second.
-Give me 50 won.

96
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,424
-Is she from Seoul?
-Just one.

97
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,758
-You jerk.
-No thanks.

98
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,844
-Aren't you coming?
-Come on.

99
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,679
You have no shame.

100
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,892
Take this one then.

101
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,603
-Give me that.
-Don't come near me.

102
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,812
Hey.

103
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,231
Hey, Hae-won!

104
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:06,819
Hey!

105
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,997
Come on, quickly.
So what did Yeong-woo say?

106
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,707
Well…

107
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,584
My bus is here. I have to go.

108
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,252
-I'll call you.
-Bye.

109
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,813
What's up with him?

110
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,107
I thought he was interested in you.

111
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,572
I don't think so. He was never interested.

112
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,366
What? He totally was.

113
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,159
He kept asking to see you, didn't he?

114
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,077
Let's just go.

115
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,998
He's so annoying.

116
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,559
Hey, Im Eun-seop!

117
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,270
Are you going home?

118
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,939
Hey!

119
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,440
Wait up, Im Eun-seop!

120
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,485
What's wrong with him?

121
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,741
Hey, Eun-seop.

122
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,078
My mom keeps telling me to get married.

123
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,957
But I'm only 18 years old.
Does it make sense to you?

124
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,167
I get that she wants
grandkids soon, but still.

125
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,463
She wants me to get married
as soon as I enter college.

126
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:53,509
And have lots of kids as soon as possible.

127
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,137
You know my mom's dream
is to become a grandma, right?

128
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,890
I understand, but I'm still a teenager.

129
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,684
Don't you think my mom is ridiculous?

130
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,185
My goodness. Hey.

131
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,103
What's wrong?

132
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,564
Actually…

133
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,608
You go ahead, okay?

134
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,651
Hey, Eun-seop.

135
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,446
Eun-seop, this bike is yours!

136
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,201
But I don't know how to ride a bike.

137
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,455
What do I do?

138
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,762
Is it fixed now?

139
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:38,679
I'm not sure.

140
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:41,349
Hurry up.

141
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,232
I think it's fixed.

142
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,318
Is it?

143
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,077
It's working.

144
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,793
Thank you.

145
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,338
What's wrong?

146
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,435
I guess Oh Yeong-woo
is here for the reunion.

147
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,020
Right.

148
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,902
A lot of people seem to be coming here.

149
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,696
Yes, probably.

150
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,743
The bookstore will get busy too.

151
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,246
I know.

152
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,793
-Good night.
-Thanks, you too.

153
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,741
Hey, Kwon Hyeon-ji!

154
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:24,618
Kwon Hyeon-ji.

155
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,125
Hey, I've decided.

156
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,376
What is it this time?

157
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,462
I'm giving up on Kim Yeong-su.

158
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,464
Sure, whatever.

159
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,633
I'm dead serious.
I'm really going to give up on him.

160
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,261
What made you change your mind
all of a sudden?

161
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,348
When the bully
was about to beat me up yesterday,

162
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,685
Kim Yeong-su showed up
out of nowhere and saved me.

163
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,897
Wouldn't that make you like him even more?

164
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,275
What? Hey, my pride is my everything.

165
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,486
-What the heck are you talking about?
-Only I.

166
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,155
-Only I can save myself.
-Nonsense.

167
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,284
Anyway, cheer me up later
at the claw machine arcade, okay?

168
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,620
The claw machine arcade?
Who goes there nowadays?

169
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,372
Outcasts don't follow trends, you know?

170
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,874
WELCOME TO HYECHEON HIGH SCHOOL
50TH ANNIVERSARY ALL-CLASS REUNION

171
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,084
It's boring to live in the countryside.

172
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,589
From spring and summer to fall and winter,

173
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:22,092
only the same things happen
throughout all four seasons.

174
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,427
-That hurts.
-Right there.

175
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,055
You see the same people.

176
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,515
His back is acting up again.

177
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,934
-I'll do it.
-I'm not very good at this.

178
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,393
There you go.

179
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,520
Don't exaggerate, man.

180
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,148
This small country town
gets lively and exciting

181
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,067
twice a year.

182
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,068
Take it only when it hurts.

183
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,197
It's around Lunar New Year's Day
and Chuseok.

184
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,452
-Geun-sang!
-Eun-seok!

185
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,329
Only during those times,

186
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,791
people visit the countryside
from other places.

187
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,838
It's not even Lunar New Year's
or Chuseok yet.

188
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,884
But as you can see,
the town feels quite lively.

189
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,928
HYECHEON, SEOUL

190
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,806
The all-class reunion.
Just because of that.

191
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,101
You can take it now.

192
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,231
PHARMACY

193
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:20,526
But you can't keep going on like this.

194
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:24,572
You should go to the hospital
and get a proper diagnosis.

195
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,575
You have to find out
why you keep getting such headaches.

196
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,955
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

197
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,375
By the way, are you going to the reunion?

198
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,419
You went to that school too.

199
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,504
Yes, I did.

200
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,007
But I'm not going to the reunion.

201
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,924
Why not?

202
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,844
I heard that you were
quite popular in school.

203
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,596
I heard it through the grapevine.

204
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,976
A popular girl's decline into misery
is nothing to be showing off about.

205
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:01,108
I think reunions are

206
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,193
better suited for people like them.

207
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,614
I don't know how they used to be,

208
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,282
but in any case,

209
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,035
they're successful now.

210
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,888
RECIPIENT: SIM MYEONG-JU

211
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,807
How is it that you have these?

212
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:38,646
She didn't know your address,
so she asked me…

213
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,440
to return them to you.

214
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,901
I see.

215
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,699
By any chance…

216
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,202
did she say anything else?

217
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,581
I have a message for him as well.
Should I tell you?

218
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,459
No. I don't think I can relay it.

219
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,588
No.

220
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,174
She didn't.

221
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,385
I see.

222
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:11,929
Well…

223
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,476
She did say she wanted me
to relay a message.

224
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,728
It's nothing nice, is it?

225
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,065
Of course not.

226
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:26,902
Well…

227
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,367
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

228
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,416
You shouldn't apologize.

229
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,836
Thank you for delivering these to me.

230
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,296
Then…

231
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,507
take care.

232
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,550
Bye, sir.

233
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,859
I saw you as I was passing by.

234
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,111
Can I sit?

235
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,782
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

236
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,551
What are you doing here?

237
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,388
Do you live here?

238
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,226
No, I don't. I live in the Walnut House--

239
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,143
I know.

240
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,526
Can I have some coffee?

241
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,944
Yes, sure.

242
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,287
Are you here to buy books?

243
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,667
No.

244
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,626
Then…

245
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,003
Wait, how do I do this?

246
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,176
Wrong one.

247
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,431
Maybe not that one.

248
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,225
You don't know how, do you?

249
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,604
Well, I'm not the one
who usually makes coffee.

250
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,606
Then go have a seat.

251
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:03,118
What are you doing here then?

252
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,704
Why are you here if you don't live here?

253
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,290
I work here.

254
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,544
So why…

255
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,358
What's this?

256
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,275
My number.

257
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:37,361
Save it.

258
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,280
But I don't have a cell phone.

259
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:42,866
What?

260
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,118
I threw it away.

261
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,039
You threw it away?

262
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,457
Yes.

263
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,670
You didn't actually come here
to give me this, did you?

264
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,466
-I did.
-What?

265
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,427
I did come to give you that.

266
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,682
To give this…

267
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,810
To give this to me?

268
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,605
You're still the same, Mok Hae-won.

269
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,691
What?

270
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:17,901
I'm still the same too.

271
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,827
Everything about me is the same too.

272
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,330
What's the same?

273
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,252
The way I feel.

274
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,675
I'll get going.
Give it some thought and call me.

275
00:21:58,942 --> 00:21:59,776
Let's go skate.

276
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,654
Let's go quickly. It's so cold.

277
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,576
Eun-seop! Why did you come so late?
It's so busy today.

278
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,953
Do you see my frozen face?
Park and come quickly.

279
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,371
Let's go.

280
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,248
What's your shoe size? 220mm?

281
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,458
Hwi!

282
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,585
-You're going to be very tall.
-Hwi, hurry up!

283
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,422
Come quickly, honey. Can you help me?

284
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,716
People are waiting. Hurry.

285
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,302
Okay, I'll be right there.

286
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,804
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

287
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,686
You're back.

288
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,521
How were things today?

289
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,231
We had three customers.

290
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:39,900
Really?

291
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,945
We should thank Lee Jang-u.

292
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,655
They were all visitors to our town.

293
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,825
I never knew a single event
would bring so many people.

294
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,953
I know.
The ice rink was very crowded today too.

295
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,332
Go upstairs first and rest.
I'll wrap it up.

296
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:56,875
You must be hungry.

297
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,922
I'm going home today, though.

298
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,175
Oh, right.

299
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:11,223
Thank you for everything.

300
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,975
I'll head out now.

301
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,730
Okay.

302
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,774
See you.

303
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,240
It's dark.

304
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,749
I'll carry that.

305
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,525
I'll go in, then.

306
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,863
Okay. Here.

307
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,573
Thanks.

308
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:35,867
See you later.

309
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,246
Good night.

310
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,206
I'm home.

311
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,879
THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY
HYECHEON HIGH SCHOOL

312
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,551
-Hello.
-He's here!

313
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,220
-My goodness!
-You're here!

314
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,554
It's been so long!

315
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,098
-Hello.
-How have you been?

316
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,557
My goodness.

317
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,185
Please stop!

318
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:09,896
Hello.

319
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,732
Come on, this way.

320
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,567
Let's go.

321
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,405
Come on, Mom.
Get me a padded coat, please?

322
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,824
-No.
-Come on, Mom.

323
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:23,118
I need that to get good grades, you know?

324
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,288
I don't care what it is.
I can't get it for you today.

325
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,083
Gosh, why not?

326
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,877
I'm busy today.

327
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,171
It's an important day, okay?

328
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,024
Anyway, why is this necessary?

329
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,903
Ask Lee Jang-u.
He's the one who planned it.

330
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,823
What's the point of gathering people
who have already graduated?

331
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,032
What is there to do?

332
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:07,120
As for me, I'm going to look stunning

333
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,913
when we have our reunion later.

334
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,415
So that Yeong-su would say,

335
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,626
"It's Im Hwi. 'Im' like important,
and 'Hwi' like the sound of a whistle."

336
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,463
"I finally realized how pretty she is
after all these years."

337
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:20,425
"I should've been nicer to her then.
Should I approach her now at least?"

338
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,219
When he starts talking to me,
I'll turn him down right away.

339
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,721
Sounds like you really gave up on him.

340
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,432
Isn't that what reunions are all about?

341
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,851
You reunite with the people from your past

342
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,936
and bring back your old feelings.

343
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,647
"Oh, my. You're pretty great."
"Oh, my. You too."

344
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,108
"What about that café?
Isn't it pretty great too?"

345
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,819
That's exactly the type of café
that our pop-up will be.

346
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,946
So if they spend money there…

347
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,910
You brought the tablecloths, right?
You didn't forget, did you?

348
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,829
Of course, I brought them.
Stop spewing nonsense.

349
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,623
Why didn't I bring them?

350
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,916
What should I do? I'm screwed.

351
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,417
I'll be right back.

352
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,543
My goodness!

353
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,003
Hey, come on!

354
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,178
Hey, Mom.

355
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,975
Ask Bo-guk to do it.
I told you I'm going to my reunion today.

356
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,687
I'm going home just to change.

357
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,689
Bo-guk's always bumming around. Why do I…

358
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,375
Tonight at ten,

359
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,377
the Hyecheon High School all-class reunion

360
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,878
will be held in the schoolyard.

361
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,214
To our very first alumni event,

362
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,508
we invite all alumni
of Hyecheon High School.

363
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,219
Please make sure to attend
and honor us with your presence.

364
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,263
GASIGOGI
NOVEL BY CHO CHANG-IN

365
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,849
RECIPIENT: SIM MYEONG-JU

366
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:02,235
"Somewhere in the Andes Mountains,
there is a mountain called Baldemir."

367
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,908
"On the summer solstice,

368
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,703
men and women of a tribe nearby

369
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,914
climb to the top of Mount Baldemir."

370
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,708
One more time.

371
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,172
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

372
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,846
WELCOME TO THE HYECHEON HIGH SCHOOL
50TH ANNIVERSARY ALL-CLASS REUNION

373
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:34,100
CAMPING IN THE PITCH-BLACK NIGHT

374
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,935
ALL-CLASS REUNION COMMEMORATIVE GIFT

375
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,023
21ST TO 23RD CLASS ALUMNI,
24TH TO 27TH CLASS ALUMNI

376
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,110
Please put it here.

377
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,204
You can put it right there. Thank you.

378
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:59,208
No, that doesn't go here.
Over there, please.

379
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,509
Sir, can I check that lighting?

380
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,219
Please turn it off,

381
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,221
then back on.

382
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,351
Great, thank you.

383
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,728
Wait!

384
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,402
"If you arrive at the top
before twilight is over

385
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,948
and confess your love upon it…

386
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:38,247
they believe that love will
always come true."

387
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,217
"If that were true,

388
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,219
love is

389
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,347
a rather simple thing."

390
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,682
"Don't you think?"

391
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,664
Aunt.

392
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,001
Aunt!

393
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,378
Aren't you going to the reunion?

394
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,213
No, I'm not.

395
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,216
-How about you?
-I'll go see

396
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,261
my friends and Eun-seop.
It's been a while.

397
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,179
Sure, okay.

398
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,976
Hold on.

399
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:23,895
How pretty.

400
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,396
I always am.

401
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,482
-I meant your earrings.
-What?

402
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,442
And your necklace.

403
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,235
What the heck?

404
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,153
See you.

405
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,113
Bye.

406
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,435
Let's go together.

407
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,963
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

408
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,757
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

409
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,009
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

410
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,845
-Welcome!
-Hello!

411
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,930
-Hello.
-Welcome.

412
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,266
-Welcome.
-Hello.

413
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,809
-Welcome.
-Have a great time.

414
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,772
HYECHEON HIGH SCHOOL

415
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,239
How have you been?

416
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:02,952
Thank you.

417
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,791
-Cheers.
-Yes, let's have a drink.

418
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,627
What took you so long?

419
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,008
Hey, I told you not to drink.

420
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,426
But it's a special occasion--

421
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,303
Don't drink. You have to drive.

422
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:23,139
-Why did you come?
-Because I live here. Why else?

423
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,223
I live here too.

424
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,393
-Long time no see.
-My goodness. How have you been?

425
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,644
Look who is here.

426
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,897
-Is everything well?
-Look who is here. Sun-ae!

427
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,023
So good to see you.

428
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,318
21ST TO 23RD CLASS ALUMNI

429
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,239
-My goodness, Su-jeong.
-Su-jeong!

430
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,866
-I can't believe it.
-My goodness.

431
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,826
-Hey.
-So good to see you.

432
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,455
You'll never have to change it
for the rest of your life.

433
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,082
Do you know what this is called?

434
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,083
-What is it called?
-What is it called?

435
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,960
"Edison's mistake."

436
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,146
Testing. Hello.

437
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,149
Dear Hyecheon High School alumni
who I respect and am proud of

438
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,777
and my dear classmates who I love.

439
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,694
Nice to see you all.

440
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,571
My name is Lee Jang-u,

441
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,323
a graduate of the 42nd class.

442
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,247
Please start gathering around.

443
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,792
You see that the schoolyard
is divided into different sections, right?

444
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,544
So where do you stand? Wherever you wish.

445
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:39,006
You can stand wherever you'd like
with your friends.

446
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,049
Everyone's gathered now,

447
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,927
so we'll get started
with the all-class reunion.

448
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,554
First of all,
I'd like to thank everyone here

449
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,473
for joining the all-class reunion

450
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,142
to celebrate
Hyecheon High School's 50th anniversary.

451
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,479
The first alumni night event,
"Camping in the Pitch-black Night."

452
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,648
As you can see,
it's decorated like a camping site.

453
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,943
We hope you enjoy good food and company.

454
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,821
In the building, the current students
have set up a café for drinks

455
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,198
and an exhibition
of the old graduation photos.

456
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,617
So I hope you enjoy
walking down memory lane.

457
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,997
In addition, at midnight,

458
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,207
the city of Hyecheon wants to welcome you

459
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,584
by turning off the lights
for about ten seconds.

460
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,545
You'll be able to enjoy
the magnificent sight

461
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,171
of the entire city going pitch-dark.

462
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,424
I heard it through the grapevine

463
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,677
that blowing out a candle in the dark
will make your wish come true.

464
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,929
If you make a wish
in that moment in the dark,

465
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,433
perhaps your wish would come true
when the lights come back on.

466
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,768
-No way!
-Whatever!

467
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,895
-I don't think so!
-I doubt that!

468
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,398
I'll take that as encouragement.
Please enjoy.

469
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,614
Hey, Im Eun-seop.

470
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,158
Did you see? Oh Yeong-woo's here too.

471
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,579
-Yes.
-He showed up with Mok Hae-won. Ta-da.

472
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,123
What? You didn't know?

473
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,126
They haven't seen each other for a while.

474
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,463
Does it bother you?

475
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:01,881
No.

476
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,799
-That's beer, right?
-Yes.

477
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,054
This is really fascinating.

478
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,513
Ten years have gone by.

479
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,892
Some who used to be great
aren't all that anymore

480
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,480
and some who used to be a bit lacking
are quite successful now.

481
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,691
-Then the tables should turn, right?
-Yes.

482
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,693
But it's not like that at all.
Why is that?

483
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,322
No matter how much time goes by…

484
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,366
Get your own bottle, man.

485
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,705
You drank it all.

486
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,509
Yeong-woo, come hang out with us too.

487
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,345
-Darn you, man. You're so mean.
-I'll be right back.

488
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,138
How can you do this to us?

489
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,681
Mok Hae-won.

490
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,476
Hey, you look so stunning.

491
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,604
You came with Oh Yeong-woo. What's up?

492
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,523
He came by to pick me up.

493
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,901
I have to say, he's still the same.

494
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,611
But he didn't say much, did he?

495
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,949
I think he has a knack
for things like that.

496
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,327
"Hey, follow me."

497
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,995
-"Follow me."
-Min Ji-yeon! Mok Hae-won!

498
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,622
Hey, it's been so long.

499
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,332
Look at you, Ji Eun-sil.

500
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,710
Hey, did you see Lee Jang-u?

501
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,670
-Lee Jang-u?
-Yes.

502
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,755
Don't mention him. It irritates me.

503
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,467
See? Lee Jang-u is the one
who liked Ji Eun-sil.

504
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,471
How is that he insists
Ji Eun-sil liked him?

505
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,098
I don't get it.

506
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:36,475
Hey.

507
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,563
Seems like they still don't like you.

508
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,314
So childish. What's wrong with them?

509
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,899
They were childish back then too.

510
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,317
Was that in your junior year?

511
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,653
-Yes.
-That's right.

512
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,030
They were so mean to you for two months.

513
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,491
Talk about holding a grudge.

514
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:57,163
But Bo-yeong says she wants to resolve
the misunderstanding between you guys.

515
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,999
She doesn't know when to stop, does she?

516
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,459
Do you want to go get coffee?

517
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:02,793
Yes, sounds good.

518
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,129
-Let's go.
-He was totally curious.

519
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:08,549
Everyone's single.

520
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,885
-Hey!
-I'm a ghost.

521
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,470
That's insane!

522
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,221
It's so great.

523
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,849
Everyone, come play balloon darts!

524
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,602
Come on, everyone.

525
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,520
Who put all these together?

526
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,438
Lee Jang-u.

527
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,858
Wait. It's the owner of the lighting shop.

528
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,067
He hasn't changed a bit!

529
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,527
He does look chubbier, though.

530
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,947
Hey, your aunt's picture is here too.
Sim Myeong-yeo, right?

531
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,950
She was so pretty.

532
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,494
Your aunt was insanely pretty.

533
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,120
You're right.

534
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,831
Madam Quilt is here too.

535
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,042
Why is Aunt Su-jeong called that?

536
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,960
Because she makes quilts
and sells them sometimes.

537
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,631
Hey, you're all screwed.

538
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,842
-I found our class.
-What?

539
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:53,928
Look at this.

540
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,639
It's Mok Hae-won, Min Ji-yeon,

541
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,556
and me.

542
00:41:58,599 --> 00:41:59,433
Where is Jang-u?

543
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:00,851
He wasn't in our class.

544
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:02,520
Which class was Eun-seop in?

545
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,313
What?

546
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,942
-What?
-Eun-seop was in our class.

547
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,610
You don't care, do you?

548
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,821
I know. Poor Im Eun-seop.

549
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,949
He had such a meager presence.

550
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,743
I thought he was in our class
only during junior year.

551
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,912
He was in our class
during the senior year too.

552
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,290
I don't think he was
in the graduation photo.

553
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,833
He wasn't there that day.

554
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,834
I remember.

555
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,462
Right. He rarely came to school
during the senior year.

556
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:31,382
-Did he?
-Yes.

557
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,800
-Girls!
-You startled me!

558
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,594
Please come in
and spend some money at our café.

559
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,764
-This way.
-What are you doing here?

560
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,350
Me? I'm making money. Come on in.

561
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,769
Please spend a lot. Come in.

562
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,522
You're all grown-up now.

563
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,197
Everyone hasn't changed at all.

564
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:56,907
Even after eleven years.

565
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,742
You haven't changed at all either.

566
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,703
I'm still very handsome.

567
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,789
HYECHEON PHOTO STUDIO,
BOARD GAMES, FACE PAINTING

568
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,882
It's bothering you.

569
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,260
-Nonsense.
-It's bothering you.

570
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,721
-Don't be ridiculous.
-I think it's bothering you.

571
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,401
-What do you mean, why?
-Just because.

572
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,862
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

573
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,531
Wait. Hae-won, where are you going?
I brought out a dish.

574
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,532
Although it's not free.

575
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,034
Just stepping out.

576
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,078
By the way, your brother didn't come?

577
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:45,039
Eun-seop? I haven't seen him.

578
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,958
Really? Good luck with your business.

579
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:48,876
-Wait…
-Good luck.

580
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,485
I actually don't like this town.

581
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:06,198
Weird things keep coming to mind here.

582
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:08,867
Like what?

583
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,875
My scary father.

584
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,800
I came because of you.

585
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,677
Just to see you.

586
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:32,849
I feel so honored.

587
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,143
Thanks for acknowledging it.

588
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,487
Frankly…

589
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,781
I didn't like this town either.

590
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,036
I was an outcast, remember?

591
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,665
To me, this town always felt like…

592
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:00,294
winter.

593
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,018
DO NOT ENTER

594
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,899
I was so afraid of that sign
when we were young.

595
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,444
Why were you afraid of that?

596
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,072
If I were to go into that area,

597
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,950
I thought I'd turn into
that kind of person.

598
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,578
"That kind of person."

599
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,206
You're that kind of person, right?

600
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,125
DO NOT ENTER

601
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:42,044
It seemed like

602
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,505
we lived in different worlds.

603
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,345
"Different worlds."

604
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,098
In any case,

605
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,142
you saved me back then.

606
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:05,025
-I did?
-Yes, you did.

607
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:37,307
Did you know that there's a flower
that only blooms in the fall?

608
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,519
No, I didn't.

609
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,731
I read it in a book once.

610
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,610
There's a flower which blooms
very briefly only in the fall.

611
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,246
-Let's go.
-Yes.

612
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,164
Have a seat over there.

613
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,675
Let's eat.

614
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,253
This was the only seat left.

615
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,387
In those days,

616
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,185
what you meant to me
who was like a dry desert…

617
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,858
Why is he sitting there?

618
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:12,027
-Are they going out?
-No way.

619
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,154
Do you know anything?

620
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:15,572
Of course not.

621
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,248
Hey, Hae-won.

622
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:27,334
I hear you're dating Oh Yeong-woo.

623
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:29,920
I'm not.

624
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,048
Are you guys just friends then?

625
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:37,260
We're not friends.

626
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,972
Do you want to go into town later?

627
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,935
You transferred from Seoul, right?

628
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:47,103
You must have good taste.

629
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,356
I want to go too.

630
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,233
Let's go together then.

631
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:53,735
There's a new tteokbokki shop
in Bukhyun-ri.

632
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,779
-Want to go there?
-Yes, I love tteokbokki.

633
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,990
Hae-won, do you like tteokbokki?

634
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:01,743
I do.

635
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,161
-Let's go.
-Let's go together.

636
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,621
I want to eat blood sausage too.

637
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:06,832
Come on, let's go.

638
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:25,183
A flower that only used to bloom
very briefly in the fall.

639
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:43,118
But you came into my life
in those desert-like days…

640
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,686
The thing is that I didn't realize it
looking at it from afar.

641
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:13,023
But when I looked at it closely,
it said, "The South Face."

642
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,900
-What?
-Did you see it?

643
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,611
It said, "The South." What a patriot.

644
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,905
He was being obnoxious about it.

645
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,698
I saw it.

646
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,199
It said, "The South Faith"!

647
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,536
"Faith."

648
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,789
…and I became a garden.

649
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,503
How is that possible?

650
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,381
We were…

651
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,259
only eighteen back then.

652
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,178
That's why it was possible.

653
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,852
The lights-out ceremony
with the City of Hyecheon will begin soon.

654
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:55,231
Please gather in the schoolyard to watch
the lights-out ceremony.

655
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,944
And as I mentioned earlier,
if you make a wish during the ceremony…

656
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,405
Who knows?

657
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,991
Your wish might come true
after the lights turn back on.

658
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,621
Mok Hae-won.

659
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,375
To tell you the truth, I…

660
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,463
Whatever kind of feelings
you have for me right now,

661
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,883
I don't want to know.
It doesn't matter to me.

662
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,055
Why doesn't it matter?

663
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:36,898
Do you have someone you like?

664
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:43,989
It seems like you do.

665
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,961
There's a warm person.

666
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,174
A warm person?

667
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:04,676
Yes.

668
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,637
When I'm with him,

669
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:11,725
he warms me up like a kettle on a stove.

670
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,642
He warms you up?

671
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,478
Yes.

672
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,738
Actually,

673
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,323
I didn't even realize that I was cold.

674
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:32,287
But it hit me when I went back home.

675
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:36,666
That I've been…

676
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,502
feeling very cold.

677
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:44,049
Hey, Mok Hae-won!

678
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,426
Come. Let's go to the lights-off ceremony.

679
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,470
Okay, I'll meet you there.

680
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,221
Okay.

681
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:51,848
Isn't that Oh Yeong-woo?

682
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,517
It's him, isn't it?

683
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:58,813
Anyway, if I were to see you again,
I really wanted to say thank you.

684
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,193
Thank you, Yeong-woo.

685
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:08,198
Sure.

686
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,659
Aren't you going to the ceremony?

687
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,455
-I don't think I'm going.
-No?

688
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:18,500
Well, then…

689
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,669
I'll get going.

690
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,335
It's dark.

691
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,190
Actually,

692
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,609
I didn't even realize that I was cold.

693
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,451
But it hit me when I went back home.

694
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,372
I'm home.

695
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,001
That I've been…

696
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,128
feeling very cold.

697
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,437
The lights will be turned off
in ten seconds.

698
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,064
Let's start the countdown.

699
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:48,816
Ten.

700
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,901
Hae-won!

701
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,487
Nine.

702
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:56,241
Eight.

703
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:00,537
Seven.

704
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,873
Willow leaves, right?

705
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,255
It's pretty.

706
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:13,258
They're shoes.
I don't want you to wear those.

707
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,593
-Why not?
-"Why not?"

708
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,889
Because we're in the countryside, and…

709
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,350
and the roads are a bit rough too.

710
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,647
Hae-won.

711
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,194
How about we do something
that will lift your mood?

712
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:42,555
Is something…

713
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,932
wrong?

714
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,100
Two.

715
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,354
One. Lights out.

716
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,329
I like you.

717
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:14,629
I like you, Eun-seop.

718
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:57,338
BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

719
01:01:57,422 --> 01:01:59,757
POSTED BY SEOP

720
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:04,345
Tonight, I want to read a book
written by an unknown author.

721
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,014
The precious stories
that you feel bad reading

722
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,892
since we can't pay royalties
to unknown authors.

723
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:14,939
Anonymous works will continue
to be published even in the future

724
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:16,482
as long as we keep forgetting,

725
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,235
and the sense of loss
from forgetting exists.

726
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:24,449
Gosh, I'm actually a little out of it.
I've been on cloud nine all day.

727
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:30,455
I want to say something,
but I need to give it some thought first.

728
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,170
What exactly did I do wrong?

729
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,714
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

730
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:42,049
What's wrong with confessing
your feelings to someone you like?

731
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:43,760
You probably know, Jang-u.

732
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,429
Why Eun-seop wasn't
in the graduation photo.

733
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:49,807
What's more, I think he disappeared
for around three years.

734
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,684
I said he disappeared.

735
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,478
I can't reach him either!

736
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:54,771
Eun-seop!

737
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:57,315
This just reminds me of that time.

738
01:02:57,398 --> 01:02:59,567
When Eun-seop disappeared

739
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,569
and came back long after.

740
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:08,993
