1
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,743
-Let's do it!
-No, I'm okay.

2
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,369
Please, just this once.

3
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,331
You really don't want to?
When it's with me?

4
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,540
But you said you use a hot iron.

5
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,959
No. That was clearly a joke.
Did you believe that?

6
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,588
-Hang on.
-Let's do it. I'll draw something cute.

7
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,048
Or else I'll really get mad.

8
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,008
Okay, fine.

9
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,760
Where should I draw it?

10
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,889
-Something cute?
-How about making coffee first?

11
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,098
-Coffee?
-I want a cup.

12
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,308
Why all of a sudden?

13
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,435
-I always drink it.
-I'll let you drink after.

14
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:06,084
But Mom,

15
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,086
Bo-guk can fix his own dinner.

16
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,964
I made plans with Ju-hui today.

17
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,216
Bo-yeong!

18
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,426
-Let's go downtown today.
-I can't.

19
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,846
Let's go. Come on.

20
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,515
Why not?

21
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,284
Hey!

22
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,036
Here.

23
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:23,953
What?

24
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,372
-Use this.
-What?

25
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,193
IM EUN-SEOP

26
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,628
-Hae-won.
-Yes?

27
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,425
Is this Gunbam?

28
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,469
Yes.

29
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,847
Were his legs always this long?

30
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,437
His face is spot-on, though.

31
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,189
-Right?
-Yes.

32
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,484
-I'll try my best.
-Okay.

33
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,612
-It looks like Gunbam.
-It does, right?

34
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:02,635
KIM BO-YEONG

35
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,596
The person you are trying to call…

36
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,600
IM EUN-SEOP

37
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,942
-I'm done.
-You're finished?

38
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,402
Yes.

39
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,490
It's cold, right?
Do you want something like hot chocolate?

40
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,742
I'd like that.

41
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,659
Okay.

42
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,332
I think Gunbam is here.

43
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,720
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

44
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:03,196
Hello?

45
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,032
Is that you, Eun-seop?

46
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,659
It's Bo-yeong.

47
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,627
I called…

48
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,174
because I lost my footing.

49
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,721
I'm sorry,

50
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,017
but can you come and rescue me?

51
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,437
I want you to come and rescue me.

52
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,358
I'll wait…

53
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,528
until you come.

54
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,407
Right here.

55
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:19,981
What did she say?

56
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,653
She said she's near
the entrance of the mountain.

57
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,783
She wants me to go and get her.

58
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,454
I'll be right back.

59
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,038
No, I'll go.

60
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,583
What?

61
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,170
It's right that I go if that's the case.

62
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,380
-How will you go--
-I'll go, Eun-seop.

63
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,925
I have something to talk about with her.

64
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:48,968
I'll be back.

65
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,360
What?

66
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,905
Are you disappointed
that I'm not Eun-seop?

67
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,247
You didn't even fall down.
This is nothing.

68
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,417
You could've come down by yourself.

69
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,297
Just like how I got here perfectly safe.

70
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,142
-Goodbye, then.
-Goodbye.

71
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,059
You're right.

72
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,230
I am disappointed
that Eun-seop didn't come.

73
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,984
IM EUN-SEOP

74
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,331
I figured this was my last chance.

75
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,590
If you text me your address, I'll-

76
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,508
No.

77
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,595
I want to go
and see for myself before I buy it.

78
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,724
Hi, welcome.

79
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,730
How pretty.

80
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,359
What do tulips symbolize?

81
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,486
A confession of love.

82
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,075
Shall I wrap some up for you?

83
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,753
This was my absolute last chance.

84
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,186
You have no idea
how much I've tried all this time.

85
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,064
A couple that's broken up goes on a trip.

86
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,818
They made a savings account as a couple

87
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,154
to travel together.

88
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,949
They went together
even though they were broken up?

89
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,534
No, separately.

90
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:27,037
Is that so? Then what?

91
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,126
I really did everything that I could do.

92
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,467
But why now?

93
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,929
Why are you doing this now
after doing nothing all this time? Why--

94
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,639
Because nothing worked,
no matter how hard I tried.

95
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,144
It didn't matter how hard I tried.

96
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,353
So what could I do?

97
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,355
The truth is…

98
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,109
I liked you.

99
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:00,488
What?

100
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,491
For a very long time.

101
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,661
I didn't know.

102
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,123
What if you had known?

103
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,963
Even so,

104
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,675
nothing would have changed.

105
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,433
I didn't get accepted into college.

106
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,435
-It's okay.
-There's always next year.

107
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,487
-Shall we go get jjajangmyeon?
-Yes.

108
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,405
-I have to go.
-Hey, Eun-seop!

109
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,115
Let's go there.

110
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,617
Take this. I got a lot already.

111
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,494
I'll buy you jjajangmyeon. Come on.

112
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,287
Everyone's waiting. Be quick.

113
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,248
Hurry outside, okay?

114
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,339
All the opportunities meant nothing.

115
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,135
Things always went awry for me.

116
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,101
As if I'm not allowed to be in his life.

117
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,667
Eun-seop!

118
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,379
You said you'd buy me
a game console with your stipend!

119
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,381
-Did you bring it?
-Yes, it's in here.

120
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,759
Guys, say hi. This is my brother.

121
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,636
-Hello.
-My cool brother will treat us.

122
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,263
-Goodbye! Let's go.
-I'll call you.

123
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,556
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

124
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,433
Let's go!

125
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,742
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

126
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,789
I heard the vagrant owns this place.

127
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,874
Vagrant?

128
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,169
You know, the guy who came
from the mountains.

129
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,674
All right, let's go.

130
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,842
Yes, sir.

131
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,976
What do you want to eat?

132
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,784
That's why I couldn't do anything.

133
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,871
I couldn't talk to him

134
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,082
or even call him.

135
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,880
But I suddenly found the courage…

136
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,633
because you came.

137
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,844
What?

138
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,638
Once you came here,

139
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,100
I felt rushed and spiteful.

140
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,853
I wanted to stand in your way
and be mean to you.

141
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,106
What did you say?

142
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,900
Be honest with me.

143
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,237
There was a time you stood in my way too.

144
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:06,942
Hey, Bo-yeong!

145
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,654
Hey.

146
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,614
Why are you crying?

147
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,575
Why are you crying? Did something happen?

148
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,536
It's because of what happened
in the AV room earlier, right?

149
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,040
Hae-won seduced Eun-seop, didn't she?

150
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:27,546
I never liked her from the get-go.
That sly brat.

151
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,506
My gosh, she's unbelievable!

152
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,968
Never.

153
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,095
What?

154
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,847
I have never stood in your way.

155
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,890
Not even once.

156
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,269
So you're saying
you never approached Eun-seop first,

157
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,980
even though you knew I liked him?

158
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:45,981
Never.

159
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,194
What's more, I only had an inkling
that you might like him.

160
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,112
I never actually thought…

161
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,740
Guess what?

162
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,202
I have a crush on someone!

163
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,622
I like him so much!

164
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,667
I never did that to you.

165
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,716
That's why I don't understand you
at all right now.

166
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,386
Why on earth did you become
spiteful and mean because of me?

167
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,432
Bo-yeong.

168
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,270
What made you so twisted and messed up?

169
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:40,953
Yes.

170
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,372
I'm with her.

171
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,709
No, it's okay. I'll bring her down.

172
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,419
Okay.

173
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,511
Don't lose me. Follow me.

174
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,089
Everybody, move.

175
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,425
Move out, everyone!

176
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,435
What is it?

177
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,854
What do you mean, sir?

178
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,939
Just tell me the conditions.

179
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,817
Right, I was supposed to tell you that.

180
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,661
Why? Do you like it, sir?

181
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,247
-No, I don't.
-Then don't come.

182
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,416
It's just a mere book club.
Nothing special.

183
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,214
Fine.

184
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,159
You're early.

185
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,748
Thank you.

186
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,591
I heard you've been meeting
Sim Myeong-yeo these days, honey.

187
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,802
Yes, I have.

188
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,765
She lives deep in the mountains
of Gangwon Province, right?

189
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,313
You know,

190
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,732
I wish you only had eyes for me.

191
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,193
Whether it be as a writer

192
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,487
or as a woman.

193
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,866
-What?
-I don't want you to meet Sim Myeong-yeo.

194
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,911
I'm not saying don't publish her book.

195
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:32,374
Let's be honest, you don't need to
meet her to publish her book.

196
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,002
So don't meet with her

197
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,754
and just publish her book. Okay?

198
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,423
That's all you have to do.

199
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,969
But it's all true, Cha Yun-taek.

200
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,516
-Excuse me, can I get some water?
-Sure.

201
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,851
What are you talking about?

202
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,729
What are they calling me?
"The next Sim Myeong-yeo"?

203
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,522
That's so ridiculous.

204
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,899
What does she have that I lack?

205
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,862
She's neither a better writer
nor prettier than me.

206
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,406
Right, I am younger than her.

207
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,659
You know about the rumors, don't you?

208
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,495
You don't?

209
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,165
Remember when she was at her peak

210
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,625
and suddenly dropped everything
and withdrew to the countryside?

211
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,211
What was it…

212
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,964
What everyone says about me is all true.

213
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,257
Right.

214
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,258
That's the truth.

215
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,306
The rumor about how
she had an affair with her brother-in-law,

216
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,643
so her sister killed him.

217
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,606
You should believe them.

218
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,112
I guess you didn't know that.

219
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,367
Then why did you break up with her?

220
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:50,869
That's hot.

221
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,205
Excuse me.

222
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,165
I want water instead of broth.

223
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:56,666
Okay.

224
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,001
Cha Yun-taek.

225
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:00,921
Cha…

226
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,466
Hey, Sim Myeong-yeo.

227
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,343
Sim Myeong-yeo!

228
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,222
Answer me.

229
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,391
You're persistent.

230
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:16,394
Just tell me the reason.

231
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,188
What's hard about that?

232
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,065
Yun-taek.

233
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:23,902
I wish you a good life.

234
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,197
Just have a good life.

235
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,367
Get married like you wanted to.
Better yet, have kids too.

236
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,993
Live a happy life and parade it.

237
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,372
Myeong-yeo.

238
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,668
Please be happy
and forget about a jerk like me.

239
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,629
Sim Myeong-yeo.

240
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,131
Let go!

241
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,640
I'm going to do everything with you!

242
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,939
I'm going to do everything with you.

243
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,612
Including this.

244
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,054
But I…

245
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,765
won't.

246
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,370
What everyone says about me is all true.

247
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,206
That's the truth.

248
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,418
You should believe them.

249
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,267
-Hae-won.
-You're up?

250
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,518
Yes.

251
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,479
Are you feeling okay?

252
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,148
Did you catch a cold?

253
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,065
I didn't.

254
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,110
-What about your mood?
-It's okay.

255
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,491
-How did the talk go?
-It went well.

256
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,328
I'm glad.

257
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,000
Wait.

258
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,252
Don't tell me you're sleepy again.

259
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,754
Tell me about it.

260
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,507
You said you have insomnia.

261
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,759
Were you just pretending?

262
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,594
-That's right.
-You were pretending?

263
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,262
No, as in I have insomnia.

264
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,102
No, you can't go back to sleep. Wake up.

265
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,645
-Hey, Hae-won.
-What?

266
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,980
I'll sleep a little more.

267
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,524
What? You've been sleeping until now.

268
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,442
Wake up already.

269
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:35,195
-I'm bored. Come on.
-Okay.

270
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:38,948
Hey.

271
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,451
Wake up.

272
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,286
Hae-won.

273
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,289
Wake up already.

274
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,042
Get up. Hurry up.

275
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,587
-Hey.
-Wake up or I'll pinch your face harder.

276
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,422
-All right.
-Get up.

277
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,929
Get up already.
Stop being stubborn, come on.

278
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:08,436
Goodness.

279
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,481
-Hello, Eun-sil.
-What the…

280
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,191
What was that smooth entrance?

281
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,150
Smooth, right?

282
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,530
-Your timing is perfect today.
-Yes.

283
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,158
Roses!

284
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,204
Hey.

285
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,416
These are the same ones
you gave me in the past, right?

286
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,251
What?

287
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,587
What?

288
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,006
Is this how
you're confessing your feelings?

289
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,675
Yes.

290
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,636
I'm Lee Jang-u, student council president
of Hyecheon High.

291
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,971
I know you're Lee Jang-u.

292
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,264
You know me?

293
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,975
I see you have white roses.

294
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,854
You must be very kind and innocent, right?

295
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,397
Yes, that's right.

296
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,607
But it's too bad.

297
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:58,319
Baek Gyeong just confessed
his feelings for me during lunchtime.

298
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,697
And I reciprocated.

299
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,614
What?

300
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,116
I'm sorry.

301
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,327
It was bad timing.

302
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,537
My timing?

303
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,833
-What's this though?
-It's nothing.

304
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,543
-Can I read it?
-Of course not. Why?

305
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,170
Don't. Put it back. Why did you take it?

306
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,214
-Thank you.
-I said it's not yours.

307
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:20,884
-Put it back.
-But I'll have to reject you.

308
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,594
-I reject your feelings.
-What?

309
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,180
Hey, everyone. I rejected him.

310
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,097
Eun-sil.

311
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,141
Give me the letter.

312
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,684
-She rejected him!
-Eun-sil!

313
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,770
-He got rejected!
-She rejected him!

314
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,396
Rejected!

315
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,231
When did you guys get here?

316
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,860
Guys! He got rejected!

317
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,445
She rejected him!

318
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,909
So, if you didn't date Baek Gyeong then--

319
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,744
-I still would've rejected you.
-Right.

320
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,704
Yes. You weren't my type back then.

321
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,872
Far from it.

322
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:54,626
I was kind of into bad boys then.

323
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:56,461
Bad boys?

324
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,546
I guess Baek Gyeong was pretty bad.

325
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,298
So you're going to a nice place later?

326
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,134
-A nice place?
-Yes, I'll be there too.

327
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,052
It'll be fun.

328
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,137
Be where?

329
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,597
You see,

330
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,475
I've already made plans.

331
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,479
Eun-sil.

332
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,396
Eun-sil.

333
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,190
Eun-sil…

334
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,359
-Hi!
-Hi, Ji-yeong.

335
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,486
Take a bottle each from our store.

336
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,571
-All right.
-Sounds delicious.

337
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,907
-Hi, Mrs. Kim!
-You're here.

338
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,159
The dongchimi is fermented to perfection.

339
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,079
-I'm excited to try it!
-I hope you enjoy it.

340
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,289
-Thank you. I will.
-You're welcome.

341
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,499
It's nice and warm here.

342
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,501
Can I get a bottle
of freshly pressed sesame oil?

343
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,670
Okay, I'll get it ready
by tomorrow so stop by.

344
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,629
All right, thanks.

345
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,089
Oh, right!

346
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,092
-Hey, did you hear?
-Hear what?

347
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,011
The daughter of Walnut House came by.

348
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,430
Of course, she lives there.

349
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,515
No, not that one.

350
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,892
You know, the one--

351
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,273
I'm talking about the daughter
who murdered her husband.

352
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,733
Isn't it a little messed up?

353
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,611
How can she come back home
after what she did to her husband?

354
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,614
I guess all the women of that household
have a violent temper.

355
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,033
Including the grandma!

356
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,744
Both the youngest and eldest daughters
are just like her.

357
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,789
How violent must you be to kill your own--

358
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,211
Were you close with the granddaughter?

359
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:23,464
What are you doing?
Hurry on into your room.

360
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,467
I actually need to stop by work.
I'll get going.

361
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:41,900
You too.

362
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,029
You also promised me
that you wouldn't tell anyone.

363
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,534
But I trusted Ju-hui.

364
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,911
I trusted you too.

365
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:16,267
BOOKSTORE JOURNAL

366
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,439
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

367
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,733
THIS IS MY FIRST LOVE LETTER TO YOU
NO. 133

368
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,116
TONIGHT, I THINK ABOUT
HOW I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE CABIN…

369
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,402
Hae-won.

370
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,123
Hae-won.

371
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:26,587
Hae-won.

372
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,172
What are you…

373
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:31,926
Hey!

374
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,513
I'm Irene?

375
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,684
You said it was Hwi.

376
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,771
Then that key chain is from me too?

377
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,523
No. You…

378
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,026
How far back did you read?

379
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,069
Then the "Goodnight Irene" in your car--

380
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,529
No, it's…

381
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,448
I engraved the title of my favorite song.

382
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,074
-Why am I Irene?
-That's because

383
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,826
you gave me the key chain.

384
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,161
You said that you made it.

385
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,796
I didn't know you kept a journal.

386
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,714
That's cute.

387
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,885
Could you tell me how far you got?

388
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,388
I'm not sure.

389
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,141
I saw you're the kid who gave me the bug.

390
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,025
-I don't want it.
-What?

391
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,110
I don't want it. Take it back.

392
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,990
Yes, that's because…

393
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,533
I thought you were a boy.

394
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,869
What? Why did you think I was a boy?

395
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,830
You were all covered up by the hat.

396
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,374
That's ridiculous.

397
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,251
Another thing.

398
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,254
You even slept over at my house.

399
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,146
Who are you?

400
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,899
That's because…

401
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,526
Hwi suddenly got sick.

402
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,862
My parents had to take her
to a hospital in Seoul, so I--

403
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,531
So you saw my angelic face

404
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,991
and fell for me again at that time.

405
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,701
This is fun, Eun-seop.

406
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,916
-Did you read all of it?
-No way, not all of it.

407
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,292
Just most of it.

408
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,298
I figured out what happened
at Nakdong River thanks to this.

409
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,884
I always thought
the timing was too perfect.

410
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,137
Turns out you called my aunt.

411
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,640
I had no idea.

412
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,100
I almost believed it was fate.

413
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,272
All right, Eun-seop.

414
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,315
I won't tease you. I'll stop.

415
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,734
Okay. Don't be like this.

416
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,361
-Go.
-Eun-seop.

417
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,279
What?

418
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,615
-"That day, Irene asked,
-Don't.

419
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,117
-'Those things…
-Don't!

420
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,952
-that look like marshmallows.'"
-Be quiet.

421
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,204
-"'What are they called?'"
-Stop!

422
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:09,750
Goodness.

423
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,003
Hello, this is Goodnight Bookstore.

424
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:13,963
What?

425
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:24,140
HYECHEON STATION

426
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,683
Why are you here again?

427
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,561
You told me the train schedule.

428
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:30,771
Yun-taek.

429
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,192
I've lost my light.

430
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,068
Now I have nothing.

431
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,947
So don't expect anything from me.

432
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,491
Sim Myeong-yeo.

433
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,539
Your hair…

434
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,544
smelled like the shampoo my mom used.

435
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,649
And your eyes

436
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,237
reminded me of the night before a storm.

437
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,533
I liked that so much.

438
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,498
Can you tell me…

439
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,877
it's all a lie?

440
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:38,923
What's a lie?

441
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,049
All of it.

442
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:45,012
The rumor that I had an affair with
my brother-in-law so my sister killed him?

443
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,015
Well,

444
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,351
believe what you want to believe.

445
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,062
The result won't change regardless.

446
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,483
Whether or not I had
an affair with him, he died.

447
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,528
Whether or not my sister killed him,

448
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,447
she still went to prison.

449
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,534
Whether or not my sister went to prison,

450
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:08,869
I'm already in ruins.

451
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,457
It doesn't matter.
Whatever you believe, that's the truth.

452
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,667
-No, it's not--
-Yes.

453
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,963
That's the truth, Cha Yun-taek.

454
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,851
Even if that's the truth,

455
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,394
at least you should

456
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,980
tell me it's not.

457
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,900
Don't I at least deserve that courtesy?

458
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,739
I'm sorry.

459
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,908
You know I'm not courteous.

460
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,662
Sim Myeong-yeo.

461
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,540
I…

462
00:38:59,086 --> 00:38:59,920
I'm…

463
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:03,841
all withered.

464
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,719
We've all withered.

465
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,181
I've withered just as much as you.

466
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,235
Wrong.

467
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,030
I'm the only one who's all withered.

468
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,532
I'm the only one…

469
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,079
who's completely dead, Yun-taek.

470
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,225
I'll cut off five fingertips

471
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,268
and draw five bloody lines.

472
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,313
I'll cry in the night
when I'm alone but not lonely.

473
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,903
One glass for you who left.

474
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:13,577
One glass is for my pathetic self.

475
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,960
And another glass for our eternal love.

476
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,339
And…

477
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,633
the last glass

478
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,470
is for God, who preordained everything.

479
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:36,183
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTIETH STORY

TITLE: THE BOOKSTORE BY THE SEA

482
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,173
Hae-won.

483
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,508
I understand

484
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,803
you'll be leaving this place someday.

485
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:19,727
Hae-won.

486
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,480
-Yes?
-You got a call, Hae-won.

487
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,148
From who?

488
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,066
She said her name was Bo-yeong.

489
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:29,904
Okay.

490
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,097
Let's go!

491
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,771
Everybody, move!

492
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,814
Let's go!

493
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,297
Everybody, move!

494
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,508
Hi!

495
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,885
HYECHEON HIGH SCHOOL

496
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,141
Hi.

497
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,144
Hello.

498
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,826
It's such a beautiful morning!

499
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,362
You're probably the only person
who asks to meet on a bus.

500
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,284
So what did you want to say?

501
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,748
I thought about what you said.

502
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,755
About my twisted and messed up heart.

503
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,802
You're right, I was like that.

504
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,681
I really hated you.

505
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,309
Think about it.

506
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,646
You got rid of me after one strike.

507
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,482
Because of one mistake.

508
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,150
You didn't even hear me out.

509
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,570
Hae-won, just a minute.

510
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,113
Let go!

511
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,909
Hae-won!

512
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,460
No matter how hard I tried,

513
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,004
you wouldn't even look at me.

514
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:39,760
After hearing that you came here,
I went to see you, but…

515
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:40,678
Is that why…

516
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:45,724
Is that why you still can't forgive me?

517
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,646
From then on, I started to wait.

518
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,315
Wait for what?

519
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:58,487
That your forgiveness would take longer
than my wrongdoing.

520
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,741
Which would make you
a petty and cold-hearted person.

521
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,702
Then people would have sympathy for me

522
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:07,955
because I'd be sad and pitiful.

523
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,711
"One strike"?

524
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,132
Bo-yeong.

525
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,427
It might've been one strike for you,

526
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,555
but it was a strikeout for me.

527
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,183
I told my life's secret only to you,

528
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,060
but you told that to others.

529
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,899
You could stick with your excuse
of how you only told Ju-hui,

530
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,568
but because of that…

531
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,570
I wasn't able to think that far.

532
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,075
I'm sorry.

533
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,417
But I couldn't shake the thought

534
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,045
that it was only one mistake.

535
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,883
That's why I hated you.

536
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,808
You probably didn't hate me.
You just disliked me.

537
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,020
Are the two any different?

538
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,606
Yes, they're different.

539
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,318
Disliking someone ends there,
but hating someone…

540
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,322
That's only possible
if you have affection.

541
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,912
I really liked you.

542
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,289
We have a transfer student.

543
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,961
Her name is Mok Hae-won
and she transferred from Seoul.

544
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,964
You know we have
a mock exam next week, right?

545
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,176
-Let's all score five points higher…
-She's so pretty.

546
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,598
How is a mill so different
from a vacation cottage?

547
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,438
Wow, you speak so kindly.

548
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:02,069
I think that's why I kept trying
by going to see you.

549
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,870
Although for you,
our friendship probably didn't mean much.

550
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,582
It was one that you could discard
after one mistake…

551
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:19,086
without even giving me a second chance.

552
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,085
Hi, I'm Kim Bo-yeong. Nice to meet you.

553
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:01,962
Hae-won.

554
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,299
Do you want to be my partner?

555
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:09,219
Take this.

556
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,557
My house is close. I can just run home.

557
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,061
Bo-yeong!

558
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,398
See you tomorrow, Hae-won!

559
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,651
Bo-yeong!

560
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:27,904
This…

561
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,421
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

562
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,558
Hello?

563
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,441
Mr. Jung Gil-bok?

564
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,576
Hello.

565
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,744
Wait here for a bit.

566
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,458
I'm here to see Mr. Jung Gil-bok.

567
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,669
Please fill out this form.

568
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:27,506
He collapsed on the street.
Someone from town brought him in.

569
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,092
It's nothing serious,
but he has to stay a few days.

570
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:34,054
But he keeps insisting that
he wants to be discharged.

571
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,015
I think it's because of the hospital fees.

572
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:47,984
Seung-ho.

573
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,280
Uncle.

574
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,419
Don't worry too much.

575
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,012
He'll get better in no time.

576
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,600
At school,

577
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,061
we raise rabbits.

578
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,820
Eat up.

579
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,989
They were so cute.

580
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,326
But they died.

581
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,166
What if my grandpa…

582
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,002
ends up like the rabbits?

583
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,050
He won't.

584
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,514
I promise.

585
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,051
Here.

586
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:44,935
Let's go.

587
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,985
Yes, that's right. Pat it in like this.

588
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,029
Your eyes too.

589
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,323
Pat it in.

590
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,331
Keep patting.

591
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,962
Aunt, you need to take out
some blankets later.

592
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,715
I will, Ji-yeon. But I'm not "Aunt."

593
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:57,716
I'm Myeong-yeo.

594
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,218
She's right, Ji-yeon.

595
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,012
Ms. Myeong-yeo doesn't go by that.

596
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,889
You can't call her "Aunt."

597
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,390
Grow up.

598
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:06,725
You're at that age now.

599
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:09,686
-What's wrong with "Aunt"?
-Don't Eun-seop's parents

600
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,313
call you "young lady"?

601
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,647
Aren't you a bit old for that?

602
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,900
That's because I still look young.

603
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:17,903
Your skin looks like that of a student.
How is it so nice?

604
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:20,155
It's the moisturizer I just used.

605
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:31,708
Can you tell me?

606
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,504
That everything is a lie.

607
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,594
It doesn't matter.
Whatever you believe, that's the truth.

608
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:43,720
-No, it's not--
-Yes.

609
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:48,016
That's the truth, Cha Yun-taek.

610
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,413
Uncle!

611
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:13,959
Did you sleep well?

612
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,710
Say bye to Hae-won.

613
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:23,593
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

614
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,652
Hae-won!

615
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:42,737
Wake up your aunt! It's time to eat!

616
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:43,655
Okay.

617
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:51,454
Aunt.

618
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:54,708
Aunt.

619
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:58,336
Are you…

620
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,343
Aunt!

621
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,344
Hae-won.

622
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:08,596
Aunt.

623
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,390
-I understand…
-Aunt!

624
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,934
Aunt! Open your eyes!

625
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:15,353
…you'll be leaving this place someday.

626
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,440
Aunt! What's wrong?

627
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,775
I'm preparing for it all.

628
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:25,864
However,

629
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,076
when you leave this place,

630
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,080
I hope your heart won't feel too heavy.

631
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,834
I just hope you'll leave smiling happily.

632
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,252
Aunt.

633
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,587
Aunt!

634
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,464
Aunt!

635
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,465
I hope…

636
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,509
you won't be hurt even a little bit.

637
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:53,058
I truly hope for this.

638
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,184
Aunt!

639
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,310
Aunt!

640
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:25,840
BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

641
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,092
POSTED BY SEOP

642
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:32,055
Oh, dear.
Irene discovered my private journal.

643
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:37,143
It seems that she saw
the bookstore journal tab.

644
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:42,148
I don't know how much she read.

645
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:47,153
But seeing how she teased me
about the marshmallow story,

646
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:52,242
that was around the time
she arrived in Bukhyun-ri.

647
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:57,413
How much did she read after that?

648
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:02,043
It's not the end of the world
if it turns out she read it all,

649
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:09,008
but I almost passed out
from embarrassment.

650
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,014
She probably had terrible headaches.

651
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,267
It must have been hard to endure.

652
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,977
You know Jang-u? The lad at City Hall?

653
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,770
He went on a blind date.

654
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,897
It seems to be going great.

655
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,023
Hey, Im Hwi.

656
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:27,193
Song Je-in and Im Hwi
got into a brawl because of you!

657
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,112
I said to try and live your best life.

658
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,822
How could I do that?

659
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,782
How am I supposed to…

660
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,785
It might just need some time
for it to be resolved.

661
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,413
Just as spring comes after winter passes?

662
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,914
I think spring will come soon.

663
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:47,297
