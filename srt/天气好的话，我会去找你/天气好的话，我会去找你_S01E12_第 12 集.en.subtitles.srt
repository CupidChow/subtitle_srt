1
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,526
-Goal!
-Goal!

2
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,908
-Goal!
-Goal!

3
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,368
Great job!

4
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,842
Honey.

5
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,720
It looks heavy. Let me carry that.

6
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,099
This is why I said I'd go with you.

7
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,352
Let's go and have a delicious meal.

8
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:49,901
Myeong-ju.

9
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,446
Hey.

10
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,489
You're here.

11
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:11,673
Dad!

12
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,678
-Dad!
-Yes, Hae-won.

13
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,099
-It's nice to be out, right?
-Yes.

14
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,893
Hurry up, Aunt!

15
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,770
Hurry up, honey!

16
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,165
Hey!

17
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,084
Who do you think you are?

18
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,588
Who do you think you are?

19
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,133
Why do you always do this to me?

20
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,593
Let go of me!

21
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,687
How dare you do that to me?

22
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,032
Hey! What gives you the right?

23
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,701
What gives you the right to hit my sister?

24
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,536
-Myeong-yeo!
-What gives you the right?

25
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,705
-You--
-What the hell do you know?

26
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,917
-No. Stop.
-You. Get over here!

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,209
-How dare you!
-Myeong-yeo.

28
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,046
-Myeong-yeo! Don't do it.
-How dare you!

29
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,798
-Stop it!
-What the hell?

30
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,092
Damn it!

31
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,636
Just get a divorce!

32
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,596
Divorce him!

33
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:45,099
What are you lacking
to have to live with a loser like him?

34
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,935
Myeong-ju!

35
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,188
-Divorce him. You don't deserve--
-Myeong-yeo!

36
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,773
No, stop!

37
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,149
-Stop it!
-Let go!

38
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,360
Who are you to tell her to get a divorce?

39
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,737
Who are you to tell her what to do?

40
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,939
Get out!

41
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,608
-Myeong-ju!
-I said, get out!

42
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,610
Hey!

43
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,778
Damn it!

44
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,411
Myeong-ju! Get out!

45
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,578
I won't!

46
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,330
-No!
-I won't!

47
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,331
Get out!

48
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,166
Damn it!

49
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,630
-Why you…
-Get out of the way!

50
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,644
Are you nuts?

51
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,024
No!

52
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,053
Myeong-ju.

53
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,947
Yes. Is this 911?

54
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:06,824
There's been an accident.

55
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,952
Yes, that's the correct address.

56
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,622
Right. Yes, just now.

57
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,374
Yes.

58
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,088
Yes.

59
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,604
Get out.

60
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,526
Listen carefully.

61
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,945
Ju-hong is dead.

62
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,696
No.

63
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,117
Yes, he is. I checked.

64
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,036
I killed him.

65
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,538
No.

66
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,957
I killed him. It was me.

67
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,750
What?

68
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,835
Myeong-yeo.

69
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,963
Do you have cash with you?

70
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:07,135
No, I don't. No, I don't know.

71
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,974
Then just go straight out the gate
and get on the bus.

72
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:17,186
There are no security cameras here,
but there will be ones on the main street

73
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,896
in your neighborhood. Understand?

74
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,650
You will avoid them…

75
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,236
as you walk back to your place.

76
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,612
Got it?

77
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,408
Sim Myeong-yeo!

78
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:32,368
Pull yourself together!

79
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,205
Myeong-yeo, hurry up.

80
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,498
The shoes…

81
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,669
Myeong-yeo, here.

82
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,254
You can wear these shoes instead.

83
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,423
Put them on, Myeong-yeo!

84
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,137
Myeong-yeo.

85
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,514
Myeong-ju.

86
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,599
It's okay.

87
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,353
Take a shower once you get home.

88
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,897
Nothing happened.

89
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,524
It's okay. Nothing happened.

90
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,736
It's fine.

91
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,696
Nothing happened.

92
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,281
-Myeong-ju.
-You should go.

93
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,492
-Hurry!
-Myeong-ju.

94
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,205
Hurry up and go.

95
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,834
Just go, Myeong-yeo.

96
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,337
Are you listening to me?

97
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,798
I said, just hurry up and go!

98
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,968
Go!

99
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,463
After you've taken a shower and a nap,

100
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,090
you will get a call.

101
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,150
Hello?

102
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,654
Yes, hello.

103
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,782
I'm investigator Gu Hyeon-tae
from the Paju police station.

104
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,161
Am I speaking to Ms. Sim Myeong-yeo?

105
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,668
Yes.

106
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,128
Yes.

107
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:52,091
I'm calling about Sim Myeong-ju.
Is she your older sister?

108
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,095
Yes.

109
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,142
So, her husband Mr. Mok Ju-hong

110
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,185
has passed away.

111
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,980
It will be from the police

112
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:10,026
to tell you that Ju-hong died
and I'm being interrogated as a suspect.

113
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,237
Yes. The thing is, your sister…

114
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,573
I sentence the defendant Sim Myeong-ju

115
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,992
to seven years in prison.

116
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,532
If I go to prison,

117
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,993
I can say I was running away
from my husband's abuse.

118
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,203
It will reduce my sentence.

119
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,496
But you can't.

120
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,550
You would have to stay in prison

121
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,510
for the rest of your life.

122
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:50,311
That's why you can't be here.

123
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,692
Take Hae-won in and live with her.

124
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,679
What am I going to do?

125
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:27,973
What?

126
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:30,559
I don't think I'll ever forget…

127
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,439
the way you look right now.

128
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,759
I'm sleepy.

129
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,387
But I want to keep looking at you.

130
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,643
You know, Eun-seop…

131
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,813
Yes. I'm sleepy.

132
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,151
Are you?

133
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,321
Then go to sleep.

134
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,826
What were you going to say?

135
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,037
Nothing.

136
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,497
What is it?

137
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,837
Nothing. I'll tell you next time.

138
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,227
Mom!

139
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:56,937
Mom!

140
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,440
Mom!

141
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,235
Mom!

142
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:05,779
-Mom!
-What took you so long?

143
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,781
Your mom was desperately waiting for you.

144
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,283
Mom!

145
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,082
I pity the kid the most.

146
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,799
Mom!

147
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,066
What did you say?

148
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,360
I said…

149
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,197
I'll live here now
while taking care of Hae-won.

150
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:53,369
I mean,

151
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,955
don't you think

152
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,290
novels are pointless?

153
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,127
And Mom,

154
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,756
it turns out I'm not even that talented.

155
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,386
You're not talented?

156
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,637
No.

157
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:13,639
I don't have talent.

158
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,225
None.

159
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,894
So from now on,

160
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,731
I'll stay here with you and Hae-won,

161
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,692
and we can spend the rest of our lives--

162
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,050
Stay strong.

163
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,220
I told you. It's not your fault.

164
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,265
Myeong-ju.

165
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,058
If it wasn't for me,

166
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,395
none of this would have happened.

167
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,067
Don't cry.

168
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,280
Go straight back home.

169
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,033
Write your novel.

170
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,535
Go on dates.

171
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:18,996
And…

172
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,333
about Hae-won.

173
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,212
Try to spend…

174
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,050
a lot of time with her.

175
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,182
She's probably very lonely.

176
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,852
-Myeong-ju.
-Listen, Myeong-yeo.

177
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,688
I'm…

178
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:48,484
I'm really…

179
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,324
SENDER: SIM MYEONG-JU

180
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:06,919
I'M FINE

181
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,111
Hey.

182
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,464
BOOKSTORE JOURNAL, NEW BLOG POST
THIS IS MY FIRST LOVE LETTER TO YOU

183
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,014
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

184
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,195
-Why are you coming from there?
-Gosh, you scared me.

185
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,197
At this time.

186
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,284
Well.

187
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,870
You're all grown now.

188
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,875
So it's none of my business.

189
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,712
Where are you coming back from?

190
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,675
My friend passed away.

191
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,810
I'm tired. Can we skip breakfast today?

192
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,603
Of course.

193
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,856
Or why don't I make something for us?

194
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,774
No, thanks.

195
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,861
Hey, you.

196
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:21,822
I heard…

197
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,909
that people were impressed
by your cello performance.

198
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:27,869
Who told you?

199
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,538
Su-jeong.

200
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,999
She said everyone raved about it.

201
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,917
I wouldn't go that far.

202
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,925
I wonder who took out all the sharp quills
from our family hedgehog.

203
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,885
What? What did you say?

204
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,305
A "hedgehog"? What?

205
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,556
It's a poetic expression.

206
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,185
Go inside.

207
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,187
All right.

208
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,898
It's cold. Come inside soon.

209
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:16,543
TRAVELS OF A SEPARATING COUPLE

210
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,176
Hae-won! Mok Hae-won, hurry.

211
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,093
Okay.

212
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,765
Come on, let's hurry!

213
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,347
Hey.

214
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,850
Looks like you have something fun there.

215
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:22,025
What is this? Is it a piece of seaweed?

216
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,318
They're stars.

217
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,986
Stars?

218
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,156
I know what it is.
What do you take me for?

219
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:29,908
I'm a geek.

220
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,327
You don't need to tell me that.

221
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,287
But you should know.

222
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,373
I'm a proud astronomy geek.

223
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,294
I see.

224
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:45,257
My heart flutters and I feel giddy
whenever I see the stars.

225
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,591
You're crazy.

226
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,260
Then what about you?

227
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,095
What is that you have there?

228
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,763
So this…

229
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,058
This is something very precious to me.

230
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,059
I see.

231
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,853
So she means a lot to you.

232
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,146
What?

233
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,191
-She's pretty.
-That's not it. Not her.

234
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,568
You got it all wrong.

235
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,278
Then what is it?

236
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,907
Look here.

237
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,828
You have to look closely
to see that she's the pretty one.

238
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,874
-She's pretty too.
-She is, right?

239
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:22,961
She's even prettier when she's eating.

240
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:24,588
She has nice bangs.

241
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,715
Right, that and her overall style.

242
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,550
Hey, but seriously.

243
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,386
-Do you know the names of all of these?
-Yes.

244
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,555
-And you look at this all day?
-Yes.

245
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,310
Mr. Cha.

246
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:40,979
Not now.

247
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,567
The person you are trying to call
cannot be reached…

248
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,497
LOOK HERE. WHO DO YOU THINK
KILLED MY BROTHER-IN-LAW?

249
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,308
CRYBABY

250
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,769
YOU HAVE 19 MISSED CALLS

251
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,041
-Well…
-What is it?

252
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,167
Forget it.

253
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,795
All right. Whatever.

254
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,258
By the way,

255
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:54,761
you look pretty good in those clothes.

256
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,640
But I wear this every day.

257
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,142
Looks nice.
Maybe because of your broad shoulders.

258
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,727
First I've ever heard that.

259
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,020
Are they really?

260
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,647
Yes. Broad like the Pacific Ocean.

261
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,069
I thought you said you didn't like me.

262
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,530
I don't. It's all in the past.

263
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,158
But didn't you just say that I look good?

264
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,119
Yeong-su.

265
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,707
If I say I don't like roses,
are they no longer beautiful?

266
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,085
No, they're still beautiful
regardless of how I feel.

267
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,713
That's what this is.

268
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,590
The fact that you have broad shoulders
and look good in your clothes

269
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,009
has nothing to do with me.

270
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,803
My feelings were in the past,
but you look great now.

271
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,430
And that's just the way it is.

272
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,393
Is the bookstore far from here?

273
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,855
Yes, so you'd better keep up with me.

274
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,775
It feels different
to meet in the afternoon.

275
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,693
Yes, it does.

276
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,405
Su-jeong, are you okay?
You don't look well.

277
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,658
Yes, I'm fine.

278
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,369
I think everyone is here.

279
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,913
-All right. Shall we start?
-Yes.

280
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,583
Excuse me. I'm a member too.

281
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,585
-That's right. We also have Hwi.
-Hello…

282
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,589
Unbelievable, Hwi.
Did you hunt him down?

283
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:15,467
What are you talking about?
Stop making fun of me.

284
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,218
Hey! I mean, Yeong-su! This way.

285
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,511
This was your idea, right?

286
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,721
-What's your name?
-I'm--

287
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,473
This is a new member.

288
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,433
Everyone, a round of applause!

289
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,726
Hello.

290
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,729
Say hello to him too. Hello.

291
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,982
Can you help us get another chair?

292
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,525
Okay. Eun-seop?

293
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,235
Let me bring you one.

294
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,738
-Please put your bag over there.
-Okay.

295
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,655
Who are you?

296
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,325
Who are you?

297
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:41,910
Here you go.

298
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,455
-Thank you.
-Eun-seop, what's the matter?

299
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,540
-You look really mad.
-No, I'm fine.

300
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,182
"We sat face to face,
smiling and talking under that tree."

301
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,437
"Our breath,

302
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,731
our laughter,

303
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,235
and our voices permeated that tree."

304
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,114
"And stayed permeated."

305
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:26,162
"The fact that we smiled
and talked under that tree

306
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,165
will be long-forgotten."

307
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,504
"But every year in spring,

308
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,257
that tree…

309
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,728
will remember our laughter,

310
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,648
our breath,

311
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,820
and our voices…

312
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,323
to leaf out,

313
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,454
fresh, green, and new."

314
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,377
WE SAT FACE TO FACE

315
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,588
We Sat Face to Face.

316
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,924
Gosh, it made my heart leap.

317
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:20,842
Right.

318
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,304
I feel something like that
in my heart too.

319
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,056
-You do?
-Can't I?

320
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,974
Seung-ho.

321
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:34,898
So Yeong-su,
can you tell us what brought you here?

322
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,025
-Right.
-I heard he really likes books.

323
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,236
He's the unicorn of our school.
Top of the class and has a girlfriend.

324
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,739
You're here because you like books. Right?

325
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:47,076
-A unicorn.
-Fun fact. Hwi has a big crush on him,

326
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,330
-but he has no interest in her.
-Excuse me.

327
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,207
Can you please use the past tense?

328
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,833
Because I'm over him now.

329
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,834
Nice to meet you.

330
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,046
I'm Lee Jang-u, the unicorn
of the 42nd class at Hyecheon High School.

331
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,924
I see you're good-looking, just like me.

332
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,217
Is that why she likes you?

333
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,427
Hello? I just said to use the past tense.

334
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,346
You don't seem to know what that means.

335
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:10,725
Do you really think Hwi likes him
only because of his looks?

336
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,810
Well,

337
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,229
we do live in a world
where looks matter the most.

338
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,607
Listen, everyone. It is all in the past.

339
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,400
Don't you know what that word means?

340
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,860
How is it in the past?

341
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,153
But it is.

342
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,322
Right, if that's what Hwi says--

343
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,949
Looks like it's ongoing, though.

344
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,576
No! It's in the past.

345
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,787
What? But you still like him.

346
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,289
-No, Jang-u.
-You liked him,

347
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,916
-and you still do.
-You're wrong!

348
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,335
-That's not true.
-Eun-seop, can I borrow that book?

349
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,419
An ideal type?

350
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,131
-What does that mean?
-I said no, Jang-u.

351
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,258
Seriously!

352
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,968
Eun-seop, why do you look so glum?

353
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,512
-Me?
-You still look really mad.

354
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,972
He has a fever.

355
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:49,889
I don't.

356
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,559
-But he was fine.
-You're sweating.

357
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,643
I think he's angry.

358
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,186
-It's because he's hot.
-Is it?

359
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,315
So tell us, Kim Yeong-su,
the current unicorn of Hyecheon High.

360
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,943
How did you like
the book club meeting today?

361
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,488
Yes. It was all thanks to,
because of, owing to, and through me

362
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:08,116
that you joined this amazing club today.
So how was it?

363
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,159
Well?

364
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,786
Anything to say?

365
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,538
You guys can go ahead!

366
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,540
Hello?

367
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:16,708
Hi, Jang-u!

368
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,795
-Is this Eun-sil?
-Yes.

369
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,757
Is it this hard to have a call with you?

370
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,884
Our timing's been off.

371
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:26,801
What?

372
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,140
Jang-u.

373
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,144
It sounds like you should just hang up
and go see a doctor.

374
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,771
-I'm hanging up.
-No. Don't.

375
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,981
Why did you call?

376
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:44,193
Actually, I have something I want to ask.

377
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,486
Is that okay?

378
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,322
Sure, ask away.

379
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,574
I'm all ears.

380
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:54,537
So you're holding
a coffee festival in Gangneung.

381
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,580
Recommend me baristas.

382
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,625
And you'd like famous baristas…
Hey, this is why you called?

383
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,419
Yes. Why? Am I not supposed to?

384
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,463
If so, I can ask--

385
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:06,883
No! There's no need.
I can help you with that.

386
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,178
Jang-u, I knew I could count on you.
Thank you.

387
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,096
I promise I will make it up to you.

388
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,389
Wait.

389
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:17,018
-Yes?
-Did you have anything else to say?

390
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,103
No.

391
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,774
I see. Okay. Enjoy your lunch.

392
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,567
Lunch? It's four o'clock.

393
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,194
You have a nice lunch yourself.

394
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,322
Yes, I will. I will have lunch.

395
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,074
Right, I will enjoy my lunch now.

396
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,035
-Bye.
-Bye.

397
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,172
Gosh, this is the first time
we've talked on the phone.

398
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,423
CONTACTS
NAME: EUN-SIL

399
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,220
What great weather.

400
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,556
"Eun-sil."

401
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,059
Excuse me, Yeong-su.

402
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:03,064
So, right now, are you actually

403
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,818
the top student
out of all students at your school?

404
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,486
Me?

405
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,280
Well, yes.

406
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:15,702
So that kind of person
does actually exist.

407
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,872
You know, I've always considered it

408
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,292
as something like the fox
in The Little Prince.

409
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,839
Something that exists
but is very hard to believe in

410
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,882
because it doesn't seem believable.

411
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,927
Well Mr. Bae, he really is
the top student at the school.

412
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,262
He always gets good grades.

413
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,348
But Hwi, aren't you younger than him?

414
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,808
Yes, I am.

415
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,560
-But why…
-Why does she talk informally?

416
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,562
Because she doesn't like using honorifics.

417
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,272
Yes.

418
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:48,317
Then why do you use them with me?

419
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,237
Now, you have to think carefully.

420
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:56,242
Did I really speak formally to you
every time you and I spoke?

421
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,662
Are you sure that's not just
how you think it's been?

422
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:03,458
If you look back, I might have
been talking informally to you all along.

423
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,712
What in the world…

424
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,677
But Yeong-su,
why do you smile every time she talks?

425
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,889
Don't tell me
you actually have feelings for her.

426
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,352
I just think she's absurd.

427
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,106
Does everything she says
make sense to you?

428
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,816
-No, of course not.
-Right.

429
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,819
Wait. Listen up.

430
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:36,657
I think you've all fallen
for my unbelievable charm.

431
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,825
Do you get it?

432
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:42,121
-Goodness. They're totally into me.
-Why isn't Jang-u coming?

433
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,840
-This is driving me nuts.
-What?

434
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,844
Hey,

435
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,472
Myeong-yeo! You…

436
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,768
What is this? Explain.

437
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:04,685
Explain what?

438
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,063
I'm talking about the fax
you sent yesterday.

439
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,399
You asked me for the opening line.

440
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,863
So I gave it to you.
What's all this about?

441
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:18,741
That's all?

442
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,493
That's all. So what?

443
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,752
Did you perhaps take that as fact…

444
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,132
and call me 34 times like a crazy person?

445
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:40,221
"I'll never ask what parts are fiction
and non-fiction in your story."

446
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,430
Those were your words.

447
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,641
You said I could mix fiction and--

448
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,061
Hey.

449
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,169
It's not dark at all. Right?

450
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:13,880
Right.

451
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,299
Someone had fixed it.

452
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,551
I wonder who did it.

453
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,434
Let's go.

454
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:34,650
I'll sneak out to come over
when my aunt is asleep.

455
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,777
-You can do that?
-Of course.

456
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,866
She actually doesn't notice things.

457
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:45,620
It's true.

458
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,623
She stays under the blankets
and can't hear a thing.

459
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,113
TRAVELS OF A SEPARATING COUPLE

460
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,615
Did you come to return that?

461
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,327
You didn't have to come
all the way over here.

462
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,456
-You could've called and I--
-This was an excuse.

463
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,265
Is Hae-won doing well?

464
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,726
Yes.

465
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:14,917
The truth is…

466
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,630
I liked you.

467
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,049
What?

468
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,552
For a long time.

469
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:29,932
For…

470
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,601
a very long time.

471
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,735
I didn't know.

472
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,030
What if you had known?

473
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,331
Even so,

474
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,043
nothing would have changed.

475
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:07,970
I see.

476
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,562
That's okay.

477
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,732
I expected it.

478
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,571
Thanks for the coffee. I'll go now.

479
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:41,045
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

480
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,063
But you know what?

481
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,400
Guess what?

482
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,486
I have a crush on someone.

483
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,029
Who is it?

484
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,449
The loner in our class
who's always reading!

485
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,661
I like him so much!

486
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,251
I liked you first.

487
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:36,267
Right. I know it doesn't matter.

488
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,519
Hae-won.

489
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:40,896
What is it?

490
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,566
-You're lucky.
-Look at these flowers.

491
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,775
I want them, too.

492
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,153
Hae-won has always been
the center of attention.

493
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,237
Go on!

494
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,201
I'm so jealous.

495
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,624
Even you, who would rather remain
at the edge of the frame,

496
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,130
followed her with your eyes.

497
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,519
Look.

498
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,026
I'm here too.

499
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,531
I also exist.

500
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,878
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

501
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:58,974
Just like this.

502
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,186
I also…

503
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,524
exist.

504
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,503
Hi, Jang-u.

505
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,630
-Is this Eun-sil?
-Yes.

506
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,966
Is it this hard to have a call with you?

507
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,133
Our timing's been off.

508
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,393
EUN-SIL

509
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,656
Su-yeon in Class Two likes you.

510
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,034
Whatever. I'm not interested in girls.

511
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,705
You guys should stop dating and gossiping.

512
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,207
How will you go to college?
You even have bad grades.

513
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,632
Sorry!

514
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,308
Hey!

515
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:28,897
-What is it? A girl?
-Yes?

516
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:31,066
-Me?
-You said you're not interested in girls.

517
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,611
Right, I'm not interested in girls…

518
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,277
-Hey.
-I'm back.

519
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,112
It's cold.

520
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,031
Why aren't you in bed? It's bedtime.

521
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:36,924
THIS IS MY FIRST LOVE LETTER TO YOU
NO. 133

522
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,177
TONIGHT, I THINK ABOUT
HOW I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE CABIN…

523
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,266
This is my first love letter to you.

524
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:50,938
That day,

525
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,732
on the other side of the window,

526
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,200
I saw you with a hurt look on your face
that was just like mine.

527
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,304
I should go. Wait.

528
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,224
No, I shouldn't.

529
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,184
I'd feel bad.

530
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,689
I forgot all that was in my head…

531
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,694
and followed you.

532
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:42,674
The train will be arriving
at Cheongdo Station.

533
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,384
Please be ready.

534
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,094
Thank you.

535
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,390
You got off at Cheongdo Station.

536
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,823
A town with many persimmon trees.

537
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,805
It had clear water flowing
from the Nakdong River.

538
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:36,812
And I was afraid you might jump into it.

539
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:57,332
Hello, Ms. Sim. I'm Im Eun-seop,
the son of Mr. Im Jong-pil--

540
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,921
Yes, Myeong-yeo.

541
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:07,759
It's just that I'm at this place.

542
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,721
Do you have some time right now?

543
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,105
No, the thing is…

544
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,084
CAMPING SITE

545
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,936
Yes, I'm almost there.

546
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,272
Please drive faster.

547
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,274
I'm driving as fast as I can.

548
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,985
But why did she come all the way here?

549
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,704
I called your aunt,

550
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,216
but I was still afraid.

551
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,220
I was afraid you might die.

552
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,309
That you might die.

553
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:27,816
Hey, Mok Hae-won!

554
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,026
Mok Hae-won!

555
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,862
Come here. Let's go.

556
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:34,656
-You're hurting me.
-Are you insane?

557
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,868
What were you thinking?

558
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:57,846
And I think…

559
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:05,270
that was our first autumn trip together.

560
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,318
I escaped!

561
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,406
Good job.

562
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,533
It was so hard to get out.

563
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,035
My aunt wasn't sleeping

564
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,412
so I had to wait
until things quieted down.

565
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,001
-What were you doing?
-Nothing.

566
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,920
What is it?

567
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,589
-Tell me.
-Wait.

568
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,424
What's going on?

569
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,511
-Just, it's nothing.
-What is it?

570
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,263
Now I'm getting upset.

571
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,600
I was just ordering something online…

572
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,270
You know, online shopping.

573
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,939
Okay. Then let me see it.

574
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,318
-Gosh, seriously? This is upsetting.
-It's not what you think.

575
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:55,695
I'm upset.

576
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:56,988
But Hae-won, it's nothing.

577
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,657
I get jealous easily.

578
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,117
To chop wood,

579
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,371
you have to relax, even your arms.

580
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:11,628
Place the edge of the ax along the grain
because that's where the wood splits.

581
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,255
Now, look.

582
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,881
-Can you stand back?
-Okay.

583
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,729
This is how not to do it.
I did that on purpose to show you.

584
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,482
-Okay.
-All right.

585
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,860
So this is how you do it.

586
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,154
Like I said,

587
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,198
-find where the wood wants to split.
-Okay.

588
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:42,325
All right.

589
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,794
Gosh. There's a chip on the blade.

590
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,297
It's chipped.

591
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:57,591
Want to try?

592
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,426
Me? Can I?

593
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,886
-Of course.
-Really?

594
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,929
It probably won't work, though.

595
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,764
Right. You couldn't do it either.

596
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,727
I've tried doing this
only for fun back home.

597
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,437
Just to let off some steam.

598
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,981
-Place your hand over here.
-Okay.

599
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,067
And hold this at the back.

600
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:19,279
-Aim and then chop.
-Okay.

601
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,282
But you were swinging it
all the way back, like this.

602
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,075
That's only for experts.

603
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,202
-I see. And this is for beginners?
-Yes.

604
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,830
-Yes. Just drop your ax from here.
-Okay.

605
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,000
Try this.

606
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,629
So I should do this, and then…

607
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:40,091
Like this?

608
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:45,680
How did you do that?

609
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,892
I did what you taught me.

610
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,185
I see.

611
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,312
Was it your first time?

612
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:58,151
But now my shoulders are sore.

613
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,695
I think I've used up all my strength.
Can you do it?

614
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:01,613
All right.

615
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,491
I showed you how not to do it.

616
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,910
I'll really show you how it's done.

617
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,913
I'm waiting. Go ahead.

618
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,460
-Now watch.
-Okay.

619
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,463
-It's dangerous, stand back.
-I will.

620
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:33,645
I give up.

621
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,105
Eun-seop.

622
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:36,690
Eun-seop!

623
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:02,882
Mrs. Kim!

624
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,968
BOGUK MILL, VARIOUS OILS

625
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:06,886
Mrs. Kim!

626
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,724
You're too early. The crushed red pepper
won't be ready until later.

627
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,684
Hey, did you hear the news?

628
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,602
Min-jeong went missing!

629
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:18,565
You know who she is, right?
She's the one who recently passed

630
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,733
the civil service exam!

631
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,860
The third daughter
of that red-roof house at the roundabout?

632
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:24,654
That's right. She went missing.

633
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,072
I'm back.

634
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:30,160
-That's terrible.
-So the whole town is on the lookout.

635
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,746
Jong-pil's son, Eun-seop, rushed over.

636
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,497
Why did he do that?

637
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:36,875
Who knows? But he's the one…

638
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,753
who used to live in the mountains.

639
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:43,214
So he was asked to search for her
in the area where she went missing.

640
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:45,175
Goodness. I hope they find her.

641
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:47,635
Yes, I hope so too.

642
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,471
And the weather is so cold.

643
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:52,223
Let's head over there
to see if we can help.

644
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,059
-Let's go.
-All right.

645
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,562
-Why did you come here and not home?
-What?

646
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,732
Wait. Let's bring over
some hot coffee in a tumbler.

647
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:03,985
Do you have any Korean rice cakes?
Roasted soybean would be nice.

648

GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

649
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,547
What should I do?

650
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,091
What is it?

651
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,928
I really like you.

652
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,472
What do I do?

653
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:31,197
How about you?

654
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,492
Likewise.

655
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,758
It's true, Eun-seop.

656
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,971
Even the small and insignificant
have feelings.

657
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:07,066
What do you want to drink? I'll get…

658
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,943
What's up?

659
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,739
I thought it might be urgent.

660
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:14,908
Is something going on?

661
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,244

666
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:53,613
I just want you…

667
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,659
to know.

668
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:02,539
In any way possible,

669
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,084
whatever it takes,

670
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:09,963
I want you…

671
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,424
-Let's do it!
-No, I'm okay.

672
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,009
Please, just this once.

673
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,845
You really don't want to?
When it's with me?

674
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,138
But you said you use a hot iron.

675
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:22,058
No. That was clearly a joke.
Did you believe that?

676
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,394
-Hang on.
-Let's do it.

POSTED BY SEOP

681
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:23,077
This is my first love letter to you.

682
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:28,082
That day, on the other side of the window,

683
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,087
I saw you with a hurt look on your face
that was just like mine.

684
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:38,217
I should go. No, I shouldn't.
I'd feel bad.

685
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:43,222
I forgot all that was in my head
and followed you.

686
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:45,683
A town with many persimmon trees.

687
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,227
It had clear water flowing
from the Nakdong River.

688
01:00:48,978 --> 01:00:53,107
And I was afraid you might jump into it.

689
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:56,235
I called your aunt,
but I was still afraid.

690
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,112
I was afraid you might die.

691
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:04,243
And I think that was
our first autumn trip together.

692
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,500
I want you to come and rescue me.

693
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:12,168
I'll wait.

694
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:13,586
-Hello, Eun-sil.
-What the…

695
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,463
-So you're going to a nice place later?
-What?

696
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,006
I'll be there too.

697
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,424
I'm Irene?

698
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:21,427
Could you tell me how far you got?

699
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,262
Can you tell me it's all a lie?

700
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,931
I've lost my light.

701
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,474
Now I have nothing.

702
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:27,600
I wish you a good life.

703
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,812
I understand you'll be leaving
this place someday.

704
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:33,773
However, I hope your heart
won't feel too heavy.

705
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,858
I'm preparing for it all.

706
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:43,491
