1
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,496
I took about 500 steps from the entrance.

2
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,248
So I should turn around…

3
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,119
Hae-won,

4
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,079
what are you doing here?

5
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,658
I'm sorry.

6
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,787
I was so scared thinking I got lost.

7
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,377
You must be cold.

8
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:15,630
Let's go.

9
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,003
You can go up first.

10
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:20,880
It's green tea.

11
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,403
When I was little,

12
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,615
my mom wasn't at home from time to time.

13
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,633
On some days,

14
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,427
my mom wouldn't be there when I woke up.

15
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,804
Mom!

16
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,848
Oddly, on those days,

17
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,476
I'd feel anxious all day.

18
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,187
I thought…

19
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,941
she might not come back.

20
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,444
Mom?

21
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,326
When I was looking for you earlier,

22
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,580
the same feeling suddenly came over me.

23
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,591
You shouldn't go up the mountain at night.

24
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,053
I was just going to go
to the entrance and turn back.

25
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,851
You can get lost
very easily in the mountains.

26
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:04,775
Finish your tea and get to bed.

27
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,287
What about you?

28
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,375
How can you roam around there so freely?

29
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,879
Do you know your way around?

30
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,841
Because I'm familiar with it.

31
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,138
That's why.

32
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,601
But you aren't.

33
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,229
So don't ever go up the mountain
at night by yourself.

34
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,309
2020 SCHOOL YEAR NEW STUDENT ORIENTATION

35
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,977
Get out of my way!

36
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:06,897
Out of my way!

37
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,784
-Hey.
-Gosh!

38
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,412
Goodness. What?

39
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,457
I got new information on Kim Yeong-su.

40
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,292
-Why didn't you come?
-Okay. How much?

41
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,129
What? He's totally broke.

42
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,174
Did you steal your dad's wallet again?

43
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,592
No, it's my brother's.

44
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,595
I got it. Wait!

45
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,306
What? What is it this time?

46
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,643
Yeong-su likes reading books.

47
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,144
What?

48
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,648
-What's wrong?
-Are you kidding me?

49
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,816
"Yeong-su eats three meals a day."

50
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,652
Why not call that new information?

51
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,988
Hey! He's at the top of the class.
Of course, he likes books!

52
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,783
Give me back my money.

53
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,285
No. I meant he likes fiction.

54
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,788
-Fiction?
-Yes.

55
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,457
He loves fiction, so that's all he reads,

56
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,168
and he wants to become a writer too.

57
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:10,586
Fiction?

58
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,172
Like the weird stories my brother writes?

59
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,215
Yes, like that.

60
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,843
Hey, that's it? You got nothing else?

61
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:19,887
Darn it.

62
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,683
What's this?

63
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,095
You're up?

64
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,347
Yes. You're up too?

65
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,682
Yes.

66
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm going into town later.

67
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,026
For what?

68
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,239
To do laundry.
I don't have a washing machine at home.

69
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,241
I usually do it at my parents',

70
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,702
but since you have laundry too…

71
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,248
Want to come with?

72
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,002
Sure.

73
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,092
Go wash up then.

74
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,660
You're not going to the ice rink today?

75
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,748
No. My dad is meeting his friends
today and tomorrow,

76
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,249
so the ice rink is closed.

77
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,626
I see. That's good.

78
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,798
-By the way, Eun-seop.
-Yes?

79
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,052
You said Hwi is Irene, right?

80
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,724
Then when you were drunk the other day,

81
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,187
why did you say,
"I'm so glad you're here, Irene"?

82
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,025
-Why, Eun-seop?
-Well…

83
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,613
-The thing is…
-Did Hwi come back from somewhere?

84
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,660
Yes. Where was it again?

85
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,870
I can't recall…

86
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,038
I didn't think so.

87
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,666
It sounded like you were saying it
to someone you love.

88
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,417
Right? The thing is…

89
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,794
It isn't Hwi, is it?

90
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,713
Come on…

91
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:01,882
I'm getting a call.

92
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,055
Hello, sir.

93
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,104
-Good work today, Bo-yeong.
-Thank you.

94
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,657
-Eun-seop.
-Yes?

95
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,951
So where had Hwi gone off to?

96
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:12,786
A retreat?

97
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,705
-Hello.
-Did you miss Hwi?

98
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,748
-Welcome.
-Did you?

99
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,386
Mok Hae-won.

100
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,894
Hold the banner up higher!

101
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,979
-Take it now.
-Higher. A little more.

102
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,316
2020 KICK-OFF CEREMONY

103
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,734
Everyone, say "Hyecheon!"

104
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,653
-Hyecheon!
-Hyecheon!

105
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,820
One, two, three.

106
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,614
-Got it.
-Okay.

107
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:54,203
With that, we'll conclude
the 2020 kick-off ceremony!

108
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,791
Let's take a quick break here
and head down.

109
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,168
-All right!
-I'll roll this up and bring it down.

110
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,086
-Okay.
-Great.

111
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,880
It'll take a long time to get down.

112
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,677
Once again,
we kicked off the year by hiking.

113
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,181
I bought these hiking boots when I heard
we hike to kick off the new year.

114
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,059
I can't believe I've already
been wearing them for five years.

115
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,520
I got mine this year too.
I'll use them again, right?

116
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,649
But it's not so bad
to start the year off by hiking.

117
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,529
It feels like I'm getting a whole year's
worth of exercise in one go.

118
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,281
But I still don't like it.

119
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,366
Keep up the effort.

120
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,912
-Did you sell a lot?
-Yes.

121
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:39,915
My goodness. Min-jeong, aren't you cold?

122
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,001
I'm fine.

123
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,503
I was coming down with a cold,
but I'm okay now.

124
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,297
I'll be fine
if I take some medicine afterward.

125
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,550
No, I meant your shoes.

126
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,637
-She's right. Your feet must be freezing.
-No, they're not.

127
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,764
I'm okay.

128
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,641
Be careful. You might get frostbite.

129
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,559
Okay.

130
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,146
You should get hiking boots
when you get your first paycheck.

131
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,439
They're worth it.

132
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,066
-They last a long time.
-They last a while. Get a pair.

133
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,862
-Yes, get a pair.
-Come on! Let's get down quickly.

134
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:13,449
We need to get down quickly to have time
for drinks with scallion pancakes.

135
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,117
Come on. Hurry!

136
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,202
-My goodness, sir.
-Wait for us!

137
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,246
Goodness, I'm so tired.

138
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:23,042
I'll take these.
Min-jeong, you can take the bag.

139
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,793
Wait for us!

140
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,893
Goodness.

141
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,813
-Excuse me.
-One moment, please.

142
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,658
I saw Eun-seop's car
as I was leaving the academy.

143
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,118
Did you follow us?

144
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:01,830
Yes.

145
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,009
-Hae-won…
-"There was a misunderstanding."

146
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,972
You told everyone that, so I already know.

147
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:19,890
That's because…

148
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,850
Explain the next part.

149
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,688
What was it that I misunderstood?

150
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,241
There was a misunderstanding.

151
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,325
Hey, Bo-yeong!

152
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,746
You're close to Hae-won, aren't you?

153
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,789
Yes, I am.

154
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,376
Then you must also know
why she came alone to live here.

155
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,419
Hey, is that true?

156
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,131
She came here after causing trouble
at her previous school?

157
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,132
What?

158
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,425
I heard that she was pregnant.

159
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,136
That's not true.

160
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,429
What?

161
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,725
But someone from
her old neighborhood said that.

162
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,561
No, it's totally not true.

163
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,271
Maybe you have it wrong.

164
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,065
Seriously, that's not why she came here.

165
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:10,983
Then what?

166
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,860
What's the reason?

167
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,069
Come on, tell me.

168
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,072
I guess you're not that close to her.

169
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,535
Hey guys, big news!

170
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,995
-What?
-Did you guys know?

171
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,290
-What?
-Mok Hae-won's mom killed someone.

172
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,668
Hae-won's mom is a murderer!

173
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,253
-Seriously?
-Yes!

174
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,856
Mok Hae-won's mom killed someone.

175
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,237
Oh, that girl Hae-won?
The one who plays cello?

176
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,156
Yes, that one.

177
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,617
Do you know why she came here
to live with her aunt?

178
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,579
Isn't it strange
that she doesn't live with her mom?

179
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:10,584
Only Ju-hui…

180
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,670
I only told Ju-hui.

181
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,341
Because she was
spreading rumors about you.

182
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,344
And Ju-hui promised me

183
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,889
that she would never tell anyone.

184
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,849
She promised me.

185
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,894
I won't tell anyone.

186
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,526
Not a single soul.

187
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,196
No, not a single soul.

188
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,369
Don't cry.

189
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,205
You too.

190
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,377
You also promised me
that you wouldn't tell anyone.

191
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,133
-But I trusted Ju-hui.
-I trusted you too.

192
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,928
But Ju-hui was spreading…

193
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,347
Bad rumors. So you did that for me?

194
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,690
Thanks, Bo-yeong. But…

195
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,822
That would've been better.

196
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,408
-What?
-I said that would've been better.

197
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,703
What do you mean?

198
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,080
To have bad rumors spread about me.

199
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,168
How would that have been better?

200
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,296
If rumors about you being pregnant…

201
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,089
At least that wasn't true.

202
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,217
It wasn't true,

203
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,264
so I wouldn't have cared,
no matter how much I was ridiculed for it.

204
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,181
However…

205
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,310
I heard her mom killed her dad.

206
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,979
-Her mom is a murderer.
-Her mom is a murderer?

207
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,731
Because that was true about my mom…

208
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,067
-That's Mok Hae-won.
-So scary.

209
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,652
Because it was so true…

210
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,742
I really couldn't be okay with it.

211
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,536
-If I were her…
-That's Mok Hae-won.

212
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,128
Thanks for the coffee.

213
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,005
Hae-won.

214
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,593
Hae-won!

215
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,223
Mok Hae-won!

216
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:39,941
Is that why…

217
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,444
"Is that why" what?

218
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,365
Is that why you still can't forgive me?

219
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,793
Frankly, it wasn't entirely my fault.

220
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,337
So how could you…

221
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,799
do this to me over one mistake?

222
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,643
Bo-yeong,

223
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,439
you're still good at pretending
to be a victim in front of others.

224
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,025
What?

225
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,447
Mok Hae-won!

226
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,210
DRY CLEANERS

227
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,336
Call me when it's done.

228
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,963
-Stay for lunch.
-Next time.

229
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,423
Okay. Please send my regards.

230
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,466
-Thank you.
-Bye.

231
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,484
Since we're in town, should we go…

232
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,694
Not to my aunt.

233
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,405
Okay, got it.

234
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,491
-Eun-seop.
-Yes?

235
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,121
Is it okay if I get some headache pills?

236
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,415
-Sure, of course.
-Sorry.

237
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,346
Hello.

238
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,057
Can I have some headache pills?
Strong ones.

239
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,895
My goodness. Your aunt just got some too.

240
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,063
-My aunt?
-Yes.

241
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,525
It should be enough to share.

242
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,363
Excuse me.
Can I have athlete's foot ointment too?

243
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,115
You have athlete's foot?

244
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,284
-For which area?
-Toenails.

245
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,493
You have athlete's foot?

246
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,996
Why are you irritated with me already?

247
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,831
Answer me. You have athlete's foot?

248
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,958
-No.
-Then why are you buying the ointment?

249
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,377
Don't yell. Have you gone mad?

250
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,254
It's for Su-jeong! Satisfied?

251
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,797
Excuse me.

252
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,008
You're disrupting my business.

253
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,802
PHARMACY

254
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,064
Eun-seop! Lower the window.

255
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,149
Lower it all the way.
Give me some allowance.

256
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,110
-It's been so long since the last time.
-Fine, I will. Wait.

257
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,862
I know you're trying to avoid it.

258
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,865
-Hello, Jang-u?
-Jang-u, can you give me some allowance?

259
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,117
-Eun-seop, we have a situation.
-What?

260
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,411
What do you mean?

261
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,541
Where are you?

262
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,461
Hello, ma'am.

263
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,047
Do you have hand warmers?
Can I get about 100…

264
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,800
if you don't mind?

265
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,177
And why do you need so many hand warmers?

266
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,389
You haven't heard?
It's complete chaos right now.

267
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,725
Someone went missing in the mountains,
so the whole town is going crazy.

268
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,143
Someone went missing?

269
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,353
Who?

270
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,689
The new employee at City Hall.

271
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:06,982
-Choi Min-jeong?
-What?

272
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,149
You know her?

273
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,151
The third daughter of the red-roof house.

274
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,279
The one who just passed
the civil service exam

275
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,905
and got a job at City Hall?

276
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,242
Her mom was so happy
that her daughter became a civil servant.

277
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,120
Are you saying
she went missing in the mountains?

278
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,080
Yes, so I heard…

279
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,499
-Then what do we do now?
-Listen!

280
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,168
You're all here. Hello.

281
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,628
Something terrible happened.

282
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,548
Jang-u's coworker
just went missing in the mountains.

283
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,757
What should we do?

284
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,592
That's what I just told you about.

285
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,511
MOUNT INAK RECREATIONAL FOREST

286
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,937
On the way down, she said she wanted rest…

287
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,814
Hello.

288
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,985
Someone saw her last
sitting on the stone wall earlier,

289
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,069
but didn't walk down together.

290
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,821
-Jang-u! Come here.
-Yes, sir.

291
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,614
Hello.

292
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,451
I asked around already.

293
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:02,996
No one has seen her down here
after she took a break on the stone wall.

294
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,499
No one walked down with her,
and she was last seen taking a break.

295
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,001
How long has she been missing?

296
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,962
I'd say about 40 minutes
since we came down the mountain.

297
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,464
We checked immediately after.

298
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,471
Jang-u.

299
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:20,972
Eun-seop.

300
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,850
-We haven't found her yet.
-Really?

301
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:25,935
We filed a report, so everyone is here,

302
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:28,521
medics, police, and firemen.
But they haven't found her.

303
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,648
When was she last seen?

304
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,484
You came down together, didn't you?

305
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,735
We did.

306
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,362
Then what happened?

307
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,868
We're almost there. Just 40 more minutes!

308
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,870
Hang in there! Hurry!

309
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,873
Sir, I'm so tired.

310
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,792
What's our reward once we get down?

311
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,336
I said I'll buy you drinks
with scallion pancakes.

312
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,253
Come on, hurry!

313
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,631
Karaoke after? How's that sound, Jang-u?

314
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,883
-Sounds good to me.
-No thanks.

315
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,385
The chief hogs the microphone.

316
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:01,554
Then we can get
a separate room from the chief.

317
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,306
Everything will be okay then.

318
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,184
I heard Min-jeong is a great singer.

319
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,436
Really? We have to hear her sing then.

320
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,023
Ji-yeon, do you know where Min-jeong is?

321
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,651
She was lagging a bit behind.
She should be in the back.

322
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,363
Have you seen Choi Min-jeong?

323
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:19,989
No, I haven't.

324
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,618
I saw her in the back earlier.
She was resting, saying she had chills.

325
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,953
She's probably in the back.

326
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,003
I think she went missing
40 minutes before we got down.

327
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,922
A little below the midpoint then.

328
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,717
She was last seen resting on a rock.

329
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,594
Then she must've gotten lost
after falling behind.

330
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,013
It's easy to slip there.

331
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,932
It'd make it easier if she'd yell out.

332
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,144
No, they're not.

333
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,103
I'm okay.

334
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,486
Once it gets dark, it's over.
It gets very cold on the mountain.

335
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:02,907
But Eun-seop…

336
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,245
The sun is setting already.

337
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,339
If you can hear us, please answer!

338
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,384
-Min-jeong!
-Min-jeong!

339
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:24,763
Min-jeong!

340
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,890
Where are you?

341
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,224
Are you out there?

342
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,193
Requesting backup
on the missing person case.

343
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,861
Min-jeong!

344
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,742
Thank you so much. It's cold out here.

345
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,619
My goodness. It's so cold.

346
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,078
MISSING: CHOI MIN-JEONG (FEMALE)

347
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,038
Oh, dear.

348
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,553
-Choi Min-jeong!
-Min-jeong!

349
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,450
-I'm going.
-Hey.

350
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:30,787
Right.

351
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,247
-I'm really going.
-See you.

352
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,456
Min-jeong!

353
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,418
-Where are you?
-Min-jeong!

354
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,838
-Min-jeong!
-Can you hear us?

355
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,189
Choi Min-jeong!

356
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,925
Choi Min-jeong!

357
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,263
Choi Min-jeong!

358
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,104
Min-jeong!

359
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,779
-Where are you?
-Can you hear us?

360
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,989
Can you hear us?

361
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,867
If you can hear us, please yell!

362
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,244
Can you hear us?

363
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,622
Choi Min-jeong!

364
00:31:58,416 --> 00:31:59,959
Where are you?

365
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,007
Choi Min-jeong!

366
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,310
-Min-jeong!
-Can you hear us?

367
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,146
-Min-jeong!
-Where are you?

368
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,986
-They still haven't found her?
-No.

369
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,113
It's taking a long time.

370
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,867
Everyone's looking for that woman, right?

371
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:33,785
Yes.

372
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,663
So the police and Eun-seop
are working together?

373
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:40,208
No, Eun-seop is on his own
on a path they aren't familiar with.

374
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,628
A path they aren't familiar with? Alone?

375
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,297
He needs to search the areas they'll miss.

376
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,342
There are some mountain paths
only Eun-seop knows about.

377
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,886
Isn't that more dangerous?

378
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:55,348
Hae-won, I told you
my brother is a wild beast.

379
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,433
This mountain is different.

380
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,602
It's not a small hill
in the back of a village.

381
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:00,895
I asked someone earlier.

382
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,815
They said it takes
more than three hours to get to the top.

383
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,859
It wouldn't matter to Eun-seop at all.

384
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,571
She's right, Hae-won.
No one is worried about Eun-seop.

385
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,240
Why wouldn't you worry?

386
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,157
Why not?

387
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,243
Why…

388
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,538
Why does everyone assume it's okay
to ask Eun-seop to do this?

389
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,622
Why?

390
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,582
Isn't it dangerous? Can't he get hurt?

391
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,084
He's human like the rest of us.

392
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,337
Why does everyone
ask him to do this like it's nothing?

393
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,633
Wow, you sound exactly like my mom.

394
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,764
Why did you ask Eun-seop to come?

395
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,308
-You know how he is.
-Come on, honey.

396
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,352
-Oh, my goodness.
-Come here.

397
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,729
If something happens to him,

398
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,314
-I won't let you off the hook.
-Leave him alone. Come here.

399
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,649
-Come.
-I'm so upset.

400
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,527
Hae-won, my brother
is gifted at climbing mountains.

401
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,404
That's why everyone asks him.

402
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,032
Still…

403
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,617
He is taking longer than usual.

404
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,911
Gosh. He's worrying me.

405
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:05,626
We found her!

406
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,628
Hae-won, they found her! Thank goodness!

407
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,712
My goodness, Min-jeong.

408
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,966
Thank you, Eun-seop. Thank you so much.

409
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:58,137
Thank you so much, Eun-seop.

410
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,066
Thank you so much.

411
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,275
You worked so hard.

412
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,867
Hae-won!

413
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,331
Come on.

414
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,263
It was a close call today, wasn't it?

415
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,816
Don't go next time.

416
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,487
Even if they ask you for help.

417
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,864
Just say no.

418
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,575
How can he do that?

419
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,786
He's the only one who--

420
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,871
But what if he gets hurt doing that?

421
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,999
Don't you see his face?

422
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,917
Look at what happened!

423
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,545
He's a human too.

424
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,630
He's not a wolf or an animal.

425
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,048
He can get hurt too!

426
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,342
If he runs up and down
such a big mountain alone,

427
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,261
he'll get hurt too!

428
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,266
They look for Eun-seop
whenever something happens in this town.

429
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,686
I was about to go crazy
thinking something might happen to him.

430
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,231
Mom, how come
everything makes you go crazy?

431
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,192
You said yesterday
that my grades were making you go crazy.

432
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,402
Hey!

433
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,571
Dad, laundry is a living being.
It has a life--

434
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,157
-Don't touch it with your dirty--
-Have this.

435
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,326
Mother, I'm okay.

436
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:51,287
I'm really…

437
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,167
Isn't it delicious?

438
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,169
-It's really delicious.
-Gosh, her nagging.

439
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,089
Come in.

440
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,092
Hae-won, do you need anything?

441
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,094
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

442
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,638
Good night then.

443
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,390
Good night.

444
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,322
You must have no fear.

445
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,990
You shouldn't go there at night.

446
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,368
But Eun-seop did.

447
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,161
That's because he's a wild beast.

448
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,543
Hae-won.

449
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,648
Mother.

450
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:03,776
Forget it.

451
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:17,915
I was supposed to go with the rescue team.

452
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,709
But I felt more comfortable going alone.

453
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,962
And it's faster that way too.

454
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,385
From now on,
don't go up the mountain alone.

455
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,221
Don't go up the mountain out back either.
Nor to that house…

456
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:34,974
Ever again.

457
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,942
If you get injured in the mountains,
who will rescue you?

458
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,902
I can't.

459
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,614
Nor can your dad or Hwi. So--

460
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,533
All three of you can rescue me together.

461
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:54,076
What?

462
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,455
If you, Dad, and Hwi all work together,

463
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,166
you'd be able to save me…

464
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,043
don't you think?

465
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,253
Forget it.

466
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,504
Don't ever go up again.

467
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,841
I'm going to get really angry next time.

468
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:12,136
But you're already angry at him.
What do you mean by next time?

469
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,262
-Hey.
-Mom.

470
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,139
Dad wants more roasted sweet potatoes.

471
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,808
-What?
-I'm not the one who is asking.

472
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,186
Dad's the one who's being oblivious.

473
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,188
-Gosh, he's so…
-I'll bring him some.

474
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:27,651
Why did you give Eun-seop
all the roasted sweet potatoes?

475
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,612
Dad and I want to eat them too.

476
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,614
But you already ate a lot!

477
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,616
I gave a bite to Dad too!

478
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,036
You ate the most. I saw it.

479
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,913
Dad, Mom is so weird!

480
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,957
She's like a thug. She keeps cursing.

481
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,501
What? I didn't curse.

482
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,962
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

483
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:52,426
On a cold day like this,
draft beer is the best.

484
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,721
The weather is crazy.
It's minus 17 degrees Celsius.

485
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,431
-You're here.
-Want a glass of beer?

486
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,682
Yes, please.

487
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,685
Frankly speaking,
I prefer soju on a cold day like this.

488
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,022
Slightly frozen soju
paired with spicy braised chicken.

489
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,067
-Soju freezes right at this temperature.
-Exactly.

490
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,778
What about beer?
What's beer's freezing point?

491
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,112
Minus four degrees Celsius.

492
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:15,241
Seung-ho, one second.

493
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,201
You didn't have to.

494
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,537
-Enjoy the pie.
-Thank you.

495
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,414
-You really didn't have to.
-It's nothing.

496
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:42,935
For you, Seung-ho.

497
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:45,646
You just kept it outside?

498
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,898
Yes, it's practically a freezer out there.

499
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,527
Now that we're all here,
shall we continue?

500
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,159
"I received a letter
that tied up yesterday."

501
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:03,581
"The path that always followed you
suddenly disappeared."

502
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,083
"So did other things that are not paths."

503
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:10,754
"The stones that used to play with us
in our childhood

504
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,840
are embedded everywhere,
hiding their faces."

505
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,019
"I love you. I love you."

506
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,062
"In the cold evening sky…

507
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,154
you can see
the thoroughly shattered lines."

508
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,489
"The snow falls sparsely."

509
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,830
"A few flakes of snow
are unable to land anywhere

510
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,458
and keep floating around,
wide-eyed and trembling,

511
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,752
endlessly."

512
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,274
A Little Love Song by Hwang Dong-gyu.

513
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,361
I want them to land on me.

514
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,491
Poems and fiction
that go well with winter.

515
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:21,575
Who's next?

516
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,952
Jang-u, read something
that will make us feel even colder.

517
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,539
I'm going to read
Natasha, the White Donkey, and Me.

518
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:28,999
Oh, that…

519
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,168
You're into foreigners too?

520
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,337
My goodness.

521
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,172
What the heck?

522
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,591
You said "Natasha."
You're interested in foreigners.

523
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,343
I see. Foreigners.

524
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,055
People prefer foreigners now.
They can speak other languages too.

525
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,807
What are you talking about?

526
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,768
Whatever. It's a total mess.

527
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,562
-Irene, my foot.
-But you picked a good book.

528
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,524
Do you often hear
that you resemble a donkey?

529
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,734
What do you mean?
I don't look like a donkey.

530
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,154
Why are you laughing? I don't.

531
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:02,157
-See you next week.
-Take care.

532
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,284
-Let's go together.
-Come on, hurry.

533
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,577
I heard this by chance.

534
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:10,040
Red ginseng is an excellent cure
for athlete's foot!

535
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,250
-Eun-seop.
-Yes?

536
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,502
-Min-jeong wants to see you.
-Why?

537
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,133
To thank him. He saved her life.

538
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,677
-I just--
-Let's set a date later. Bye.

539
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,054
-Bye.
-See you.

540
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:25,722
Goodness.

541
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,898
-Should we clean up now?
-Yes, sure.

542
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,194
Wait.

543
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,622
You can wear these.

544
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,084
What is it?

545
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,462
Well…

546
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,425
They're shoes.

547
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,052
I don't want you to wear those.

548
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,183
Why not?

549
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,893
"Why not?"

550
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,609
Because we're in the countryside, and…

551
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:21,945
the roads are a bit rough too.

552
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,281
In any case, wear them.

553
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,037
Where are you going?

554
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:31,830
To the bathroom.

555
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,881
It really is a relief.

556
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,674
Eun-seop is safe and didn't get hurt.

557
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,928
Right. I was so worried
because he was taking so long.

558
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:48,180
I almost forgot, Jang-u.

559
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,849
My mom is waiting to kill you.

560
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,352
I had no choice.

561
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:57,105
Imagine how desperate I must've felt
to have asked Eun-seop.

562
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,899
Do you like her?

563
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,943
What are you talking about?

564
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,654
No, it was simply
because of my love for all humanity…

565
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,322
Don't worry, Jang-u.

566
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,866
I doubt my mom would
actually go so far as to kill you.

567
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,660
She wouldn't, right?

568
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:12,246
Of course not.
She'll just hate you to death.

569
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,832
She's going to make a voodoo doll of you
and prick it with a needle.

570
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:18,585
"I'm not going to let this slide."

571
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,962
"I'm going to kill him."

572
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,050
But I can understand how his mother feels.

573
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:28,095
To be honest, just because
he navigates the mountains well,

574
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,597
everyone in this town relies on Eun-seop.

575
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,225
But he's still their precious son.

576
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,270
You're right. I'm completely to blame.

577
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,230
I'm just saying that's how she must feel.

578
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,232
By the way, Mr. Bae.

579
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:44,486
Were you ever the top student
in your school?

580
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,529
No.

581
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:47,281
Never.

582
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,492
-That's difficult to achieve.
-Right.

583
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,161
Gosh, then who might have?

584
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:56,248
He is quite famous.

585
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,250
He was the top student for all 12 years.

586
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,961
You went to Seoul National University!

587
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,630
Yes, I went there.

588
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,882
Do you have a question
for the top student, Hwi?

589
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:07,801
What is it? Functions?

590
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,011
Quadratic equations?

591
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:09,928
I know. English?

592
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,055
Or do you want me to recite a poem?

593
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,348
If not, I can discuss

594
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,100
-the use of definite integrals--
-No.

595
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,059
-What?
-Jang-u.

596
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,814
What type of women do top students like?

597
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:22,482
What?

598
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,152
Give a real person as an example,
not Natasha.

599
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,821
A Korean, not a foreigner. Okay?

600
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,057
That must've hurt.

601
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:34,197
I'm so envious of you, Eun-seop.

602
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,200
Me?

603
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,579
Yes.

604
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,173
Your family is so warm.

605
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,433
My family feels

606
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,728
as cold as a freezer compartment.

607
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,530
I truly envy you.

608
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:20,494
You have so many people who love you.

609
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:40,138
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

610
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,015
Did you drink with Jong-min yesterday?

611
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:42,933
No.

612
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:44,851
No, I didn't.

613
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,728
Gosh, how did he know?

614
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,651
-Oh, no.
-You're here early, sir.

615
00:51:52,734 --> 00:51:54,653
A lot of deliveries for City Hall today.

616
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:55,862
Is that right?

617
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,405
I hope my package is here too.

618
00:51:58,698 --> 00:51:59,533
Goodbye, sir.

619
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,120
All right. Here we go.

620
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,498
Hello, Jang-u! Are you heading to work?

621
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,667
Hi, Min-jeong. Are you all right?

622
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,751
Yes, I am.

623
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,419
Why are you here? You should rest.

624
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:16,049
By the way, did you ask your friend?

625
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,175
My friend?

626
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,303
-You mean Eun-seop?
-Yes.

627
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,015
I asked him, but the thing is…

628
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,225
What did he say?

629
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,436
Well…

630
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,771
-Eun-seop.
-Yes?

631
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,315
-Min-jeong wants to see you.
-Why?

632
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,486
To thank him. He saved her life.

633
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:41,867
Well, he wants to get a meal with you,

634
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,828
but not now. In other words…

635
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,955
So he doesn't want to?

636
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:50,208
No, that's not it.

637
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,711
That's not what I meant.
He wants to eat with you.

638
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,045
Really?

639
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,256
-Yes, someday…
-What a relief!

640
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,883
I was so grateful to him.

641
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,467
I'm sure you felt very grateful.

642
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:02,345
One second, Min-jeong.
My phone keeps ringing.

643
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,472
-I'll go first.
-Yes, go ahead.

644
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:05,599
-See you later.
-Okay.

645
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,645
Hello, this is Lee Jang-u, the 42nd class…

646
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:11,688
Pardon me?

647
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,654
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

648
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,065
Hae-won.

649
00:54:03,531 --> 00:54:04,407
Hae-won.

650
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,168
Are you new here?

651
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,504
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

652
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,634
Ma'am, did you go see a doctor?

653
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,928
-Yes, I did. He said I'm okay.
-Did he? Great.

654
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,141
One cabbage pancake, please.

655
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,059
Okay.

656
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:33,478
-I'll get going.
-Eat first!

657
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,396
Next time.

658
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:57,836
Thank you.

659
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,700
HYECHEON LAKE FROZEN FESTIVAL

660
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:41,880
BUKHYUN-RI, HYECHEON, SEOHYEON

661
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,521
By any chance, are you Myeong-ju?

662
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:23,606
Hello.

663
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,527
You've aged quite a bit.

664
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:05,732
Mom.

665
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:43,520
BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

666
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,896
POSTED BY SEOP

667
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:47,690
Today at the book club,
we picked passages we like

668
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:50,109
from poems and fiction
that go well with winter.

669
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:55,365
She is settling in quite well
with our book club.

670
00:58:56,115 --> 00:59:00,620
She often reads the books
that other members have read.

671
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,831
I suddenly wondered
if she becomes curious about people

672
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,792
through their book choices.

673
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:12,799
If that's the case,
which book should I pick?

674
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,013
I wonder why she came here.

675
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,765
There must be another reason.

676
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:22,392
Why are you always so busy?

677
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,394
The Hyecheon High reunion, remember?

678
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:26,896
You know the 50th anniversary
reunion is in two days, right?

679
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,814
Everyone needs to attend.

680
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,900
Then what exactly
can I talk to you about, Mom?

681
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,444
Why you did that to Dad back then.

682
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,321
Whether the reason I know is true.

683
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,825
I'm done too,
but I have another engagement.

684
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,660
Is something going on?

685
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,495
You're still the same, Hae-won.

686
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:43,871
I'm the same too.

687
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:51,087
