1
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:41,833
Aunt.

2
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:44,836
Aunt.

3
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,881
Are you…

4
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,387
Aunt!

5
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,726
Aunt! What's wrong?

6
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,562
Aunt! Open your eyes!

7
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,776
Aunt, what's wrong? Wake up!

8
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:13,948
Should I tell you?

9
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,168
Aunt!

10
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,252
What's going on?

11
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,424
Aunt.

12
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,383
Aunt!

13
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,219
Aunt!

14
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:40,016
I always rehearse
going back to that day in my head.

15
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,320
If I go back to that day,

16
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,284
I feel as if I can get everything back.

17
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,166
All that I have missed.

18
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,420
I'm going to do everything with you!

19
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,260
I'm going to do everything with you.

20
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,019
Including this.

21
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,524
All that I have lost.

22
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,098
Please let me return
to be the person I was back then.

23
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,025
Please.

24
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,611
Please.

25
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,074
Let me be who I was.

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,671
This is a type of glaucoma
called closed-angle glaucoma.

27
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:38,760
She seems to have fainted
due to a buildup of intraocular pressure.

28
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:43,014
-In that case…
-We'll need to run some more tests,

29
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,143
but it seems she's almost lost
her vision in one eye.

30
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:55,401
But has she been neglecting
all the symptoms?

31
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,529
This must have been very painful.

32
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,075
Has your aunt seen a doctor?

33
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,785
She had an excruciating headache.

34
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,245
Your head hurts?

35
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,498
Yes. The pain is driving me insane.

36
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,543
At this stage,
she probably had terrible headaches

37
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,629
and eye pain.

38
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,715
Vomiting at times too.

39
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,510
It must have been hard to endure.

40
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,056
Is this her first time seeing
a doctor about this?

41
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,565
Hello?

42
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,567
Who is this?

43
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:37,986
It's me. Hae-won.

44
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,947
Mom, don't you recognize my voice?

45
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,708
Aunt fainted.

46
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,716
Did you hear me? She fainted.

47
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:06,723
Okay.

48
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,267
-What?
-I heard you.

49
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,730
Hello? Mom?

50
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,788
Hae-won.

51
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,722
Are you here with Ms. Sim Myeong-yeo?

52
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,015
Yes.

53
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,600
-I'll be back.
-Yes.

54
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,904
One short rib soup, please.

55
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,655
-A short rib soup for table three.
-Okay.

56
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,657
So Jang-u, are you going

57
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,534
-to the Town Hall later?
-Yes, I am.

58
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,204
Go eat lots and help out a lot.

59
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,330
Yes, I will.

60
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,666
By the way, I heard Ji Eun-sil
broke up with her boyfriend.

61
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,877
Pardon? Eun-sil… Pardon?

62
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,463
You know, the one who works
at the Gangneung City Hall.

63
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,298
The daughter of that side dish store?

64
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:25,384
That's right.
I heard she broke up with her boyfriend.

65
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,385
Oh, dear.

66
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,473
She had a boyfriend?

67
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,392
Yes, I heard he was
her colleague at City Hall.

68
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,270
Why do you sound amazed?

69
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,648
It's the sound I make
when I'm processing new info.

70
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,732
-I see.
-Got it.

71
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,442
Really?

72
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,862
But where do you get this new information
even I'm unaware of?

73
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,156
-My wife told me.
-I heard from Eun-sil's mom.

74
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,408
Do you two know each other?

75
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,370
Yes, her store is
inside our apartment complex.

76
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,831
You know the alterations shop next to it?

77
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,542
The one with three sons and a daughter?
Yeong-ran's family?

78
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,627
Yes, I know the family.
Why? Is something up?

79
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,630
I heard that they recently had twins.

80
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,550
Yes, Ji-hu and Chae-yeon.
They had fraternal twins.

81
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,179
Right, and Hyeon-a who works
at the market is getting married.

82
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,015
Yes, I know. She's marrying
Kim Cheon-sik, the math teacher.

83
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,809
That's right.

84
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:15,852
Lucky them.

85
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,776
So, when will you get married, Mr. Jang-u?

86
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,445
I haven't thought about it yet.

87
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,821
Why not?

88
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:28,656
I'm not sure.

89
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,701
Hello, sir.

90
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,119
-Here to drop off some rice?
-Yes.

91
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,788
I'll leave this here.

92
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,248
All right.

93
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,500
I can see that many
have already made donations.

94
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,836
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.

95
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,713
-She's the daughter of that family?
-Yes.

96
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,256
HYECHEON RICE CAKE FESTIVAL

97
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,507
In February,

98
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,426
the town holds

99
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,511
RICE CAKE FESTIVAL

100
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:54,223
a rice cake-making event
like the ones seen in the movies.

101
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,144
-Here you go.
-Have a drink!

102
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,563
-Goodness.
-Take a look at this.

103
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,690
-Oh, my.
-Can you bring that here?

104
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,942
-Come this way.
-Try this.

105
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,951
-My gosh.
-What are you doing?

106
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,578
That's when you know

107
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,166
winter is coming to an end

108
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,422
and spring is coming soon.

109
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,094
Oh, I want to try too.

110
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,388
-Shall we go together?
-Sure.

111
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,434
Hey, so what happened?

112
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,145
-What?
-Did she go to the hospital?

113
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,315
Yes, we took her there in Ji-Yeon's car.

114
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:48,027
Mom, it was shocking.
They say all her eye nerves are damaged.

115
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,197
-Goodness.
-Her eyes were green from glaucoma.

116
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,158
Is this about the Walnut House?
The one with beautiful daughters.

117
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,078
-Yes.
-What's the point of having good looks?

118
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,540
One of them had a shotgun wedding
and moved to Seoul

119
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:03,042
but later went to jail
after her husband died.

120
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,628
The other one supposedly had
a great career as a writer,

121
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,673
but now she's stuck here
and living thoughtlessly.

122
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,383
So it's the eldest…

123
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,593
who committed murder, right?

124
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,222
My gosh, how could you call it murder?
It was manslaughter!

125
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,766
Was it? Is there a difference?

126
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,892
Of course, there is.

127
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,938
Anyway, their mom suffered
great heartache from her daughters.

128
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,233
She ended up getting cancer
in her final years.

129
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,694
That's right. Before that,
she used to be so healthy.

130
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:34,198
What a pity. I feel bad for her.

131
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,450
Hey, what is that thing you're making?

132
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,204
Goodness, you're doing such a great job.

133
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,249
What's the matter? It's pretty.

134
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:44,959
Isn't it pretty?

135
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,837
Yes, it is. It looks so pretty.

136
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,551
By the way, you know Jang-u?
The lad at City Hall?

137
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,219
He went on a blind date.

138
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,054
It seems to be going great.

139
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,515
-A blind date?
-Yes.

140
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,892
I heard he might get married next month.

141
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,187
What? Get married?

142
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,232
It's always great news
that someone is getting married.

143
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,775
We get to eat noodles and rice cakes,

144
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,360
as well as a buffet.

145
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,571
-Sounds good.
-I'd like that.

146
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,282
Eun-sil. Are things fun at work?

147
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,284
No. It's no fun at all.

148
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,410
But about that date--

149
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,872
Goodness. You should know
how blessed you are.

150
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,832
You even have a job.

151
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,210
-That hurts!
-And try to make these look nice.

152
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,463
You're too harsh on her.

153
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:31,881
I give up.

154
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,425
Look at you with your temper.

155
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,844
Let's scrape it all off.

156
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,681
-Gosh.
-Are you all right?

157
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:41,724
Goodness, I'm so tired.

158
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,893
-Are you okay?
-Something smells nice.

159
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,937
Goodness, be careful.

160
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,856
-That looks about ready.
-Take it inside.

161
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,317
-Should I?
-Yes, to the lounge.

162
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,778
I got this. Hello.

163
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,988
-Hello.
-Hello, Jang-u.

164
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,783
-It's not ready yet?
-Go ahead.

165
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,159
-This looks okay.
-All right.

166
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,244
-Over here!
-You can take one each.

167
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,747
-Hello.
-Hello.

168
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,208
-Hello.
-Hello.

169
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,334
Here you go.

170
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,919
-Hello.
-Come on in, Jang-u.

171
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,671
Everyone, say hello to Jang-u.

172
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,672
He's the one who went on that blind date.

173
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,757
That blind date?

174
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,092
The one who's on a roll.

175
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,760
-He's handsome.
-You went to SNU?

176
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,637
Yes, I'm that Jang-u. Hello.

177
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,305
What? Are you looking for something?

178
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,681
No.

179
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,351
No, I just came by to say hello.

180
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,061
It looks very delicious.

181
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,814
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

182
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,524
-He's good-looking.
-I agree.

183
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,484
Oh, my goodness.

184
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,985
Hello, Eun-sil.

185
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,070
Who are you looking for?

186
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,030
Me? You? Oh, wait.

187
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,698
I need to use the bathroom right now.

188
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,783
So long.

189
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,914
"That Jang-u"?

190
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,179
So, is Seung-ho's grandfather doing okay?

191
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,390
Yes, of course. He is doing fine.

192
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,767
That's a relief.

193
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,606
How did that coffee festival go?

194
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,275
It went well, thanks to you.

195
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,532
-Hey.
-Yes?

196
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,994
I heard about your date
and that you're getting married.

197
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,913
No, what are you talking about?

198
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,207
So is it a false rumor?

199
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,125
Totally.

200
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,295
How much of it is false?

201
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,008
-That I'm getting married.
-And that you went on a date…

202
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,635
Well, I did go on a blind date.

203
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,847
My parents want me
to get married soon, so I did go.

204
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,724
But it didn't go well?

205
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,103
No.

206
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,021
I see.

207
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,945
It's not cold at all anymore, right?

208
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,989
Well, I think it's very cold.

209
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,407
No, it isn't. Look.

210
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:07,620
That's only half of what I saw
in midwinter.

211
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,165
I think that has more to do
with your lung capacity.

212
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,791
-Is that so?
-Yes.

213
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,585
But Eun-sil,

214
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,589
you have purple lips now. It looks ugly.

215
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,384
Guess what, Jang-u? You're always ugly.

216
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:26,847
-Really?
-Yes.

217
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,156
What are you doing?
They said you have to stay for a few days.

218
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,658
They wanted to run some tests.

219
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,825
I don't have money.

220
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,205
They'll switch you to a shared room
once there's a spot.

221
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,086
I heard you were in severe pain.

222
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,003
Nonsense.

223
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,297
I could live with it.

224
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,969
The doctor said
it must've been excruciatingly painful.

225
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,845
Yes, it was painful.

226
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,931
But I couldn't be bothered.

227
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,142
They said the pain was so bad
that you would've wanted treatment.

228
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,023
My laziness defeated the pain.

229
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,151
Are you happy now?

230
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,237
Aunt.

231
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:25,990
Aunt!

232
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,493
Aren't you going back to Seoul?

233
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,956
Those who need to leave will leave.

234
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:39,003
I'm getting tired of you being here
and telling me what to do.

235
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,923
It's about time you go back.

236
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,224
Those who are left behind will stay.

237
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,937
That season is approaching.

238
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,920
-Cheers.
-There it is.

239
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,463
-Hello, sir.
-Here you go.

240
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,721
-I'll do it.
-Okay.

241
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,945
Gosh.

242
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,747
After making rice cakes with our old crop,

243
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,832
we will prepare to plant new crops.

244
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,042
That's how it is, right?

245
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,127
That's right.

246
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:07,508
I should get ready
to close down the ice rink.

247
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,218
Time flies.

248
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,679
You're too young to be saying that.

249
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,974
-I'll take this.
-Yes.

250
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,817
My gosh! Darn it, you startled me.

251
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,777
Coming back from the hospital?

252
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:11,905
What brings you here?

253
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,199
Did Hae-won call you?

254
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:16,869
Yes.

255
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,621
I'm fine.

256
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,541
Hae-won overreacted.

257
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,503
Sim Myeong-yeo.

258
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,426
Take off your sunglasses.

259
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,758
I didn't send you here
for you to live like…

260
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,181
I wanted you
to live your life to the fullest.

261
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,768
I told you to write books and go on dates.

262
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,437
-I said to try and live your best life--
-But…

263
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:30,776
But Myeong-ju,

264
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,821
how could I do that?

265
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:35,989
What did you say?

266
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,992
How could I?

267
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,165
I killed a man.

268
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,050
Those who don't know the truth…

269
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,095
will take pity on you.

270
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,305
But I didn't.

271
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,976
I felt sorry for myself.

272
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,732
Why would you feel that way?

273
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,320
I also have the right
to pay for what I've done wrong.

274
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,116
Yet you even took that away from me.

275
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,660
That's because…

276
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,705
you didn't do anything wrong.

277
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,622
Yes, I did.

278
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,003
I stepped on the pedal.

279
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,506
I killed him.

280
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,513
Myeong-ju, you know what?

281
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,103
I remember the smell of the blood.
How the wind felt on my skin.

282
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,439
I remember it all.

283
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,153
How could I not be guilty?

284
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,742
How can I…

285
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,620
live as if nothing happened?

286
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,831
How could I act as if nothing's wrong?

287
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,920
How am I supposed to…

288
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,811
Did you eat?

289
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,289
Have you tried talking to Aunt?

290
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,503
Try to convince her.

291
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,422
They said it isn't too late
to start medications

292
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,299
or laser treatments for her other eye.

293
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,845
You're close to her.

294
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,515
Were we?

295
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,604
She said she'd start writing books again,

296
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,148
and it seemed like
she was back together with Yun-taek,

297
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,694
so I thought she was making slow changes.

298
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,041
I was wrong.

299
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,716
She's never been the type to do anything.

300
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,979
-Myeong-ju.
-Yes?

301
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,231
I want to do everything.

302
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,400
Like what?

303
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,278
Everything in this world.

304
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,364
I'm going to do it all.

305
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,335
The weather is so nice.

306
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:17,961
Myeong-ju.

307
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,675
I'm so scared.

308
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,888
I'm really scared.

309
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,224
I'm so afraid.

310
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,020
Myeong-ju, I…

311
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,648
I'm terribly scared.

312
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,987
Myeong-ju.

313
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,491
Myeong-ju.

314
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,398
-Hey, Im Hwi?
-Yes?

315
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,114
How dare you ride on the back
of Yeong-su's bike to get to school?

316
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,950
-Who are you?
-Me?

317
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,078
I'm Yeong-su's girlfriend, Song Je-in.

318
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,291
I see. So you're that Song Je-in.

319
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,293
-What?
-I'm glad you came.

320
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,211
Hey!

321
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,551
-Oh, my gosh!
-Unbelievable.

322
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,428
-Let go of this!
-You go first!

323
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,056
-Let me go!
-I said, let go!

324
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,605
Let go on the count of three.

325
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,274
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

326
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:04,401
-You're still there!
-You let go first!

327
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,027
Yeong-su!

328
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,572
Song Je-in and Im Hwi
got into a brawl because of you!

329
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:12,742
Aren't you coming?

330
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,163
Gosh.

331
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,758
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

332
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,676
Yes, Mother.

333
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,267
I'm on my way now.

334
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:39,936
Yes.

335
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,200
You should be ashamed of yourself!

336
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,367
Why?

337
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,245
Why would you fight over a boy,
of all the other things?

338
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,914
You're such an embarrassment.

339
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,873
Mom!

340
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,626
Boys mean everything to me.

341
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,462
Are you out of your mind? Seriously?

342
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,214
Are you crazy?

343
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,257
I'm not crazy. I'm fine.

344
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,509
I'm doing even better
after taking the brain tonic.

345
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,679
Why would you go after someone
who already has a girlfriend?

346
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,681
Mom, as I said, we had a deal.

347
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,351
D-A-E-L.

348
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,686
Hwi, I think you got the spelling--

349
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,438
That's not important right now.

350
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,023
Hwi!

351
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,525
Hi, Seung-ho. What are you doing here?

352
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,111
Are you also my guardian?
I'm good with that.

353
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,529
I heard you got into trouble.

354
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,949
Yes. How did you know…

355
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,825
-You told him?
-Yes.

356
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,202
Why you…

357
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:40,830
Come on. Parents come to school
when their kids get into trouble.

358
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,415
I know all that.

359
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,792
You're right.

360
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,046
Goodness, Seung-ho. You're so clever.

361
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,715
Is that something to praise him about?

362
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,051
Why don't you announce it
to the whole town?

363
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:57,180
Goodness. You're scared of Seung-ho
finding out and yet you behave this way?

364
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,556
But we had a deal.

365
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,851
-Whatever. The whole town already knows.
-Stop hitting me. It hurts.

366
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,108
-Grandpa!
-Seung-ho!

367
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,321
You're not sick anymore? You're better?

368
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,990
Yes, I'm fine.

369
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,410
You're all grown up, worrying about me.

370
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,955
Let's go back home now.

371
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:22,872
Shall we?

372
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,711
I did a lot of driving today.

373
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,713
Right, you did.

374
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,800
Did you talk to Seung-ho's father?

375
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,930
I called, but I couldn't get in touch.

376
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,350
But the number you had was his?

377
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,187
I'm not sure. No one answered.

378
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,481
I tried calling
the travel agency where he works.

379
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,192
But he wasn't there anymore.

380
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,738
I see.

381
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,158
When did you say was
the last time he visited?

382
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,868
About five years ago.

383
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,038
I left my contact information for now.

384
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,707
How are things with you?

385
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,627
The same.

386
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:15,258
Aunt keeps saying she's fine
and is being very stubborn.

387
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,136
Mom doesn't seem like
she wants to talk Aunt into anything.

388
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,098
I don't get why they're acting like this.

389
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,317
What Seung-ho's dad and Myeong-yeo…

390
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,029
are each going through…

391
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,992
It might just need some time
for it to be resolved.

392
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,711
Just as spring comes after winter passes?

393
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,757
Right.

394
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,516
I think spring will come soon.

395
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:06,810
I think so too.

396
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,691
LOOK HERE. WHO DO YOU THINK
KILLED MY BROTHER-IN-LAW?

397
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:19,632
Cha Yun-taek.

398
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,636
Yes, you're right.

399
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,269
What the others said is all wrong.

400
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,984
What you said is right.

401
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,638
To tell you the truth,

402
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:19,567
THE SISTERFIELD MAZE
SIM MYEONG-YEO

403
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,618
I've never once
wanted to give up on myself.

404
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,287
'93 HANJUNGANG NEWSPAPER
ANNUAL SPRING LITERARY CONTEST WINNERS

405
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,042
You know what?
I find these things ridiculous.

406
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,419
Why is that?

407
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,589
I'm the best writer here anyway.

408
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,216
What?

409
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,301
I'm already the best,

410
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,346
so what's the point of winning a contest?

411
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,722
I will outdo them anyway.

412
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,225
Don't you agree?

413
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,982
I've never doubted my talent.

414
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,155
I've never defined my limits

415
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,117
or regarded myself as of little value.

416
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,708
I've never thought
I would fall apart, get sick,

417
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,298
and grow old and ugly.

418
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,724
It had never once occurred to me.

419
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:43,985
I never imagined I would live
in the middle of nowhere,

420
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,157
waiting to die…

421
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,874
for the rest of my life.

422
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:01,753
I wish you a good life.

423
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,758
Just have a good life.

424
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,011
Get married like you wanted to.

425
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,555
Better yet, have kids too.

426
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,391
Live a happy life and parade it.

427
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:17,602
And to be honest…

428
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,228
Myeong-yeo.

429
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,816
Please be happy
and forget about a jerk like me.

430
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,235
…there wasn't a single moment

431
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,615
in which I wanted to break up with you.

432
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,537
Excuse me, sir.
Could you please turn the car around?

433
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,504
That's the truth,

434
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,756
Cha Yun-taek.

435
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:23,918
Why do you keep coming to our town?

436
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,254
You gave me the train schedule.

437
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,511
Hey, Myeong-yeo.

438
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,431
Let me hug you just once.

439
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,516
What?

440
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,864
Don't.

441
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,251
Let me also be honest.

442
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,671
I didn't want to break up with you.

443
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,507
Not even for one moment.

444
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,429
Are you sure you read
about what I've done…

445
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,183
before coming here?

446
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,854
"Article four on the contents of the book.
Section three."

447
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,693
"I'll never ask what parts are fiction
and non-fiction in your story."

448
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,362
You don't know…

449
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,075
what parts are true
and what parts are fiction.

450
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,453
And yet you're here.

451
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,206
What's wrong with that?

452
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,375
You've got more nerve…

453
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,671
than you let on, Yun-taek.

454
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,465
You're right.

455
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,760
That's why I loved you.

456
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,167
Hello.

457
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,503
-Hey, there.
-You're all here.

458
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,380
Hyeon-ji, please don't carry that around.

459
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,048
Did someone hit you in the head with it?

460
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,384
-Hello.
-Come on in.

461
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,386
-Hello, Jang-u.
-Hello.

462
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:39,720
Hey, you're here.

463
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,849
-Hello, Eun-sil.
-Good that you're here. Come in.

464
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,101
There? In that small space?
Just the two of us?

465
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,103
Wait. Let me just put this away first.

466
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,815
-What took you so long?
-I had to stop by my house.

467
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,824
-Eun-sil, what is it?
-Glad you're here.

468
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,617
I want you to try this.

469
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:05,538
How is it?

470
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,583
-What?
-How does it taste?

471
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,461
I don't know.

472
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,130
That's not good. What should I do?

473
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:15,923
Then

474
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,177
how about this?

475
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,308
-Yes, this tastes good.
-What?

476
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,392
Why?

477
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:28,769
I bought this.

478
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,647
I bought this from my mom's store.

479
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,902
So what you just had is delicious?

480
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,404
What? No, that's not what I meant.

481
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,991
Then how about this?

482
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,495
How is it? Is it salty? Sweet?

483
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,207
-I really don't know.
-Darn it!

484
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,375
You're saying that
to only the ones I cooked.

485
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,003
Are you playing tricks on me? Why you…

486
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:05,056
Hey, you have massive arms.

487
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,141
I have massive legs too.

488
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,853
Oh, that's good. Good for you.

489
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,942
What are you two doing?

490
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,276
Sorry?

491
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,487
What do you mean?

492
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,405
-Why are you smiling?
-It's just…

493
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:23,908
What is it?

494
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:25,243
No, it's nothing.

495
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,040
Gosh, that blanket looks really nice.

496
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,043
Right? It took me a long time to make.
Isn't it pretty?

497
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,086
It is.

498
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,052
-By the way, Geun-sang.
-Yes?

499
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,431
After you're done with that,
can you help with removing the mold?

500
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,016
Yes, I was going to.

501
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,695
Hey, here you go.

502
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:08,077
Hyeon-ji, how come you're so good at this?
Did you take a special class?

503
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,163
I was practicing some moves
for my hip-hop performance.

504
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,792
Oh, my. And yet I'm the weirdo?

505
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,044
Goodness.

506
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:29,640
Listen, Yeong-su. The more I think
about it, the angrier I get.

507
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,517
You know, I'm talking about Je-in.

508
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,895
The one who goes around the town
saying she's your girlfriend.

509
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:38,524
What on earth did you say to her
to make her beat me up like that?

510
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,651
Hey, I got slapped
in the face for the first time.

511
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:44,697
I've been an outcast for two years
but no one's ever done that to me before.

512
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,033
But you pulled out all of Je-in's hair.

513
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:51,662
Still, she hit me first.

514
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:57,501
Did you just laugh?
Do you want to take part in this fight?

515
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,130
-Hey.
-What?

516
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,925
Je-in said she'll go to school
with us from now on.

517
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,969
What? Why?

518
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,889
I don't want to!

519
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:11,307
I really don't want to!

520
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,195
They're here.

521
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,822
Hush.

522
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,078
Seung-ho. Let's go inside.

523
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:36,791
Let's go.

524
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,418
One, two, three!

525
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,046
-Welcome!
-Welcome!

526
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,022
How are you doing?

527
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,066
I'm doing better.

528
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,485
-Have you eaten?
-You haven't?

529
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,112
-Take care of Seung-ho too.
-Yes.

530
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,155
-I don't think we can eat that.
-Why not?

531
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,616
-Let's hurry inside.
-Why do you say it like that?

532
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,545
You must be tired today.

533
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,297
No, I'm okay.
You should also go and get some rest.

534
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,215
I will.

535
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:28,759
Oh, that's right.

536
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,764
Bo-yeong apologized to me.

537
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,267
She said she was truly sorry.

538
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,353
Then she said she hates me

539
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,732
because she once liked me

540
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,110
and that I probably disliked her.

541
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,696
Did you?

542
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,865
I don't know.

543
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,994
Did I really not even like her?

544
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,540
How I feel about her now is so obvious

545
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,252
that I can't remember how I felt
about her when we were close.

546
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,592
But then again, even if I do remember,

547
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,135
that doesn't mean I can go back.

548
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,598
Trust is like glass.

549
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,268
Once it's been broken,
you can put it back together,

550
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,103
but the cracks are still visible.

551
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,397
That's true.

552
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,073
Don't overthink it.

553
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:39,997
You should go inside.

554
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,291
I'll get going.

555
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,546
Drive safely.

556
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,859
Eun-seop, I sent you an email.

557
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,361
Please check it.

SIM MYEONG-YEO

560
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,711
I read your email.

561
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,593
You said I can decide
to show your story to Hae-won

562
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,219
after reading it.

563
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,933
But the fact that you sent this to me

564
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,687
seems like you'd like Hae-won
to know the truth.

565
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,191
Hi there, our dear Gunbam.

566
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,484
Our precious, cute Gunbam.

567
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,568
I'll be back soon.

568
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,696
As you said, it is a crime

569
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,948
to kill a family member
with one's own hands.

570
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,911
However, I don't know
the details of the circumstance.

571
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,958
So I don't think it's my place
to make the decision.

572
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,715
Although difficult, the right thing to do
would be to tell her yourself.

573
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:39,426
But if you can't bring yourself to do so,

574
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:45,683
I will get involved only so far
as to give the manuscript to Hae-won.

575
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,773
You must have suffered a lot…

576
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,277
having to keep your silence.

577
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,785
But whatever happens,

578
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,164
I believe in your love

579
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,166
for Hae-won.

580
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,842
What is this?

581
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,012
-You should read it.
-What is it about?

582
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,473
Is this something you wrote?

583
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,226
No.

584
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,144
Then?

585
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,313
Just…

586
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:40,779
All right.

587
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,867
But why do you want me to go home?
I want to stay here longer.

588
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:49,413
I think it's more important
that you read this.

589
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,170
I'll go to your place after work.

590
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,089
We can talk about it then.

591
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:02,926
All right.

592
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:16,899
This is random.

593
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,380
I'm home.

594
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:20,462
Aunt.

595
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:22,965
Aunt?

596
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,948
But why do you want me to go home?
I want to stay here longer.

597
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,826
I think it's more important
that you read this.

SIM MYEONG-YEO

600
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:28,155
It was the day before I broke up with you.

601
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:31,366
On September 4th, 2010.

602
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:37,497
It was pouring rain since the morning.

603
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,628
I got a message from my sister.

604
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,922
CURRY?

605
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,214
Curry?

606
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,802
SURE

607
00:49:31,885 --> 00:49:32,719
SENT

608
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:38,809
It was just like any other day.

00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,392

610
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,060

611
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:34,364
Who do you think you are?

612
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,242
Who do you think you are?

613
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:41,288
Why do you always do this to me?

614
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:44,416
Let go of me!

615
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,334
I said, let go!

616
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:49,379
Hey, how dare you do that to me?

617
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,922
Darn you.

618
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,010
Even the sight of my brother-in-law
beating up my sister…

619
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:58,221
was the same.

620
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,856
The only difference…

621
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:31,671
was that I ended up killing him.

Mom, so is this…

625
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,376
Is this…

626
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,631
Who killed Dad?

627
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,220
What?

628
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:31,690
So it's not you who killed Dad…

629
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,318
but Aunt, who'd been taking care of me?

630
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,445
So Aunt…

631
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,412
-Hae-won.
-Tell me.

632
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,417
Did Aunt really kill Dad?

633
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,922
Hae-won, it's--

634
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,591
Answer me now!

635
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:03,513
No, that's--

636
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,765
-Let me go!
-Hae-won.

637
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,812
So the two of you knew.

638
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:11,897
Hae-won, please.

639
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,107
I can understand why you hated Dad.

640
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,028
I didn't always like him either.

641
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,867
But still, he was my dad.

642
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,622
And the person who killed Dad…

643
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:31,833
wasn't you…

644
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:35,462
but Aunt.

645
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:37,589
Mok Hae-won.

646
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,679
I'm your guardian from now on.

647
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,151
She was the only person left
I could trust and rely on.

648
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:03,865
Hae-won…

649
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:07,869
-Hae-won.
-You two are scary.

Hae-won.

651
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,043
Don't come near me.

Don't follow me out.

Tell me.

Who do you think can forgive me?

656
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:29,677
Mom!

657
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:52,575
Hae-won.

658
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,128
Mom doesn't seem to be
in a good mood today.

659
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,297
Why don't we play together?

660
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:58,057
Excuse me.

661
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,229
Are you okay?

662
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,400
Sorry, have you seen a young woman here?

663
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,819
Yes, I think she was sitting over there.

664
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:52,737
Thank you.

665
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,191
Hae-won.

A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

668
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:05,471
There was a time when I thought living
was the process of finding my place.

669
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:08,433
A place where it's okay for me to exist

670
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,476
without bothering anyone
or being bothered.

671
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:15,523
Finding a place
where no one would reject me.

672
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:20,528
That's what I thought living was.

673
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:25,533
But now, I've changed my mind.

674
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:30,538
Wherever it may be, my place can be
the place where I am right now.

675
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:35,626
As long as I live as my true self,

676
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:40,673
I think it will be okay
for me to exist in this place.

677
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:45,511
That's all I have for now.

678
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:52,226
If I have to do more,
I might want to quit everything.

679
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,942
Is all of this really something
I could've lived without knowing?

680
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:01,569
Because the truth would hurt you.

681
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,405
She probably carried the burden for you.

682
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,282
Did you know Eun-sil is leaving today?

683
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,992
To Gangneung. Her leave is over.

684
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:09,285
I'm so scared.

685
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:12,079
I have no idea who people truly are.

686
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,498
It feels like I'm being deceived.

687
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,666
Are you saying you'll turn yourself in?

688
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,460
Then what does that make me?

689
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,587
I still want to pay the price
for my wrongdoing.

690
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:21,964
I'm leaving.

691
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,925
Spring is here.

692
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:35,812
