1
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,931
-Hae-won.
-Yes?

2
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,601
I need to bend down to pick this up.

3
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,810
Okay. Go ahead.

4
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,395
-Just do it?
-Yes, that's fine.

5
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:11,988
Are you teasing me?

6
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,991
No, of course not.
It's because I like you.

7
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,368
-I'm quick to notice these things.
-No, you aren't.

8
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,872
-I'm not?
-No. Jang-u is the quick-witted one.

9
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,249
You're right.

10
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,019
Eun-seop!

11
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,357
-Hello, Hwi.
-You're here.

12
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,316
What?

13
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,609
What was that just now?

14
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,069
What are you talking about?

15
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:55,406
Hyeon-ji, I just saw something strange.

16
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,407
What was it?

17
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,286
Eun-seop and our dear Hae-won…

18
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,996
No. What did we do?

19
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,251
I think they ate something.
I can smell it.

20
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,837
Whatever. Guess what?

21
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,422
Hwi went to buy a bike saddle
and got kicked out of the store.

22
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,258
Hey, don't tell them that!

23
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:14,759
Guess how stupid she is?

24
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,095
It was 300,000 won,
but she thought it was 30,000.

25
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,888
Cut it out!

26
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,306
So why are we here?

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,102
Well, I came to steal Eun-seop's wallet
but he's here, so I don't think I can.

28
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:26,396
I see. Then let's go.

29
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,731
Okay. We should also eat something.
I'm hungry.

30
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,409
-Let's pick up where we left off.
-What?

31
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,096
HYECHEON INTERCITY BUS TERMINAL

32
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,265
Goodness.

33
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,767
-Hey!
-Hey, get over here.

34
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,603
-Did you want one?
-Thanks.

35
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,564
-Things are slow these days. It's crazy.
-I know.

36
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,065
-The economy's bad.
-Excuse me…

37
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:15,403
Do you know where Im Jong-pil lives?

38
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,155
Im Jong-pil?

39
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,032
Who is Im Jong-pil?

40
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,117
Isn't he the Jong-pil we know?

41
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,535
That's right, it must be him.

42
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,204
Why are you looking for him?

43
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:26,623
He's right. Why?

44
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,213
I have all kinds of bolts and screws here.

45
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,760
Hello? Darn it.

46
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,555
-Yes?
-Someone's looking for Im Jong-pil.

47
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,601
Jong-pil?

48
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,770
Isn't he Eun-seop's family?

49
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,314
Who's looking for him?

50
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,943
You have to get it this time.

51
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,486
All right. Just stay put.

52
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,449
Let's not go easy on him.

53
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,077
"Cosmos Billiard Club."
The total is 17,000 won.

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,495
Can you please sign here?

55
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,331
Hey, don't put that on there!

56
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,166
-All right.
-Move it.

57
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,834
Hurry up.

58
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,379
Give me a minute.
I need to check how far it is.

59
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,339
What's there to check? Just hit here.

60
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,924
Hurry up and take it.

61
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,551
Isn't that Jong-pil?

62
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,097
-Hurry up!
-I'll get going.

63
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,183
-Get this one closer to that one.
-Goodness.

64
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:30,228
Hey there, Jong-pil!

65
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,564
What is it?

66
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,608
Come over here.

67
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,654
So someone was looking for me?

68
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:40,571
Yes.

69
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,450
I heard that he asked around
starting from the terminal.

70
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,661
Who was it?

71
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,663
Well, I heard

72
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,834
he may have looked like
someone related to Eun-seop.

73
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,759
Look now. Don't try to get away.

74
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,222
-We're going to Jinjune for another round.
-Let's go.

75
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,182
Come on, Jong-pil.

76
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,684
-Thanks for the game.
-Sure.

77
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,147
All right. Thank you.

78
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:19,819
Im Hwi!

79
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,614
Hey, Im Hwi!

80
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,702
Why isn't she coming?

81
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,416
Im Hwi!

82
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,004
"Im" like important.
"Hwi" like the sound of a whistle.

83
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,174
Im Hwi!

84
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,927
I'm coming, Kwon Hyeon-ji!

85
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,098
Gosh, it's cold.

86
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,023
Who is he?

87
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,360
Oh my. Do you have a crush on me?

88
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,862
-Shut up.
-That will be awkward.

89
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:20,546
-Yes?
-Come on.

90
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,506
Right.

91
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,801
Isn’t this the first time
you linked arms with me?

92
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,513
Just keep on walking.

93
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:27,697
Im Eun-seop.

94
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,412
Eun-seop.

95
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,875
Wake up and play with me.

96
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,835
I'm bored. Please?

97
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,257
Eun-seop.

98
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,182
Eun-seop.

99
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,447
Yum.

100
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,577
Hae-won?

101
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,455
-You like it?
-What did you do?

102
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:19,499
What does it taste like?

103
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,000
It tastes funny.

104
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,263
You're so mean.

105
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,749
What is it?

106
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,961
You're radiant.

107
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,921
What?

108
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:08,839
Nothing.

109
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,594
-Eun-seop.
-Yes?

110
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,263
Can I cook for you?

111
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,098
You?

112
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,267
What's that supposed to mean?

113
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,852
I'm a good cook.
Better than my aunt, at least.

114
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,607
Seriously.

115
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,318
I wouldn't put ham in doenjang-jjigae.

116
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,325
This tastes fishy.

117
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,494
Uh-oh.

118
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,330
What could have gone wrong?

119
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,008
Yes.

120
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,887
But it was impossible
to get your mobile number.

121
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,975
You did a great job
keeping your personal life under wraps.

122
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,811
Get to the point, crybaby.

123
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,317
What will you do about the contract?

124
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,320
I can’t wait around forever
after making an offer.

125
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,697
I see.

126
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,826
What's it going to be?
Are you signing or not?

127
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,370
I'll sign.

128
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,665
What? You will?

129
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,292
No, if you have a problem with it.

130
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,710
No, listen.

131
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,920
It's nothing like that…

132
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,423
Then send the contract
via registered mail, crybaby.

133
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,674
Within a week.

134
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,343
Wait. Hang on.

135
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,096
The thing is,

136
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,351
that’s not how we do
our business around here.

137
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,562
Then what do you use? A carrier pigeon?

138
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,734
So, in our company,

139
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,861
we like to do business in person.

140
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,989
That's why my calendar is packed
with back-to-back meetings.

141
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,783
CHIEF EDITOR CHA YUN-TAEK

142
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,117
Let's see.

143
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,997
Why don't you come by sometime?
Whenever you can.

144
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,666
I'm incredibly busy,

145
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,626
but I'll specially make the time for you.

146
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,671
Our office is at Hoedong-gil, Paju-si…

147
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,880
From 6:18 a.m.,

148
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,424
there's one at 9:18 a.m.,
12:18 p.m., 3:18 p.m.,

149
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,010
6:18 p,m., and 9:18 p.m.

150
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,096
Trains from Hyecheon.

151
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,766
What? So are you telling me

152
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,185
I should come to see you?

153
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,395
In case you didn't know,

154
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,814
beggars can't be choosers.

155
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:31,857
Listen, Myeong--

156
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,068
Hello?

157
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,611
Are you signing a book deal?

158
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,322
When did you get back?

159
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,825
Just now. So, are you signing a deal?

160
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,828
Yes, I am.

161
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,831
But you made a commotion
about how much you didn't want to write.

162
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,833
You went on about how your mind is blank

163
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,168
and your creativity well has dried up.

164
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,294
What's gotten into you?

165
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,966
Once you hit rock bottom,
the only way is to go up.

166
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,552
As it happens, I'm now poor and in need.

167
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,847
That brings me to my question.
Why are you taking those?

168
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,891
You have my carrots,

169
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,019
potatoes, and tomatoes in your hands.
It's really bothering me.

170
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,898
Do you mean these? I bought them myself.

171
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,817
With your money?

172
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,863
Yes, when I was at Eun-seop's.
So these are mine.

173
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,739
I see. So you bought them?

174
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,494
By the way,
I’m really curious about your new book.

175
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,538
You know how much I like your novels.

176
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,957
-Once it’s published we can--
-Hey.

177
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,086
Winter is almost over.

178
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,341
Isn’t it time for you
to wake up from hibernation?

179
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,511
Didn't you say you'll go back in spring?

180
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,272
What? Who?

181
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,193
You know, Eun-seop's biological father.

182
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,529
Mom! I need my gym t-shirt.

183
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,616
Yes, it's in the bottom drawer.

184
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,870
But that man is dead.

185
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,830
Then it's obvious.

186
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,292
You mean, his uncle?

187
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,254
Yes, I think so.

188
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,714
Goodness.

189
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:23,135
The town gossip mill has already gone
into overdrive because of him.

190
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,512
What?

191
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,436
Goodness. I've never liked this darn town.

192
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:37,024
It's teeny tiny.
So whenever something happens,

193
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,567
everyone gossips about it.

194
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:43,197
They gossiped about
a vagrant living in the mountains.

195
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,366
When he came to work in town
every so often,

196
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,202
everyone gossiped about that.

197
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,497
Whether he has a young child or not

198
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,332
was the next subject of gossip.

199
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,418
Then the gossip went on about
if we were taking care of that child.

200
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,795
All this gossiping!

201
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,215
I mean, he died a long time ago.

202
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,509
Do they even remember what he looks like?

203
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:07,012
Goodness, I'm so sick and tired of this.

204
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:14,270
But why is that man looking for you?

205
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:20,442
Well, he probably just wants to know
where Eun-seop is.

206
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,822
He has stopped looking for me,

207
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,283
so he might've already
gone to the bookstore.

208
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,787
Why on earth would he go there?

209
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,372
What is he going to do?

210
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,583
Take Eun-seop's money again?

211
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,003
He took a great amount
the last time he came

212
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,754
because he wanted to buy a boat.

213
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,382
He also took money
when his leg got injured.

214
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,718
What is it going to be this time?

215
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,638
Why does he keep coming back
when Eun-seop doesn't even have money?

216
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,892
He probably won't do that again.

217
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,436
All right. Let's put money aside.

218
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,604
But he keeps…

219
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,650
He keeps asking Eun-seop
to become a sailor like him, so I--

220
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,777
Mom, Dad! I'm going to school!

221
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:07,281
-All right, Hwi.
-Okay, have a nice day!

222
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,198
I will!

223
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,626
Whatever.

224
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,049
But that man is dead.

225
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,384
Then it's obvious.

226
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,720
You mean, his uncle?

227
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,922
Hey!

228
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,112
Has it already been five years?

229
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,408
The last time we met
was before you went to military service.

230
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,202
Yes.

231
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,749
-Did you buy the boat?
-No.

232
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,418
I couldn't.

233
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,716
Anyway,

234
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,595
look what I found.

235
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,222
Do you also have one?

236
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,158
They were taken on the same day.

237
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,202
I took these.

238
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,546
I want you to come with me.

239
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,298
Where?

240
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,550
It's a bit far from here.

241
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,637
If this is about me becoming a sailor…

242
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,056
Well, you could say…

243
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,142
it's something like that.

244
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,610
Hey.

245
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,737
You better get it straight.

246
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,866
I'm the one related to you by blood.
Don't you get it?

247
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:43,080
You and I share the same blood
flowing inside our bodies.

248
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,541
That's why we're drawn to each other.

249
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,460
Remember how you went
to see your mom in the end?

250
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,131
You took care of her
for three years while she was sick.

251
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,508
It all boils down

252
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,302
to having the same bloodline.

253
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,513
Do you understand?

254
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,391
When you call those people who raised you,

255
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,227
you say "Mother" and "Father"
and act all polite, don't you?

256
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:06,895
That's all because

257
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,064
you're unrelated to them.

258
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,114
Unrelated.

259
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,539
What did he say? Gosh.

260
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,958
"Unrelated"? What does it mean?

261
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,086
Gosh, that darn dog.

262
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,298
-What's he saying?
-Hi, Hwi.

263
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,299
Gosh, you scared me.

264
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,218
-Why aren't you going in?
-Hush.

265
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,062
Have you finished catching up?

266
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,618
-Hae-won.
-Yes?

267
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,912
I…

268
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,873
Tell me.

269
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,168
I think I have to go somewhere.

270
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,294
Where?

271
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,424
Just somewhere…

272
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,762
But I might not get back today.
Is that okay with you?

273
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,096
No.

274
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,558
But you can go.

275
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,644
What about the flea market?

276
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,230
It's okay. I'll try to get it done myself.

277
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,356
Hey, Eun-seop!

278
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,107
Don't you dare leave! You can't go!

279
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,568
Stay where you are!
I'll kill you if you go!

280
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,739
What's with her?

281
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,533
She seemed very upset.

282
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,204
Mom!

283
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,831
Hey! Why are you not at school
and back home?

284
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,126
-Did you skip school again? You brat!
-It's not like that.

285
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,128
-No!
-I told you

286
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,714
to at least try to be diligent
if you're not book-smart.

287
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,424
What were you thinking? Goodness.

288
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,802
-Listen, Mom!
-Why? What is it?

289
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,553
Eun-seop ran away!

290
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,640
What did you say?

291
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:10,560
That uncle came by
and asked him to go with him.

292
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,813
He didn't ask for money?

293
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,607
Money, my foot!
I wish he had asked for money instead!

294
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,109
He just took him away!

295
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,694
Said something about "bloodline."

296
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,071
Are you sure

297
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,448
Eun-seop went with him?

298
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,076
He followed him on the spot!

299
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,579
Why didn't he just take money from him?
Gosh, this is so annoying!

300
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,571
HYECHEON TO GANGNEUNG

301
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,591
What are you doing?

302
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,718
Hey, let's go.

303
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,136
-A flea market?
-Yes.

304
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,262
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE FLEA MARKET

305
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:28,472
I think it will be fun.

306
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,057
A FEW DAYS AGO

307
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,392
Okay, everyone. Let's hold an event.

308
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,020
What kind of event, Su-jeong?

309
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,104
A flea market.

310
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,564
A "flea market"?

311
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,985
Are you giving me ideas
for a City Hall event?

312
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,905
I was thinking more of a small event.

313
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,698
What's a "flea market"?

314
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,700
I know! I know for sure!

315
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,452
It's to reduce, reuse, and--

316
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,828
No, Hwi. That's not it.

317
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,206
But Su-jeong,

318
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,459
a flea market is where you sell items
you no longer use.

319
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,628
You're right. That's true.

320
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:02,255
What should I do?
I don't have anything to sell then.

321
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:08,095
I think you can also sell items
you're good at making.

322
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,763
-Right, Eun-seop?
-Yes.

323
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,853
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE FLEA MARKET

324
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,527
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE FLEA MARKET

325
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:29,282
Did you have a lot of customers?

326
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,077
This is a great opportunity!

327
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:32,994
Don't miss it!

328
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,412
Welcome!

329
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,248
The one that you have looks great.

330
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,544
Try to smile, Hyeon-ji. You look so angry.

331
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,921
-Here!
-This looks delicious.

332
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,008
Then Su-jeong, how about selling
your handmade pies or quilts?

333
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,635
For you, this is 5,000 won.

334
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,887
I think they'd be a big hit.

335
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,598
Then what about me?

336
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,227
Hyeon-ji, just go with calligraphy.
You're really good at it.

337
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,730
What would you like for me to write?

338
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,731
Let's see…

339
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,275
I want one for my son that says,

340
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,736
"Jun-yong, Mom loves you."

341
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,155
But his dad doesn't?

342
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,323
Pardon?

343
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:15,495
JUN-YONG, MOM LOVES YOU

344
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,790
DAD IS NOT INCLUDED

345
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,709
Hae-won, what do you think I should do?

346
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,170
Please try this.

347
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,005
It looks delicious.

348
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,340
Please try it.
We also have red bean porridge.

349
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,050
Have some scallions.

350
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,594
They're tasty.

351
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,429
In that case,

352
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,098
I can do a stock clearance sale
of my various lights.

353
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,642
Hello, everyone!

354
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,145
This is not just some everyday event!

355
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,690
Let me introduce you
to full-color LED display panels

356
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,817
that come in various sizes!

357
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,784
Everyone!

358
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,288
How much do these go for?

359
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,125
What's up with her?
She's not saying anything.

360
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,961
Hwi. Have you made a lot of sales?

361
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,130
Jang-u. You can take my spot.

362
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,966
-"Take my spot"?
-I'm going to the bookstore.

363
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,220
What has that got to do
with me taking your spot? Hwi?

364
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,265

How much is this?

366
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,354
-You mean this one?
-Yes.

367
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,107
Take a guess.

368
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,654
I've never planned such
a perfect event in my life.

369
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,241
It has got me thinking…

370
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,953
Hello, Jang-u.

371
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,414
-Thanks for all your hard work.
-Thank you.

372
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,999
-Shall we?
-Yes, sir.

373
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,211
What if the mayor appreciates
my work so much

374
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,171
and promotes me to deputy mayor?

375
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,089
Welcome, sir.

376
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:53,176
Even if all 50 million citizens
in Korea visit our town,

377
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,552
that's not going to happen.

378
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,639
I know you hate me. We need to talk.

379
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,228
So is everyone set?

380
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,022
No. Hae-won hasn't yet decided.

381
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,734
I'll be selling books
since I work at a bookstore.

382
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,152
With whom?

383
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,446
Obviously…

384
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,124
It looks really nice.

Excuse me.

00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,856
What would be a good read
when you want to run away from exams?

391
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,819
-Well…
-It's 4,200 won.

392
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,696
Thank you.

393
00:26:58,366 --> 00:26:59,909
Hey, you're good at this.

394
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,203
-Hae-won.
-Yes?

395
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,833
Do you think Eun-seop will come back?

396
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,049
I don't think so.

397
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,303
Hae-won.

398
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,599
Im Eun-seop is going to leave

399
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:26,019
and go somewhere far away with that man.

400
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,316
That's not true.
He said he'll be back by tonight.

401
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,151
He said he also called his mother.

402
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,404
-So what you're worried about--
-Hae-won.

403
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,323
Eun-seop…

404
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,201
is acting differently this time.

405
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,121
I don't think he is coming back.

406
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,749
Permanently.

407
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,390
I'll stay with you from now on.

408
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,351
I'm done working as a sailor.

409
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,355
It's about time, anyway.

410
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,107
Don't you think?

411
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,902
You're an adult now.

412
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,905
I know that family took care of you,

413
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,784
but I think you've stayed
with them long enough to pay the price.

414
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:27,539
I…

415
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,921
Do you see that small building over there?

416
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,593
You really liked books.

417
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,221
When I visited you every once in a while,

418
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,391
if I came with books, you'd get so…

419
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,353
"Once upon a time, in a big mountain,

420
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,982
there lived a young child and his mother."

421
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,777
-It sounds like us, right?
-You'd get so excited.

422
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:01,656
That's why I bought it.

424
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,410
I used all the money I got from you

425
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,663
and my savings from working as a sailor.

426
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,417
Are you serious?

427
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:15,795
You bought that?

428
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,591
Some people…

429
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,719
are meant to be alone…

430
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,722
from cradle to grave.

431
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,074
Your father was one of them.

432
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,837
I'm also one of them.

433
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,009
You're one of them too.

434
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,181
That's the way we are.

435
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,226
We can't stay with anyone.

436
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:19,025
Like how your mom
also couldn't stand it and left.

437
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,948
It runs in our blood.

438
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,741
Our blood.

439
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,078
It's what makes us destined

440
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,541
to be alone until the day we die.

441
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,884
That's why I want to stay with you.

442
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,722
Isn't it better to live with someone
similar in that way?

443
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,853
It would also save us
from getting our emotions hurt.

444
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,607
Why?

445
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:01,818
Do you think…

446
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,404
you're different from us?

Hey, they're really good, right?

449
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,303
This is the work that the city does

450
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,431
to teach these brilliant, young talents.

451
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:16,434
Look at these brilliant, young talents.
Just hear me out.

452
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,853
They all learned to play at school.

453
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,271
-Jang-u.
-Yes?

454
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,190
I'm trying to listen.

455
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,736
-Right, I was about to do the same.
-Please be quiet.

456
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,451
But aren't they really good? Okay.

457
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,586
Did you all enjoy the music?

458
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,921
-Yes.
-Yes.

459
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,339
For 30 years,

460
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,258
-as a musician to the Esterházy family…
-Can you play for us?

461
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,678
-Sorry?
-You're a cellist too.

462
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,679
Please play for us.

463
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,640
-You're right, but…
-Yes, I'd love to hear you play too.

464
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,433
-Why are you saying that?
-Please!

465
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,143
-I can't!
-Ji-yeon.

466
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,354
Just a second. Ji-yeon.

467
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,022
-Ji-yeon.
-Hey, stop it.

468
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,149
-Hae-won wants to play the cello.
-Be quiet!

469
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,526
Play for us, just this once.

470
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,861
-She will play the cello.
-He's talking nonsense.

471
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,738
-Really?
-You know what he's like.

472
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,783
-She's really good.
-Don't listen to him.

473
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:14,951
-Play.
-No, thanks.

474
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,036
-Ji-yeon, let her play.
-Ji-yeon, it's okay.

475
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:38,326
Eun-seop.

476
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,707
Look at your face. What happened?

477
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,384
Some people

478
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:00,306
are meant to be alone
from cradle to grave.

479
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,144
I'm also one of them.

480
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,150
It runs in our blood.

481
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,777
Our blood.

482
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,202
It's what makes us destined…

483
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,165
to be alone until the day we die.

484
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,473
-Nothing.
-What do you mean?

485
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,561
I was worried about what I'd do
if you suddenly disappeared.

486
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,252
Why?

487
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:15,756
Do you think you're different from us?

488
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,987
It's been a while since I took a train.
The ride brought back old memories.

489
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,531
We used to ride trains a lot together.

490
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,576
Right. You'd cry every single time.

491
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,870
"Myeong-yeo, I love you.
Myeong-yeo, I'm sorry."

492
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,206
"Myeong-yeo, sob, sob.
Weep, weep. Sniff sniff."

493
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,042
I meant every word I said.

494
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,627
I see. Is that so?

495
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,632
Here. I'll sign if you delete this line.

496
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,841
THE BOOK WILL BE BASED ON
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF "THE WRITER"

497
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,802
I can't do that.
That's what will make this book appealing.

498
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,847
I don't think so.
I'd find it the least appealing.

499
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:08,351
That's not your call to make.
I'm the chief editor, so I get to decide.

500
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,268
Listen up.

501
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,438
It might be fun to stand back
and watch a house burn down

502
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:15,399
but it's hell if you're in that house.
Don't you get it?

503
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,654
I can't write about
what it's like to be in hell.

504
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,076
Then combine your stories.

505
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,119
What?

506
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,913
You can mix fiction and non-fiction.

507
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:32,792
Who cares? I won't be able
to tell which is which.

508
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,589
In that case…

509
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,927
I'll never ask what parts are fiction
and non-fiction in your story.

510
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,470
Deal?

511
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:47,848
Here you go.

512
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,812
You can sign here with your stamp.

513
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,398
What is this?

514
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,109
I knew this would happen
so I prepared an extra set

515
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,987
that includes what I've just said.

516
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,156
This is how a successful editor
gets his work done.

517
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:16,460
That’s the one you just pulled out.

518
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,378
What?

519
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,214
Really? Wait.

520
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,551
-You fell for it again? Yes, you did.
-Goodness.

521
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,511
Gosh.

522
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,639
It was really fun. Right?

523
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,349
Yes, it really was.

524
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,435
Well, I gave great discounts

525
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:36,897
but it was good
to get my inventory organized.

526
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,607
I have decided.

527
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,235
I'm going to open my pie shop.

528
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,279
It will be called "Crystal Pie."

529
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,909
But Hae-won's cello performance
was the most impressive out of all.

530
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,827
You're right.

531
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,997
I've never seen anything like that before.

532
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,959
Me too. That was on a whole other level
from what kids play at school.

533
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,253
Agreed.

534
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,006
I'd like to learn something
like that someday.

535
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:03,632
Really?

536
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,218
But Eun-seop isn't showing up.

537
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,847
I know.

538
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,600
It would have been great
if he was here with us.

539
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,185
I feel the same way.

540
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:17,355
I told you, he's not coming back.

541
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,565
Hwi, be careful with your clothes.

542
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,402
-It's already late. We should get going.
-Right.

543
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,654
-It feels empty without the owner.
-I know.

544
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,324
Where are you going? We are not done yet.

545
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,745
Is the camera angle a little off?

546
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,373
-Yes.
-Right, I don't think it's straight.

547
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,833
-Are we taking it now?
-Hi, Hae-won. Yes, we are.

548
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,961
-Should I stand here?
-Yes, that's perfect.

549
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,132
Wait, just a second!

550
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,217
Gosh, seriously.

551
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,929
Can we all move a little to the left?

552
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,852
Why do you have a rag?

553
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,605
Seung-ho, we are taking a picture.

554
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,775
Did we get that? I think I blinked.

555
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,859
I think I posed well.

556
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,617
Jang-u, you can go now. I got this.

557
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,244
Well, let me just finish this.

558
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,995
Eun-seop talked so much about this

559
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,997
so it's hard for me to just leave.

560
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,001
-By the way, Hae-won.
-Yes?

561
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,130
How are you feeling these days?

562
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,718
You seemed to have
a lot going on in your mind.

563
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,888
Right.

564
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,057
I was a little frustrated.

565
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,268
But I feel better now.

566
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,522
Living in Seoul is really tiring, right?

567
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,401
I used to have those moments too.

568
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,487
I’d get an upset stomach
from eating alone,

569
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,491
so I’d hang out with friends
but that didn’t take the loneliness away.

570
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:57,663
But those moments
have all become memories after time.

571
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,959
-Memories?
-Yes.

572
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:06,088
Like how you’re making memories here.

573
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,093
I have great memories
from the time I was living in Seoul.

574
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,347
Where do you want this?

575
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,310
-Hae-won?
-Yes?

576
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,519
Where should I put this?

577
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,856
Right. That goes into the storage
over there.

578
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,274
The storage?

579
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,401
I was just there now.
Could’ve told me sooner.

580
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,362
Can you put
the light bulbs out in the front?

581
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,906
-Light bulbs go outside?
-Yes.

582
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,325
Those would need sorting.
Could've told me sooner.

583
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,951
And bring those books back in.

584
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,955
-Okay.
-Thank you.

585
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:44,543
Regardless…

586
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,215
I can’t let him go.

587
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,137
No.

588
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,556
I'll stop him.

589
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,684
I’ll tell him not to go.

590
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,771
I'll cling to him.

591
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,318
He will go if that's what he wants.

592
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:14,073
How could you say
something like that so easily?

593
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,200
Eun-seop is not…

594
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,205
He is not our child.

595
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,706
What about how I feel?

596
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,459
Even when you brought him home

597
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,964
and told me to raise him like a stranger
since he's not ours,

598
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,507
I couldn't do it.

599
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,051
How is that even possible?

600
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,137
He eats and sleeps under our roof,

601
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,558
and goes to sleep
on my arms and in my arms.

602
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:45,271
How on earth could he not be ours?
He's my child. Am I wrong?

603
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,273
But he isn't.

604
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,654
That’s what everyone in this town says.

605
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:54,572
I believed in him!

606
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,868
I did, even when he left us

607
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,080
for three years
to be at his mom’s deathbed.

608
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:07,084
I believed in him.

609
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,588
That someday, he will come back.

610
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,715
Even when for three years

611
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:17,553
he never called us once.

612
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,764
Even when you kept on telling me

613
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,017
he will never come back to us.

614
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,853
I never doubted him.

615
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,731
I believed in him till the end.

616
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,820
And he came back.

617
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:38,032
In the end, he came back to us.

618
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,700
But the blood…

619
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,165
The bloodline means more.

620
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,459
"The bloodline"?

621
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,211
Is that how you feel?

622
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:55,299
Then do you also put more meaning
to your bloodline?

623
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,468
Because of that,

624
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:01,388
is Hwi more precious to you
and feels more like your child?

625
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,598
No!

626
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:05,851
Not at all.

627
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,217
Just once.

628
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:26,306
Can you tell me just once?

629
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:29,935
Please?

630
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,065
Words like "I love you."

631
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,778
"I really do…

632
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:42,781
Are you hungry?

633
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,741
…love you very much."

634
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:46,493
What is it?

635
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,537
My goodness.

636
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,289
This is…

637
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,626
This is my favorite!

638
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,545
It’s a rhinoceros beetle, right?

639
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,383
Did you bring this to show me?

640
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,054
Aren't they really hard to find?

641
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:09,433
I haven't seen one in a while.

642
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,481
Hold on to it for a minute.

643
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,774
Are you hungry? I'll start cooking.

644
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,568
It won't be long. You must be hungry.

645
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:25,282
Hwi, look what your brother did for mommy.

646
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,994
He caught this precious beetle
and brought it home.

647
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,046
Hwi.

648
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,423
Your name is Hwi.

649
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,176
"Hwi" like the sound of a whistle.

650
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:50,098
Goodness, Eun-seop.
You've been there for two hours.

651
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,809
Is she that adorable?

652
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,569
Honey.

653
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:05,030
Are you okay?

654
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,328
I'm watching a drama.

655
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,338
Or "I missed you."

656
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,132
"I'm sorry."

657
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,678
We didn't get to say any of those things.

658
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,115
Hwi, come here for a second.

659
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:21,189
You'll just leave us anyway.

660
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,983
Forget it.

661
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,151
Just leave already.

662
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,572
Don't touch it.

663
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:31,158
You don't get to touch my stuff
since you'll be leaving!

664
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,162
Go become a sailor!

665
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,331
And sail all the way to the Pacific Ocean!

666
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,252
Does it matter to you
if I become a sailor or decide to leave?

667
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,921
Since when did you like me so much?

668
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,299
From the moment I was born!

669
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,303
I've liked you
since the moment I was born!

670
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,348
Ever since I came out crying
and saw the world for the first time.

671
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:56,141
I've liked you since then, you idiot!

672
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,393
"Don't cry."

673
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:01,063
"I'm not leaving."

674
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:03,857
Why?

675
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,652
Why is it so hard to say those words?

676
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,071
Because you're my brother.

677
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,114
My brother!

678
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,701
You've always been my brother
from the moment I was born!

679
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,913
So I liked you from the start.
What do you want me to do?

680
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,290
I hate you, Eun-seop.

681
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,125
I really hate you!

682
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,044
Get lost! Go and become a sailor!

683
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,681
Whatever. I don't care.

684
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,391
I'm telling Mom and Dad!

685
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,726
Mom! Dad!

686
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,728
-Eun-seop made me cry!
-This was expensive.

687
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:46,900
What?

688
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,570
Really? Was it really expensive?

689
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:51,488
Yes.

690
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,950
Made a big decision and got it downtown.

691
00:49:56,243 --> 00:50:00,080
It's been a while since you've bought me
something to show how you feel.

692
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,334
It's the one I wanted.

693
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,461
This is it.

694
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,340
I thought it was 30,000 won
but it was actually 300,000 won.

695
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,052
My dear Eun-seop.
You must have a lot of money.

696
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,222
Next time, you can just give me cash.

697
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,225
Why would a student need
such an expensive saddle?

698
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:23,603
You can do so many other things
with 300,000 won.

699
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:24,521
What?

700
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,607
Stop laughing, you lunatic!

701
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,528
It's unfair that you're laughing
when I'm crying!

702
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:33,655
Out of my way!

703
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,163
Gosh, it feels good.

704
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:46,501
It's great! Eun-seop, I really like it!

705
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,216
It's great!

706
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:11,610
Move out of the way!

707
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:20,243
You even came to see me off.

708
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:22,412
What an honor.

709
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:26,750
Hey.

710
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:30,086
Maybe you can finally tell me about it.

711
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:31,880
About what?

712
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:33,840
About that day.

713
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,177
Why you broke up with me.

714
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,056
I broke up with you so many times.

715
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,266
About a thousand times.

716
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:44,810
The very last time.

717
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:49,773
On September 5th, 2010 at 9:23 a.m.

718
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,858
You texted me, "Let's break up."

719
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,653
I want an answer to that, Myeong-yeo.

720
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:58,740
It's not like…

721
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,327
I memorized the date
because I still have feelings for you.

722
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,913
I just remember because
I was so dumbstruck at the time.

723
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,123
So tell me.

724
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:11,336
Why did you have to break up
with me on that day?

725
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,964
I really can't think of what I did wrong.

726
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,590
Why on earth did you do that?

727
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:18,969
Well.

728
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,097
I can't remember.

729
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,599
You can't?

730
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,645
What's with you?
You thought I'd remember that now?

731
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,566
It happened more than ten years ago.
How would I remember?

732
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:38,989
The train is now approaching.

733
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:43,118
Please take a step away from the train.

734
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,914
I'll get going.

735
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:49,958
Take care.

736
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,460
Let me know when you have the draft.

737
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,962
Get lost, crybaby.

738
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,078
Maybe you can finally tell me about it.

739
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:32,083
About that day. Why you broke up with me.

740
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,464
On September 5th, 2010 at 9:23 a.m.

741
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:39,883
You texted me, "Let's break up."

742
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,929
I want an answer to that, Myeong-yeo.

743
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,433
MY LOVE CRYBABY: WHERE ARE YOU?

744
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,919
So is that punk in jail or not?

745
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,922
As I said, our warrant got dismissed.

746
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,757
So an arrest is impossible!

747
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,967
This is driving me nuts.

748
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,885
I’m going to catch that bastard.

749
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,012
-Any evidence?
-Hey, there’s more than enough.

750
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,305
Gosh, it sounds the same.

751
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,525
Let's break up.

752
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,406
Well. I can't remember.

753
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,952
It happened more than ten years ago.
How would I remember?

754
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:55,959
Darn it. You! How dare you!

755
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,293
Don't talk back to me.

756
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,422
Who do you think you are?

757
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,924
What did you say? What?

758
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:04,968
Hey!

759
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,868
-The man who came here yesterday.
-Yes.

760
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:18,995
I heard he's your uncle.

761
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:21,873
Yes.

762
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:23,750
Hwi said…

763
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:29,464
you’ll be leaving this place soon.

764
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,135
That’s not true, is it?

765
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,065
You will leave when spring comes.

766
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:53,530
When the weather is nice…

767
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,743
and it gets warmer here.

768
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,416
You'll end up going back.

769
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:13,967
Eun-seop.

770
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,556
I don’t know what our future holds either.

771
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:24,519
But for the first time,

772
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:30,775
I can’t wait to find out
what will happen next.

773
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,660
I’m really curious about…

774
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,788
what’s next for us.

775
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,419
Eun-seop,

776
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,380
how about you?

777
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:27,707
BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

778
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,459
POSTED BY SEOP

779
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:34,339
It was the first event held
after the opening of Goodnight Bookstore.

780
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:39,552
Irene was the actual one in charge.

781
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:44,474
I'm grateful for all the loving support
from the book club members.

782
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:49,270
As I look back
at the photos of the members,

783
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:54,400
I can truly feel they had a great time,
so I'm a little jealous…

784
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:59,447
Irene seems much happier
than she was at the end of last year.

785
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:04,327
If I'm not mistaken,
she seems brighter and smiles more often.

786
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:10,833
I'm blinded every time I see her smile.

787
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,048
It was the landlord's daughter.

788
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:20,885
She wants me to move out right now
if I'm not going to pay rent.

789
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:23,596
Did you go on a blind date
during your lunch break?

790
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,474
Jang-u, then what's your ideal woman like?

791
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,393
I heard you signed a deal with Myeong-yeo.

792
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:29,852
Call it off.

793
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,896
I have to publish her book.

794
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,773
There's something I have to find out.

795
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,066
"Please don't leave."

796
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:37,819
"Stay by my side."

797
01:01:37,902 --> 01:01:39,153
Tell me, Eun-seop.

798
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:42,198
Is what we have love?

799
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:48,538
