1
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:12,966
Jin-ho.

2
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,712
Mom. Don't go.

3
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,681
Wait.

4
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,153
Mom.

5
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,406
Don't go.

6
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,248
Mom.

7
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,847
Eun-seop!

8
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:37,986
Im Eun-seop!

9
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,894
Eun-seop. You're full of happiness.

10
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,981
Look how your mom, dad, and sister

11
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,108
are all smiling.

12
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,445
I can see that you're really happy.

13
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,865
Eun-seop. What's wrong?

14
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:27,035
Eun-seop. Please stop. Look at me.

15
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,037
What's the matter, Eun-seop?

16
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,747
Eun-seop, what is it?

17
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,253
Im Eun-seop!

18
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,016
Eun-seop.

19
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,188
Where have you been? Aren't you sick?

20
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,399
Why aren't you dressed warmly?
You're sick!

21
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,694
I'm not cold.

22
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,783
Look at your face. What happened?

23
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,307
Have a seat.

24
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,326
The light was on,
so I thought you were here.

25
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,369
I leave it on,

26
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,789
so anyone who gets lost can come.

27
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,590
Did you get hurt?

28
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,842
I had a little fall.

29
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,928
How did that happen? You're a great hiker.

30
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,896
Are you okay, though?

31
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,193
Why did you come here?

32
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,864
You weren't coming down,

33
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,824
so we all got worried.

34
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:17,867
But it's late…

35
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,953
I did bring a lantern this time.

36
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,999
They said it would only be
a 30-minute walk,

37
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,792
and they were right.
That's how I got here.

38
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,420
And I didn't even trip once.

39
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,840
I told you not to come.

40
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,052
It wasn't as bad as I thought.

41
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,307
Right. The shoes you got me were good--

42
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,017
That's not why I got them for you.

43
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,028
Don't ever come up the mountain again.

44
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,449
Even if…

45
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,618
I'm sick…

46
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,247
or I…

47
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,043
never go back down.

48
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,093
You should never come up here.

49
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,109
Come out when you're done.

50
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,060
Once upon a time,

51
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,271
a brother and a sister
set out on a journey…

52
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,734
because they wanted to become happy.

53
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,449
They had heard that somewhere on Earth

54
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:24,118
lived a bluebird of happiness.

55
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,683
So they climbed mountains
and crossed rivers

56
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,603
to finally arrive in a town
where the bluebird lived.

57
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:59,737
But such a bird was nowhere to be found.

58
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,365
You should get inside.

59
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,218
In the end,

60
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,263
they return home
without finding the bluebird.

61
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,222
-Hey…
-It's nothing.

62
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,641
What?

63
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,463
Hey!

64
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,173
Stay for a meal.

65
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,634
I don't feel like eating. Maybe later.

66
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,018
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

67
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,402
Why did you come here?

68
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,301
Hey.

69
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,556
-The courier is coming--
-I know.

70
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,899
HYECHEON WEST MARKET

71
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,369
We're here, Mother.

72
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,212
Are you here to shop?

73
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,882
Hello. It's been a while.

74
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,384
How are things at the ice rink?

75
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,969
They're just okay.

76
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,849
By the way, you should come by
for some dried sweet potatoes.

77
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,935
I've been meaning to go.
Enjoy your shopping.

78
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,812
-All right. Take care.
-Bye.

79
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,240
Hello.

80
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,908
Yeo-jeong, you're here.

81
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,410
HEALTH FOODS

82
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,412
What is it? Is your son still sick?

83
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,584
I guess that's not why you're here.

84
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,753
I want to get some brain tonic.

85
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,087
Brain tonic? What for?

86
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,758
For Hwi.

87
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,885
But you didn't want to.

88
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,262
Remember you said,

89
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,806
"How would something like that
make her grades improve

90
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,726
when she's always been bad at studying?"

91
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,021
I offered you a real bargain
and practically begged you to get it,

92
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,106
but you only bought your son--

93
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,400
Just hurry up and get it for me already!

94
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,037
Gosh.

95
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,539
Mom.

96
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,504
You only call me that out of need.

97
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,424
You're still mad at me, right?

98
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,264
I told you not to go there. Remember?

99
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,101
It bothers me when you go there
even when you're fine.

100
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,646
Why did you drag yourself up there
when you were that sick?

101
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,607
You're out to shop with your son?

102
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,734
Yes, ma'am. Take care.

103
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,949
How many times have I told you?

104
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:41,120
I get that the last time you went there
was because of a missing person.

105
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,582
Yes, it annoyed me. But we had no choice.

106
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,961
But you were sick this time.

107
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:53,132
You were unwell.
Then you shouldn't have gone there.

108
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,175
Why do you keep going there?

109
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,804
What's so special about it
that you had to go when you're sick?

110
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,640
Mother, it's nothing
for you to worry about--

111
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,058
How could you say that?

112
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,281
I'm sorry.

113
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,702
I'm sorry, Mother.

114
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,874
Whatever. Forget it.

115
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,001
I saw that woman.

116
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,468
What?

117
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,309
I was sitting out
on the porch that morning…

118
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,564
when I saw her illusion.

119
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,362
So I followed her
and found myself on the mountain.

120
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,034
I…

121
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,245
I told you it's dangerous.

122
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,709
I promise…

123
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,839
I will never go there again
without your permission.

124
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,511
I won't go to the cabin

125
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,347
or anywhere else…

126
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,600
without your permission.

127
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,023
You promise?

128
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,360
Yes.

129
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,778
Don't ever come up here again.

130
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,081
THE BLUEBIRD

131
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:41,550
Hello, Hae-won.
I came for some sawdust porridge.

132
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,939
When you said "sawdust porridge,"

133
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,317
I thought it was made with real sawdust.

134
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,278
It's actually oatmeal porridge,

135
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,947
but I named it after what it looked like.

136
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,784
Then does it taste like sawdust, too?

137
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,453
No, not at all.

138
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,455
It's very tasty with a nutty flavor.

139
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,459
-I'm glad to know.
-Thank you.

140
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,509
Hey, I'm going somewhere today.

141
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,344
Where?

142
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,473
I have some business in Seoul.

143
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,017
-Are you leaving now?
-Yes.

144
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,062
I'll be back tomorrow.
Su-jeong will be taking care of Gunbam.

145
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,563
Okay.

146
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,735
Check the boiler.
We can't have another breakdown.

147
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,862
All right.

148
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,363
Sweep the backyard

149
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,824
and don't skip your meals.

150
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,326
Gosh, seriously.

151
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,961
Seung-ho, go on and eat up.

152
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,718
So you're going where?

153
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,721
-Hello. He's cute.
-Yes, hello.

154
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,264
Come here.

155
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,102
-Seoul.
-Seoul? Why?

156
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,729
I barely have any royalties
coming in anymore.

157
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:21,191
I'd need to write another novel
if I want to keep making a living.

158
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,568
Really?

159
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,362
That's what those publishers said.

160
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,739
Come on.

161
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,492
But this time I'm going to hear them out.

162
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,245
Fixing the house cost me a great deal.

163
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,830
I see.

164
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,375
With suffering comes creativity indeed.

165
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,253
Don't get ahead of yourself.

166
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,296
I don't know how things will go.

167
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,216
Besides, I can make do with less money.

168
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:48,552
I'm off.

169
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,304
Okay. I won't get ahead of myself,
Ms. Author.

170
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,640
Have a safe trip, Ms. Author.

171
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,685
Don't you worry about Gunbam, Ms. Author.

172
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,487
Eun-seop.

173
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,406
Eun-seop!

174
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,825
It's you, Hae-won.

175
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,578
Gosh. Where is Eun-seop?

176
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,329
He's not here. What is all that?

177
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,373
It's for Eun-seop.
He asked me for a favor.

178
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,417
And this…

179
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,919
This is for you.

180
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,129
CEO OH YEONG-WOO

181
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,338
What is this?

182
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,257
Yeong-woo asked me to give you that.

183
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,842
He did?

184
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,178
Yes. He runs a coffee shop in Seoul

185
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,930
and said you should come by
in spring when you're in town.

186
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,516
Why is your face so pale?
Did you catch a cold?

187
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,019
I don't know. I just feel chilly.

188
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:42,063
You should go see a doctor
or take some medicine.

189
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,815
It will go away soon.

190
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,193
No, it won't.

191
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,195
-You have to see a doctor for--
-Let's go.

192
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,988
Are you done?

193
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,324
I'm leaving.
Make sure to see a doctor. See you.

194
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,284
-I didn't know about this place.
-Take medicine!

195
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,203
Yes, that was quick.

196
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,986
What would they have said
when they were breaking up?

197
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,368
Hey, get lost.

198
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:40,538
Did he carry all the luggage as they left?

199
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,706
I said, get lost.

200
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,797
Why are you tagging along on my way home?

201
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,799
Listen, Myeong-yeo.

202
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,386
Stop calling my name, Yun-taek.

203
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:03,103
Why was it at night,
of all the times in the day?

204
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,064
Get off at the next stop.

205
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,733
I can't stand the sight of you.

206
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,991
Did they share tears

207
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,743
as much as they've known each other?

208
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,161
Stop crying and get off!

209
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:24,541
I…

210
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,669
I really like you.

211
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,839
I love you so much.

212
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,342
They had run full speed towards
the other end of the world

213
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,469
in search of love.

214
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,305
Love, my foot.

215
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,975
I can't live without you.

216
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,394
What nonsense.

217
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,238
Then they exhausted all their energy
to give up on love

218
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,575
and return to where they were.

219
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,122
We call this a breakup.

220
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,460
But when you've devoted yourself
with nothing more left to give,

221
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,628
it's also

222
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,132
called love.

223
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,217
THE WIND BLOWS, I LIKE YOU
A TRAVEL ESSAY BY LEE BYUNG-RYUL

224
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,778
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

225
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,040
Hae-won, you can go home now.

226
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,710
-Yes?
-Do we have cold medicine?

227
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,717
Yes, we do.

228
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,385
Bring it over to the bookstore.

229
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,013
-What?
-I said to bring it to the bookstore now.

230
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,897
Listen. We have our book club in an hour.

231
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,235
It's just medicine.
Can't this wait till then?

232
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,236
Yes, you're right.

233
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,573
-What did you say?
-Don't forget to bring it then.

234
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,074
Wait. What did you just say?

235
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:04,826
Hey!

236
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,708
Ms. Daughter, I'm home.

237
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,460
Dad.

238
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:16,004
Can you guess what
Eun-seop just said to me

239
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,465
over the phone?

240
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,924
What did he say?

241
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,761
He asked me to run an errand.

242
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,722
Eun-seop asked me
to run an errand for him.

243
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,599
I see. Is that so?

244
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,435
Yes, he said it
in a really bossy and mean tone!

245
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:33,813
"Why, you brat!
Bring me that medicine right now!"

246
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:34,939
That's how he said it.

247
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,817
To me! He bossed me around
to bring him medicine!

248
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,402
Dad, are you listening to me?

249
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,113
Yes, of course.

250
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,072
I can't stand this.

251
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,699
Turn this off.

252
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,809
THE BLUE BIRD

253
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,001
Hello!

254
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,212
-Gosh, it's cold.
-Hi, Hae-won. How are you?

255
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,005
Hae-won, I'm back.

256
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,049
-Hi, Hae-won.
-Goodness. Hello.

257
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,467
So did you see a doctor?

258
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,219
-The thing about a cold is--
-Did you catch a cold?

259
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,637
-Yes, she did.
-Where is he?

260
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,472
Where is our dear crazy Eun-seop?

261
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,725
Hey, Eun-seop. Don't ask me
to run errands for you again.

262
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,478
We have sweet red bean buns today.

263
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,480
Really? That would go well with milk.

264
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,690
-You can just stay seated.
-Right.

265
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,026
Seung-ho, let's move this over here.
One, two…

266
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,487
Su-jeong, over here.

267
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,656
Oh, no. Look what you've done.

268
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,616
Gosh, this is heavy.

269
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,078
Thank you.

270
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,583
This looks really delicious.

271
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,042
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

272
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,670
-This looks too nice to eat.
-Please go ahead.

273
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,047
Grandpa is toasting sweet red bean buns.

274
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,216
-Let's eat them later.
-You made this yourself?

275
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,175
Of course.

276
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,760
Oh, right.

277
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,518
ISSUE! GLOBAL TOPIC
AN OLD ENGLISHMAN'S SPECIAL JOURNEY

278
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:38,855
I read this beautiful article
a few days ago.

279
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,401
An 80-year-old Englishman decides

280
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:47,155
to travel with a travel brochure
he's had forever.

281
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:54,203
He plans to take a plane
to Bavaria, Germany.

282
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,542
The place has a vibrant city
that hosts music festivals every year.

283
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:03,796
But something wasn't right.

284
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,090
He follows the map on the brochure,

285
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,509
but instead of finding the city,

286
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,054
he gets lost deep in the woods.

287
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,976
He manages to find his way out
after spending two days in the forest.

288
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:21,731
Then he returns home
and shows others that the map is wrong.

289
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,276
That's when someone points out to him,

290
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,570
"Look,

291
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,698
this was made right after
the end of the First World War."

292
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:35,119
"That happened more than 100 years ago."

293
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,419
He did visit the place of his dreams,

294
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,256
but it was completely different
from what he had seen

295
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,175
on his map countless times.

296
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,722
How is this a beautiful article?
I think it's sad.

297
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:55,974
I agree.

298
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,392
Really?

299
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,019
But I found it beautiful.

300
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,022
Even though he failed,

301
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:07,986
he completed a tough journey
for his dream and happiness.

302
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,530
I wanted to applaud him for that.

303
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,324
As you know, it's also my dream

304
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,619
to travel to faraway places as he did.

305
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,833
Well, I guess it was a brave
and beautiful thing to try

306
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,126
but this article--

307
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:27,839
To me, this sounds similar to
the story The Blue Bird.

308
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,884
In the book, a brother and sister travel
to find the bluebird of happiness.

309
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,886
But they fail and come back.

310
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,014
That's sad, Hwi.

311
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,598
No, it's okay.

312
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:42,186
They find the bluebird in their birdcage
when they return home.

313
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,771
It has a completely happy ending.

314
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,983
I don't really like
the story of The Blue Bird.

315
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,609
How come?

316
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,278
It makes no sense.

317
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,740
"Happiness has been by my side all along,
but I failed to notice."

318
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,033
Isn't that disheartening?

319
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,493
What's wrong with that?
You can go without knowing!

320
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:01,122
It's just like how I'm a gem
but Yeong-su doesn't know.

321
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,915
-You see?
-But to him, you're not a gem--

322
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,168
Stop!

323
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,088
Anyway, I really don't think
it's a good story.

324
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,300
Really? But--

325
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,217
I agree.

326
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,179
I'm with Hyeon-ji on this.

327
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,600
It's a story about how they go
on a long journey to find happiness,

328
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:25,104
only to find it in their house.

329
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,606
Maybe

330
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,609
it's an excuse we made up
to comfort ourselves

331
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,029
from having a hard time finding happiness.

332
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,367
Because I think happiness is far away.

333
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,288
Hye-won, but still.

334
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,499
I know. I'm just sharing what I--

335
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:48,044
No, that's not what I'm talking about.
I wanted to say that I'm a gem.

336
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:50,129
-A different topic.
-I mean it.

337
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,632
I really am a gem!

338
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:55,843
But he's with Je-in.

339
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,303
Je-in? Who is she?

340
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,321
So…

341
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,074
what are your thoughts
on your book signing event?

342
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,995
Well, isn't it for you to decide?

343
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,794
How about the "Meet the Author" event?

344
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:31,420
That sounds good.

345
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,756
I'm down with whatever you suggest.

346
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,134
Anyway,

347
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,386
how about we go for another drink?

348
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,348
Yes, we can have something simple.

349
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,993
We had a great time today.

350
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,286
I said I'm a gem!

351
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:04,662
-Bye, Hae-won!
-I'm right!

352
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,080
-No you're not.
-Yes, I am!

353
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,999
-Good night!
-I really am a gem!

354
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:23,598
-I'll get going, too.
-Hold on.

355
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,612
-Here.
-What is it?

356
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:41,741
Medicine. You'll get better sooner
if you take this before going to bed.

357
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,036
No, it's okay.

358
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,212
MEDICINE

359
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:01,636
Hae-won!

360
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,682
Mok Hae-won!

361
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:15,900
Take this with you.

362
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,944
I said it's okay.

363
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,363
Still.

364
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,448
No, I don't want it.

365
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,075
Bye.

366
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,827
-Hae-won.
-I said I don't want it.

367
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:31,832
Take the medicine.

368
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,835
You got better without it.

369
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,047
I'll get better without it too

370
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,675
once I get a good night's sleep.

371
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,677
Please take it.

372
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,098
Please?

373
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,351
Then what will you do for me?

374
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,938
What can you do for me

375
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,482
if I take this medicine?

376
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,238
Must I

377
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,865
do something for you?

378
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,242
Yes.

379
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,661
I wish you would.

380
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:13,291
-Like…
-Maybe you could…

381
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,378
respond to my confession.

382
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,177
I want to hear it.

383
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,848
Can you do that for me?

384
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:57,520
I'm sorry.

385
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:04,944
I'm really sorry.

386
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,801
I like you, Eun-seop.

387
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,482
Mom!

388
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,860
Mom! Do you know where that book is?

389
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,862
I don't know. What book?

390
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,156
It's the one I had to read this week.

391
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,492
I have to bring it to school today,
but it's gone!

392
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,911
Didn't you give that
to Eun-seop the other day?

393
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,288
You asked him for a summary.

394
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,372
That's right!

395
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,124
Oh, no. What should I do?

396
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,710
It's simple. We'll call him.

397
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,670
Right, a call. Then I'll go pack my bag.

398
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:30,899
Yes, hello?

399
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:34,820
Yes, Father.

400
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,281
Do you remember the book Hwi gave you?

401
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,034
You mean that novel?

402
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,080
The title was…

403
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,333
What's the book title?

404
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,043
I think it said "Rye"?

405
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,295
She says it's "Rye" something.

406
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,798
The Catcher in the Rye.

407
00:43:58,927 --> 00:43:59,762
Yes.

408
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,223
Oh, is that so?

409
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,059
No, I can go quickly.

410
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:07,770
Yes.

411
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,863
What did he say? Where is it?
What? Is he bringing it?

412
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,198
What? Dad, I'm in a rush!

413
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,659
The thing is…

414
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,452
Yes. What is it?

415
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,412
Dad, I'm doomed if I get another penalty.

416
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,081
My whole life will come to an end.

417
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,165
What is it?

418
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,210
It's on the mountain.

419
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,252
Unbelievable.

420
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,922
He said he put it in his backpack

421
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,132
that he left on the mountain
the last time--

422
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,926
Whatever. Tell him to bring it now!

423
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,887
Tell him to scurry like a squirrel
to climb up that mountain.

424
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,139
-Right?
-No!

425
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,184
Never! Not the mountain!

426
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:48,727
No, he can't go!

427
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,604
He can't.

428
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:18,882
Mother.

429
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,093
No, never. Do you understand?

430
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:24,930
I can talk to Hwi.
So you're not going, okay?

431
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:29,226
-But I can--
-Now, you promised me

432
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,103
you'd never go there again, didn't you?

433
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:32,438
Yes, I did, but…

434
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:35,107
How about I go instead? Would that work?

435
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,153
-Or you and I could--
-But how will you climb a mountain?

436
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,697
Then just forget about it. I can just…

437
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,494
Hae-won!

438
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,746
Do you have some time now?

439
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:51,832
Are you busy?

440
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,876
Mother, please don't.

441
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,586
-You can talk to me.
-No.

442
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,880
-Now isn't a good time.
-What?

443
00:45:58,839 --> 00:45:59,715
Why?

444
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,384
Why is that?

445
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,011
We can talk.

446
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,099
GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE

447
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,859
Forget about what my mother said.

448
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,363
She's just worried
because I went missing the other day.

449
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,908
That's why she asked you for help.

450
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,660
I can just go by myself.

451
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:32,164
I'll tell her that we went together.

452
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:34,833
Eun-seop.

453
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,963
That's one way of doing it.

454
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,636
But I've never lied like that before.

455
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,938
We can go together. It's not a big deal.

456
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,953
Did you know that this was here?

457
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:54,746
Yes.

458
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,165
It's a tomb.

459
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,377
This is where suspicions come true.

460
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:03,672
Suspicions?

461
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,427
If you come here
and think about your suspicions,

462
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,178
they come true.

463
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,562
I think I was in high school.

464
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,983
I felt uneasy
about my father driving a tractor.

465
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,321
You're here.

466
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:29,781
Mother, what happened?

467
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,408
Your father was driving a tractor…

468
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:32,784
He ended up getting injured.

469
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,370
That's scary.

470
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,206
That means there will be misfortune.

471
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,542
Not always.

472
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,504
Sometimes good suspicions come true too.

473
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,173
Hae-won, where's your seat?

474
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:55,307
C-3.

475
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,393
This way!

476
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,970
I've never seen a wooden tombstone.

477
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,472
KIM GIL-SANG

478
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,517
The date of birth and death
are in question marks.

479
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:56,827
Stop suspecting.

480
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,581
It will come true.

481
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,088
You can go down first.

482
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,219
That way is to the summit.

483
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,679
I want to go there
since I've come this far.

484
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,473
Bye.

485
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,332
That part is slippery.

486
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:21,930
Hold my hand.

487
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:51,478
So this view was only an hour away.

488
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,235
It's nice.

489
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:09,788
To be honest…

490
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:17,045
I can't look you straight in the eyes.

491
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,720
I just need to accept…

492
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,017
the fact that you don't like me.

493
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,777
But it's hard. I'm sorry.

494
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,532
Don't be.

495
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,123
You were so warm.

496
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,269
You were so warm to me.

497
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,377
So I kept on suspecting.

498
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,930
But I won't anymore. I will stop.

499
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,186
You told me not to,
so from now on, I won't.

500
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:02,776
I should stop.

501
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:13,620
But Eun-seop.

502
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,141
Never mind. I should go.

503
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,843
Bluebirds exist, Hae-won.

504
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,470
You're lying.

505
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,306
They're real. Trust me.

506
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,266
But you've never seen one.

507
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,934
You can't see them every day.

508
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,563
They only show up every once in a while.

509
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,106
How?

510
00:58:06,691 --> 00:58:07,817
Like a miracle.

511
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:09,277
A miracle?

512
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:10,945
What is that?

513
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,579
What do I do?

514
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,796
My suspicion came true.

515
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:33,343
It's when something you believed
could never happen, happens.

516
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,639
Who makes that happen?

517
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,308
A bluebird.

518
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,127
The bluebird that's always by your side
makes that happen.

519
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,883
That bird will bring you miracles.

520
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:53,047
BOOKSTORE JOURNAL
A GOODNIGHT BOOKSTORE PRIVATE BLOG POST

521
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,799
POSTED BY SEOP

522
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,679
There are things you can see better alone,

523
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:04,684
and it's not that bad
to learn from loneliness.

524
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:09,731
The less you expect, the easier life gets.

525
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:14,694
It hurts to genuinely want something.

526
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:19,782
Yet, my heart still has desires.

527
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:24,662
I kissed Irene on the mountain.
I almost fainted.

528
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:29,751
I can no longer joke about it,
which means that this is serious.

529
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:35,965
Now, she lives behind my eyes.

530
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,597
I thought you didn't like me.

531
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,057
That's impossible.

532
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,142
What's this chemistry between you two?

533
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:48,936
So what I saw earlier was for real?

534
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:49,937
Myeong-yeo.

535
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:53,733
You have to write about your life
from college until now as a novel.

536
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,734
About your book.

537
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:58,237
He asked if you really
have no intention of publishing it.

538
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,614
-What is it?
-Nothing.

539
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,866
I was worried about what I'd do
if you suddenly disappeared.

540
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,451
They always made me uneasy.

541
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:07,038
I was afraid my precarious moment of
happiness would disappear in an instant.

542
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:13,670
