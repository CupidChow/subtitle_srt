00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:15,833
<i>Many times we try to</i>
<i>search for past stories in our lives.</i>

2
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:21,208
<i>Wondering which memories</i>
<i>we might have lost.</i>

3
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:26,375
<i>Sometimes, we remember.</i>

4
00:01:29,625 --> 00:01:33,000
<i>And many times,</i>
<i>they've fallen into a deep black hole.</i>

5
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:37,916
<i>Despite how hard we try to retrieve them,</i>

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,375
<i>we can't find them.</i>

7
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,708
<i>Until one day, we encounter a miracle</i>

8
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:50,208
<i>that brings us back to</i>
<i>the pit of memories.</i>

9
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,875
<i>Allowing us to search</i>

10
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,875
<i>and rediscover those stories once again.</i>

11
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,833
Hello, Ma'am. Delivery.

12
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:54,125
- Put it right here.
- Yes, Ma'am.

13
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,416
Eh, still one set left, right?

14
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,833
Yes, one more set.
Can I get that for you tomorrow?

15
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,166
Yes, but don't come in late.

16
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,583
Thank you, of course.

17
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,041
Thank you.

18
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,416
Okay.

19
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,750
Is…the agreement ready?

20
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,541
Nothing to fix, proceed as it is.

21
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,125
If it's done, I'll sign it.

22
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,041
Yes.

23
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:55,333
Yes, thank you.

24
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,375
Take care, then.

DUSIT PHOTO SHOP

26
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,916
When we get new pictures,
I wanna develop 'em.

27
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,291
Sure.

28
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm heading out.

29
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,125
Stay safe.

30
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,750
Bring me next time.

31
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,750
Sure, but give me the bag for now.

32
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,625
Gimme.

33
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,625
Gotta go.

34
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,208
See you soon.

35
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:00,750
See you soon.

36
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,166
I'm off.

37
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:19,250
<i>A Thai underwater photographer</i>
<i>went missing in the Italian sea,</i>

38
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:24,250
<i>while he was diving</i>
<i>for a photography expedition</i>

39
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,750
<i>at an underwater cave in Ravenna.</i>

40
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:30,791
<i>During the dive, he got separated</i>
<i>from the team and went missing.</i>

41
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,750
<i>The search team has mobilized</i>
<i>over 100 personnel,</i>

42
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:39,333
<i>including divers and rescue units,</i>
<i>but no trace of him.</i>

43
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:25,375
- Okay.
<i>- Okay, take care.</i>

44
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,750
Take care, Mom.

45
00:12:55,291 --> 00:13:00,000
<i>Today, there is the mission that will send</i>
<i>astronauts to the Lunar Gateway,</i>

46
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,958
<i>named Overture 9.</i>

47
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:06,250
<i>In this mission, we have two things</i>
<i>to be glad for Thailand.</i>

48
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:09,625
<i>Firstly, Overture 9 has chosen</i>
<i>Thailand to provide</i>

49
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,166
<i>the main food for the astronauts</i>

50
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,625
<i>which confirms that the Thai food industry</i>

51
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:19,750
<i>passed the highest safety measure</i>
<i>on the space standard levels.</i>

52
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:24,625
<i>This confirms that our food is toxin-free</i>
<i>and we have best food safety in the world.</i>

53
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:28,833
<i>For the mission to send astronauts</i>
<i>to Lunar Gateway station,</i>

54
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:32,458
<i>Overture 9, will be</i>
<i>another step for mankind,</i>

55
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:36,791
<i>to open a new chapter in history</i>
<i>towards a permanent presence on the moon,</i>

56
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,833
<i>and will be the first step in</i>
<i>exploring other planets, far from here</i>

57
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,083
<i>which humans have yet to explore.</i>

58
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,583
<i>And another pride of Thailand,</i>

59
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:50,791
<i>Ms Linlada Sasinpimon is a part</i>
<i>of the team as a mission specialist.</i>

60
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:54,583
<i>She has become one of</i>
<i>the inspirations for Thai youths,</i>

61
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:58,708
<i>encouraging them to dare</i>
<i>and follow their dreams.</i>

62
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,833
- Thank you.
- See you next time, kiddo.

63
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,500
Of course.

64
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,166
Kath!

65
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,833
Kath…

66
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,500
Always late.

67
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,625
Sorry. Come on, let's go.

68
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,125
Come on!

69
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:31,833
Come, I'll pay for your O-aew jelly.

70
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,750
Let's go.

71
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,833
Hold on tight.

72
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,625
Here we go.

73
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,958
You drive so slow.

74
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,500
I don't want to reach home too soon.

75
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:18,625
Then, don't drive slowly,
just take a detour instead.

76
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,375
Sure.

77
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,000
It's my first time to see this.

78
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,000
So many unique patterns.

79
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:47,333
In a kaleidoscope, every image we see
is a reflection of each other.

80
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,708
Each image has a relation
to the one next to it.

81
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:58,125
Oh, like having
multiple dimensions of you?

82
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,833
Yeah.

83
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:08,583
I only wanna see you
in this dimension, here…

84
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,791
without any reflections.

85
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,500
Me too.

86
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:45,375
<i>MAX-Q, the vehicle has reached</i>
<i>the highest pressure of the flight path.</i>

87
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,250
How's the breathing?

88
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,791
I can hold longer.

89
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,875
Good.

90
00:22:23,708 --> 00:22:26,083
Don't exceed your limits.
I'm worried, ya know?

91
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,333
Worried?

92
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:29,916
Then, come down with me.

93
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,083
Nah, I'd drown.

94
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:34,666
I'll teach you.

95
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,500
I can't swim.

96
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,208
And if I drown, who would save me?

97
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,500
Okay, then teach me next time.

98
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,083
But thanks for coming with me.

99
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:52,000
Can't swim, can't help me.

100
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,541
But you're cute, eh?

101
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,291
<i>Strange, huh?</i>

102
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,875
<i>I want to go up,</i>

103
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,333
<i>but you want to go down.</i>

104
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,791
<i>Going different directions,</i>
<i>hard luck meeting.</i>

105
00:31:51,916 --> 00:31:55,208
3…2…1…

106
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,250
<i>Lin!</i>

107
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,625
Tom!

108
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,000
<i>Lin!</i>

109
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,041
<i>Lin!</i>

110
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:10,583
Lin?

111
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,041
<i>Lin?</i>

112
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:27,333
YEAR 2004

113
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,666
Why do you like this song?

114
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:43,416
Do you know its meaning?

115
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:46,500
Its meaning is…

116
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:50,458
The only thing that can break
every rule of physics in this universe is…

117
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,625
Love.

118
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:55,250
Love will make two people,

119
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:57,666
no matter how many light years apart,

120
00:41:58,666 --> 00:42:00,625
love will shorten the distance

121
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:03,958
between the two hearts
to keep them close, always.

122
00:42:05,416 --> 00:42:07,708
How's that? Romantic, huh?

123
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,291
Is it good?

124
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:27,541
Wanna try?

125
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,625
Is it good?

126
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:39,041
Nah.

127
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,291
Delicious yet?

128
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:48,833
Yeah.

129
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,125
It's spilling.

130
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:11,166
It's spilling.

131
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:49,916
Hello, Mom.

132
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:54,583
Oh, Lin. Kath is upstairs,
she hasn't woke up yet.

133
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:56,333
- You can go wake her up.
- Alright.

134
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,875
Okay, place your hands on your thighs.

135
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:01,750
Back straight.

136
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:05,250
Lower your chin a bit.

137
00:44:05,333 --> 00:44:08,083
1…2…3

138
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:25,875
Time to wake up.

139
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,041
So early.

140
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,000
Can you be here every morning?

141
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:35,625
Every day, huh?

142
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:44,458
You know what today is?

143
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:46,208
What day?

144
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:48,958
Competition day.

145
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,250
You're right.

146
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:55,500
- Shower quickly.
- Why didn't you wake me?

147
00:44:56,666 --> 00:44:57,916
Go shower.

148
00:44:59,541 --> 00:45:00,708
I'll wait downstairs.

149
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,833
So long.

150
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:15,875
All done.
You can pick them up in two days.

151
00:45:15,958 --> 00:45:17,291
Yes, thank you.

152
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:20,375
I'm heading out with Lin, Mom.

153
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:21,333
Where are you going?

154
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,083
Around, for fun.

155
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,750
Things that I warned you about…

156
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:34,333
You never listen, do you?

157
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,125
I'm a freediver.

158
00:45:48,083 --> 00:45:49,375
What's so wrong about that?

159
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,916
Can't I follow my dreams?

160
00:45:58,208 --> 00:45:59,583
Your dreams…

161
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:04,083
Some day you won't be able to return here.

162
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:11,375
Dad said that every freediver…

163
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:15,208
knows that this sport is risky
and very dangerous.

164
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:21,250
But they are happy to do it.

165
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:27,166
I have never touched my dream even once.

166
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,416
You've already reached your own.

167
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:34,583
But you chose to stop it yourself.

168
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:42,833
Even if Dad has been gone a long time,

169
00:46:45,291 --> 00:46:50,083
I believe that
he still supports us to be divers.

170
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:53,458
You were a great freediver.

171
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:56,750
I wanna be great like you.

172
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:04,125
Today, I'll make you see…

173
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,291
that I can do it.

174
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:10,958
Dad watches over us.

175
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:20,666
Even though you don't support my dream,

176
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:22,916
please don't stop me.

177
00:47:34,916 --> 00:47:35,916
Lin…

178
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,000
Wait a moment.

179
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:57,083
Can you give this robe to Kath?

180
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,875
Try to relax. Focus.

181
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:22,833
Ready?

182
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:25,625
If you're not,
we can go later, near the end.

183
00:48:27,333 --> 00:48:31,125
Early or late,
I still need to join the competition.

184
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,333
Now's good, Lin.

185
00:48:34,208 --> 00:48:36,208
Kath, you can stand-by now.

186
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:39,333
Go.

187
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:55,166
Hurry back up. I'll be waiting.

188
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,125
Yeah.

189
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:57,500
Go.

190
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:07,083
Kath, you ready?

191
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:12,083
Kath!

192
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:12,125
Hey!

193
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,916
Can I get film developed by this evening?

194
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,958
Lin?

195
00:52:14,125 --> 00:52:15,625
You know me?

196
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,666
Can I pick it up this evening?

197
00:52:51,416 --> 00:52:52,250
Kath.

198
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:55,541
Why didn't you answer the customer?

199
00:53:03,375 --> 00:53:04,625
Dad?

200
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:09,708
Let me.

201
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:13,708
Here it is.

202
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:21,666
Please deliver to this address then.

203
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:23,083
Oh, sure.

204
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,250
Three days from now.

205
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:35,583
Thank you.

206
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:38,916
I'm going now.

207
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:49,750
Hey, Is that the photo that you developed?

208
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:52,500
Let me see.

209
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:02,875
Oh, you're so good at
developing photographs.

210
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:04,625
Good job.

211
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:10,666
Are you alright?

212
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:12,958
Huh?

213
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:19,791
Look here.

214
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:24,333
Kath!

215
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:26,166
You're already back?

216
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:28,583
Put these away in the kitchen.

217
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:31,416
I already bought everything you asked for.

218
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,583
I asked?

219
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:36,208
You did!

220
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:38,666
Here, put them away in the kitchen.

221
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,541
- Mom.
- Hmm?

222
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:42,791
Is this real?

223
00:54:43,583 --> 00:54:44,708
Of course it is.

224
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:47,666
You said you're gonna
make fried bitter-beans for Dad.

225
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:52,833
You keep watching
the fighting fish instead of working.

226
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:53,875
I finished it.

227
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,458
You keep watching, it will get pregnant.

228
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:59,708
You crazy? How could the fish
get pregnant with me?

229
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:02,375
Put them away in the kitchen, dear.

230
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,291
What?

231
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:09,166
These bitter-beans are good.

232
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:12,958
Wanna eat fried bitter-beans, really?

233
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:15,791
Mom.

234
00:55:16,875 --> 00:55:18,375
I need to borrow it, Mom.

235
00:55:18,458 --> 00:55:20,583
Borrow? Where are you going?

236
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,958
Kath, where are you going?

237
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:26,583
Who's gonna cook for Dad?

238
00:55:26,666 --> 00:55:27,500
Kath!

239
00:55:29,666 --> 00:55:30,625
Kath.

240
00:55:30,708 --> 00:55:32,333
Ride safely, dear.

241
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:34,750
Kath!

242
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:44,125
You finished, Lin?

243
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:46,625
Hurry a bit.

244
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:52,416
Hello, Sir.

245
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:54,833
Oh, hello.

246
00:55:55,666 --> 00:55:57,166
The shop is already closed.

247
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Where's Lin?

248
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:02,333
Lin's inside.

249
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:03,291
Thank you.

250
00:56:13,083 --> 00:56:14,083
Where are you going?

251
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:18,250
Moving to Phuket.

252
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:21,416
Right now?

253
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,333
Yeah.

254
00:56:33,625 --> 00:56:35,958
Go shop there some time. Bye.

255
00:56:39,125 --> 00:56:40,000
Lin…

256
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,625
It's Kath. Remember me?

257
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:51,083
Mm, yeah. We've just met at the store.

258
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:55,500
Just that?

259
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:06,583
Of course. You're a junior, after me.

260
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:09,416
The school's drum major.
Everyone knows you.

261
00:57:14,166 --> 00:57:15,166
You only remember that?

262
00:57:21,291 --> 00:57:22,375
Lin!

263
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,041
I'm coming, Dad.

264
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:27,958
Uncle Tinn.

265
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,458
We'll be off.

266
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:31,291
Good luck. Come back to visit sometime.

267
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:33,416
Okay, come to us, too.

268
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,916
- Okay, sure.
- Yeah.

269
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,958
If you'll come visit, why do I have to go?

270
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,541
I gotta go.

271
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:45,833
See you.

272
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:21,166
Is that your friend?

273
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:23,000
Nope! She is a younger sister at school.

274
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,375
You girls talked so long.

275
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,041
Are you ready?

276
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:39,375
1 MONTH LATER

277
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:15,000
Ah, Kath. I prepared
everything for you, dear.

278
00:59:17,458 --> 00:59:18,833
Thank you, Mom.

279
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,250
Acting naughty again, you!

280
00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:27,833
Try kicking it, Dad.

281
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:31,875
Kicking it?

282
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,291
It's time to get it now, I think.

283
00:59:43,375 --> 00:59:46,125
It's always like that.
Needs a kick to get it started.

284
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,041
How did you know?

285
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:49,250
I guessed.

286
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:56,041
Oh, stop pretending, honey.

287
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:59,958
You can say if it hurts.
She already knows.

288
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:06,958
- Are you actually hurting?
- Of course, who would act hurt?

289
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,291
I guess you can't kick the bucket now.

290
01:00:13,583 --> 01:00:15,958
- How dare you challenge me on this?
- Come on!

291
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:21,083
<i>It's been so long</i>
<i>that I haven't felt like this.</i>

292
01:00:21,958 --> 01:00:24,916
<i>Or is this a parallel world</i>

293
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,750
<i>like we saw in the movies?</i>

294
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:31,125
<i>So many questions, yet to be answered.</i>

295
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:34,166
My feet hurt but not something else.

296
01:00:36,375 --> 01:00:38,708
Ah, I better go.

297
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:44,333
Kath, the fin, dear. You forgot the fin.

298
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:45,541
Thank you, Mom.

299
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:48,666
- Good luck.
- Bye-bye.

300
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,000
<i>How can I be here?</i>

301
01:00:59,458 --> 01:01:02,208
<i>It's like there's a force</i>
<i>yanking me there,</i>

302
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,125
<i>and then yanking me back here.</i>

303
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:10,416
<i>Everything here seems to</i>
<i>be everything I ever dreamed of.</i>

304
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:14,750
<i>But there's only one thing. I want it</i>
<i>to be like the world I came from.</i>

305
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,750
<i>But it never happened…</i>

306
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:56,333
Didn't you move to Phuket for a month now?

307
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:00,500
I came back to work.

308
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,500
Work on what?

309
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:05,666
They have a freediving competition here.

310
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:08,791
You're competing?

311
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:12,333
Not competing, the staff team.

312
01:02:13,625 --> 01:02:14,500
Huh?

313
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:18,166
And, are you competing, Kath?

314
01:02:18,250 --> 01:02:19,083
Yeah.

315
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:21,791
Keep on fighting.

316
01:02:23,083 --> 01:02:24,958
Thank you, Lin.

317
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:38,333
I gotta go.

318
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,958
Let's go together.

319
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:50,666
Faster, faster, faster.
It's about to start.

320
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:52,541
It's starting! It's starting. Come on.

321
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,375
Don't go yet! Wait for me.

322
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:58,666
Hurry, Kath!

323
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,000
Wait, wait, wait.

324
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:03,708
Hurry, Kath.

325
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:05,166
Wait for me.

326
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:07,583
I'm going!

327
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:11,541
Wait for me!

328
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,750
Get on.

329
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:20,375
Okay, Let’s go.

330
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:21,916
Let’s go.

331
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:27,708
Climbing here.

332
01:03:43,041 --> 01:03:44,791
Eat well, baby.

333
01:03:46,291 --> 01:03:48,291
Nom! There ya go.

334
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,458
Sathu!

335
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:08,166
It's very late, why aren't you in bed?

336
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,583
Mom will complain.

337
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:13,333
A minute. I wanna watch you work.

338
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,333
What work?

339
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:17,958
Looking at an amulet.

340
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,708
Here, look at these photos.

341
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:24,541
I took them back when I was young.

342
01:04:25,125 --> 01:04:28,041
Any beautiful spot,
I went and took all of them.

343
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:33,291
This is the reason why you like diving?

344
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:35,166
Yes.

345
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,041
I want to capture
the beautiful underwater scenery

346
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:41,041
for others who won't be able to see it.

347
01:04:41,125 --> 01:04:42,833
That's how these pictures came to be.

348
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:46,916
And you, what do you wanna do?

349
01:04:58,916 --> 01:05:00,666
I wanna see you.

350
01:05:07,375 --> 01:05:09,708
I want you to be with me all my life.

351
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:17,958
Oh, what's going on, huh?

352
01:05:18,583 --> 01:05:23,000
You want me to take
pretty underwater pictures for you,

353
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:24,666
right?

354
01:05:25,375 --> 01:05:26,375
Yes, Dad.

355
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:29,500
What is it?

356
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,875
Snot and tears just from this?

357
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:34,541
Seriously, is it that sentimental?

358
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,416
Hey…

359
01:05:40,375 --> 01:05:41,625
I'm asking you seriously,

360
01:05:43,041 --> 01:05:46,000
why do you want to be a freediver?

361
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,041
It might run in the DNA.

362
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:53,875
Mom is a freediver.

363
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,500
Dad is an underwater photographer.

364
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:01,916
And I'm still
the best person in the world.

365
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:02,833
Right.

366
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,541
But I'm not good at it.

367
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:15,333
Sometimes I feel exhausted,
and I wanna quit, Dad.

368
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,625
Kath…

369
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,541
Never stop dreaming, dear.

370
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,583
If we keep doing it,

371
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:29,208
one day, the dream might come true.

372
01:06:30,875 --> 01:06:34,375
Look at me. These beautiful pictures.

373
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:37,791
I was looked down upon a lot once,

374
01:06:37,875 --> 01:06:39,875
and told I could never
sell these pretty pictures.

375
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:44,000
If I'd stopped because of their words,

376
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:47,375
I wouldn't have ever met your mom.

377
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:52,916
And I wouldn't have
a lovely daughter like you.

378
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:55,875
Keep fighting.

379
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:01,333
Very good.

380
01:07:02,416 --> 01:07:03,541
Time for bed.

381
01:07:04,041 --> 01:07:05,333
You crybaby.

382
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:11,875
Go to sleep.

383
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:17,166
Sathu.

384
01:07:19,291 --> 01:07:20,458
Still?

385
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:23,250
Still not going to bed?

386
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,625
Go, dear. Sweet dreams.

387
01:07:30,291 --> 01:07:31,375
Alright.

388
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:09,333
Who are you looking for?

389
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,291
It's nothing.

390
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:14,541
Here.

391
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:16,375
Thank you.

392
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:27,083
Miss Kath, ready for stand-by.

393
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:28,000
Okay.

394
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:29,833
Kath

395
01:08:31,416 --> 01:08:32,833
You have to do it today.

396
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,041
Safety, go now.

397
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:57,083
Come in, come in.

398
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:01,083
Come, come. A bit more.

399
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:02,583
Kath!

400
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:04,041
- Carry her. Carry her in.
- Over here.

401
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:05,166
Put her on the ground.

402
01:11:16,416 --> 01:11:18,000
- Kath!
- CPR, calm down.

403
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:27,041
Stay clear. Stay clear.

404
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,083
Kath…

405
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:36,125
Why did you push your limits?

406
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:38,208
It's not worth it if something happens.

407
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:51,625
Thank you.

408
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:03,416
You might have to
save me my whole life, Lin.

409
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,250
Because this is my dream.

410
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:10,125
Being in freediving competitions.

411
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,791
It's like letting yourself go.

412
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:20,541
Leave everything on the surface.

413
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:23,000
And think about the world below.

414
01:12:25,791 --> 01:12:26,875
So deep.

415
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,750
What about you? Your dreams?

416
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,875
It's more like a daydreaming than a dream.

417
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:49,291
So what it is?

418
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:05,750
I love stargazing.

419
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,833
I wanna be up there.

420
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,416
I want to explore space.

421
01:13:17,208 --> 01:13:18,625
I'll live on this planet…

422
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:23,458
and go to that planet there.

423
01:13:25,583 --> 01:13:28,166
As far as Uranus over there.

424
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:33,375
Where is Uranus?

425
01:13:34,458 --> 01:13:36,458
It's too far. You can't see it.

426
01:13:38,291 --> 01:13:40,958
But it's December, we just might.

427
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,208
There! A comet!

428
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:46,750
That's right.

429
01:14:00,208 --> 01:14:01,750
But really, Kath,

430
01:14:03,416 --> 01:14:07,458
my dreams won't come true,
compared to yours.

431
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,375
Don't stop dreaming.

432
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:15,375
One day, it might come true.

433
01:14:19,958 --> 01:14:22,125
When you reach Uranus,

434
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,166
find a way to send a signal to me…

435
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,958
telling me which planet it is.

436
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:37,083
Kath… you're the first person

437
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:40,541
who said what I talk about can come true.

438
01:14:44,125 --> 01:14:47,375
Promise that you won't give up your dream.

439
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:03,083
Yeah.

440
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:33,041
How do you know how to row?

441
01:15:34,125 --> 01:15:36,500
My birth home is near the sea,
of course I'd know.

442
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,375
Not true. I used to know someone…

443
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:43,250
whose birth home is here,
but can't even swim.

444
01:15:43,333 --> 01:15:45,291
- Really?
- Yeah.

445
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:48,125
Is there really someone who lives
by the sea but can't swim?

446
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,500
Yes, there is.

447
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:55,875
- But I have a confession.
- Huh?

448
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,125
This is the first time I rowed.

449
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:00,916
Really?

450
01:16:03,666 --> 01:16:05,041
I feel completely at ease.

451
01:16:19,125 --> 01:16:21,000
<i>I really wanna stop time here, Lin.</i>

452
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:24,250
<i>Where it's just the two of us.</i>

453
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:35,958
Kath.

454
01:16:36,541 --> 01:16:38,000
- We're here.
- Yeah.

455
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:41,875
We're here.

456
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:56,333
Gotta go.

457
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:58,375
Kath?

458
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:00,125
Huh?

459
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:06,250
Wanna hang out tomorrow?

460
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:09,166
Where are we going?

461
01:17:10,750 --> 01:17:11,791
To see the fog sea.

462
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:14,750
Khao Khai Nui, right?

463
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:17,166
Mmm.

464
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:19,333
Of course! I've been there before.

465
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,333
Then… let's meet up there.

466
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:27,541
I have something for you,
something to tell.

467
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:33,166
Really? Then tell me now.
Give it to me right now.

468
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:35,125
Not now.

469
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:38,208
It's not romantic. I'm off.

470
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,208
Take care.

471
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:29,208
Hello?

472
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:32,666
Pi Lin… where are you?

473
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:34,916
The fog is beautiful. Come take pictures.

474
01:18:35,916 --> 01:18:36,958
I'm going.

475
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:40,541
What are you doing? Why didn't you hurry?

476
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,166
I'm taking pictures of the beach.

477
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,916
Ah, is it pretty?

478
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:46,791
<i>The water's a bit weird.</i>

479
01:18:48,916 --> 01:18:51,083
It receded from the beach by a lot.

480
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:02,291
Pi Lin! Get out of there!

481
01:19:03,916 --> 01:19:05,083
<i>Big wave!</i>

482
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:07,791
<i>Lin!</i>

483
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:16,125
Pi Lin, do you hear me?

484
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,541
<i>Pi Lin!</i>

485
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:00,541
Pi Lin!

486
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:19,583
Kathariya!

487
01:22:20,208 --> 01:22:21,083
Kath!

488
01:27:56,916 --> 01:27:57,750
Lin.

489
01:28:10,125 --> 01:28:11,041
Kath.

490
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:22,833
Kath.

491
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:48,625
Lin?

492
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:50,791
Uncle!

493
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:20,125
You're lucky the bullet just grazed you.

494
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:26,541
You look better. You'll be fine soon.

495
01:29:28,125 --> 01:29:29,083
Uncle, go downstairs.

496
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:31,375
I'll handle things here.

497
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:34,583
Get some rest, alright?

498
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:38,416
Dad!

499
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,791
Do you remember me?

500
01:29:56,750 --> 01:30:00,916
I think…you should rest a bit more.

501
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:02,916
It will get better soon.

502
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:06,541
Take care of her.

503
01:30:17,708 --> 01:30:19,125
Who was that man?

504
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:26,291
Uncle Tianwang, the owner
of the Chinese opera troupe.

505
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:52,833
You can speak Thai?

506
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:57,958
I'm a half British, half Thai.

507
01:31:06,625 --> 01:31:08,375
Where does the sun rise?

508
01:31:15,416 --> 01:31:18,916
The sun rises in the hearts
of those who do not give up.

509
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,875
Did the British send you?

510
01:31:28,208 --> 01:31:31,791
You're a Free Thai
who has been helping us.

511
01:31:38,625 --> 01:31:41,000
Right now, both the Thai police
and the Japanese soldiers

512
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:42,708
are looking for you.

513
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,916
Don't know when Free Thai
will send a ship to pick you up.

514
01:31:47,791 --> 01:31:49,791
The only way you'll survive,

515
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,958
is to escape on the ship
with those prisoners.

516
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,208
There is no time.

517
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,458
Gotta go out to find intel.

518
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:28,625
Also, I'm Lin.

519
01:32:31,500 --> 01:32:32,666
I'm Kath.

520
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:48,583
Before you passed out,

521
01:32:50,125 --> 01:32:51,875
I heard you call my name.

522
01:32:53,208 --> 01:32:54,458
You know me?

523
01:32:58,875 --> 01:32:59,916
I guessed.

524
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:13,291
Thank you.

525
01:34:07,166 --> 01:34:10,125

01:34:18,375 --> 01:34:20,541
Okay. I'm going to
take the picture, stay still.

528
01:34:20,625 --> 01:34:21,541
Get ready.

529
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:23,750
A little bit to the left.

530
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:27,041
Okay, ready. I'm about to take it.

531
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:29,333
3… 2… 1

532
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:31,791
Done.

533
01:34:31,875 --> 01:34:32,958
Is it okay?

534
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:34,625
Yes, yes. Go change your clothes.

535
01:34:37,208 --> 01:34:38,083
Let's go.

536
01:34:39,791 --> 01:34:40,958
Go where?

537
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:43,625
Is this the time to be doing this?

538
01:34:46,083 --> 01:34:48,416
It won't take long, just a moment.

539
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:54,333
We don't have
many photos together, please.

540
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,250

01:35:01,625 --> 01:35:04,166

take the picture, ready?

542
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:06,083
Alright, go ahead.

01:35:06,166 --> 01:35:07,958
Okay, good pose.

01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:03,916
If you need anything, tell me.

552
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:05,500
Thank you.

553
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:11,416
Sit here for a bit.

554
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,416
I'll go inform my people first.

555
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:23,125
- This war's almost over, don't you think?
- Yeah.

556
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:25,291
No matter who wins,

557
01:36:25,375 --> 01:36:27,125
we'll still be slaves to the Japanese.

558
01:36:27,208 --> 01:36:29,500
Yes! It doesn't matter who wins.

559
01:36:29,583 --> 01:36:32,166
Even if America wins, our country…

560
01:36:32,250 --> 01:36:34,250
will still be slaves to America.

561
01:36:35,125 --> 01:36:37,916
How are we going to live after this?

562
01:36:40,666 --> 01:36:43,458
Thais have never been colonized

563
01:36:43,541 --> 01:36:45,250
or anyone's slaves.

564
01:36:45,333 --> 01:36:48,208
We just fought with each other into chaos.

565
01:36:48,791 --> 01:36:51,541
Hey, you're a foreigner.
What do you know, huh?

566
01:36:51,625 --> 01:36:52,500
I'm Thai.

567
01:36:58,916 --> 01:37:01,000
Don't you know your status?

568
01:37:03,166 --> 01:37:05,416
I just want everyone
not to give up so easily.

569
01:37:06,250 --> 01:37:07,500
I know, Kath.

570
01:37:08,333 --> 01:37:11,250
But right now, you're being hunted.

571
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:14,583
I'm sorry.

572
01:37:15,625 --> 01:37:17,666
Your hair and face
are already eye-catching.

573
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:20,500
If you keep doing this,
I won't be able to help you.

574
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,958
Why are you smiling?

575
01:37:29,125 --> 01:37:31,250
Did you just say I'm beautiful?

576
01:37:38,791 --> 01:37:39,833
Let's go.

577
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:47,291
Sir… check please?

578
01:37:47,375 --> 01:37:48,208
Yes.

579
01:37:49,541 --> 01:37:50,416
Thank you very much.

580
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,083
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

581
01:37:57,625 --> 01:37:59,791
What Thai? Clearly a foreigner.

582
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:04,125
Right? Thai people should look like us.

583
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:13,375
<i>Tomorrow will be our Victory Day.</i>

584
01:38:40,041 --> 01:38:41,500
Hello, Comrade Prim.

585
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:45,666
Is this the one you want us to sneak out?

586
01:38:47,708 --> 01:38:49,916
You'll have the boat pick up
the prisoners tomorrow, right?

587
01:38:50,875 --> 01:38:52,250
Yes, the boat will arrive tomorrow.

588
01:38:52,333 --> 01:38:53,791
Tomorrow?

589
01:38:55,375 --> 01:38:56,500
Any later and it won't be safe.

590
01:38:57,250 --> 01:38:59,375
We don't know what Japan will do next

591
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:00,916
after they declare victory.

592
01:39:03,958 --> 01:39:06,250
Tomorrow is a good idea.

593
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:10,916
The boat will dock at Thap Lamu, at dawn.

594
01:39:12,208 --> 01:39:13,208
Thank you.

595
01:39:14,375 --> 01:39:15,875
Have a safe journey.

596
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:22,791
Let's return to the shrine first,

597
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:24,916
then we'll leave late at night.

598
01:39:31,875 --> 01:39:32,833
What's wrong?

599
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:36,458
Can I stay?

600
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:42,750
Kath, if you get caught,
it won't be just you.

601
01:39:44,875 --> 01:39:46,541
Will you come with me?

602
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:52,083
You helped me,
so what will you do if you get caught?

603
01:39:53,625 --> 01:39:55,458
I have many more missions to do.

604
01:39:56,375 --> 01:39:58,125
You're not the only one in trouble.

605
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,166
I'm not afraid to die.

606
01:40:01,875 --> 01:40:03,750
I could die at any time.

607
01:40:04,875 --> 01:40:07,458
But I want my death to mean something.

608
01:41:26,375 --> 01:41:30,125
It's a pity we didn't have
much time to talk.

609
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:34,750
Anyway, I wish you a safe journey, Kath.

610
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:40,083
And when the time is right,
come back and visit.

611
01:41:41,916 --> 01:41:42,833
Okay.

612
01:41:44,750 --> 01:41:48,083
Lin, you too. Be careful.

613
01:41:48,958 --> 01:41:51,041
It's very dangerous in the capital.

614
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:53,291
The Japs are swarming everywhere.

615
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:56,958
It's my duty. I'll do it no matter what.

616
01:41:57,750 --> 01:42:01,625
Thank you, Uncle,
for risking yourself by hiding me here

617
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:03,875
and always helping us.

618
01:42:07,416 --> 01:42:11,375
Anything I can do
for the nation, I will do.

619
01:42:13,375 --> 01:42:16,083
Thanks to you both for
your sacrifices for the country.

620
01:42:17,375 --> 01:42:18,708
Stay safe…

621
01:42:19,625 --> 01:42:22,166
and fulfill your duties.

622
01:42:23,125 --> 01:42:24,000
Alright?

623
01:42:48,625 --> 01:42:50,250
I just miss my Dad.

624
01:42:51,291 --> 01:42:53,125
You remind me so much of him.

625
01:42:57,958 --> 01:42:59,666
Take good care of yourself.

626
01:43:00,208 --> 01:43:02,833
When everything settles down,
I'll come back.

627
01:43:05,875 --> 01:43:08,791
Alright, take good care of yourself.

628
01:43:08,875 --> 01:43:09,750
You too.

629
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:13,416
Uncle, a Japanese military truck
is coming.

630
01:43:15,958 --> 01:43:18,958
Do the Japanese soldiers know we're here?

631
01:43:22,166 --> 01:43:23,458
Tell everyone to get ready.

632
01:43:23,541 --> 01:43:24,666
Yes, yes, Uncle. Okay.

633
01:43:25,708 --> 01:43:27,458
You two, go find a place to hide.

634
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:29,708
Go.

635
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,166
We're already closed today.

636
01:43:50,125 --> 01:43:51,750
Why don't you come back tomorrow?

637
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,875
Where did you hide the spy?

638
01:44:03,375 --> 01:44:06,666
What spy? There's no spy here.

639
01:44:07,375 --> 01:44:09,541
This is an opera house,
just opera performers.

640
01:45:10,416 --> 01:45:11,875
Dad!

641
01:45:13,375 --> 01:45:15,500
Kath!

642
01:45:15,583 --> 01:45:18,000
If they catch us,
all our efforts will have been in vain.

643
01:45:19,041 --> 01:45:20,291
Kath, get on the truck!

644
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:22,666
Kath!

645
01:46:13,583 --> 01:46:14,666
This is the rendezvous point.

646
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:25,875
Lin.

647
01:46:25,958 --> 01:46:27,250
Let's run away together.

648
01:46:28,125 --> 01:46:29,166
I can't.

649
01:46:30,791 --> 01:46:32,250
I have more missions to do.

650
01:46:36,833 --> 01:46:40,166
Have you ever wondered why
I knew you from the start?

651
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,500
It's because we knew each other before.

652
01:46:52,916 --> 01:46:53,958
We were close…

653
01:46:58,750 --> 01:47:00,166
And we loved each other.

654
01:47:05,875 --> 01:47:07,875
I travelled from another world.

655
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:14,916
Apart from this world,
there are many more.

656
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:19,666
And in every world I've been to,

657
01:47:28,583 --> 01:47:32,958
there isn't a single one
where we don't love each other.

658
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:39,833
But in every world…

659
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:46,000
we end up being apart.

660
01:47:49,375 --> 01:47:51,375
I came to this world,

661
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:55,083
because I don't want to lose you again.

662
01:48:00,875 --> 01:48:02,750
Can we just stop caring for anything else?

663
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,750
Not caring about the war.

664
01:48:07,041 --> 01:48:08,458
Not caring about the country.

665
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:12,958
Can we run away and be together?

666
01:48:15,208 --> 01:48:17,333
Can we be together forever?

667
01:48:20,083 --> 01:48:22,083
I don't want to live in pain anymore.

668
01:48:24,375 --> 01:48:25,750
Seriously, Kath,

669
01:48:28,583 --> 01:48:30,750
I don't understand anything you said.

670
01:48:37,208 --> 01:48:39,041
But if we can get through this,

671
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:42,958
let's talk about this later.

672
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:45,250
No.

673
01:48:46,583 --> 01:48:48,125
Right now, you need to get on the boat.

674
01:48:48,833 --> 01:48:49,750
No,

675
01:48:52,125 --> 01:48:53,250
I won't.

676
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:57,166
What took you so long?

677
01:48:58,375 --> 01:48:59,541
Lin!

678
01:49:00,750 --> 01:49:02,791
The Japanese attacked the shrine.

679
01:49:02,875 --> 01:49:03,916
They probably know about us now.

680
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,958
- The boat's waiting.
- Go.

681
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:07,750
Let's go, Kath.

682
01:49:11,833 --> 01:49:13,083
Come on!

683
01:49:13,583 --> 01:49:14,666
- Go, go, go, Kath.
- Hurry.

684
01:49:27,958 --> 01:49:29,166
We're surrounded.

685
01:49:41,916 --> 01:49:42,958
Go!

686
01:49:59,333 --> 01:50:00,500
Go!

687
01:50:07,375 --> 01:50:09,458
Prim, take her to the boat.
I'll distract them.

688
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:12,208
No, I won't leave you, Lin.

689
01:50:12,291 --> 01:50:14,166
Can you not worry me further?

690
01:50:15,333 --> 01:50:16,250
I won't leave you, Lin.

691
01:50:17,500 --> 01:50:18,625
Go, Kath.

692
01:50:18,708 --> 01:50:19,708
Go.

693
01:50:20,666 --> 01:50:21,833
- Go.
- Lin.

694
01:50:21,916 --> 01:50:23,125
Go.

695
01:50:25,250 --> 01:50:26,291
Lin.

696
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:42,958
Go!

697
01:51:00,875 --> 01:51:02,791
Kath, come on!

698
01:51:08,791 --> 01:51:09,916
Kath!

699
01:52:26,291 --> 01:52:27,250
Go, get outta here!

700
01:52:34,083 --> 01:52:35,000
Come on.

701
01:52:55,666 --> 01:52:56,500
Go!

702
01:53:09,333 --> 01:53:11,166
Kath, are you alright?

703
01:53:13,458 --> 01:53:14,541
Lin, come on.

704
01:53:17,041 --> 01:53:18,500
Come on.

705
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,458
Faster, faster, faster.

706
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:38,625
Kath.

707
01:53:46,958 --> 01:53:48,500
Let's go!

708
01:54:37,458 --> 01:54:38,291
Kath.

709
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:01,083
Stop the boat!

710
01:55:07,583 --> 01:55:09,208
<i>I'm so glad</i>

711
01:55:10,125 --> 01:55:11,958
<i>to be here in this world</i>

712
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:18,333
where I got to meet you, Lin.

713
01:55:31,625 --> 01:55:33,583
I had the chance to see you smile

714
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:40,916
<i>and be by your side like before.</i>

715
01:56:53,125 --> 01:56:55,875
<i>The oxygen is running out, Kath.</i>

716
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:02,375
<i>Every breath after this</i>
<i>is very precious to us both, Kath.</i>

717
01:57:08,708 --> 01:57:10,250
<i>Please don't go.</i>

718
01:57:11,958 --> 01:57:15,000
<i>Stay with me until our very last breath.</i>

719
01:57:19,916 --> 01:57:22,250
<i>I used to think of you as Uranus.</i>

720
01:57:23,875 --> 01:57:24,875
Why is that?

721
01:57:28,625 --> 01:57:30,958
Because the Earth and Uranus…

722
01:57:31,458 --> 01:57:36,791
are 2,723,950,000 kilometers apart.

723
01:57:37,958 --> 01:57:41,250
But we humans discovered Uranus

724
01:57:41,833 --> 01:57:44,083
even before discovering the south pole.

725
01:57:52,375 --> 01:57:54,750
No matter how far away you are,

726
01:57:57,333 --> 01:57:59,375
I will follow until I find you, Kath.

727
01:58:18,625 --> 01:58:19,750
<i>Tomorrow…</i>

728
01:58:22,291 --> 01:58:24,416
I need to go to New York with my mom.

729
01:58:29,625 --> 01:58:31,708
We won't see each other again, right?

730
01:59:24,583 --> 01:59:26,166
<i>In parallel worlds…</i>

731
01:59:27,083 --> 01:59:29,125
<i>Is there one where</i>

732
01:59:29,958 --> 01:59:31,458
<i>we can live</i>…

Take care of yourself, Mom.

736
02:00:31,375 --> 02:00:32,708
<i>What would happen…</i>

737
02:00:33,875 --> 02:00:36,000
<i>If we had the chance to restart everything</i>

738
02:00:37,041 --> 02:00:38,500
<i>all over again?</i>

739
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:31,125
Go back.

740
02:01:32,750 --> 02:01:34,458
Go back and tell yourself

741
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:37,333
that you have to live.

742
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:40,416
Kath…

743
02:01:42,750 --> 02:01:44,083
it's time to go back.

I'm thrilled to be a part
of the Overture project again.

749
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:50,083
As the mission's Commander…

750
02:02:51,875 --> 02:02:55,458
who was involved in
the program since its beginning.

751
02:02:56,375 --> 02:03:00,666
The Overture 77 mission
is an important step

752
02:03:01,166 --> 02:03:03,666
to study the Charlotte Comet,

753
02:03:03,750 --> 02:03:06,500
which is making its way towards Uranus.

754
02:03:07,291 --> 02:03:11,791
<i>Its path, influenced by the gravity</i>
<i>of surrounding planets,</i>

755
02:03:11,875 --> 02:03:16,041
<i>has diverted it to</i>
<i>a journey towards Earth.</i>

756
02:03:16,125 --> 02:03:18,250
<i>And on this mission,</i>

757
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:21,458
<i>Thailand also joined</i>
<i>the expedition effort.</i>

758
02:03:22,625 --> 02:03:25,458
<i>Which is the largest</i>
<i>international collaboration</i>

759
02:03:26,375 --> 02:03:30,291
in the history of space exploration.

760
02:03:55,041 --> 02:03:56,000
Lin!

761
02:03:59,583 --> 02:04:00,666
Lin!

<i>The only thing that can break every rule</i>

763

Love will make two people,

764
02:04:57,458 --> 02:05:00,333
<i>no matter how many light years apart.</i>

765
02:05:00,833 --> 02:05:03,041
<i>Love will shorten the distance</i>

<i>keep them close, always.</i>

<i>Kath!</i>

768
02:06:15,125 --> 02:06:16,625
I love you, Kath.
