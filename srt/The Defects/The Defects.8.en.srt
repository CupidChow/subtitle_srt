Yes. Everything is being prepared
without a hitch.

I heard the first months
of pregnancy are really tough.

if I should go visit her myself.

Once she's in the stable period,
I'll invite you to our home soon, Madam.

Okay. I'll be waiting, Sister.

Actually,

22
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:47,813
there was a bit of a hassle.

00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:57,643

They say acne is hereditary too, right?

89
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:41,426
I wondered what the issue was.

90
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:43,795
I can't even.

91
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,866
As expected, it was defective.

92

The kid was always catching colds
and fevers.

93
00:08:52,104 --> 00:08:54,606
My wife had a really hard time
raising the kid.

94
00:08:54,906 --> 00:08:58,210

we want one with better fortune this time.

95
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:00,078
Will you match horoscopes for us too?

96
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:04,182
I...

97
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:07,119
don't really have anything to say.

98
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:11,256
Our child is very ill.

99
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:16,261
She was fine
when we first brought her home.

100
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:19,331
Then she was suddenly diagnosed
with a rare disease.

101
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:22,134
There's medicine that can cure her.

102
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:27,272
A few injections will do it,

103
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,374
but it costs one million dollars.

104
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:33,946
Do you know what my first thought was
when I heard that?

105
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,648
The price we paid for Eun Jo.

106
00:09:37,716 --> 00:09:40,052
That figure came to mind immediately.

107
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:42,287
Adding that...

108
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:47,659
to the million dollars for treatment,
I wondered how much it all came to.

109
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:50,862
Calculating it like that,

110
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,598
I truly...

111
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,834
felt disgusted with myself.

112
00:09:57,869 --> 00:09:59,438
When you raise a child,

113
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:01,640
there are precious,

114
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:05,043
overwhelming moments...

115
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:07,012
that money can never buy...

116
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:11,283
no matter what.

117
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:13,485
And...

118
00:10:15,153 --> 00:10:17,322
while raising Eun Jo, I've experienced...

119
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:21,493
so many of those moments.

120
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:25,230
But...

121
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:31,470
in front of that million-dollar price tag,
I thought those things.

122
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:34,506
But I don't think like that anymore.

123
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:37,009
I realized...

124
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:40,812
I'm Eun Jo's mom.

125
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:46,818
How did it go?

126
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:48,553
It'll be taken care of soon.

127
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:50,956
Let's go.

128
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,667
Here she comes.

129
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,335
You've arrived.

130
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:09,841
I see everyone's here.

131
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:11,777
We're done here, right?

132
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:15,180
Still, it's the last time,
so you should say your goodbyes properly.

133
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,949
Goodbyes? What goodbyes?

134
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,318
This whole thing feels wrong
and uncomfortable.

135
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:22,054
Are you trying to make us feel guilty now?

136
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:23,555
Do you feel guilty?

137
00:11:25,624 --> 00:11:29,294
You shouldn't feel that yet.
We haven't even started.

138
00:11:29,294 --> 00:11:30,662
You haven't even paid the price yet.

139
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:34,299
Let's share the guilt now.

140
00:11:38,737 --> 00:11:40,539
- Guns?
- What's that for?

141
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:41,640
Today,

142
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,876
all of you must kill your own children.

143
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:47,079
This isn't what we agreed on.

144
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,381
If this is how it is,
I want to cancel the refund.

145
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:51,984
You're telling us to murder?
This doesn't make any sense.

146
00:11:51,984 --> 00:11:53,251
I'm canceling the refund.

147
00:11:53,251 --> 00:11:54,453
Please cancel it.

148
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,726
They were products from the start.

149
00:12:00,726 --> 00:12:02,294
You paid for them, didn't you?

150
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:05,230
Why are you treating them
like people now and trying to back out?

151
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,733
Still, you're telling us to kill?

152
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,334
This is insane, isn't it?

153
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,675
Don't overthink it.

154
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:18,043
Don't be scared.

155
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:22,314
Come on.

156
00:12:23,248 --> 00:12:24,750
Even animals are categorized...

157
00:12:25,384 --> 00:12:28,520
as livestock or wild animals
based on usefulness.

158
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:30,555
It's the same with humans.

159
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,259
If you're going to raise them at home,
they should be useful.

160
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:37,462
Think of it simply.

161
00:12:37,462 --> 00:12:39,531
You're slaughtering them
because they've outlived their use.

162
00:12:40,332 --> 00:12:42,267
I plan to clean up...

163
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:45,003
this dirty business today.

164
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:46,872
That's why we needed customers like you.

165
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:48,707
Murder.

166
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:51,176
Solicitation of murder.

167
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,512
Complicity in murder.

168
00:12:54,713 --> 00:12:55,881
You know,

169
00:12:56,615 --> 00:12:57,916
those are serious crimes.

170
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:02,487
Now we're all on the same boat.

171
00:13:07,326 --> 00:13:08,894
This is insane.

172
00:13:08,894 --> 00:13:11,229
All rumors about purchased adoptions...

173
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,632
will disappear here.

174
00:13:13,865 --> 00:13:15,334
Of course, I'll participate too.

175
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:17,336
Today,

176
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:19,171
I'm going to kill...

177
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:21,373
my own child today too.

178
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:23,942
I can't do it.

179
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:25,444
I'm leaving.

180
00:13:25,444 --> 00:13:27,546
This isn't right.
This doesn't make any sense.

181
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:31,750
- Let go.
- Bring her here.

182
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:33,185
Let go!

183
00:13:33,185 --> 00:13:34,086
Mom.

184
00:13:34,086 --> 00:13:35,954
- Eun Jo.
- Eun Jo!

185
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:40,926
No.

186
00:13:41,827 --> 00:13:43,929
- Don't do it.
- Please.

187
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:50,502
We will begin the Healing Camp Program...

188
00:13:50,502 --> 00:13:53,005
with Dr. Kim Se Hee shortly.

189
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,608
Everyone, please gather at the center
of the campground.

190
00:13:58,076 --> 00:13:59,678
Move toward the campfire.

191
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:37,582
What can you give to your parents?

192
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,786
What kind of child can you be for them?

193
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:43,121
Shall we talk about it?

194
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:44,423
Now, who wants to go first?

195
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:45,590
I'll go first.

196
00:14:49,227 --> 00:14:52,164
My parents really love me,

197
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:54,232
and they truly care for me.

198
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,935
When do you feel
that your parents love you?

199
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:00,772
When I throw the ball well,

200
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:04,376
Mom and Dad were really happy.

201
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:07,145
And every time, I felt so encouraged.

202
00:15:07,813 --> 00:15:08,947
I see.

203
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:12,751
But even though
I can't play sports anymore,

204
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:14,987
whatever I do,

205
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:17,623
I'm sure they'll always support
and cheer me on.

206
00:15:18,156 --> 00:15:21,860
I used to be
a professional baseball player.

207
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:25,097
I trained desperately
and made it into the team,

208
00:15:26,465 --> 00:15:28,266
but I realized that going from the second
to the first league wasn't...

209
00:15:29,234 --> 00:15:31,336
something effort alone could achieve.

210
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:33,271
No matter how hard I tried,

211
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:38,110
I couldn't catch up
to players born with talent.

212
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:41,713
So I gave up my dream
of being a baseball player.

213
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:44,416
Do Hyun, what do you want to do now?

214
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,052
Honestly, I haven't thought
about it in detail.

215
00:15:48,654 --> 00:15:50,522
But I think I really enjoy taking photos.

216
00:15:51,957 --> 00:15:53,592
Even while I was playing sports,
whenever I had time,

217
00:15:53,592 --> 00:15:55,327
I'd take pictures of my friends,

218
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:58,196
and I really enjoyed it.

219
00:15:58,196 --> 00:15:59,498
Both my wife and I dream...

220
00:15:59,798 --> 00:16:01,833
of sending our son to the Major League.

221
00:16:02,668 --> 00:16:06,038
So we'd like to meet a child...

222
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:10,876
who has that potential.

223
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:32,364
What's this?

224
00:16:33,532 --> 00:16:34,967
I'm not pregnant.

225
00:16:36,635 --> 00:16:38,337
I never had the procedure either.

226
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:40,739
What are you talking about?

227
00:16:41,807 --> 00:16:42,774
However,

228
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:45,944
a baby might still be born.

229
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:48,246
What do you mean?

230
00:16:49,014 --> 00:16:50,248
From the beginning,

231
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,685
Mom never planned
to use my egg to make a baby.

232
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:55,954
She planned to use her own.

233
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:00,792
What?

234
00:17:01,893 --> 00:17:03,662
In the lab,

235
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,797
there are hundreds,

236
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:09,868
no, thousands of her eggs stored.

237
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:13,472
She collects sperms
from men with excellent genes,

238
00:17:14,373 --> 00:17:17,009
combines them with her own genes,
and creates exceptional children.

239
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:20,912
Using countless surrogates to create them,

240
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,714
dispose of them,

241
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,951
create more,

242
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:28,253
and dispose of them again.

243
00:17:29,054 --> 00:17:30,522
That's how...

244
00:17:31,923 --> 00:17:32,891
I was made.

245
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:35,794
And also, your child...

246
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:37,062
Wait. Stop.

247
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:45,270
So you're telling me, Sister,

248
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:47,906
I mean,

249
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:49,975
that woman was...

250
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:54,780
trying to make...

251
00:17:57,015 --> 00:17:59,151
her own child,

252
00:17:59,918 --> 00:18:00,919
not mine?

253
00:18:01,853 --> 00:18:02,788
She dared...

254
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:06,091
to deceive me and my husband?

255
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:12,164
She's a total lunatic.

256
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:18,236
Unbelievable. Damn it.

257
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:25,310
But why are you telling me this?

258
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:31,016
What's going on?

259
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:32,651
What's this?

260
00:18:39,391 --> 00:18:40,726
Damn it.

261
00:18:40,726 --> 00:18:41,560
Hey.

262
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:43,528
Did you take a hit?

263
00:18:52,537 --> 00:18:55,907
Everyone, thank you for waiting.

264
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,682
We will now begin the game.

265
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:13,692
The survival game begins now.

266
00:19:14,726 --> 00:19:15,627
Mom.

267
00:19:20,732 --> 00:19:21,667
Mom.

268
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:25,470
The rules are simple.

269
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:28,273
Don't die. Just survive.

270
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,442
If you get shot, you die.

271
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:31,109
Dad.

272
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:33,478
- As you run and hide from the bullets,
- Lift your gun.

273
00:19:33,478 --> 00:19:35,080
- you'll come to realize...
- Mom.

274
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,782
- Mom.
- that surviving isn't...

275
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:38,450
easy at all.

276
00:19:39,384 --> 00:19:42,220
Right, and one more rule.

277
00:19:43,088 --> 00:19:46,992
No matter what,
you must never call "Mom" or "Dad."

278
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:54,232
If you have a gun but don't shoot,
you die.

279
00:19:58,103 --> 00:19:59,237
Stay still.

280
00:19:59,237 --> 00:20:00,472
Just stay still.

281
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,707
Dad.

282
00:20:02,374 --> 00:20:05,510
Now, let's start the game.

283
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,378
Ready.

284
00:20:07,145 --> 00:20:09,114
Set. Go.

285
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:10,182
Don't.

286
00:20:10,182 --> 00:20:11,116
Five.

287
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,884
I'll study hard.

288
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:14,119
Mom.
Four.

289
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,591
Three.

290
00:20:21,026 --> 00:20:21,893
Mom.

291
00:20:22,094 --> 00:20:23,161
- Two.
- I'm sorry.

292
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:25,297
One.

293
00:20:40,045 --> 00:20:41,813
Do Hyun!

294
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:47,552
What are you doing?

295
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:48,520
Are you insane?

296
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:54,626
I'll be...

297
00:20:56,395 --> 00:20:58,764
the selfish mom who saves Eun Jo.

298
00:21:05,137 --> 00:21:06,004
Eun Jo is...

299
00:21:07,005 --> 00:21:08,540
here.

300
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:12,744
If I shoot you,

301
00:21:14,713 --> 00:21:16,481
they'll let Eun Jo live.

302
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,444
Eun Jo!

303
00:21:46,378 --> 00:21:48,447
- Eun Jo.
- Eun Jo.

304
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:50,582
- Eun Jo!
- No.

305
00:21:52,017 --> 00:21:52,884
No.

306
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,587
You said you'd save her!

307
00:21:55,587 --> 00:21:56,855
But she's alive!

308
00:22:07,032 --> 00:22:07,933
Move.

309
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:10,068
Move!

310
00:22:11,103 --> 00:22:12,170
Kill me.

311
00:22:13,205 --> 00:22:16,174
Eun Jo is my daughter.

312
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:23,448
Mom!

313
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,118
Honey!

314
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:29,855
Eun Jo.

315
00:22:31,957 --> 00:22:33,091
I'm...

316
00:22:34,226 --> 00:22:35,160
sorry.

317
00:22:36,261 --> 00:22:38,363
Mom.

318
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:39,631
I'm sorry...

319
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:43,535
for not being a good mom.

320
00:22:44,136 --> 00:22:45,237
Mom.

321
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:50,409
No.

322
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:52,611
Honey, wake up.

323
00:22:52,611 --> 00:22:53,745
Wake up!

324
00:22:58,283 --> 00:22:59,217
Honey.

325
00:23:02,387 --> 00:23:03,622
Get Kim Ah Hyun!

326
00:24:09,421 --> 00:24:10,289
So Mi!

327
00:24:50,095 --> 00:24:52,064
Ah Hyun.

328
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:04,276
So Mi!

329
00:25:08,347 --> 00:25:09,214
Stop it.

330
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:11,350
Ah Hyun.

331
00:25:21,093 --> 00:25:22,260
Stop it!

332
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:11,610
What's a mother?

333
00:26:14,012 --> 00:26:14,913
Mom.

334
00:26:17,015 --> 00:26:19,685
If you have nothing to say, hang up.
Useless girl.

335
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:27,559
What is a mother?

336
00:26:28,293 --> 00:26:29,161
But Se Hee,

337
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:32,097
I don't need you anymore.

338
00:26:38,603 --> 00:26:40,939
There are mothers like me in this world...

339
00:26:42,374 --> 00:26:44,109
and daughters like you...

340
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:47,145
who get killed by mothers like me.

341
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:10,836
This is the police.

342
00:27:10,836 --> 00:27:12,738
Kim Se Hee and her organization,

343
00:27:12,738 --> 00:27:16,775
you are under arrest
for child abduction and confinement,

344
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:18,844
murder and solicitation of murder,

345
00:27:18,844 --> 00:27:21,813
corpse abandonment and mutilation,
child trafficking and kidnapping.

346
00:27:22,748 --> 00:27:24,216
Drop your weapons and surrender.

347
00:27:25,083 --> 00:27:26,184
This is a warning.

348
00:27:26,718 --> 00:27:28,687
Drop your weapons and surrender.

349
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:34,259
Put down your guns.

350
00:27:35,394 --> 00:27:37,229
Drop your weapons and surrender.

351
00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:39,164
This is a warning.

352
00:27:39,164 --> 00:27:40,832
If you do not drop your weapons
and surrender,

353
00:27:40,832 --> 00:27:43,235
- Director, you need to get out of here.
- we will open fire.

354
00:27:44,903 --> 00:27:46,104
(Police Commissioner)

355
00:27:46,104 --> 00:27:48,807
(Police Commissioner Jeon Jae Du)

356
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:54,379
Damn it.

357
00:27:55,247 --> 00:27:57,049
(Chairwoman)

358
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:04,690
- Hello?
- Commissioner.

359
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:07,426
You need to clean this up.

360
00:28:07,426 --> 00:28:09,294
You said you weren't sending
the police today.

361
00:28:09,294 --> 00:28:10,696
What is this?

362
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,398
This is not where they're supposed
to be right now.

363
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:14,599
I can't even.

364
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,600
Hey.

365
00:28:16,234 --> 00:28:18,870
The police are just doing their job,
catching criminals.

366
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,105
What's wrong with that?

367
00:28:27,446 --> 00:28:28,480
You need to leave.

368
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:33,719
That feels good.

369
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:39,324
(Kim Se Hee)

370
00:28:40,792 --> 00:28:41,627
Madam.

371
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:47,633
(Kim Se Hee)

372
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:52,304
I'll stay silent
for the rest of my life...

373
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:54,640
if you help me.

374
00:28:57,342 --> 00:28:59,077
You have to help me.

375
00:29:05,384 --> 00:29:07,552
Nice to meet you, Ah Hyun.

376
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:10,989
My Mary.

377
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,560
Drop your weapons and surrender.

378
00:29:15,927 --> 00:29:17,296
This is a warning.

379
00:29:17,863 --> 00:29:20,999
If you do not drop your weapons
and surrender, we will open fire.

381
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:28,373
Yes.

382
00:29:28,874 --> 00:29:31,276
I trust you'll handle this cleanly...

383
00:29:31,877 --> 00:29:33,045
without traces.

384
00:29:33,045 --> 00:29:34,846
Yes, of course.

385
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:36,381
Don't worry.

386
00:29:36,815 --> 00:29:37,950
Without traces.

387
00:29:44,256 --> 00:29:45,657
This is a warning.

388
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:49,561
If you do not drop your weapons
and surrender, we will open fire.

389
00:29:56,168 --> 00:29:57,069
Uncle.

390
00:29:57,736 --> 00:29:58,804
It's over.

391
00:29:59,538 --> 00:30:00,739
That's enough now.

392
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,413
This is a warning.

393
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,416
Move once more and we will open fire.

(SWAT Team)

395
00:30:22,728 --> 00:30:23,629
Director.

396
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:27,032
You can...

397
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,234
abandon me now.

398
00:30:47,653 --> 00:30:48,553
Go!

399
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,172
Uncle!

400
00:31:09,308 --> 00:31:11,810
Uncle.

401
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:14,379
Uncle, no!

402
00:31:15,781 --> 00:31:16,782
Uncle.

403
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:28,627
Uncle, no.

404
00:31:29,928 --> 00:31:31,296
Uncle.

405
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,066
No. Please no.

406
00:31:36,668 --> 00:31:37,703

408
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:00,058
Hello?

409
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,426
Madam.

410
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,761
Sister.

411
00:32:03,795 --> 00:32:04,696
Right now,

412
00:32:05,397 --> 00:32:07,799
something seems
to have gone terribly wrong.

413
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:11,103
I think the Police Commissioner
misunderstood something.

414
00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:12,471
Like what?

415
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:14,439
I mean,

416
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:17,175
I'm supposedly being arrested
by the police or something.

417
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,177
Just...

418
00:32:19,878 --> 00:32:21,413
shut your mouth and die.

419
00:32:22,414 --> 00:32:24,216
Then you won't get arrested.

421
00:33:09,728 --> 00:33:11,296
Yes, this is Kiss Café.

422
00:33:12,264 --> 00:33:13,265
Mom.

423
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:15,701
Who is this?

424
00:33:16,268 --> 00:33:17,269
Mom.

425
00:33:18,303 --> 00:33:20,639
It's Se Hee.

426
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,843
But there are a dozen Se Hees.

427
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:28,747
Hey, which Se Hee are you?

428
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:31,283
Ahn Se Hee? Kim Se Hee? Choi Se Hee?

429
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:35,487
Kim Se Hee.

430
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:38,590
Why did you call?

431
00:33:39,358 --> 00:33:40,359
Do you need money?

432
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:43,028
No, I...

433
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:47,633
If you've got nothing to say, hang up.
Useless girl.

434
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,479
Did you call to tell on us
to the woman at the café?

435
00:34:01,246 --> 00:34:03,315
Guys, do you know
why her name is Kim Se Hee?

436
00:34:03,582 --> 00:34:05,183
The director told me.

437
00:34:12,624 --> 00:34:13,592
Mom.

438
00:34:15,027 --> 00:34:15,861
Hey.

439
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:28,473
Mom.

440
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:30,075
Here.

441
00:34:30,642 --> 00:34:32,945
Se Hee,
do you know why your name is Se Hee?

442
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:34,413
No.

443
00:34:35,147 --> 00:34:37,316
Remember the story I told you long ago...

444
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:39,851
about that Miss Park I used to work with?

445
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:44,089
The one who married a rich guy
and turned her life around.

446
00:34:44,089 --> 00:34:45,090
Right.

447
00:34:45,457 --> 00:34:46,858
Her name was Se Hee.

448
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:51,463
I wanted to be like her.

449
00:34:51,463 --> 00:34:53,598
That's why I named you Se Hee.

450
00:34:53,598 --> 00:34:56,068
I thought if I kept calling that name,
I might become like her too.

451
00:34:56,068 --> 00:34:57,002
I see.

452
00:34:57,636 --> 00:34:58,704
But Se Hee,

453
00:34:59,404 --> 00:35:01,440
I don't need you anymore.

454
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,245
I think I'm finally going
to get lucky myself.

455
00:35:10,315 --> 00:35:12,484
Someone will come
and fix things for you somehow.

456
00:35:12,851 --> 00:35:14,386
So behave.

457
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,621
Bye now.

458
00:35:18,523 --> 00:35:19,524
Mom.

459
00:35:22,794 --> 00:35:23,862
Mom.

460
00:35:43,048 --> 00:35:45,117
I went through so much to make this.

461
00:35:45,784 --> 00:35:46,685
I...

462
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,022
I put everything into this.

463
00:36:11,476 --> 00:36:14,279
What do they think they're doing?

464
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,115
Do they think
I'm going to collapse like this?

465
00:36:25,691 --> 00:36:27,092
Do you think that'll be perfect?

466
00:36:31,763 --> 00:36:32,664
Honey.

467
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:35,133
My girl.

468
00:36:36,268 --> 00:36:37,202
You're here.

469
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,672
You just want to believe it's perfect.

470
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,278
You're...

471
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,350
just making another child
who looks like you.

472
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:22,080
That "perfect being" you talk about is...

473
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,184
someone who isn't even you.

474
00:37:28,654 --> 00:37:30,389
Born to proper parents,

475
00:37:30,956 --> 00:37:32,291
raised differently from you,

476
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:34,993
given nothing but love,

477
00:37:35,861 --> 00:37:37,129
and growing up...

478
00:37:38,263 --> 00:37:39,965
to shine brilliantly, unlike you.

479
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:42,301
Shut up!

480
00:37:43,101 --> 00:37:44,836
You reek.

481
00:37:47,005 --> 00:37:48,573
The stench is overwhelming.

482
00:37:50,742 --> 00:37:51,944
You thought I didn't know?

483
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:57,115
That rotting stench comes...

484
00:37:57,883 --> 00:37:59,885
from your festering inferiority complex.

485
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:01,253
No.

486
00:38:01,253 --> 00:38:03,822
No.

487
00:38:05,424 --> 00:38:07,392
You said all a child needs is love...

488
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,030
and that just looking at them
with loving eyes is enough.

489
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:14,399
Then why didn't you do that for me?

490
00:38:17,269 --> 00:38:18,370
I thought maybe,

491
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:21,406
you'd regret having abandoned me.

492
00:38:22,908 --> 00:38:24,576
I hoped you'd wonder...

493
00:38:26,411 --> 00:38:28,246
if I might still be alive.

494
00:38:30,415 --> 00:38:32,217
If I'd known you were this pathetic,

495
00:38:33,552 --> 00:38:35,220
I wouldn't have missed you so much.

496
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:38,690
I should've just hated you...

497
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,693
and loathed you.

498
00:38:44,162 --> 00:38:46,231
I regret ever expecting anything.

499
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:58,243
You lost...

500
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,314
completely.

501
00:39:08,954 --> 00:39:11,089
This morning, the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office...

502
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:14,259
raided SH Medical Foundation.

"Kim Se Hee Gate" breaks open...

over the late Kim Se Hee's illegal
adoption trafficking,

505
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:22,901
the political and business sectors are
on high alert,

506
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:26,204
and attention is focused on whether
further allegations will be revealed.

507
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,108
Untie us.

508
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:31,643
Hurry and untie us.

509
00:39:35,847 --> 00:39:37,382
That bastard caught us.

510
00:39:37,382 --> 00:39:38,750
He's a total psychopath.

511
00:39:42,721 --> 00:39:43,755
Don't move!

512
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:48,060
Stop.

519
00:40:19,524 --> 00:40:21,393
It must've been tough. How was it?

520
00:40:21,393 --> 00:40:22,828
- It was hard.
- What was?

521
00:40:22,828 --> 00:40:24,363
Math was really tough.

522
00:40:24,363 --> 00:40:26,398
Still, you have to do it.

Either eat or sing. Pick one.

527

Why am I still so nervous
when I've auditioned so many times?

528

I'm nervous too.

529
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:48,053
Si Woo, do you think
I'll do well this time?

530
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:50,155
Of course, because you're my sister.

531
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:52,391
Of course, because you're my daughter.

532
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:58,063
Si Woo, after we drop her off,
do you want to go to the amusement park?

533
00:40:58,063 --> 00:40:58,997
Really?

534
00:40:58,997 --> 00:41:01,066
What? I'm going too.

535
00:41:01,066 --> 00:41:02,868
We were going just the two of us today.

536
00:41:02,868 --> 00:41:06,505
Come on, Mom.
That's not fair. I'm going too.

537
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,107
Should we wait a little, then go together?

538
00:41:10,442 --> 00:41:11,276
Yes.

539
00:41:12,077 --> 00:41:14,379
All right, we'll all go together then.

540
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,481
- Okay.
- Okay.

541
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:27,059

542
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:28,493
Is this place just made for you?

How does your face keep getting better
every time I see you?

544

If there is, tell me. I'll handle it.

What about you? Are you studying hard?

549
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:49,414
Come on, of course I'm...

550
00:41:49,781 --> 00:41:50,782
not.

551
00:41:52,084 --> 00:41:53,752
I'm just living life as a fanboy,
that's all.

console games are really fun.

555
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,198
I even bought a ton of game cartridges
to play with you.

556
00:42:06,932 --> 00:42:11,036
Wait. Around the time you get out...

557

Two? Three?

558
00:42:13,171 --> 00:42:15,841
Maybe even season four will be released.

00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:24,049
Are the kids...

560
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:25,751
doing okay?

561
00:42:26,385 --> 00:42:27,753
Of course.

562
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,856
Tomorrow we're all going to see Seok Su.

563
00:42:35,927 --> 00:42:37,229
I wish I could come with you.

564
00:42:37,996 --> 00:42:40,632
Join us next time.

565
00:42:40,966 --> 00:42:41,800
Promise.

566
00:42:42,868 --> 00:42:45,037
Pinky promise.

567
00:42:45,037 --> 00:42:46,271
I'll do it. Promise.

568
00:42:48,507 --> 00:42:49,441
Promise.

569
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:05,290
Seok Su, it's really nice here.

570
00:43:07,426 --> 00:43:08,760
Just like we promised,

571
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:11,830
we came.

572
00:43:19,338 --> 00:43:20,639
I really miss you, Seok Su.

573
00:43:59,611 --> 00:44:00,912
Guys, here.

574
00:44:02,114 --> 00:44:03,582
It's here.

575
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:06,184
This is no joke. It's eight servings.

576
00:44:07,486 --> 00:44:09,688
There's so much meat,

577
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:12,057
and it's supposed to be a housewarming,
but it feels kind of empty.

578
00:44:12,057 --> 00:44:14,993
There's only meat.
It doesn't really feel right.

579
00:44:14,993 --> 00:44:15,961
I like it.

580
00:44:15,961 --> 00:44:18,430
Still, it does feel a bit empty.

581
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:21,566
Do you want me to make some ramyeon?

582
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:25,837
I seriously almost threw up just now.

583
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:27,472
Even hearing
the word "ramyeon" makes me gag.

584
00:44:27,472 --> 00:44:29,207
Seriously.

585
00:44:29,207 --> 00:44:31,410
But wait, I think I smell fried chicken.

586
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,111
Si Woo, you're amazing.

587
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:34,513
How did you know?

588
00:44:34,513 --> 00:44:35,547
Ta-da.

589
00:44:36,348 --> 00:44:38,383
- Really?
- Ah Hyun.

590
00:44:38,383 --> 00:44:41,253
Thank you. Is this really for me?

591
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,855
- Don't be like that.
- Let's eat together.

592
00:44:45,457 --> 00:44:46,591
Who's taking the drumstick?

593
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:48,593
- Me.
- All right. Si Woo.

594
00:44:48,593 --> 00:44:50,929
And you, Ah Hyun.

595
00:44:51,763 --> 00:44:53,799
Yes, let me try a drumstick too.

596
00:44:53,799 --> 00:44:55,033
And for our youngest.

597
00:44:56,234 --> 00:44:59,438
So Mi gets this one.
This is a drumstick too.

598
00:45:00,772 --> 00:45:02,140
This part is super dry.

599
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:04,776
Just kidding. I'll give you a wing.

600
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:08,013
The night view is really pretty here.

601
00:45:08,013 --> 00:45:09,147
Should we take a selfie together?

602
00:45:10,115 --> 00:45:11,016
Should we?

603
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:12,618
Okay, I'll take a picture.

604
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:15,187
One, two, three.

605
00:45:43,749 --> 00:45:47,352
(The Defects,
Epilogue)

606
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,588
You lost.

607
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,190
Completely.

608
00:46:03,268 --> 00:46:04,236
I love you.

609
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,338
Mom.

610
00:46:55,887 --> 00:46:57,255
Crazy bitch.

611
00:47:15,073 --> 00:47:19,077
(Thank you for supporting
and watching The Defects.)
