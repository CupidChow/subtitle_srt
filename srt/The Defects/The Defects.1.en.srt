Year 2011

7
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,751
- Boss.
- Yeah?

8
00:01:15,792 --> 00:01:16,999
We're here.

9
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:20,709
You can handle it alone, right?

10
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes, of course.

11
00:01:22,042 --> 00:01:23,918
- Hey, Tae-sik.
- Yes?

12
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,999
What do you think is inside there?

13
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:33,584
I'm not interested.

14
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:38,751
If I were you,
I'd be dying to know.

15
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,709
Should I tell you?

16
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:44,959
That thing I always bring...

17
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:47,334
Which you pour cement over
and dispose of...

18
00:01:47,876 --> 00:01:49,209
No, I'm good.

19
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,334
Why? Are you scared?

20
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:53,999
Terrified?

21
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:57,375
It doesn't matter.
It's just good money.

22
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:01,999
You said you need cash
for your mom's surgery, right?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,125
Yes.

24
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:05,542
You're a good son.

25
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,375
You'll probably go to heaven.

26
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,584
Please save me.

27
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:57,584
Please... save me.

28
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:00,083
Save me...

29
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,999
Please...

30
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:05,709
Please save me.

31
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,209
I don't want to die.

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,334
Mister, please save me.

33
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:18,459

Breakfast!

40
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:03,999
Wha..?

41
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:10,000
- Come eat.
- Yeah.

42
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,999
Instant noodles again?

43
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,792
Wow, it smells amazing!

44
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:24,584
Who made it?
Just eat already.

45
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:28,999
Unit Three, reporting an incident
at Bukhyeon-dong.

46
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:33,834
Another morning with
a crazy number of traffic accidents...

47
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:39,876
What do you know?
They reset the code word again.

48
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:41,709
Where's So-mi?
Is she not eating?

So-mi!

52
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,209
Hey, sis...

53
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,500
I wonder how she's doing,
you know?

54
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:05,500
After abandoning me
without a hint of guilt...

55
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,042
Baby, stop!
Take this with you.

56
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:11,083
You didn't eat breakfast,
at least have some soy milk!

57
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,125
- You woke me up late.
- I'm sorry...

58
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,999
I hope she lives a miserable life.

59
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:32,876
Ugh, I'm sick of ramen.

60
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:34,542
I want chicken.

61
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:38,626
Then shall we get some chicken?

62
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,999
Really? No cap?
Yes!

63
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:43,751
Guys, let's go!

64
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,792
What kind of chicken should we get?

65
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's go.

66
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:14,709
Come on, you said
we're having chicken.

67
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:15,999
Do you have money?

68
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:20,083
Why does she
always pick on me?

69
00:07:28,751 --> 00:07:29,709
What?

70
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:36,292
Speak up already!

71
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:38,000
There are way too many in there.

72
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,167
Let's just go somewhere else.

73
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,959
There are plenty of gambling houses.

74
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:43,959
Scared?

75
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,000
He's terrified.

76
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:49,667
Are you talking about me?

77
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:51,999
I never get scared, okay?

78
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,542
Let's just ask the old man
to buy us chicken!

79
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:56,542
Hey!

80
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:59,876
The old man's broke.
You just keep eating ramen.

81
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:01,751
Why are you such an ass?

82
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,542
Then we're doing it, okay?

83
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:07,000
How about we spice it up?
Make a little bet?

84
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:08,999
Alright, let's split teams.

85
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:10,751
Finders keepers, okay?

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,042
Losers do cleaning,
laundry, and dishes.

87
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,667
Fine, whatever.

88
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:16,542
Heads or tails!

89
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:19,834
Good luck.

90
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:27,999
Hey, hey, hey!

91
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,667
Who are you kids?

92
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,250
How'd you get in?

93
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:33,792
We came to play.

94
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:34,834
Password.

95
00:08:34,876 --> 00:08:35,834
Password?

96
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:38,500
If you're here to play,
say the password.

97
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:41,999
I kind of forgot.

98
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,999
Can you give us the first letter?

99
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,667
We have money and everything.

100
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,792
'M'.
The first letter is 'M'.

101
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:02,459
Hey, what the hell!

102
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:03,999
Sorry.

103
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:43,417
This place is huge,
I told you!

104
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,042
I can't see anything.

105
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,292
Who's he?

106
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:50,792
Come on, I need a king...

107
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,792
Look, isn't that the safe?

108
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,999
So, what are we gonna do?

109
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:19,667
Joo-an, your big sister
has a plan for everything.

110
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,042
Hey, I'm older than you!

111
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:23,459
You don't act like one.

112
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,626
What did you just say?

113
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,999
As long as it works out,
it's all good!

114
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:28,999
- Let's go!
- Wait!

115
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:30,626
Wait up!

116
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:41,459
Come on.

117
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,417
Hey!

118
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,500
What are you? Cops?

119
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,209
Kill 'em!

120
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,459
Joo-an!

121
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:17,999
Catch them!

122
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:21,125
Get the other side!

123
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:23,999
Push!

124
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,167
- Run for it!
- Run!

125
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,417
The safe!

126
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:53,584
Hey, sis!

127
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,918
Over here!

128
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:02,292
We win.

129
00:13:02,334 --> 00:13:04,375
Let's open our own
fried chicken shop...

130
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,042
Those idiots...

131
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,999
Hurry up, I'm hungry!

132
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:09,500
Me too, come on.

133
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:12,999
Don't forget the cleaning!
No backsies!

134
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:18,375
Seriously, they wouldn't notice
if 5 million won went missing!

135
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:21,000
You wanted chicken, right?
It's all we need.

136
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:25,334
We could've opened
a whole fried chicken place.

137
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,709
Instead, we can barely buy two...

138
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:30,999
Are we seriously
leaving the money like that?

139
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,167
Someone will come for it.

140
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,125
Who?

141
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:43,125
Let's go eat chicken.

142
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,999
I was serious about
opening a chicken place...

143
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,959
Chicken
Take-out Available

144
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:53,042
Hey, there it is!
There comes our chicken!

145
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:57,999
Wow, unbelievable.

146
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,334
- Should we eat inside?
- Are you crazy?

147
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,125
What if the old man catches us?

148
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:05,000
We can just sit and eat
in the corner.

149
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:06,999
No way! I'm starving,
let's just go home.

150
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:09,999
Missed Call - Mister

151
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,042
- Crap, we're screwed.
- Why?

152
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:18,250
It's the old man.

153
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:20,918
We should go.

154
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,999
Let's hurry. Come on!

155
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:34,999
Focus.
You're far from done.

156
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,834
Don't drop your gun!

157
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:41,000
Focus.

158
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,667
Seok-su.

159
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:47,250
You're useless, you hear?

160
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:48,584
Dog shit.

161
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:50,083
Eat this!

162
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:01,292
So-mi.

163
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:07,459
Joo-an.

164
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:11,999
You crazy bastard!

165
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:14,876
Ah-Hyeon.

166
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,542
Whatever you guys do,

167
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:30,999
I don't care at all.

168
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,999
Breaking the law or going reckless,

169
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't care.

170
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,792
There's only one thing
I care about.

171
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,709
Unauthorized outing.

172
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,959
If you want to die,
then leave.

173
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,918
If you wish for any of us to die,

174
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:51,709
go ahead.

175
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:09,459
Mister...

176
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,542
How long do we have to
live like this?

177
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:16,375
Wouldn't it be better to just die?

178
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:19,751
- So-mi!
- What? It's true.

179
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:22,125
Am I wrong?

180
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,834
We're stuck here forever.
Can't even go outside!

181
00:16:26,876 --> 00:16:29,792
No one looks for us.
We don't even have names!

182
00:16:29,834 --> 00:16:30,999
Stop it.

183
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,417
Is this what you call living?

184
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:36,999
Why... why do we have to
live like this?

185
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:39,375
Isn't it better to just die instead?

186
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,334
We didn't want to die!

187
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,209
I don't want to die.

188
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,584
Please save me, mister.

189
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:47,250
I don't want to die...

190
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:50,292
Please, save me...

191
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:53,250
Please... Save me, please!

192
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,250
I don't want to die.
Please save me.

193
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:02,042
Because we all chose to live.

194
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,999
We can't go on like this anymore.

195
00:18:38,542 --> 00:18:40,542
They won't last much longer.

196
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:43,626
Ah-hyeon.

197
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,500
I got us a boat.

198
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,999
It's a small fishing boat,
so the journey will be rough.

199
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:54,999
I want you to take care of them.

200
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:57,626
What about you?

201
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:01,918
Mister...

202
00:19:01,959 --> 00:19:03,250
I have something to do.

203
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:05,959
When it's all done,

204
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:08,876
I'll come right after you.

205
00:19:09,999 --> 00:19:12,375
Don't worry,
I'll be right behind.

206
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:14,751
Can't we just go together?

207
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:19,209
We can forget everything
and start fresh.

208
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:21,876
What happens to those kids
isn't your fault.

209
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:25,709
It's not something
you can handle alone.

210
00:19:26,209 --> 00:19:27,876
You'll get contacted soon.

211
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,459
I can trust you, right?

212
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:34,999
I'm sorry.

213
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:37,792
I feel like
I'm asking too much of you.

214
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:42,292
I'll talk to the kids separately.

215
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,999
Yeah, let's go.

216
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:57,709
I'll bring plenty of cash today.

217
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:59,959
Let's win a fortune.

218
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,083
Alright, man.
See you later.

219
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:08,876
Hey, why do you keep sweeping?
No one's coming.

220
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:11,500
Just keeping myself busy.

221
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:15,542
I understand.
Things have been slow lately.

222
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,542
Too slow, in fact.

223
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,876
We're running out of money.

224
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,667
No refund customers these days...

225
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:28,209
Boss, what if
we expand our operation?

226
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:31,999
Won't there be
much more work that way?

227
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:33,792
Like what?

228
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:35,292
Something like sales...

229
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:38,584
It may be more profitable.

230
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:43,250
Actually, I tried begging
Director Jeong for work.

231
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:44,834
Didn't work.

232
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,584
Only got cursed at.

233
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:51,626
Can't we bypass Director Jeong
and contact the higher-ups?

234
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,250
You think that's possible?

235
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:55,999
Why not?

236
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:08,459
Do you know who's at the very top?

237
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:13,417
Who?
Have you actually seen him?

238
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:15,999
The Lord.

239
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,167
The Lord is up above.

240
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:23,709
He's not in this world,
but he's there.

241
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:26,042
Can't be seen,
but he exists.

242
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:33,999
♪ Sorry sorry
♪ Sorry sorry

243
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:38,751
Thank you so much every time, Doctor.

244
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,792
Don't be.
I do it because I enjoy it.

245
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,834
You know how much I love kids.

246
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:46,667
The director is here!

247
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:48,959
Come quickly!

248
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:54,999
- Shall we start with a prayer?
- Yes.

249
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:59,751
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

250
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:04,999
Lord, bless this food you have
graciously given us and bless us.

251
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:08,999
Through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen!

252
00:22:08,999 --> 00:22:12,375
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

253
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:13,709
Amen.

254
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,667
Enjoy the food!

255
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:18,999
Looks delicious, right?

256
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:23,876
Doctor, you're like my mom.

257
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:25,417
Really?

258
00:22:26,876 --> 00:22:28,751
Then call me 'Mom', okay?

259
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:30,999
Mom!

260
00:22:36,584 --> 00:22:38,042
Help me!

261
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:40,999
I'm in here!

262
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:43,667
Help me!

263
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:47,751
I'm in here!

264
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:52,417
Who are you?

265
00:22:53,792 --> 00:22:54,999
Untie me!

266
00:22:56,999 --> 00:23:00,125
The Reality of Upper-Class Newborn Trade

267
00:23:01,626 --> 00:23:02,918
Please...

268
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:07,250
I'll make it all go away, really!

269
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,959
How can you make it
go away, Mr. Reporter?

270
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:13,999
You found out...

271
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,626
...about everything.

272
00:23:16,999 --> 00:23:18,500
No, no!

273
00:23:19,417 --> 00:23:22,792
I don't know anything.
Nothing at all!

274
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:24,584
Please...

275
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,999
I have a 7-year-old son,

276
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,709
and a pregnant wife.

277
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,999
Please, I beg you.

278
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:33,918
Good for them.

279
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:36,876
Whole Life Insurance

280
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,751
They'll receive about 3 billion won
in insurance.

281
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,999
Your wife will be happy.

282
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:43,500
Uh...

283
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:48,250
An impossible amount
with a reporter's salary.

284
00:23:48,292 --> 00:23:49,375
No, no, no.

285
00:23:49,417 --> 00:23:51,584
She doesn't need this.

286
00:23:51,626 --> 00:23:53,999
Please... save me!

287
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,999
She doesn't need this!
Please!

288
00:24:07,417 --> 00:24:08,959
It's done.

289
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:11,667
I don't want to live anymore.
I'm sorry.

290
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:13,999
Show love to the children.

291
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:17,918
Let them know through your eyes.

292
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:22,083
Children who are loved
return it twofold.

293
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:24,999
Are you watching this again?

294
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,999
I love you, my girl.

295
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,459
Why do you watch this?
It's gross.

296
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:32,167
Because it's fun.

297
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:34,417
Let's all do it together.

298
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,792
I love you, my girl.

299
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:39,500
Mommy loves you.

300
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:42,626
I love you, my girl.

301
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:44,959
- Daddy loves you.
- Mommy loves you.

302
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:48,417
Good job.

303
00:26:37,584 --> 00:26:39,834
This can't be...

304
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:42,918
Unfortunately, Si-woo doesn't meet

305
00:26:42,959 --> 00:26:45,250
the requirements for
the Mensa math class.

306
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:48,792
There must be an error in the test.

307
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,083
We'll try again.

308
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:54,125
You know, right?

309
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:57,209
Si-woo's dad graduated
from Stanford Medical School.

310
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,083
For Si-woo to walk his path,

311
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:02,792
he must take the Mensa math class.

312
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:07,167
All the kids here have already joined.

313
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,999
We'll take it again.

314
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:11,626
The results will likely be the same.

315
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:12,999
For God's sake!

316
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,042
There's no way.

317
00:27:17,584 --> 00:27:20,417
They said Si-woo
had high intelligence...

318
00:27:22,959 --> 00:27:23,999
Mom!

319
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:28,584
Mom!

320
00:27:29,626 --> 00:27:32,999
I finished early.
Can I skip tuition and go play?

321
00:27:34,334 --> 00:27:35,125
What did you say?

322
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,167
Please?

323
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:42,876
Are you serious?

324
00:27:42,918 --> 00:27:44,667
Mom, please?

325
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,584
You're laughing again.

326
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,459
Alright, let's go.

327
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,209
You're the best, Mom!

328
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,125
Hello?

329
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:17,834
Is this Dr. Kim Se-hee?

330
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,709
Yes, who's speaking?

331
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:22,834
The lady requests to meet you.

332
00:28:26,751 --> 00:28:29,999
I've been waiting
so long for your call.

333
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,626
There are a few things
to keep in mind...

334
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:35,999
Sorry, but I'm driving right now.

335
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,999
There's a child with me too.

336
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:39,999
I'll call you back soon.

337
00:28:39,999 --> 00:28:41,125
Excuse me?

338
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:46,792
Did I disturb your studies?
Sorry.

339
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:48,792
No, I'm fine.

340
00:28:49,626 --> 00:28:50,918
What a kind girl.

341
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,918
By the way, tell me about Si-woo.
He seems fun.

342
00:28:56,792 --> 00:29:00,542
Si-woo is very popular
and fun at school.

343
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,584
He's one of my closest friends.

344
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:06,584
He's going to the kids' park
with his mom today.

345
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:09,999
Really?
Si-woo's very lucky.

346
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:17,542
What are you doing?

347
00:29:17,584 --> 00:29:19,834
Huh?
You got here fast.

348
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:22,542
I was doing something nearby.
What's this?

349
00:29:22,584 --> 00:29:24,584
An emergency disposal.

350
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:26,209
I just went and got it myself.

351
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,959
It's damn heavy.

352
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,459
Anyway, I've got a game tonight.

353
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,999
You can handle this alone, right?

354
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,834
Sure, it's not like
it's my first time.

355
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:38,417
And this is a refund request
that came in.

356
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,250
I want a refund.
The kid isn't 19 yet.

357
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:46,459
Yes, ma'am.
Of course.

358
00:29:46,876 --> 00:29:49,542
Can I confirm a few things first?

359
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:50,999
Go ahead.

360
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,999
You're Park Min-joo, right?

361
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,999
And your husband is Choi Hyun-gyu...

362
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:56,999
Yes, that's right.

363
00:29:56,999 --> 00:29:58,918
Let's get this over with.

364
00:29:58,959 --> 00:30:00,918
He's nothing but a defect.

365
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:04,000
I mean,
how can a kid be so stupid?

366
00:30:04,042 --> 00:30:06,083
I want a refund fast!

367
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:09,626
And some compensation for the error!

368
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:10,959
Ma'am...

369
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:12,626
Our customer sounds upset.

370
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,999
Ugh, disgusting people...

371
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:15,999
Seriously...

372
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,999
Even dogs aren't abandoned like this!

373
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:20,999
Alright, give me a hand.

374
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,792
One, two...

375
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,167
Hello?

376
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,167
Yes, take care of him well.

377
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,459
With no loose ends.

378
00:30:45,999 --> 00:30:47,083
Okay.

379
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:48,918
Si-woo,

380
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:51,334
I'll get some coke.
Wait here, okay?

381
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:52,500
Okay.

382
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:54,876
See you in a bit.

383
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:03,500
What do you mean?

384
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:05,292
Why did his level test
come out like that?

385
00:31:05,334 --> 00:31:06,751
I don't know.

386
00:31:06,792 --> 00:31:08,999
He was a defect.

387
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:10,999
I'm seriously annoyed, honey.

388
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:14,834
Still, how could you make
that decision alone?

389
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,250
It's a big deal!

390
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,459
Why do you always do
whatever you want?

391
00:31:18,834 --> 00:31:23,999
And when has doing it your way
ever worked out? Huh?

392
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:25,876
You're unbelievable...

393
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:29,125
Why did you even bother adopting
in the first place?

394
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:33,375
Your mom was all crazy
about having grandkids,

395
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:35,000
despite her son being infertile.

396
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:37,959
She would've blamed me again.

397
00:31:38,584 --> 00:31:41,417
You talk like a frickin' villager.

398
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:42,918
So what now?

399
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:46,417
What if things go south
because of the refund?

400
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:48,834
We can just say he went missing.

401
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:52,792
And they'll take care of the disposal.
We have to trust them.

402
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:56,334
Honestly, he smiles like a weak fool!

403
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:58,667
Like an idiot.
Don't you think so?

404
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:01,876
Yeah, he didn't look like a kid
with the brains.

405
00:32:01,999 --> 00:32:03,292
Exactly!

406
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:06,167
But still, you raised him
like he was your own.

407
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:07,500
Do you have no sympathy?

408
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:08,876
Sympathy my butt.

409
00:32:08,918 --> 00:32:10,876
We don't share a drop of blood.

410
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:13,999
What a waste.

411
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:16,125
I spent way too much money on him.

412
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,167
Mom?

413
00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:19,083
Mom...

414
00:32:19,792 --> 00:32:20,751
Mom!

415
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,292
What am I going to tell my mother?

416
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:27,542
I'm going to adopt a new one.

417
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:30,542
We're getting a full refund,
so we'll just use that.

418
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:35,626
Honey, I've gotta go now.

419
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:39,167
Oh! You have to come and cry too.
To make it look real.

420
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,417
Bye now.

421
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,375
Hello? Hello?

422
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,709
Why do they need me as well?

423
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:49,292
Jeez...

424
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:01,999
Mom!

425
00:33:03,334 --> 00:33:04,999
Mom, where are you?

426
00:33:13,999 --> 00:33:15,209
You're Si-woo, right?

427
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:21,792
Your mom got hurt just now.

428
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:22,959
She's at the hospital.

429
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:23,999
What?

430
00:33:24,584 --> 00:33:26,083
She asked me to come get you.

431
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,667
Let's go.

432
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:38,125
Excuse me...

433
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:39,167
Please...

434
00:33:39,209 --> 00:33:40,209
What's going on?

435
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,459
Help me...

436
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:45,167
My son is missing.

437
00:33:45,209 --> 00:33:47,375
- Calm down.
- Please, find my child.

438
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:49,834
Ma'am, calm down.
Where did you last see him?

439
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:53,042
He was playing just over there.

440
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,999
And we were supposed
to meet right here.

441
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,999
But he disappeared!

442
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,167
Okay, what's his name and age?

443
00:34:01,209 --> 00:34:03,999
Choi Si-woo, he's 11.

444
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,292
- It's a boy?
- Yes...

445
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:08,292
Si-woo, my baby...

446
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:12,584
Ma'am, Ma'am, Ma'am!

447
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:14,792
- He must be so hungry...
- Calm down.

448
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:15,999
The report has been filed.

449
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,918
He said he wanted coke,
so I went to buy it...

450
00:34:18,959 --> 00:34:20,709
Please stay calm
and wait a little longer...

451
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:21,751
Si-woo!

452
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:23,042
Ma'am! Ma'am!

453
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:26,209
- Where is he?
- Ma'am, wait!

454
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,918
We have to find him!

455
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:33,083
- Honey, our boy!
- Tell me what happened.

456
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:36,542
- Did you find Si-woo?
- No, not yet.

457
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:39,292
We're looking for him
at this very moment.

458
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:41,375
My poor Si-woo!

459
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,999
He must be starving...

460
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:45,999
Honey...

461
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,000
- Are you okay?
- Honey, please...

462
00:34:48,042 --> 00:34:50,709
I can't live without Si-woo!

463
00:34:50,751 --> 00:34:53,167
- What do we do?
- Si-woo...

464
00:34:53,209 --> 00:34:55,999
Please, find him.

465
00:35:19,125 --> 00:35:21,167
Si-woo... Choi Si-woo!

466
00:35:21,999 --> 00:35:23,209
Wake up.

467
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:25,375
Can you hear me?

468
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,667
Who are you?

469
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,709
Where am I?

470
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:31,792
Si-woo, just wait.

471
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,999
Boss

472
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:35,542
Wait a moment.

473
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:37,959
Yes, boss.

474
00:35:37,999 --> 00:35:39,876
Hey, where are you?

475
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:41,500
Almost there.

476
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:43,584
I totally got busted today gambling.

477
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:44,999
Darn it.

478
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:45,999
I'll be there soon.

479
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:47,125
What?

480
00:35:47,876 --> 00:35:49,709
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

481
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:52,792
It's okay.
Go home and rest.

482
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:54,459
I'll finish things up here.

483
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,417
I've got nothing to do
at home anyway.

484
00:35:56,459 --> 00:35:57,792
Let's grab a drink after.

485
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:01,292
Yes, okay. Got it.

486
00:36:02,751 --> 00:36:03,876
Mister...

487
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:07,792
Where are we?
Who are you?

488
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,000
Where's my mom?

489
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,125
Listen carefully, Si-woo.

490
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:13,959
You've been kidnapped.

491
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:15,999
And the people who ordered
your kidnap...

492
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:19,042
...are your parents,
Park Min-joo and Choi Hyun-gyu.

493
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:24,959
Yes, hello?

494
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:26,334
I've confirmed the location.

495
00:36:26,999 --> 00:36:28,959
Leave the child for a while.

496
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:32,292
Then ask a staff member for help
an hour later.

497
00:36:32,334 --> 00:36:33,584
Wait, what?

498
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:38,999
You want me to put on a show?

499
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:42,709
Yes, report it to the police as well.

500
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:44,876
I'll lure the child to
a security camera blind spot,

501
00:36:44,918 --> 00:36:46,667
and take him to the parking lot.

502
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:48,876
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

503
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,292
About the refund...

504
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:55,375
And your mom and dad
told me to kill you.

505
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,125
Don't kill me!
Please save me!

506
00:36:59,667 --> 00:37:01,626
I'm really sorry!

507
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:02,959
No, no, Si-woo.

508
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,999
I'm going to save you.

509
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,042
So if you want to live,

510
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:11,375
you have to trust everything
I say from now on.

511
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:12,626
Can you do that?

512
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:17,083
Choi Hyun-gyu and Park Min-joo...

513
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:21,125
They never saw you as their child.

514
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:24,792
That's not true!
My mom and dad aren't like that!

515
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:26,083
Mister, I want to get out.

516
00:37:26,125 --> 00:37:28,459
No, Si-woo.
You can't go out right now.

517
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:31,999
You have to trust me,
can you do that?

518
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:36,876
Here, take this.

519
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:38,375
Go here.

520
00:37:38,999 --> 00:37:41,751
There will be kids like you
waiting for you.

521
00:37:42,751 --> 00:37:44,959
Don't let anyone see you
on the way.

522
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:25,083
It's hard to believe, but...

523
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:29,959
Your parents are bad people
who buy children with money.

524
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:34,209
And if they don't like 'em,
they just trash them.

525
00:38:42,999 --> 00:38:45,417
If they find out you're still alive...

526
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:46,999
What if I just try harder?

527
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:49,999
I'll become a better son.

528
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,999
I'm sorry, mister.

529
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:57,250
Please, just let me call
my mom once.

530
00:38:58,876 --> 00:39:03,667
I'll tell her I'll do better,
that I'm sorry.

531
00:39:09,417 --> 00:39:12,626
Bathhouse

532
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:25,042
A new child will arrive soon.

533
00:39:25,834 --> 00:39:27,667
Take good care of him, Ah-hyeon.

534
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,083
Okay. Be careful.

535
00:39:57,999 --> 00:39:58,999
Si-woo...

536
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,876
People who throw away their child
for being 'not good enough'...

537
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,918
...aren't worthy of being parents.

538
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:19,417
You know, I was the one
who made the big decision.

539
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:22,999
You usually don't make big decisions.

540
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:25,375
He smiled at me and said,

541
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:29,125
Hehe, Mom...,
you know?

542
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:32,292
Yeah, yeah.
Grinning all stupid.

543
00:40:32,334 --> 00:40:37,042
At that moment, I realized
I couldn't take him anymore.

544
00:40:37,083 --> 00:40:38,999
I was done with him.

545
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:43,999
Seriously, I even hated
the sound of him walking.

546
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:50,042
Honestly, you're something else.

547
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:53,751
You'd have done the same.
Try being stuck with him 24/7.

548
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,500
Hold on.

549
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:57,792
Hello?

550
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:01,542
You're supposed to be sad,
remember?

551
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,417
Hello?

552
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:09,751
Hello?

553
00:41:11,709 --> 00:41:13,375
Who is it?

554
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:19,999
Mom...

555
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:25,209
Are you...

556
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:27,999
Are you Si-woo?

557
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,584
Impossible, stop fooling around.

558
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:33,999
Mom!
Mom, I'm sorry!

559
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:36,792
What the hell?

560
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,125
- What is it?
- What do we do?

561
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:42,459
It's him on the phone.

562
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,999
- Who?
- It's his voice...

563
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:48,334
I think he's not dead!

564
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:51,876
What? Hang up!

565
00:41:51,918 --> 00:41:53,459
He can't be alive!

566
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,999
See for yourself.

567
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:57,709
Hello?

568
00:41:58,167 --> 00:41:59,999
We processed the refund, right?

569
00:41:59,999 --> 00:42:02,125
Then he's supposed to be dead.

570
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:03,667
Hello?

571
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:09,876
Mom!

572
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:13,834
Mom!

573
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,209
Mom!

574
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,042
Die! Die! Die!

575
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:18,876
It's time to go.

576
00:44:02,417 --> 00:44:03,667
Choi Si-woo is alive.

577
00:44:18,334 --> 00:44:19,751
Yes, Director Jeong.

578
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:21,000
Where's Choi Si-woo?

579
00:44:21,042 --> 00:44:22,042
Excuse me?

580
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:24,250
If you don't find the damn kid,

581
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:25,999
you're dead.

582
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,042
What do you mean...?

583
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:28,751
Wait, hello?

584
00:44:32,876 --> 00:44:35,999
Tae-sik, I think we're screwed.
Don't tell me...

585
00:44:40,999 --> 00:44:44,292
Bathhouse

586
00:44:56,709 --> 00:44:57,626
Who's that?

587
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:59,250
Is he like a five-year-old?

588
00:45:02,751 --> 00:45:04,834
It must be a mistake, right?

589
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,334
He's really small.

590
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:18,918
Welcome.

591
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:28,125
Tae-sik!

592
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:30,375
Woo Tae-sik!

593
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:32,334
Woo Tae-sik!

594
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,334
You're early.

595
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:37,125
- Is he here?
- What?

596
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:39,000
- He's here...
- What's going on?

597
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:43,000
He said the kid was gone.
I thought we were done for.

598
00:45:44,167 --> 00:45:47,751
Why is he on my ass all the time?

599
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:48,959
Jackass...

600
00:45:55,584 --> 00:45:56,751
Director Jeong!

601
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:57,999
The kid's here!

602
00:46:02,999 --> 00:46:05,709
What's going on?
I said the kid's here!

603
00:46:06,292 --> 00:46:07,999
Fuck you...!

604
00:46:13,999 --> 00:46:15,042
Open it.

605
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:18,584
- What's going on?
- Take him out.

606
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:25,709
Have you ever looked into
their eyes?

607
00:46:25,751 --> 00:46:26,999
The kids that died here...

608
00:46:27,667 --> 00:46:30,250
You could see hell through their eyes.

609
00:47:36,626 --> 00:47:37,999
Aren't you going to blow it?

610
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:48,792
Hey, kid.

611
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:50,626
Listen carefully.

612
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:53,209
The day you arrive here
is your new birthday.

613
00:47:53,918 --> 00:47:55,334
Congrats.
You're born again.

614
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:57,834
I'm impressed
he made it here by himself.

615
00:48:02,334 --> 00:48:03,626
Here.

616
00:48:21,334 --> 00:48:23,042
So what's your name?

617
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:25,209
Why would you ask that?

618
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:27,751
Give yourself a new name, okay?

619
00:48:28,584 --> 00:48:32,042
We didn't like the names they gave us,
so we made our own.

620
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:35,876
Their names are
after subway stations.

621
00:48:36,334 --> 00:48:39,334
Ah-hyeon Station, Seok-su Station,
and Joo-an Station.

622
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,500
Funny, right?

623
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,999
She has a K-pop idol's name.
So-mi!

624
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:47,834
Is she Jeon So-mi, or what?

625
00:48:47,876 --> 00:48:49,459
She's out of her mind.

626
00:48:53,167 --> 00:48:54,250
Not funny?

627
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:55,999
Guess not...

628
00:48:57,459 --> 00:49:00,042
Mister, call me back...

629
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:03,209
I'm hungry.

630
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:05,959
When is the old man coming?

631
00:49:06,083 --> 00:49:07,999
He said he'd buy us chicken today.

632
00:49:07,999 --> 00:49:09,167
Yeah...

633
00:49:09,209 --> 00:49:11,999
Hey, why didn't you come
with the old man?

634
00:49:13,959 --> 00:49:17,042
Bluebird one, searching around
the payphone area.

635
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:22,125
Ah-hyeon, what's that car?

636
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:32,125
Searching near the payphone.

637
00:49:33,209 --> 00:49:35,626
We're looking for an eleven-year-old boy,

638
00:49:36,751 --> 00:49:39,292
last seen with a blue shirt
and beige pants.

639
00:49:39,334 --> 00:49:41,834
Looking for a eleven-year-old boy...

640
00:49:41,876 --> 00:49:44,167
Police frequency,
but they're not using code words.

641
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:45,751
What the hell?

642
00:49:46,125 --> 00:49:48,999
Hey, did you meet anyone
on the way here?

643
00:49:50,667 --> 00:49:53,459
Or... did someone see you?

644
00:49:54,584 --> 00:49:56,999
Maybe you called the police?

645
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:02,626
I called my Mom.

646
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:05,999
Mister...

647
00:50:48,709 --> 00:50:50,250
- Get closer to him!
- Shoot!

648
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,292
Mister...

649
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:28,542
Mister!

650
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:38,125
The Defects
Epilogue

651
00:53:55,751 --> 00:53:57,751
Kim Ah-hyeon

652
00:53:59,751 --> 00:54:02,999
Kim Ah-hyeon

653
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,999
Kim Ah-hyeon

654
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:11,417
Is your name...

655
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,083
Kim Ah-hyeon?

656
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:27,918
Bathhouse

657
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:31,334
Is this our home?

658
00:54:32,292 --> 00:54:33,334
Well...

659
00:54:34,709 --> 00:54:36,542
Not exactly.

660
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:39,083
It's home.

661
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:41,000
Let's go inside.

662
00:54:43,542 --> 00:54:44,709
Yeah.

663
00:54:47,999 --> 00:54:49,999
Kim Ah-hyeon

664
00:55:22,334 --> 00:55:23,375
Help yourselves.

665
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:28,334
Where's the chicken leg?
Did you eat it?

666
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:29,999
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did!

667
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:31,167
Who ate the chicken leg?

668
00:55:31,209 --> 00:55:32,999
- The legs are gone!
- Pass me a piece!

669
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:35,334
You can have this.

670
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:36,542
Don't fight.

671
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:38,459
- I wish we ate chicken more often.
- Me too.

672
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,292
I'm sick of eating ramen every day.

673
00:55:40,334 --> 00:55:42,167
It's better to have it
once in a while.

674
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:45,083
Mister, let's take a picture together!

675
00:55:45,125 --> 00:55:46,417
Should I take it?

676
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:48,250
Who takes pictures while eating?

677
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:50,209
Come on, it's been a while.

678
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:53,125
Gosh...

679
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:55,751
Leave me out of it.

680
00:55:55,792 --> 00:55:57,209
- I'm taking it.
- No, don't!

681
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,500
Just pose!

682
00:55:58,542 --> 00:56:00,500
One, two, three!

683
00:56:00,999 --> 00:56:03,042
One, two, three!

684
00:56:31,918 --> 00:56:34,042
Thank you to actor Kim Soo-ro
for the special appearance.

685
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:37,042
The Defects

686
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:39,999
Nice to meet you, Madam Lady.

687
00:56:39,999 --> 00:56:42,709
I want to give him
a child worthy of him.

688
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,792
There's always a way.

689
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:46,709
You know, I'm so happy today.

690
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:49,292
I feel like my dream
is about to come true.

691
00:56:49,999 --> 00:56:50,918
My best friend from class...

692
00:56:50,959 --> 00:56:52,542
He hasn't been coming to school.

693
00:56:52,584 --> 00:56:53,959
He should be fine, right?

694
00:56:53,999 --> 00:56:55,125
We were just products to them.

695
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:56,667
Something they bought,

696
00:56:56,709 --> 00:56:58,334
that may be disposed of whenever.

697
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:00,167
Where's the membership card?

698
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:02,334
Those kids shouldn't even exist.

699
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:04,125
Where would they go?

700
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:05,542
To a place where no one exists.

701
00:57:06,334 --> 00:57:07,209
Hurry!

702
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:08,918
You're all defective products.

703
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,959
...trying so hard to kill us.

704
00:57:10,999 --> 00:57:12,167
The one our old man
couldn't find...

705
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:14,083
The monster.
I'm gonna find him.
