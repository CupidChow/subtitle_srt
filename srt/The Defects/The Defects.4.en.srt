Won Jina

00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,792
Choi Young Jun

00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:21,876
Kim Jin Young

5
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:31,999
The Defects

6
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,125
- Dad, is it here?
- Yeah.

7
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:03,751
Let's go in.

8
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:12,542
Wow, is this our new home?

9
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:19,918
There are even pretty flowers
that look like Mom!

10
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,584
Thank you for everything.

11
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:33,999
What do you mean?

12
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:37,250
You've been through a lot
to support me.

13
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:47,542
Real Estate Gift Agreement

14
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,375
It's your house now.

15
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:55,626
From now on,
do whatever you want.

16
00:01:55,667 --> 00:01:57,167
Kim Se-hee

17
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:34,834
What's going on?

18
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:38,792
It's a good day,
so I thought we should have a drink.

19
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,042
Oh, yeah?

20
00:02:40,999 --> 00:02:43,584
It's a little late, but sure.

21
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,667
Tastes good.

22
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:50,999
What? You said I could
do whatever I want.

23
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:55,626
I knew you were smart,
but I didn't know you'd succeed.

24
00:04:57,999 --> 00:04:59,125
Not bad.

25
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,918
You were pretty useful.

26
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:33,042
Mom, what are you doing?

27
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,042
Can't sleep?

28
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:39,626
Come on,
I'll tuck you in.

29
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:54,209
The Defects
EP4. Mom

30
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,999
Are things looking good?

31
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:58,876
Yes, very good.

32
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,042
It only happens once every 10 months,
it can only be intense.

33
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:06,417
Why do people go crazy over auctions?
The items are random.

34
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:08,999
People aren't confident
in their own choices.

35
00:06:08,999 --> 00:06:11,209
They need others' approval.

36
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:13,999
And I take advantage of that.

37
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,000
Kwon Kang-man

38
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:24,876
22nd National Assembly Member
Kwon Kang-man

39
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,083
How can I help you?

40
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,709
The Congressman isn't here.

41
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:30,250
I saw his car parked inside.

42
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:31,876
It'll only take a minute.

43
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,375
You must make an appointment.

44
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:37,834
You can't barge in like this
even if you're the police.

45
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:39,584
It won't take long...

46
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:41,000
You're obstructing official duties...

47
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:44,292
Huh? There he is in there.

48
00:06:44,334 --> 00:06:46,000
You didn't have to lie.

49
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:48,459
You can't go in.
Wait, stop!

50
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:56,584
We'll be in touch soon.
Okay.

51
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:01,125
What's this about?

52
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:03,209
Detective Choi Hyung-seok
from Buchon Station.

53
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,751
I'd like to ask about your son.

54
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:13,876
Have a seat.

55
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:18,250
What about my son?

56
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,292
About Kwon Sung-woo's death
from 3 years ago.

57
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,292
Did he really die?

58
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:32,999
That's a painful question.

59
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:54,999
He looks a lot like my boy.

60
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:02,042
Is this your son...?

61
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:06,584
Detective Choi Hyung-seok, was it?

62
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:07,959
Yes.

63
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:11,999
If you're here to rip open
a grieving father's heart,

64
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,751
then please leave.

65
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,042
It's just that...

66
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:20,042
Please leave.

67
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:44,584
Kwon Sung-woo...
How is he alive?

68
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:07,417
You okay, Ah-hyeon?

69
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:15,125
Yeah, I'm alright.

70
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:19,876
Let's go inside.

71
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,667
Okay, let's piece it all together.

72
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:33,292
This is Old Man Tae-sik.

73
00:09:33,999 --> 00:09:35,500
Our old man

74
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,999
was taking jobs from this guy,

75
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:39,999
secretly disposing
of the abandoned kids.

76
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:41,584
In the process, he saved us.

77
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:45,125
There has to be someone above him,

78
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,876
and I think it's this person.

79
00:09:51,584 --> 00:09:54,250
And this person
doesn't only dispose of kids,

80
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,876
but also sell babies
to rich clients illegally.

81
00:09:58,918 --> 00:10:03,125
These babies aren't orphans either.

82
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:10,999
They made them
through donor sperms and eggs.

83
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:12,999
That's right.

84
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,999
The biological parents don't know
about their baby's existence.

85
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:23,083
So this woman
had her eggs extracted,

86
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,375
but never found out
what happened afterward.

87
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:31,042
In other words,
this whole thing is illegal.

88
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:35,999
It was never legal to start with.

89
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:40,876
So... us too?

90
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:43,999
Baby factory.

91
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:46,959
I read about it in a book.

92
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:50,334
The Nazis did stuff like this.

93
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,999
Trying to create the perfect genes.

94
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:56,918
Perfect genes...

95
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Ah-hyeon,
I need a perfect daughter.

96
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,751
This is disgusting.

97
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,000
My mom told me
that they're dangerous.

98
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:14,918
More than we can imagine.

99
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,500
Let's find them.

100
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:19,250
We have to stop this.

101
00:11:21,626 --> 00:11:22,999
Ah-hyeon...

102
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,751
Let's find them ourselves.

103
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,999
Play the video you filmed.

104
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,209
Okay.

105
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:41,125
She's clearly the boss.

106
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,083
I'm sure of it.

107
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:47,751
But how do we find her?

108
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:54,417
First, Let's try tracking down
one of the egg donors.

109
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:56,083
Okay.

110
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,999
SH Scholarship Foundation

111
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:27,999
She parties every day except Sundays,
cuz she needs to study.

112
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:29,876
You know what's scary?

113
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:32,834
She parties all week,
then tops her med school classes.

114
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:36,042
They say she's an AI,
she memorizes entire books.

115
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,999
I bet she's on drugs or something.

116
00:12:41,876 --> 00:12:42,999
Do you have a light?

117
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,626
Don't you know me?
Second-year med student.

118
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,209
What's a med student doing here?

119
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,792
Wanna hang out?

120
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,584
I'm kinda busy.

121
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:48,999
It's them.

122
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:51,999
They're headed that way.

123
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:21,999
What can I get you?

124
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:23,584
Beer?

125
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:31,500
You know this, right?

126
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:34,083
Find the server room
and plug this in.

127
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,999
Then everything they're using
will be sent to me in real time.

128
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,125
And this...
Use it only if you must.

129
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:43,709
It's too dangerous.

130
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:48,999
Be careful.

131
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:50,999
Don't worry.

132
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:53,250
Ah-hyeon, don't get hurt.

133
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:57,083
Take care of the kids.

134
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,417
See you all later.

135
00:15:03,042 --> 00:15:04,918
- You're here!
- Hey.

136
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:08,500
- The usual?
- Of course.

137
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,876
I'm going to the bathroom.

138
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:45,959
The embryo implantation using
the chairman's eggs was successful.

139
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:47,959
What's next?

140
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:50,459
We've got three more this week.

141
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,250
All looking good.

142
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:56,000
Looking good won't cut it.

143
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:58,083
I told you,
I want perfection.

144
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:04,999
When can I get her eggs?

145
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,125
I won't feel safe until then.

146
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:24,417
Get in.

147
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:12,626
Where are they going?

148
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:18,999
What is this place?

149
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,209
5th floor.

150
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:42,250
Thank you for visiting
our hospital today.

151
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,334
Today's drug administration
will take about two hours,

152
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:49,250
but depending on your personal condition,

153
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:52,167
it may take up to five hours.
Please be noted.

154
00:17:52,999 --> 00:17:56,083
No private conversations are allowed.

155
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:58,918
If any information is leaked externally,

156
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,334
you will face severe consequences.

157
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:08,751
Aren't you going in?

158
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:22,626
You need to change first.

159
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:24,500
Okay.

160
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:25,542
Knock when you're done.

161
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:49,999
Wait a minute.

162
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:55,999
What the hell is going on?

163
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,500
A detective came asking...

164
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,918
We can't undo spilled milk.

165
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,167
We'll just have to take care of it.

166
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,876
What do you mean?

167
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:07,667
You mean he's alive, huh?

168
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:12,751
Apparently yes.
Kwon Sung-woo is alive.

169
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:13,999
What?

170
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:16,876
Hey! How could you have
fucked it up?

171
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:17,876
Congressman!

172
00:19:23,751 --> 00:19:27,999
You said it'll be done quietly,
so that no one knows!

173
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:32,209
If your son is alive,

174
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,834
it'll shake the whole country,
won't it?

175
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,042
What did you say?

176
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:40,667
Feeling wronged?
Then sue me.

177
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:47,834
What are you playing at?

178
00:19:49,999 --> 00:19:51,000
Do you want money?

179
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:53,417
Congressman!

180
00:19:54,209 --> 00:19:56,709
I already have more money
than I'll ever need.

181
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:00,250
Making money's no fun anymore.

182
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:06,918
I just want to fix
this messed up world,

183
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:10,042
and make it right again.

184
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,918
What?

185
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,417
God saw... it was good.

186
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:19,417
God saw... it was very good.

187
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:22,999
That verse always makes me think.

188
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:27,042
Did God mean it?

189
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:32,626
Was he actually satisfied
with the humans he created?

190
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:35,876
No...

191
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,334
I don't think God meant it.

192
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:43,999
Why else would he have
given humans so many tests?

193
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:48,999
He created dumb, foolish, ugly,

194
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:52,209
and useless human beings
to fill the world.

195
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:54,999
So irresponsible...

196
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,834
God saw... it was good.

197
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:02,584
How terrible is that?

198
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:04,999
I'm a responsible person.

199
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:05,999
Amen.

200
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:10,999
I see through what I have started.

201
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,167
I need you to amend a law for me.
It's urgent.

202
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,876
Just a few lines in the bioethics act.

203
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,500
How dare you!

204
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:20,792
Kwon Sung-woo.

205
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,500
Do you know
what he has become?

206
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:28,626
What?

207
00:21:29,876 --> 00:21:34,417
Congressman, you'll get killed!

208
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:37,209
I'll take care of
Kwon Sung-woo myself.

209
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,209
You do your part.

210
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:43,167
Make sure you handle things right,
Congressman.

211
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,999
Take responsibility.

212
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:41,667
Are you okay?

213
00:22:41,709 --> 00:22:42,999
Yeah, I'm fine.

214
00:22:42,999 --> 00:22:44,999
Check if there are other areas.

215
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:46,167
Got it.

216
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,542
What is all this?

217
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:34,125
Uncle.

218
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:35,999
Ah-hyeon.

219
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:38,542
Get changed and wait.

220
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,083
A staff will come for you.

221
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:42,834
What kind of test
am I getting today?

222
00:23:43,709 --> 00:23:44,999
Not sure.

223
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,459
Uncle, did you eat?

224
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,834
You didn't eat, right?

225
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:53,375
Don't skip your meals.

226
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:06,292
The restoration isn't perfect yet.

227
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:07,999
But this phone's owner...

228
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:11,542
- Is he really a trafficker?
- What?

229
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:12,999
Take a look.

230
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:17,417
Mister, we're about to eat dinner.
When are you coming home?

231
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:19,500
I'm gonna be late,
don't wait for me.

232
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:23,209
You've never been away this long,
I'm worried.

233
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,918
Sorry, Ah-hyeon.
I'll be home tomorrow, don't worry.

234
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:30,292
If you ask me,
they seem like family.

235
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:39,999
Anesthesia is complete,
ready to proceed.

236
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:41,083
Got it.

237
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,999
Let's start today's extraction.

238
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:47,500
Hey, stop receiving
this woman's eggs.

239
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:50,375
Her drug addiction
has her messed up.

240
00:24:50,417 --> 00:24:51,999
She's all torn up.

241
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:54,042
Understood.

242
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,125
Extraction going well.

243
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:01,167
Doctor, we're missing a participant.

244
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:03,667
Go get her then.

245
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:10,334
Hello? Anyone inside?

246
00:25:11,584 --> 00:25:13,459
Huh? Nurse?

247
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:15,918
Hey, are you okay?

248
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:19,626
One of the samples is missing!

249
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:21,584
Shit.

250
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:50,834
Joo-an.

251
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:54,500
Yes, I found the blueprint.

252
00:25:55,751 --> 00:25:58,042
Head down and go right.

253
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,999
That's where the main server should be.

254
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:03,250
I think the main server is key here.

255
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Joo-an.

256
00:26:38,209 --> 00:26:39,751
- Are you getting this?
- Yeah.

257
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:41,125
Move closer to it.

258
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:45,667
Not that one, the second one.

259
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:48,000
Did you find it?

260
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:50,500
Is this it?

261
00:26:50,959 --> 00:26:51,999
Yeah, that's the one.

262
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:32,459
Are you getting it?

263
00:27:34,999 --> 00:27:35,999
Got it.

264
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:37,999
Hang on.

265
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:42,292
Boss, you should see this.

266
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:51,999
Did you get something?

267
00:27:51,999 --> 00:27:53,876
Uh, yeah.

268
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:56,459
I found the buyers list.

269
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,417
There are thousands of them.

270
00:27:58,792 --> 00:27:59,999
That many?

271
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,999
Anything on the seller?

272
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:03,792
Hold on.

273
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:07,999
DNA Modified Child Buyer NO.17

274
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:11,167
DNA data?
What is this?

275
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:14,375
DNA data?
What does that mean?

276
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,083
What?

277
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:19,375
Well, in simple terms,

278
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:22,792
they filter out good DNA
from bad DNA.

279
00:28:22,999 --> 00:28:26,751
I think they're creating
customized genes.

280
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:32,125
Unbelievable.

281
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:41,959
What is it?

282
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:43,751
We picked up an outside signal.

283
00:28:57,709 --> 00:28:59,792
Lock down the building.

284
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,083
Now!

285
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:17,125
Code Black! Code Black!
Intruder alert!

286
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:18,999
Code Black! Intruder alert!

287
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:20,292
We need to move fast.

288
00:29:20,334 --> 00:29:22,751
Intruder alert,
search every corner!

289
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:07,459
Code Black,
we have an intruder.

290
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:15,999
Sister!

291
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,375
- Have you been well?
- Of course.

292
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,751
Sorry for making you
come all the way here.

293
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:23,918
I'll take it from here.

294
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,042
Yes, Madam Lady.

295
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,999
My husband can't move around easily.

296
00:30:29,999 --> 00:30:31,959
Please understand.

297
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:34,083
Oh no, it's really nothing.

298
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,876
It's a great chance for me
to visit in person.

299
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:40,626
Thank you for being so understanding.

300
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,876
And sister...

301
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:48,834
Thank you.

302
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:52,292
For offering us your daughter.

303
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,167
It feels like we're a family now.

304
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:00,292
Like real sisters.

305
00:31:12,751 --> 00:31:13,999
Honey.

306
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,292
Yeah.

307
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:22,459
We finally meet.
I've wanted to see you.

308
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:26,250
Nice to meet you,
I'm Kim Se-hee.

309
00:31:33,209 --> 00:31:35,083
Let's get straight to the point.

310
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:40,751
As you can see,
I'm maintaining my approval rating well.

311
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,999
But everyone who come here
to offer me deals and sort

312
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:51,042
talk only about my approval ratings.
It's frankly boring.

313
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:59,667
Foolish people get bored when they hear
what they need to hear.

314
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:06,709
You're very bold,
just as I heard.

315
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:13,417
Youngest president in Korean history.
Highest average approval rating.

316
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:17,334
Why would someone with everything
listen to small-minded people

317
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:20,667
who only talk about approval ratings?

318
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:24,999
I know you dream
of doing real politics.

319
00:32:27,709 --> 00:32:29,209
About the low birthrate crisis...

320
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:34,876
In a country where the president
and first lady are DINKs,

321
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:40,083
people can't be convinced to have kids.
This isn't about approval ratings.

322
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,999
I'm sure there is a reason
why you agreed to see me.

323
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,167
To think alongside the people.
To be one with the people.

324
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:51,500
That's what you're thinking, right?

325
00:32:53,417 --> 00:32:57,667
And above all,
you truly love your wife.

326
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:11,709
I guess I have a good eye for people.

327
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,792
After being diagnosed
with ovarian insufficiency,

328
00:33:17,584 --> 00:33:21,000
I even thought of divorce.

329
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,584
I thought if we divorced
during the term,

330
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:28,999
it might ruin his future.

331
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:34,042
I considered divorcing
right before the inauguration.

332
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:37,999
Let me help
make your dreams come true.

333
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:42,459
The Lord will bless you.

334
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:44,042
Amen.

335
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:56,125
If all goes well,

336
00:33:56,584 --> 00:33:59,626
I will give a small favor in return.

337
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:03,209
I heard there were many struggles
with your research.

338
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:08,542
There are too many
useless regulations in Korea, right?

339
00:34:19,999 --> 00:34:20,999
Joo-an.

340
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,999
- Joo-an!
- Keep going straight.

341
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:29,959
Guide her well through the test.

342
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:31,417
Sure.

343
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:01,375
Um...

344
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,375
Excuse me, miss.

345
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:06,542
Where do I take the test?

346
00:35:09,334 --> 00:35:11,626
I'll just wait here.

347
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,125
What's going on, Ah-hyeon?

348
00:35:35,584 --> 00:35:36,709
Ah-hyeon!

349
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:38,792
What is it? What's wrong?

350
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:44,250
Ah-hyeon,
do you need anything?

351
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:46,792
Can I go in?

352
00:35:53,999 --> 00:35:54,999
Yes.

353
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:01,209
Who was that girl just now?
Is she new?

354
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,250
Who?

355
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:31,000
Wow, it's Snow White!

356
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,209
Do you know the real story
of Snow White?

357
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:43,042
What?
First time seeing Mom smoke?

358
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,250
Yeah...

359
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,083
Want to try?

360
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:53,999
Mom...

361
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:56,334
Ah-hyeon.

362
00:36:57,999 --> 00:37:02,959
You know Snow White's stepmother
who said "Mirror mirror..."?

363
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:06,667
Actually she was...

364
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:19,876
This is really bad.

365
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:22,999
- They blocked all signals.
- What?

366
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:24,999
Let's get moving.

367
00:37:25,417 --> 00:37:26,459
Bro!

368
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:28,209
We have to do something.

369
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:35,667
Joo-an!

370
00:37:36,459 --> 00:37:37,667
Joo-an?

371
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:46,083
There, get her!

372
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:49,167
Intruder spotted!
Intruder spotted!

373
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:53,250
Bro...

374
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:57,792
Let's go.
We can't... leave her behind.

375
00:37:57,834 --> 00:37:59,709
Go in there and do what?

376
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,334
Ah-hyeon...

377
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,334
Hey!

378
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,709
Ah-hyeon...

379
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:17,542
Ah-hyeon...

380
00:38:19,709 --> 00:38:20,999
Ah-hyeon!

381
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,959
Si-woo, what do you mean?

382
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:27,042
It's Ah-hyeon.

383
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:31,999
The person who was in front of her.

384
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:36,876
That was Ah-hyeon.

385
00:38:46,292 --> 00:38:48,999
Over there! Catch her!

386
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:30,667
You, report to HQ!

387
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:33,167
And you get the chainsaw!
Move it!

388
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,542
Ah-hyeon,
do you need anything?

389
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,918
I, Yoon Se-hoon, agree to annul
the adoption of Yoon Ji-seok

390
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:31,209
from 17 years ago,
and to discard him.

391
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,667
The reason is 'defective product'.

392
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:36,083
You say it too, honey.

393
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:39,751
I agree. Amen.

394
00:43:13,918 --> 00:43:15,999
All staff,
gather in the lobby.

395
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:17,999
All staff,
report to the lobby immediately.

396
00:43:17,999 --> 00:43:21,250
- Is something wrong?
- It's nothing serious, don't worry.

397
00:43:21,292 --> 00:43:23,000
- Please get changed.
- Okay.

398
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:40,876
Hello?

399
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,292
Ah-yeon, it's me.

400
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:45,751
It's Si-woo!

401
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,751
Si-woo?
What happened to you?

402
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:55,542
Listen, can you help me?

403
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,876
I'll explain when we meet.

404
00:44:01,292 --> 00:44:04,667
But come without anyone knowing.

405
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,459
Where are you right now?

406
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,209
Okay.

407
00:44:21,918 --> 00:44:23,167
You can't go out.

408
00:44:24,999 --> 00:44:26,999
- No!
- Don't touch me!

409
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:07,834
Everyone out!

410
00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:15,292
All staff,
gather in the lobby.

411
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:18,000
All staff,
report to the lobby immediately.

412
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:20,751
All staff,
gather in the lobby.

413
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:23,709
All staff,
report to the lobby immediately.

414
00:46:27,999 --> 00:46:29,792
Stand in line!

415
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:39,959
Hey, what are you doing?
Move to the lobby.

416
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:00,999
Now, take off all your masks.

417
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:03,876
Masks off!

418
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,250
Masks off.

419
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:43,751
Don't move.

420
00:47:46,042 --> 00:47:47,083
Don't move!

421
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:51,292
Out of the way!

422
00:49:32,999 --> 00:49:33,999
Lower your weapons.

423
00:50:33,334 --> 00:50:34,584
Stop.

424
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:07,542
Don't make that face!

425
00:51:16,709 --> 00:51:18,417
It's a bomb. Boom!

426
00:51:48,918 --> 00:51:50,292
No!

427
00:52:17,042 --> 00:52:18,459
Mom...

428
00:52:18,918 --> 00:52:19,999
You lost.

429
00:52:20,792 --> 00:52:21,876
Mom?

430
00:52:24,626 --> 00:52:26,167
You're useless.

431
00:52:27,542 --> 00:52:28,999
Mom...

432
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:31,834
Goodbye, Ah-hyeon.

433
00:52:32,959 --> 00:52:33,999
Mom...

434
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:37,959
Mom!

435
00:52:38,999 --> 00:52:40,292
Mom!

436
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:26,083
Ah-hyeon.

437
00:53:26,709 --> 00:53:31,834
You know Snow White's stepmother
who said "Mirror mirror..."?

438
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:35,375
Actually, she was not her stepmom.

439
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:37,375
She was her real mom.

440
00:53:38,375 --> 00:53:41,792
The one who ordered the huntsman
to bring Snow White's heart...

441
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:45,999
...wasn't the stepmom.
It was her real mom.

442
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:05,918
Ah-hyeon.

443
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:12,167
My daughter, how have you been?

444
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:19,751
Why did you come here?

445
00:54:20,417 --> 00:54:22,083
You should've died that day.

446
00:54:58,834 --> 00:55:01,209
Thank you to actors Lee Min-woo and
Seong-hoon for their special appearance.

447
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:04,209
The Defects

448
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:06,667
What if something happens to her
while you hesitate?

449
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:08,083
We have to think it through!

450
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,999
I don't care!
I'll go alone if I have to!

451
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:11,999
They might actually be of use.

452
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:15,334
Shouldn't at least one adult
be there to help these kids?

453
00:55:15,375 --> 00:55:17,584
Is that really the only way?

454
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:18,876
You're not alone anymore.

455
00:55:18,918 --> 00:55:20,834
So come with me, let's go together.

456
00:55:20,876 --> 00:55:22,876
You killed Eun-gyeol...

457
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:24,709
Yoon Ji-seok, that bastard!

458
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:26,876
He was my son.
And he needs to die now.

459
00:55:26,918 --> 00:55:30,375
We should've picked out the good genes
and combine them.

460
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:32,999
Then we wouldn't have wastes like these.

461
00:55:33,999 --> 00:55:36,626
So I'm going to do just that.

462
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,999
Nice to meet you... my Maria.

463
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,459
I want to be a daughter
that's useful to my mom.

464
00:55:42,918 --> 00:55:45,626
Your son, Ji-seok...
He's in here!
