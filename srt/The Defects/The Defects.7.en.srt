Seok Su.

00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,410
- Are you okay?
- Seok Su.

7
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,270
Seok Su.

8
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,310
How did you know to come here?

9
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,180
- Don't be like that.
- Say something.

10

Seok Su.

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,020
What do we do? Seok Su.

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,820
Seok Su.

13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,460
- Seok Su.
- Why is Seok Su...

14
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,290
What do we do?

15
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,100
What should we do with the kids?

16
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,700
Wait.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,800
We'll kill them all at once.

18
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,960
Seok Su.

19
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,890
Seok Su.

20
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,460
Let me go.

21
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:43,960
Ah Hyun.

22
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,030
I'm not going, Uncle.

23
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,540
If you do this, you'll die.

24
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,740
If Mom no longer needs me,

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,310
then I'll die anyway. Isn't that right?

26
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,710
Before Mom abandons me,

27
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,710
I'm going to abandon her first.

28
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,880
Uncle, you should stop this too.

29
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,380
Mom...

30
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,490
is not a mother.

31
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,890
Let's go back.

32
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,490
I'm not going.

33
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,230
If you go in there,

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,500
you'll regret it.

35
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,440
I might kill you.

36
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,310
Then do it now.

(The Defects
Episode 7. D-Day)

39
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,320
Why aren't you saying anything?

40
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,950
Ah Hyun.

41
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,820
Seok Su.

42
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,190
What's wrong with him?

43
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,260
Seok Su, look at me.

44
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,600
- What do we do?
- Ah Hyun.

45
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Seok Su.

46
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,470
I'm okay.

47
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,740
Don't talk!

48
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,040
Seok Su, don't say anything.
You're not going to die.

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,070
Even so,

50
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,310
it's okay.

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,610
We're all together in the end.

52
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,950
Seok Su, don't die.

53
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,320
- Wake up, Seok Su.
- I like it.

54
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,590
Seok Su.

55
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,960

85
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,390
in the murder case of the pastor couple
from the church in Buchon-dong.

86

the son of the pastor couple.

93
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,780
He's not breathing.

94

What do we do?

95
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,790
What do we do? Please call an ambulance.

You.

100
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,050
Did you lose them, or let them go?

101
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,450
I was especially fond of her.

102
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,150
She was the most useful among them.

103
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,660
But you shouldn't have.

104
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,290

115
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,330
Seok Su, why are you lying down like this?

116
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,870
Wake up, Seok Su.

117
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,310
We said we'd live happily together.

118
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,310
Why do you have to die?

119
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,480
Don't die.

120
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
What do we do?

121
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,250

122
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,620

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,330
What do we do? Seok Su.

00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,370
We said we'd live happily together.

Why break the promise we made?

129
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,240
Seok Su, you can't die like this.

Seok Su.

131
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,080
Seok Su, please don't die.

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,610
- Seok Su, please.
- Open your eyes.

I'm sorry.

137
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,650
I was too late.

138
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,690
It's my fault.

139
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,490
I couldn't protect him.

140
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,490

145
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,020

Breaking news.

Assemblyman Kwon Kang Man of
the New Gyeore Party has been found dead.

148
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,670
A total of five bodies,
including that of Assemblyman Kwon,

149
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,310
were found at the scene.

150
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,810
The suspects are the children involved
in the murder of Pastor Yoon and his wife…

151
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,580
Actually,

152
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,920
I heard something a bit troubling.

153
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,960
What is it?

154
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,330
Rumors are spreading
in the National Assembly.

155
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,230
That Assemblyman Kwon Kang Man was...

156
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,570
a member
of the adoption-for-sale membership.

157
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,940
Seeing how poorly the secrecy was kept,

158
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,610
I'm starting to get nervous too.

159
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,550
I hate when people gossip
about private matters.

160
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,750
Maybe I'm too sensitive.

161
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,290
With the pastor couple dead,

162
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,190
and even Kwon Kang Man ending up
like that...

163
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,760
Madam.

164
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,260
If you think about it,

165
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,830
this may actually be a good thing.

166
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,080
No one left in this world knows...

167
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,780
about our meeting anymore.

168
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,120
Sister.

169
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,920
I know well...

170
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:13,560
that you can't open the future
without closing the past.

171
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,200
What do you mean?

172
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,970
Back when there were no laws
or proper technology,

173
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,900
mistakes were inevitable.

174
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,540
So yes, there were noisy incidents.

175
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,440
But now we have laws,
and perfect technology.

176
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,880
There are no more errors.

177
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,980
All we have to do is...

178
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,450
filter out the errors of the past.

179
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,220
Cleanly, without a trace.

180
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,720
You'll be held accountable
for those words.

181
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,460
You know that, right?

182
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,130
There won't be any trace left.

183
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,030
None at all.

184
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,080
When will it be perfect?

185
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,820
Soon.

186
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,220
It'll be done soon.

187
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,100
Let's stop now.

188
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,230
I won't let you do
anything dangerous anymore.

189
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,200
I can't lose anyone else.

190
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,710
I can't go.

191
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,810
What?

192
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,480
She's the woman who tried to kill us.

193
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,480
And now Seok Su is dead too.

194
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,980
What's next?

195
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,380
More children will be sacrificed.

196
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,220
I can't allow this anymore.

197
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,120
Ah Hyun.

198
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,260
I promised the kids...

199
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,160
that I'd let them go anywhere they want...

200
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,530
and live freely.

201
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,570
I couldn't keep that promise to Seok Su,

202
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,640
but I want the remaining kids
to live like that no matter what.

203
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,910
I can't let it end like this.

204
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,620
You're still alive.

205
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,390
Kids, have you been well?

206
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:30,030
A new child has arrived,

207
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,500
and one is gone.

208
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,700
- Shall we take a look?
- Yes.

209
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,040
Don't.

210
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,420
This one was really hard to get.

211
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,330
It must be tough on you.

212
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,510
(D-7)

213
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,480
Who is it?

214
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,760
(Would you like to refund your child?)

215
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,860
A refund?

216
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,130
(Would you like to refund your child?)

217
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,570
This is your last chance.

218
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,000
You're saying I can apply
until this weekend?

219
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,540
What kind of compensation is offered?

220
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,940
I'd like a refund in cash.

221
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,950
Is that possible?

222
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,310
Of course.

223
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,050
Since this is the last chance,
everyone's applying for a refund.

224
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,660
I'm so sick of kids now
I can't even look at them.

225
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,160
Please note that refunds are
no longer available after this period.

226
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,330
Don't miss this valuable opportunity.

227
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,100
But still,
you grow attached after raising them.

228
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,600
How could they just...

229
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,740
Madam.

230
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,540
People capable
of such sentimental thoughts...

231
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,210
do not buy children in the first place.

232
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,350
However,

233
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,880
if they did grow attached
while raising them,

234
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,720
and now can't abandon them
because of that...

235
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,020
Well,

236
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,260
foolish and inferior people like that...

237
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,030
couldn't possibly be my clients.

238
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,860
I'll take care of it cleanly.

239
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,070
And you know...

240
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,610
your husband's DNA is
in my daughter, right?

241
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,850
She's a healthy child.

242
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,580
We'll probably get good results next week.

243
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,820
Yes?

244
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,820
(D-5)

245
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,240
(Would you like to refund your child?)

246
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,760
(Your child is defective.)

247
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,830
(We'll compensate you
with a perfect child.)

248
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,470
Yes, ma'am?

249
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,440
What is this? I received a letter.

250
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,250
It says my child is defective.
What does that mean?

251
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,320
Yes, ma'am.

252
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,850
You wanted to raise Do Hyun
into a baseball player, right?

253
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,390
Yes, that's right.

254
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,020
Unfortunately,

255
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,030
after a comprehensive analysis
of Do Hyun's genetic data,

256
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,630
physical development,
and athletic performance...

257
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,330
Why would you analyze that?

258
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,000
Ma'am, we see records of treatment...

259
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,370
for a shoulder injury recently.

260
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,300
Is that right?

261
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,440
No. That was just a minor sprain.

262
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,640
It wasn't serious at all.

263
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,310
He's going to Thailand
for training soon and...

264
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,420
Just what exactly is so defective
about Do Hyun?

265
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,660
Is that it?

266
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,690
I can't see anything.

267
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,550
Let me see.

268
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,190
How's it going there?

269
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,590
Same here.

270
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,030
What's the refund request rate?

271
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,860
It's 96 percent.

272
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,530
What's with the other four percent?

273
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,930
They've given no response yet.

274
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,770
Push them.

275
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,270
Share the non-refund list with me.

276
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,610
Let's wrap this up fast.
We need to move to the next stage.

277
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,040
Understood.

278
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,810
It's been less than a week,

279
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,850
so 96 percent isn't bad.

280
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,850
See? I told you.

281
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,450
Too attached to abandon the kid?

282
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,550
What a joke.

283
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,190
Jung Hyun.

284
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,800
When are you going to kill Ah Hyun?

285
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,670
You can't do it?

286
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,030
No, I can.

287
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,440
There's no time.

288
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,740
Yes.

289
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:36,430
What the...

290
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,220
That woman must die.

291
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,050
Shut up.

292
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,910
Tae Sik.

293
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,750
This is a team member's phone.

294
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,980
Are you hurt?

295
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,220
I'm okay.

296
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,260
(Refund Schedule)

297
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:19,830
D-Day?

298
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,770
It looks like the refund D-day.

299
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,180
But do refunds ever get initiated
by the organization first?

300
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,180
No way.

301
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,680
Refund requests always come from
the parents first, never the organization.

302
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,850
All of that costs money too, that's why.

303
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,450
But this isn't a refund request.

304
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,560
It says "Eligible for Refund."

305
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,530
(On Hold)

306
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,970
Lee Do Hyun.

307
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,930
Seo Eun Jo.

308
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,500
They're top-priority refund targets.

309
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,040
Then why are these two
still marked as "on hold?"

310
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,980
The parents were offered a refund,
but haven't made a decision yet.

311
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,310
Maybe...

312
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,880
some parents are a little different.

313
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,150
Like So Mi's mom.

314
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,530
(Unknown Sender)

315
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,670
(Your child is 98.5 percent defective.)

316
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,370
(Delete All)

317
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,380
People don't usually doubt delivery texts.

318
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,020
So I installed malware in the link.

319
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,620
The moment they click it,

320
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,960
their phone becomes mine.

321
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,500
Look.

322
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,230
Where they are now, where they're going,

323
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,800
who they're texting with,

324
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,200
who their family is,

325
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,770
what's happening to them.
I can see everything.

326
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,840
Well, the good news is...

327
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,080
Eun Jo's condition hasn't worsened
since the last time.

328
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,920
Thank you, Doctor.

329
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,550
About the treatment
I mentioned last time...

330
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,960
Well...

331
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,690
It's a newly developed drug...

332
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,690
and not covered by insurance in Korea.

333
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,960
I know the cost is high,

334
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,800
but it's the best option right now.

335
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,130
And in Eun Jo's case,

336
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,970
the disease is progressing faster
than expected.

337
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,910
There's not much time.

338
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,580
Is there really no other way?

339
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:49,150
Occasionally, institutions
or individuals make donations,

340
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:53,150
but those are assigned in order of need
starting with low-income patients.

341
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,920
But how...

342
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,430
How can one injection cost
over one million dollars?

343
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:03,900
Sir.

344
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Still, for Eun Jo's sake,

345
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,740
please think it over one more time.

346
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:22,150
Today, we have a special mother
and child guest.

347
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,220
Baseball fans might recognize him.

348
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,190
He's already been featured in the media...

349
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,420
for his pro-level skills.

350
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,330
This is Lee Do Hyun.

351
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,470
Sadly, we now have to call him
a former player.

352
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,700
Due to a serious injury,

353
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,100
he gave up his dream
of becoming a pitcher...

354
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,640
and is now seeking a new dream.

355
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,340
Please tell us what happened.

356
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,320
Do Hyun.

357
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,680
Are you okay?

358
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,090
Do Hyun, are you okay?

359
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,650
I told you not to push yourself.
Stay still.

360
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,020
Do Hyun.

361
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,460
I told you not to overdo it.

362
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,730
I don't know what to say, ma'am.

363
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,540
You've been through a lot, Coach.

364
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,840
Yes, and so have you, ma'am.

365
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,870
Right now,

366
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:49,970
more than regret over giving up his dream,

367
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,770
I think Do Hyun feels more guilt
and sorrow for his mother.

368
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,210
That's the kind of loving kid he is.

369
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,280
Yes, that's true.

370
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,410
And this is all you have to do
as a mother.

371
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,480
Show him enough love so he feels it.

372
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,190
Express it.

373
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,220
And support his new dream.

374
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,320
You love him very much, right?

375
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,160
Yes.

376
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,230
Do you want to say it out loud?

377
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,960
I love you, my son.

378
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Say it.

379
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,900
My son,

380
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,240
I love you.

381
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,080
I sounded so awkward.

382
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,380
- I did too.
- I know, right?

383
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,950
You two did great.

384
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,590
Thank you so much
for inviting us today, Doctor.

385
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,490
I really feel like we were healed here.

386
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,990
Thank you so much.

387
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,390
Do Hyun, would you step outside
for a while? I want to talk to your mom.

388
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,390
Okay.

389
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,000
Wait outside.

390
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,340
Ma'am, it's been tough, hasn't it?

391
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,640
You struggled for a long time
trying to have a child.

392
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,180
And you've raised him so wonderfully.

393
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,580
It's not even your own blood,

394
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,550
but you raised him so well.
You're amazing.

395
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,190
I know how much you've struggled.

396
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,590
You raised him so well.

397
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,130
But the problem is the genetics.

398
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,460
I ran a few more tests,

399
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,970
and Do Hyun's genes weren't good.

400
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,270
He was never meant to be an athlete.

401
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,740
Doctor, what do you mean...

402
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,580
If I raise my voice here,

403
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,090
everyone outside,
including Do Hyun, will hear.

404
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,090
If you don't want that, just listen.

405
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,930
Honestly, isn't it such a waste?
All that money and time spent?

406
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,700
And now you want
to support his new dream?

407
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,670
That's nonsense.

408
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,270
You invested a large amount of money,

409
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,410
but the child didn't deliver.

410
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:09,210
Why should you take the loss?

411
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,150
You did your best.

412
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,180
Now go ahead and request a refund.

413
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,300
(Would you like to refund your child?)

414
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,040
(3 days left until final refund deadline)

415
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,150
Yes?

416
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,650
Is there only one left now?

417
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,150
(D-2)

418
00:29:58,830 --> 00:29:59,860
Stay here a moment.

419
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,330
Hello.

420
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,870
Hello.

421
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,170
Please sit down.

422
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,940
How are you here?

423
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,240
You look surprised.

424
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,680
I was asked...

425
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,410
to speak with you, so I came.

426
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,780
Then is the doctor in charge today...

427
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,290
Yes, that's me.

428
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,550
You must be struggling.

429
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,660
It's so hard when a child is sick.

430
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,830
You received the invitation, right, ma'am?

431
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,960
I can only imagine
how hard it's been emotionally.

432
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,270
Maybe not as hard as for a sick child.

433
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,670
Eun Jo must be going through a lot too.

434
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,010
What are you talking about?

435
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,340
But ma'am,

436
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,510
why haven't you given her the injection?

437
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,520
If you really wanted to save her,

438
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,420
you should've found a way to get
the money and given her the injection.

439
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,220
It's not like you're that poor.

440
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,730
That's the limit.

441
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,360
Love that hesitates
at one million dollars.

442
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,370
You should stop now
and request the refund.

443
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,770
We'll give you a perfect child
until you're satisfied.

444
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,840
A new Eun Jo. If not her, the next Eun Jo.

445
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,880
If not, then the next.

446
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,180
You just keep raising them...

447
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,110
like you always have.

448
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,050
To this woman, people are just products.

449
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,590
Products that are replaceable
if they don't like them.

450
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,180
Mom.

451
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,380
Yes?

452
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,250
You hate me, don't you?

453
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,980
What?

454
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,780
Well,

455
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,190
other kids are good at studying...

456
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,760
and do cute things.

457
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,490
But I've never done anything for you, Mom.

458
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,900
What are you saying?

459
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,970
I never do anything cute,

460
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,440
and I only make you suffer.

461
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,210
Tell me if you need to go to the bathroom.

462
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,080
You drank a lot of water earlier.

463
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,050
Sorry.

464
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,050
Mom.

465
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,520
Stop talking nonsense and go to sleep.

466
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,410
Are you okay?

467
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:08,780
Yes.

468
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,490
Honey.

469
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,820
You got that text too, right?

470
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,990
That invitation.

471
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,730
Why do you care about stuff like that?

472
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,570
No, I just...

473
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,230
Don't mention that ever again.

474
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,840
I deleted that text as soon as I got it.

475
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,370
You delete it too. Right now.

476
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,480
Okay, I will.

477
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,160

478
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:57,000
(Your child is defective.)

479
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,930
(Hurry and submit your refund request.)

480
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,970

(D-1)

485
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,350
You're Eun Jo's mother, right?

486
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,710
Yes.

487
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,520
Can we talk inside for a bit?

488
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:04,030
You considered refunding Eun Jo,
didn't you?

489
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,170
Did you really not know...

490
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,910
that this is what happens
if Eun Jo is refunded?

491
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,510
I didn't know...

492
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,040
that they'd do something this cruel...

493
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,850
to the children.

494
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,320
If I had known,

495
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,820
how could I do that to Eun Jo?

496
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,390
If it weren't for him,

497
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,360
I'd already be dead.

498
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,460
I met a good adult,

499
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,560
and that's why I'm alive now.

500
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,700
So Eun Jo and the others...

501
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,630
can keep on living too,

502
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,470
please help us.

503
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:40,890
(D-day)

504
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,830
Are you ready to meet the kids?

505
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,100
Yes.

506
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,400
Good, let's wipe them all out.

507
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,200
Do Hyun, give me your phone.

508
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,860
My phone?

509
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,100
They say it's the rule
in the camp. No phones.

510
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,540
Okay. Here.

511
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
Thanks.

512
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,480
Listen carefully.

513
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,750
What's more important
than revenge is you guys.

514
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,350
Don't get hurt, no matter what.

515
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,560
Don't worry. We can do this.

516
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,230
Ah Hyun, I'm counting on you.

517
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,530
Yes.

518
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,700
Si Woo, you stay safe too.

519
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,430
Okay.

520
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,070
Let's go.

521
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,540
Yes.
Let's go.

00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,430
Dr. Kim Se Hee is really
such a kind person.

524
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,430
She even invited us to this event.

525
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,040
Right? It looks really fun, doesn't it?

526
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,610
Yes.

Let's go.

533
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,470
Okay.

534
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,570
Are all the kids here?

535
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,840
Except for one.

536
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,680
Mom.

537
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,460
- Mom.
- Yes?

538
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,300
Wait for me.

539
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,170
It would've been better
if Dad came with us.

540
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,370
But I don't like him.

541
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,340
I'm so happy I came with you, Mom.

542
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,820
Se Hee, what are you going to make for me?

543
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,350
Curry, your favorite.

544
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,920
That sounds delicious.

545
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,790
I'll go get something from the car.

546
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,530
Make the curry while I do that.

547
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:34,790
Okay.

548
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,230

thank you for waiting.

557
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:29,570
We'll now begin the game.

558
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,310
The survival game begins now.

559
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,180
Mom.

560
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:46,250
Mom.

561
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,690
The rules are simple.

562
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,790
Don't die. Just survive.

563
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,730
If you get shot, you die.

564
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,960
Dad.

565
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,300
- As you run and hide from the guns,
- Lift your gun.

566
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,570
- you'll come to realize...
- Mom.

567
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,300
- Mom.
- that surviving isn't...

568
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:02,940
easy at all.

569
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,840
Right, and one more rule.

570
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,640
No matter what,
you must never call "Mom" or "Dad."

571
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:15,520
If you do, you die immediately.

572
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,320
Now, let the game begin.

573
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:19,790
- No.
- Ready.

574
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,620
Set. Go.

575
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:28,090
What are you doing?

576
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:29,300
Are you insane?

577
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,840
(The Defects,
Epilogue)

578
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,740
(Miju Orphanage)

579
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:55,890
Congratulations.
I heard you got another scholarship.

580
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,830
Genius kids are different.
Are you born gifted?

581
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:01,460
So what? Trash blood is still trash.

582
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,830
Don't say that.

583
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,270
It's good blood if it wins scholarships.

584
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,700
Let's go.

585
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:09,800
We should celebrate...

586
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,340
since she's getting another scholarship.

587
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,510
Let's go.

588
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:14,470
Move.

589
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,550
- Hurry up.
- Keep walking.

590
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:20,050
Guys, kick her.

591
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,810
Damn it.

592
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:22,720
She stinks.

593
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,780
How gross.

594
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,750
Enough.

595
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,020
We should still give her a gift.

596
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,260
Let's just end this.

597
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,370
(I love you, Mom.)

598
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,590
(Special thanks
to Hwang Seog Jeong for her appearance)

599
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,620
(The Defects)

600
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,660
Now we're all on the same boat.

601
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:15,760
I'm going to kill...

602
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,960
my own child today too.

603
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,530
We have to find Kim Se Hee.

604
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,270
We must stop this
before the refunds begin.

605
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,940
How dare she deceive me and my husband!

606
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,440
She's a total lunatic.

607
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,540
Woo Tae Sik.

608
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:27,910
Tae Sik!

609
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:30,010
Uncle, that's enough now.

610
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:33,710
Director, you can abandon me now.

611
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,550
Get Kim Ah Hyun.

612
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,820
You said all a child needs is love.

613
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,650
Then why didn't you give that to me?

614
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,160
There are mothers like me in this world...

615
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,820
and daughters like you...

616
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,430
who get killed by mothers like me.

617
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,600
