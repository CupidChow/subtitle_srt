Yum Jung-ah

00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:13,500
Won Jin-ah

3
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,792
Choi Young-joon

4
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:21,876
Kim Jin-young

5
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:31,999
The Defects

6
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:42,999
Han Yoo-na

7
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:54,000
- Next is Han Yoo-na.
- Okay.

8
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:23,334
Judge Yoo Hyung-rae

9
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,667
You have passed the audition.

10
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:26,999
Really?

11
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:27,999
Let go!

12
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:30,292
- You can't go in!
- Let go of me!

13
00:01:30,876 --> 00:01:32,334
- Mom?
- Han Yoo-na!

14
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,459
Come here, right now!

15
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:34,792
Just a second...

16
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:38,584
- We're going!
- No, not like this!

17
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:39,999
- Wait...
- Come on!

18
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,918
You can't do this!

19
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:50,209
It's over...

20
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:54,209
Why?

21
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,667
Did your mother ruin it again?

22
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:02,042
I worked so hard for that audition...
Why, Mom?

23
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,626
When is your mother coming back?

24
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,999
I don't know!
She's so annoying!

25
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:29,876
Yoo-na, you need to control
your breathing when you're angry.

26
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:34,584
Now, take a deep breath.

27
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:40,999
Can you lie down for me?

28
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:43,959
Are you hypnotizing again?

29
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,959
It's not hypnosis, it's therapy.

30
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,999
I don't really think it works though.

31
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:02,167
Just breathe slowly...

32
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,250
Good.

33
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:16,999
Breathe out gently,

34
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:21,083
and let all the frustration and anger

35
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:25,417
inside of you dismantle itself.

36
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:33,000
Yoo-na.

37
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:37,000
Were you upset because your mother
kept forcing you to study?

38
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:38,709
Yeah...

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,042
She doesn't understand you.

40
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:45,834
She doesn't know
what you really want.

41
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:47,584
Yeah, that's right.

42
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:51,250
How do you want Daddy to treat you?

43
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:56,209
I just want you to support me.

44
00:03:56,751 --> 00:04:00,459
I'll always cheer for you, Yoo-na.

45
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:04,584
Thanks, Daddy.

46
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:07,999
I'm the only one you've got, right?

47
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,584
Yeah...

48
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,959
Now...

49
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,459
Call me 'babe'.

50
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:16,709
Huh?

51
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,417
Don't call me 'daddy'.

52
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:20,375
Call me 'babe'.

53
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:28,000
What's wrong...

54
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:31,209
Babe...

55
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,834
Easy as pie.

56
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:03,292
The Defects

57
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,542
The Defects
EP2. Quality Complaint

58
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,459
This just in.

59
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,999
A car crashed into a guardrail
and exploded on Yanghyeon Bridge

60
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:15,999
in Gyeonggi-do at around 1 a.m. today.

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,792
Luckily, there was little traffic
to cause any secondary accidents.

62
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:22,083
However, the driver of the crashed
vehicle wasn't found.

63
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,500
The authorities are suspecting
the driver

64
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:27,125
to have fallen off the bridge.

65
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:29,417
Sis...

66
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:32,999
Identifying the victim has been difficult
due to severe damage...

67
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,375
Tell me that's not him.

68
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,918
That's not our old man, right?

69
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,918
Police are considering
both suicide and accident...

70
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:47,375
Hey, hey! It's your fault!
It's all your fault!

71
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,959
The old man is gone because of you!

72
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,667
- Stop it!
- It's your fault!

73
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:54,125
Why did you call your mom?
Dumbass!

74
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,000
- Let go of me!
- I said, stop!

75
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:58,834
The old man is gone because of you!

76
00:06:01,792 --> 00:06:05,709
None of us here are at fault.

77
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,876
Is anyone there?

78
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,250
We're here to share the good news.

79
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,667
Is anyone inside?

80
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:32,751
Choi Si-woo?

81
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:35,918
Si-woo, are you in there?

82
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:38,999
Your mom's looking for you.

83
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:43,999
She said she's really sorry.

84
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:47,500
She said she misses you so much.

85
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,626
Si-woo, don't.

86
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:57,834
Don't do it.

87
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:09,083
I don't think anyone's here.

88
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,999
Where the hell did that brat go?

89
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:28,999
Pack everything up.

90
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:43,751
It's okay.

91
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:54,999
Han Yoo-na

92
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,500
What about you?

93
00:08:04,042 --> 00:08:05,375
I have something to do.

94
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,999
When it's all done,

95
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,751
then I'll come right after you.

96
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:12,792
Can't we just go together?

97
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,542
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:17,334
I feel like
I'm asking too much of you.

99
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,999
Final target, 'the Monster'.
The Alpha and omega of everything.

100
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:35,999
Maybe I knew it all along.

101
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:40,792
Like this.
Fill it to the top.

102
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:50,375
- Good job.
- Thanks.

103
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,375
Let's go grab a drink.

104
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,417
They said it was disposing of waste.

105
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:57,500
That I'd make
a lot of money doing it.

106
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:59,792
It was a simple job.

107
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:02,834
Too simple to wonder
why it paid so much.

108
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:07,667
Yeah... I knew.

109
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,999
I knew from the very start.

110
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,709
Please save me.

111
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,999
- I don't want to die...
- That I was disposing of people.

112
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,999
The day I first met you, Ah-hyeon...

113
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,876
I saw all the kids
I had killed through your eyes.

114
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:24,125
Mister, please save me.

115
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,999
I ended up saving you and the others

116
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:30,209
to make up for my guilt.

117
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,334
Bathhouse

118
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,083
Is this our home?

119
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:39,250
Come on, get in.

120
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:42,999
It's okay.

121
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:44,999
It's okay, you're safe now.

122
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:47,209
But no matter how many I saved,

123
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,417
I'll always be a disgusting murderer.

124
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,292
So I don't want any of you...

125
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:54,584
Save me, please!

126
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:56,626
...to feel pity for me,

127
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,584
or miss me when I'm gone.

128
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:00,250
I don't want to die.

129
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,792
Because I'm not worthy.

130
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,999
Final target, 'the Monster'.
The Alpha and omega of everything.

131
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:34,209
Kim Ah-hyeon

132
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,834
I agree to annul the adoption
of Kwon Sung-woo

133
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:05,751
from 18 years ago,
and to discard him.

134
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:08,417
The reason is 'defective product'.

135
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:11,417
Damn it,
this is an annoying procedure.

136
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:16,626
I, Yoon Se-hoon, agree to annul
the adoption of Yoon Ji-seok

137
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,042
from 17 years ago,
and to discard him.

138
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,292
The reason is 'defective product'.

139
00:12:21,918 --> 00:12:23,083
You say it too, honey.

140
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,792
I agree. Amen.

141
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:31,417
I, Han Chul-soo,

142
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:35,375
agree to annul the adoption
of Han Yoo-na

143
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:40,584
from 17 years ago,
and to discard her.

144
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,834
The reason is... I thought she was
a quiet girl, but she's not.

145
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:52,792
Final target, 'the Monster'.
The Alpha and omega of everything.

146
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,167
Refund request for Han Yoo-na

147
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:10,999
Express Line, Wednesday 1 a.m.,
Incheon Port

148
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:17,459
We demand lawmaker Kwon Kang-man
to repeal the Special Law!

149
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,375
Mr. Kwon Kang-man,
how could you cancel our meeting?

150
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:23,626
Hello...?

151
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,999
Uh... My apologies, ma'am.

152
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:32,999
He promised he'd come today,

153
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:36,209
but he used the protest
as an excuse to cancel.

154
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,999
We'll meet when the time is right.

155
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:43,292
Sincere apologies.
I'll set another date without fail.

156
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:46,542
Pastor, I know you're busy.
Thank you so much.

157
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,876
No, it's my honor.

158
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,999
I heard from the Lady.

159
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,626
We agreed to meet at the church.

160
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:54,999
Is that so?

161
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,876
Congratulations, Madam CEO!

162
00:13:57,334 --> 00:13:58,667
Let's head out.

163
00:13:58,709 --> 00:13:59,876
Safe trip.

164
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,999
Fucking hell...

165
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:19,334
Where could the driver have gone?

166
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,500
He must be nearby...

167
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:35,626
Do the forensics.

168
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,417
- Yes, sir.
- Hurry.

169
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:54,999
Tell me.

170
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:57,999
Wait.

171
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:43,042
We already checked this place.

172
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:44,999
It’s set for demolition,
so no one's here.

173
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:47,626
Are you sure?

174
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,042
Yes.

175
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,292
Those kids shouldn't even exist.

176
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:54,209
Where would they go?

177
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:57,999
To a place where no one exists.

178
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,667
Listen carefully.

179
00:16:15,999 --> 00:16:17,459
Once we leave here,

180
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,959
we have to put everything behind.

181
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:23,334
Sis, what about our old man?

182
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,250
Is he really dead?

183
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:31,834
Guys...

184
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:34,667
Do you know what he
really wanted for us?

185
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:40,751
Unauthorized outing.

186
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:45,584
We don't have to live
in hiding anymore.

187
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:48,000
We're going somewhere
where nobody knows us.

188
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,876
There, we can go out
whenever we want.

189
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:56,959
We can go swimming,
eat yummy food...

190
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,417
Are you okay?

191
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,000
- What the hell?
- Are you okay?

192
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:05,500
Demolition ready.

193
00:17:10,626 --> 00:17:12,999
- We need to leave!
- Take him and go, hurry!

194
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,042
Hurry! Hurry!

195
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:29,209
This way! Over here!

196
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,542
Bathhouse

197
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:39,999
Do it.

198
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,999
- Let's go in!
- Yes, sir!

199
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:52,667
Open up!

200
00:17:57,918 --> 00:17:58,959
Hurry up!

201
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:05,999
Are you okay?

202
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:07,999
What do we do now?

203
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:16,292
Let's find another exit!
Follow me!

204
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:25,792
Hey!

205
00:18:27,334 --> 00:18:28,584
Move aside.

206
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:29,626
Get back.

207
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:31,999
Hurry!

208
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:35,542
- Let's go!
- Come on!

209
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:42,834
Watch your steps, be careful.

210
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:44,500
Be careful, let's move.

211
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,000
Find them quickly!

212
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,584
Where the hell are they?

213
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,999
Go, hurry!

214
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:02,792
Move!

215
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:14,542
Faster!

216
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:16,999
Quickly!

217
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,584
- Si-woo!
- Are you okay?

218
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:25,876
I'll take Si-woo!

219
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,125
Oh, no...

220
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,209
There they are!

221
00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:40,584
Go on ahead!

222
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,000
Pull it up!

223
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:53,626
Search quickly!

224
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,250
- Check in there.
- You go down.

225
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:08,500
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

226
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,042
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

227
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,542
Hang in there, Si-woo!

228
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:17,667
Go in.

229
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,250
We meet at last, Madam Lady.

230
00:21:59,876 --> 00:22:02,542
I heard you needed me.

231
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,042
So you've arrived.

232
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:12,918
I’ve been wanting to meet you.

233
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,334
The Lord...

234
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:20,792
...has advised me
to meet you, sister.

235
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,334
I see.

236
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:26,667
My husband...

237
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,000
He's a perfect man.

238
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:33,500
I'm his only fault.

239
00:22:35,999 --> 00:22:38,709
My womb is unable to bear a child.

240
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:44,459
Please don't say that.

241
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,167
I'm here to help you.

242
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,751
I want to give him
a child worthy of him.

243
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,209
A perfect child.

244
00:23:06,042 --> 00:23:08,042
Si-woo didn't come to school again.

245
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,334
My mom said he got admitted
to a mental hospital.

246
00:23:12,375 --> 00:23:13,334
Really?

247
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,999
But I heard he went missing.

248
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,999
Apparently, his mom made that up.

249
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:20,459
My mom saw her laughing
and chatting at a cafe.

250
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,000
No way.

251
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:24,042
How could she do that
when her son's missing?

252
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:27,584
Exactly. That's why
he's not really missing.

253
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,792
Choi Si-woo

254
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:36,999
Hey, honey!

255
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:37,999
Mom!

256
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:42,834
Good to see you.

257
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:44,999
Let's go.

258
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Honey?

259
00:23:57,999 --> 00:23:58,999
Yes?

260
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:00,375
What have I told you?

261
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:04,334
You must always focus on
how you're portrayed outside.

262
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:07,959
Sorry.

263
00:24:07,999 --> 00:24:09,667
Whose daughter are you?

264
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:10,999
Yours.

265
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,999
- Who do you take after?
- You, Mom.

266
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:18,167
That means you must
shine bright wherever you are.

267
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,292
Yes, just like you.

268
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:24,125
Honey!

269
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:29,999
You know, I'm so happy today.
I feel like I could fly.

270
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:33,834
My dream is about to come true.

271
00:24:34,334 --> 00:24:35,667
Honey.

272
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:38,584
- Wanna hear my childhood story?
- Yes!

273
00:24:39,876 --> 00:24:42,334
When I was a student in school,

274
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:45,375
I thought I'd die
if I didn't get first place.

275
00:24:47,209 --> 00:24:48,834
And look at me now.

276
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:52,375
- I didn't die, right?
- Right!

277
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,959
Nobody dies because of grades.

278
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:03,709
It's because I never missed
the first-place spot.

279
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:06,999
That's why I didn't die.

280
00:25:11,918 --> 00:25:13,417
Just kidding!

281
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:27,167
Uncle!

282
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:30,999
Hey, welcome.

283
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:34,792
Did you eat?

284
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:36,626
What about you?

285
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:41,626
Stop eating that.

286
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:45,083
Keep it a secret for me.

287
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:51,417
Sheesh, what happened?

288
00:25:51,792 --> 00:25:54,083
Too much exercise isn't good for you.

289
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,042
Whatever you do,
overdoing it will get you hurt.

290
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,999
You have to overdo it to win.

291
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,292
But Uncle...

292
00:26:09,751 --> 00:26:10,999
Mom is kinda...

293
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:15,999
Never mind.

294
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,459
Actually...

295
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,999
Remember when I told you?

296
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:22,500
My best friend from class...

297
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,626
He hasn't been coming to school lately.

298
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:31,167
So?

299
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:36,250
You know,
there are all kinds of rumors...

300
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:39,959
Some say he's in a mental hospital.

301
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:42,709
Others say he's gone missing.

302
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:47,999
He should be fine, right?

303
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:50,834
Go on.

304
00:26:51,334 --> 00:26:52,999
It's almost dinner time.

305
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:10,959
Let's go.

306
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,083
Why aren't you coming?

307
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:34,999
Isn't this place nice?

308
00:27:40,209 --> 00:27:41,334
Someday...

309
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:44,999
I don't know when,
but someday...

310
00:27:50,918 --> 00:27:51,999
Let's come back here.

311
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:03,584
Yeah, we'll come back.
Promise.

312
00:28:03,626 --> 00:28:04,626
Here.

313
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:06,292
Pinky promise.

314
00:28:06,334 --> 00:28:08,584
No, not shake hands.
Do the pinky promise!

315
00:28:08,626 --> 00:28:09,667
Do it!

316
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:17,375
Topmeri Sushi Restaurant

317
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:26,125
What do we do?

318
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:29,125
Sis, is there no one inside?

319
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:34,584
Do we just keep standing here?

320
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:35,626
Huh?

321
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:41,459
Express line?

322
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:46,626
What about Tae-sik?

323
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,876
Come inside, come in.

324
00:29:16,459 --> 00:29:18,000
It must've been tough

325
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,626
to come all the way here.

326
00:29:23,375 --> 00:29:24,500
Here.

327
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:30,542
We can't...

328
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:35,125
It's gonna be rough.
You'll need the money.

329
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:39,334
It includes Tae-sik’s share,
so don't refuse.

330
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:12,375
Take good care of the kids.

331
00:30:12,417 --> 00:30:13,500
And be careful.

332
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,042
This way, here.

333
00:30:29,209 --> 00:30:30,542
Move.

334
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:31,709
Inside!

335
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,292
Excuse me?
Is this the right place?

336
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,417
Sis! Sis! Sis!

337
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,542
Sis...

338
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,042
Run... Run for it!

339
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,209
Split up.

340
00:31:52,709 --> 00:31:54,375
- You two, go that way.
- Yes, sir.

341
00:32:02,876 --> 00:32:03,959
Are you okay?

342
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:06,500
Let's move!

343
00:32:20,167 --> 00:32:21,375
Where did they go?

344
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:26,542
- So-mi.
- Yeah?

345
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:28,417
- Stall them for a minute.
- Why?

346
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:35,250
Okay.

347
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,542
Hey!

348
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,999
There they are!

349
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:49,500
Joo-an! Joo-an! Joo-an!

350
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:51,999
Wait!

351
00:32:51,999 --> 00:32:53,083
Wait, wait!

352
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:54,834
Let me say one thing
before I die.

353
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:56,918
Look beside you.

354
00:32:58,375 --> 00:32:58,999
Why?

355
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:04,000
Hurry, let's go!

356
00:33:27,334 --> 00:33:29,000
You're all defective products.

357
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:32,626
You don't deserve to live.

358
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,250
Sis!

359
00:34:27,459 --> 00:34:28,959
I, Kwon Kang-man,

360
00:34:28,999 --> 00:34:30,999
agree to annul the adoption
of Kwon Sung-woo

361
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:33,999
from 18 years ago,
and to discard him.

362
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:36,999
The reason is 'defective product'.

363
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:40,042
Damn it, this is an annoying procedure.

364
00:34:40,999 --> 00:34:43,250
I agree to annul the adoption
of Yoon Ji-seok

365
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:45,751
from 17 years ago,
and to discard him.

366
00:34:45,999 --> 00:34:47,000
You say it too, honey.

367
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:48,500
I agree.

368
00:34:51,999 --> 00:34:54,000
I, Han Chul-soo,

369
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,999
agree to annul the adoption
of Han Yoo-na

370
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:02,459
from 17 years ago,
and to discard her.

371
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:06,375
The reason is...

372
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,667
I thought...

373
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:19,959
...there'd be at least one
decent reason.

374
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:22,959
Like, they couldn't afford
to raise us,

375
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:25,292
or maybe they just
couldn't form a bond.

376
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,667
But no.

377
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,876
We were just products to them.

378
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:32,000
Something they bought,

379
00:35:32,459 --> 00:35:34,667
that may be disposed of whenever.

380
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,542
Just products.

381
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:39,500
Products?

382
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:41,999
We were...

383
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:44,999
...products to them?

384
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:50,459
I'll kill them.

385
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,292
I'll kill every last one of them.

386
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:56,959
I need to know.

387
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:00,626
Why the people who once
called themselves our parents

388
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:02,999
are trying so hard to kill us.

389
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,375
Why we have to live in hiding.

390
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:08,792
Why they buy and sell
children like merchandise.

391
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,751
And...

392
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:14,876
The one our old man
couldn't find till the end.

393
00:36:15,709 --> 00:36:16,834
The monster.

394
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,542
I'm gonna find him.

395
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:27,459
This won't be easy.

396
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,626
Elite Private Adoption Business?

397
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:30,999
Hey...

398
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:32,834
VIP Membership

399
00:36:32,876 --> 00:36:33,999
Isn't this a business card?

400
00:36:36,417 --> 00:36:38,209
We can start off by finding this.

401
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,209
You're right.

402
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,209
But how do we find it?

403
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,209
I think I've seen it before.

404
00:36:58,334 --> 00:37:00,876
A School Full of Dreams and Love

405
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:02,999
- Hello.
- God bless you.

406
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:04,542
God bless you.

407
00:37:10,584 --> 00:37:13,000
Hello, God bless you.

408
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:16,751
Hello.

409
00:37:16,792 --> 00:37:19,375
Hello, God bless you.

410
00:37:19,999 --> 00:37:22,542
Hello, God bless you.

411
00:37:23,751 --> 00:37:26,709
Afterschool classes
will start next week.

412
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:28,542
Yes, go ahead.

413
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:31,999
Post the job opening
for assistant teachers right away.

414
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:32,999
Okay.

415
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,999
Yes, come in.

416
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:00,292
Mr. Principal,

417
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:02,959
you have to come
to the staff dinner tonight.

418
00:38:04,292 --> 00:38:06,959
Oh, was it today?

419
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:10,000
If I go, the other teachers
might feel uncomfortable.

420
00:38:10,042 --> 00:38:12,167
No, not at all.

421
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:15,584
Everyone always waits for you.

422
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:20,334
Unfortunately,
I already have plans tonight.

423
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:24,834
Even if you stop by for a bit,

424
00:38:24,876 --> 00:38:28,292
it would mean a lot
to the teachers.

425
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:32,999
Then I'll try to make time.

426
00:38:32,999 --> 00:38:35,167
Thank you so much, Mr. Principal!

427
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:49,834
Just breathe slowly...

428
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:53,667
What's wrong...

429
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,999
Yoo-na, I'm so sorry.

430
00:38:57,999 --> 00:38:58,918
Can you come out for a second?

431
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,584
Yoo-na, I'm so sorry.
Can you come out for a second?

432
00:39:01,918 --> 00:39:02,999
Mom?

433
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:27,459
- Joo-an, can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.

434
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:41,999
He got in the car.

435
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:46,000
I'm trailing him.

436
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:48,999
Let's go.

437
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:10,334
Go ahead.

438
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,999
- No, it's okay.
- Why'd you turn it off?

439
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,999
Heard you're headed somewhere nice.

440
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:21,999
What?

441
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:26,000
Will you be accompanying...?

442
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:27,999
No, how could I dare?

443
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:32,083
I didn't know you smoked,
Mr. Principal.

444
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:33,417
Only once in a while.

445
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,999
Heading somewhere else nice?

446
00:40:35,999 --> 00:40:37,999
- Excuse me?
- No, nothing like that.

447
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:40,375
Well then,
have a good night.

448
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:42,334
Good night!

449
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:44,292
You too.

450
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:45,292
Here I go.

451
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,250
Do you need a driving service?

452
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:09,292
Let's go.

453
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:32,667
You look young, Miss.

454
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:37,334
I have a license, don't worry.

455
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:38,999
How old are you?

456
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,542
Why are you asking?

457
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:47,918
Just curious.

458
00:42:12,751 --> 00:42:13,792
We're here.

459
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:23,999
Massage Service 24/7

460
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,626
Excuse me.

461
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,999
Can I see your license?

462
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:30,876
What?

463
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:33,999
How old are you?

464
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:37,125
Just wondering, nothing serious.

465
00:42:38,375 --> 00:42:39,999
Why do you keep asking?

466
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:41,626
You look so young.

467
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,709
Maybe... around twenty?

468
00:42:45,334 --> 00:42:46,375
Twenty-one?

469
00:42:46,959 --> 00:42:49,584
You just got out
of high school, right?

470
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:51,999
What are you trying to say?

471
00:43:01,918 --> 00:43:03,751
They haven't moved away.

472
00:43:13,876 --> 00:43:16,334
Want to come up for some coffee?

473
00:43:17,709 --> 00:43:20,709
Don't worry, I live alone.

474
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:26,918
I don't drink coffee.

475
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:33,542
But I am in need of some money.

476
00:43:34,999 --> 00:43:36,999
I do whatever I can for cash.

477
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:38,792
Wow.

478
00:43:39,792 --> 00:43:42,209
You look even younger
without the cap.

479
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:47,083
I love girls
who look young like you.

480
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,667
Even better if they're actual kids.

481
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:54,042
But you know what's even better?

482
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:57,292
When those kids say
they need money.

483
00:43:57,334 --> 00:43:58,918
That's the best.

484
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,626
Yeah, money is good.

485
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:09,042
But I know someone
you might like even more.

486
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:12,292
Younger,
and more baby-faced.

487
00:44:15,626 --> 00:44:17,542
But she's underaged.

488
00:44:18,209 --> 00:44:19,709
That's a little much, right?

489
00:44:19,751 --> 00:44:21,876
No, no, it's fine.

490
00:44:21,918 --> 00:44:22,999
I'd love that!

491
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,292
How old is she?

492
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:28,167
17?

493
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:32,584
Should I call her over?

494
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:35,083
Yeah, call her!
Call her, call her!

495
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:45,209
Where's Joo-an?

496
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,125
Joo-an...

497
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,667
You sure you'll be okay?

498
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:57,250
Yeah.

499
00:45:02,999 --> 00:45:05,334
- What about Si-woo?
- He's asleep.

500
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,209
Let's go.

501
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:15,834
Joo-an.

502
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:18,751
Be careful.

503
00:45:19,459 --> 00:45:20,417
Don't worry.

504
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:22,334
I'm going in.

505
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:04,999
Come in.

506
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:09,125
Client Han Chul-soo's house is clear.

507
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:11,542
Client Kwon Kang-man's house is clear.

508
00:46:11,584 --> 00:46:14,042
Heading towards
client Choi Hyun-kyu's house next.

509
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:31,918
Why don't you take off that scarf?

510
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:34,250
Are you cold?

511
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,999
You're pretty shy, huh?

512
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:43,375
Are you really a high schooler?

513
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,834
Freshman?

514
00:46:45,876 --> 00:46:46,751
Sophomore?

515
00:46:47,999 --> 00:46:50,999
Why's your makeup so heavy?

516
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:53,000
Wanna shower with me, babe?

517
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,209
Kidding.

518
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:09,000
Stay still, stay still.

519
00:47:21,834 --> 00:47:23,626
Did you say babe?

520
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:27,584
Fuck you, disgusting pervert!
Piece of shit!

521
00:47:27,626 --> 00:47:30,667
Who the hell are you?
What are you?

522
00:47:31,459 --> 00:47:32,999
You sick bastard!

523
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:35,999
On your knees.

524
00:47:35,999 --> 00:47:37,999
Yoo... Yoo-na?

525
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,709
Get on your knees, asshole!

526
00:47:48,876 --> 00:47:50,626
I'll keep watch outside.

527
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:52,167
Make it fast.

528
00:48:00,626 --> 00:48:02,042
Where's your membership card?

529
00:48:04,584 --> 00:48:05,999
What are you talking about?

530
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:09,667
I said, where's your membership card?

531
00:48:10,042 --> 00:48:14,292
I... I really don't know.
I swear!

532
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:18,125
Where's Lim Kyung-mi?

533
00:48:18,626 --> 00:48:20,000
Where the hell is she?

534
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,626
Yoo-na... Yoo-na...

535
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:25,792
Fuck...

536
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:29,792
Stop fucking calling me that!

537
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:33,000
Breathe...
Take a deep breath...

538
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:40,709
Yoo-na.

539
00:48:41,459 --> 00:48:44,292
Breathe when you're angry,
remember?

540
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,209
Okay, slowly.

541
00:48:53,999 --> 00:48:55,417
Good job.

542
00:48:56,042 --> 00:48:58,250
Well done, my Yoo-na.

543
00:49:01,999 --> 00:49:03,626
You piece of trash.

544
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:06,417
Did you think
I'd fall for that again?

545
00:49:06,459 --> 00:49:07,792
Where's Lim Kyung-mi?

546
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:10,417
Where's Lim Kyung-mi?

547
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:12,626
Where the hell is she?

548
00:49:12,667 --> 00:49:14,751
She went to her parents' place!

549
00:49:15,042 --> 00:49:17,000
Are you telling me
she left the house in this state?

550
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:20,834
I've never seen her
leave the house so long.

551
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:26,626
You better tell me properly.

552
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:28,751
Or I'll send all the photos
on your phone

553
00:49:28,792 --> 00:49:29,999
Or I'll send all the photos
on your phone

554
00:49:29,999 --> 00:49:31,667
to everyone you know.

555
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:32,834
Are you crazy?

556
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:37,417
You think you can
get away with this?

557
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:39,999
I'm in danger as it is.

558
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:41,876
And one more thing.

559
00:49:42,042 --> 00:49:43,542
Wow...

560
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:46,999
You look even younger
without the cap.

561
00:49:47,709 --> 00:49:50,709
I love girls who look young like you.

562
00:49:51,584 --> 00:49:55,042
Even better if they're actual kids.

563
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:59,209
But you know what's even better?

564
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:02,999
When those kids say
they need money.

565
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,292
That's the best.

566
00:50:04,999 --> 00:50:05,999
Hey!

567
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:16,167
I'll tell you where Lim Kyung-mi is!
At a psych hospital!

568
00:50:16,209 --> 00:50:17,999
I put her in a psych hospital!

569
00:50:18,459 --> 00:50:20,209
- What?
- She lost her mind!

570
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,792
She eventually went crazy!

571
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:23,918
Tell me everything clearly!

572
00:50:24,999 --> 00:50:28,999
Right after hearing you went missing,

573
00:50:29,876 --> 00:50:33,042
she traveled all over
the country to find you.

574
00:50:33,876 --> 00:50:34,999
And eventually...

575
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:36,626
...she went crazy.

576
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:37,999
It was me.

577
00:50:39,334 --> 00:50:40,334
What did you say?

578
00:50:41,209 --> 00:50:43,083
The one who refunded you...

579
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:45,667
...wasn't your mom.

580
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,667
It was me.

581
00:50:58,584 --> 00:51:00,999
Yoo-na, I'm so sorry.

582
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:02,417
Can you come out for a second?

583
00:51:02,999 --> 00:51:04,999
Yoo-na, I'm so sorry.
Can you come out for a second?

584
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:07,125
Mom...

585
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:23,584
Mom?

586
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:54,334
Delete

587
00:52:04,083 --> 00:52:06,209
So forgetful these days.

588
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,083
Your head is all over the place.

589
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:11,417
- Where's Yoo-na?
- She left a while ago.

590
00:52:11,459 --> 00:52:12,626
I'll be back soon.

591
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:14,999
Tell Yoo-na I'll be checking
her homework later.

592
00:52:15,584 --> 00:52:16,709
Got it.

593
00:52:16,751 --> 00:52:17,999
We can go now.

594
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,000
I didn't even know...

595
00:52:35,459 --> 00:52:36,999
I cursed Mom so much.

596
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,459
Tell me.

597
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,999
Tell me where Mom is.

598
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:43,834
Tell me!

599
00:52:43,876 --> 00:52:45,792
- So-mi, calm down.
- Tell me!

600
00:52:45,834 --> 00:52:47,167
Tell me, tell me!

601
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:48,709
You mustn't kill him!

602
00:52:48,751 --> 00:52:51,500
Tell me! Which hospital?

603
00:52:51,542 --> 00:52:53,751
- I'll kill you!
- Don't!

604
00:52:57,999 --> 00:53:01,918
Child Shopping - Epilogue

605
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:08,999
- Sweetheart.
- Yes?

606
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:10,999
Don't worry too much about Si-woo.

607
00:53:10,999 --> 00:53:12,292
He'll be just fine.

608
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:31,500
Kim Ah-hyeon

609
00:53:36,999 --> 00:53:40,999
Kim Ah-hyeon

610
00:54:06,626 --> 00:54:09,042
Thank you to actors Yoo Seung-mok and
Kim Soo-ro for their special appearance.

611
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:12,042
The Defects

612
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,459
How many are they?

613
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,542
Five in total.

614
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:15,876
Did you see her face?

615
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:17,999
I wonder if she looks like me.

616
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:19,375
I found it!

617
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:21,334
Go check Han Chul-soo's house.

618
00:54:21,375 --> 00:54:22,375
Get out of there.

619
00:54:22,876 --> 00:54:24,751
What were your parents like?

620
00:54:24,792 --> 00:54:27,709
Someone who wished
to shine the brightest.

621
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,999
I need collateral.

622
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:32,542
I have a favor to ask of you.

623
00:54:32,584 --> 00:54:33,709
Will you help me?

624
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:35,584
We should go find So-mi's mother.

625
00:54:35,626 --> 00:54:37,250
We don't even know
how to use that membership card.

626
00:54:37,292 --> 00:54:40,000
They'll be flooding the place.
Why go there?

627
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:41,999
So-mi's mother will know.

628
00:54:41,999 --> 00:54:44,792
Why do you keep struggling to survive?

629
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:45,999
Get caught, and you're dead.

630
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:47,500
Mom!

631
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:48,542
Like this!
