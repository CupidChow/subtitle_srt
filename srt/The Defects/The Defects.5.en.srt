00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,999
Yum Jung-ah

2
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:13,584
Won Jin-ah

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,876
Chou Young-jun

4
00:00:20,876 --> 00:00:21,959
Kim Jin-young

5
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:31,999
The Defects

6
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:51,500
Mom.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,999
Yes?

8
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:57,709
Why is my name Ah-hyena?

9
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:00,667
Because I said so.

10
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:07,209
Then what does my name mean?

11
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,876
'Ah' means 'me',
and 'hyena' means 'shine'.

12
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:15,167
So it means 'I will shine'?

13
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:23,876
No, it means you're the child
who'll make me shine.

14
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:31,083
Why did you come here, huh?

15
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,999
You should've died then.

16
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,999
How are you still alive?

17
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:44,709
Was I supposed to die?

18
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:47,584
What's the reason for you to live?

19
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,250
How could you, Mom...

20
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:54,999
How could you go that far?

21
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,459
'Mom'...?

22
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:00,918
What does that even mean?

23
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,167
Useless child.

24
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:10,876
The Defects
EPEE. Useful Child

25
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:14,000
The Bioethics Act,
aka the 'Eye Shopping Bill',

26
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:18,334
has recorded over
500,000 people opposing in petition.

27
00:02:18,375 --> 00:02:21,999
Opposition parties are now
actively protesting the bill.

28
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:24,999
So what is this bill exactly?

29
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:27,999
It's an inhumane law that has gotten
a lot of attention lately,

30
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:31,751
which is cloaked as
a scientific progress.

31
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:34,792
It ultimately legalizes
egg and sperm trading,

32
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:39,167
and allows for the genetic
and gender editing of fetuses.

33
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,792
You can't just call it inhumane.

34
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:45,834
According to research,
the bill could offer a breakthrough

35
00:02:45,876 --> 00:02:48,918
to Korea's plummeting birthrate crisis.

36
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,667
Which research are you referring to?

37
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,626
Even our president
insists on being child-free.

38
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:59,459
Korea is on the verge of extinction
with the fertility rate of below 0.6.

39
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,999
In this crisis, the Eye Shopping Bill...

40
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:07,167
Of course... I was wondering
when my story would be brought up.

41
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:11,167
Should you really be drinking?

42
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,999
I'd prefer if you didn't
before your sperm collection.

43
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:16,876
This much is fine.

44
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:19,584
No, it's not.

45
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:33,751
When should I start wearing
the prosthetic belly?

46
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,542
To make it look like I'm pregnant.

47
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:41,042
I should gain
some weight too, right?

48
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:45,792
How about quitting alcohol first?

49
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:48,667
I'm not the one getting pregnant.

50
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,292
The girl who's getting pregnant...

51
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:57,042
Is she really Kim Se-her’s
birth-daughter?

52
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,500
Yeah, we confirmed it.

53
00:03:59,876 --> 00:04:01,999
She's smart and a total prodigy.

54
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,584
Pretty like her mom too.

55
00:04:05,626 --> 00:04:08,999
Still, even if she's blinded by ambition...

56
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:12,250
How could she give up
her own daughter like that?

57
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,417
She's just a kid...

58
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:21,999
Honey, I'll relay what she said.

59
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:26,417
Madam Lady.

60
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:31,042
Do you know when Virgin Mary
gave birth to Jesus?

61
00:04:33,626 --> 00:04:35,500
She was fourteen.

62
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:40,042
Isn't this all God's miraculous plan?

63
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:48,459
Heavenly Father full of love,
have mercy on us...

64
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:54,000
Fine, I understand.

65
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,292
But honey...

66
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:07,375
Shouldn't we meet the girl
at least once?

67
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:18,417
Just hold on, it's not dangerous.
I swear it's not.

68
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:20,083
I'm sorry, Ah-hyena.

69
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,083
Just a little longer,
nothing will happen.

70
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:25,918
So-mi, can you take off the tape?

71
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,999
Yeah, right?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

72
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,999
What are you doing?
Who are you people?

73
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,999
Si-woo, what happened to you?

74
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:39,999
Listen, I'll explain everything.
So please... Please...

75
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:44,375
Please help us.

76
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,167
Our sister is trapped in there.

77
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:49,626
What?

78
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,083
Your mom is trying to kill our sister.

79
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,959
No, it must be a misunderstanding.

80
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:56,250
Our mom would never...

81
00:05:58,209 --> 00:06:00,375
No, she would never!

82
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:05,792
Hey, Ah-hyena is in danger.

83
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:07,918
And we really need your help.

84
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:09,834
We're going to trade you
for Ah-hyena.

85
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,584
Ah-hyena?

86
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,999
Who's that...?

87
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:27,626
I want to meet Ah-hyena in person.

88
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,999
Did you know?

89
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:33,292
The current Ah-hyena
is extremely useful.

90
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:48,999
Mom!

91
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Stay away!
I said, stay away!

92
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:53,500
What are you doing?

93
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:54,999
Let our sister go!

94
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:57,626
Mom...

95
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:00,209
Stay the hell away!

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,999
Mom...

97
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,542
I want to meet Ah-hyena in person.

98
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:11,292
Let her go.

99
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:18,500
- Ah-hyena...
- Ah-hyena!

100
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:22,999
Hey, are you okay?

101
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,042
You alright?

102
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,375
Oh, no... Ah-hyena...

103
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,834
Hurry!

104
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:36,999
Let's go.

105
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,417
You okay?
Did you get hurt?

106
00:07:58,542 --> 00:07:59,876
Mom...

107
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,125
Yes, my dear Ah-hyena.

108
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,709
My daughter, you're okay.

109
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,999
Ah-hyena! Ah-hyena?

110
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,459
- Take her.
- Yes.

111
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:28,500
Holy crap, are you okay?

112
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,125
Wake up, Ah-hyena!

113
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,459
Is she okay?

114
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,999
Hey, drive faster!

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,542
- Hurry up already!
- Ah-hyena...

116
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,459
Did you hear her?
She called me 'Mom'.

117
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:50,542
Pf ft, 'Mom'...

118
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,125
So sick of it.

119
00:08:52,626 --> 00:08:55,751
We'll find and
dispose of them immediately.

120
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:57,999
No, leave them.

121
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,999
They might actually be of use.

122
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,999
Didn't they seem to be
searching for their parents?

123
00:09:25,334 --> 00:09:26,751
She must've been shaken.

124
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:30,125
Good thing she didn't get hurt.

125
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:33,999
What if she had gotten a scar?
Tomorrow's the meeting.

126
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,542
Don't let her out
when she gets pregnant.

127
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,250
Yes, ma'am.

128
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,999
I guess once you're pregnant at fourteen,
you can't even go outside.

129
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,667
If you ever need help,
make sure to call me.

130
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:30,709
- Piggyback her.
- Can you move?

131
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:31,500
- Here.
- Come on.

132
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:38,999
She won't stop bleeding.

133
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:45,584
Let me see.

134
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:47,125
That woman earlier...

135
00:10:47,751 --> 00:10:49,334
Don't you think she is
Ah-Hyperion’s mom?

136
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,125
No way.

137
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:56,000
That was Ah-hyena.

138
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:58,999
The person who was in front of her.

139
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,542
Show love to the children.

140
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,125
Let them know through your eyes.

141
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,083
Children who are loved...

142
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,709
- Are you watching this again?
- ...return it twofold.

143
00:11:10,751 --> 00:11:12,500
I love you, my girl.

144
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:15,292
Mommy loves you.

145
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:19,999
So the woman Ah-hyena
watched on TV was...

146
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:23,999
But, why would she...?

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,459
- Ah-hyena?
- Ah-hyena!

148
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,834
Ah-hyena!

149
00:11:32,876 --> 00:11:33,999
- Ah-hyena! Ah-hyena!
- Take her to the hospital!

150
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,834
- Not the hospital!
- Then what do we do?

151
00:11:35,876 --> 00:11:38,709
We have to save her!
Let's go...

152
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,167
Dr. Park!

153
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:42,999
Let's call Dr. Park.

154
00:11:44,876 --> 00:11:49,834
Yeah, the doctor that the old man called.
Right, let's call Dr. Park.

155
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,250
- She won't answer.
- What do you mean?

156
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:54,292
She never moves without money!

157
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:56,999
Just call,
we have to save her life!

158
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,417
She's a doctor,
she must have a conscience.

159
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,167
Whatever, I'll figure it out.
I'm going to him no matter what.

160
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:06,999
Please!
We have to think it through!

161
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:08,792
I don't care!
I'll go alone if I have to!

162
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:27,876
Topper Sushi Restaurant

163
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:39,250
Welcome.

164
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,792
Choi Hyeong-seok,
National Police Agency

165
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:52,792
Do you know these kids?

166
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:55,292
What is it you want?

167
00:12:57,334 --> 00:12:58,751
Woo Tae-sik.

168
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:01,375
We're looking for Woo Tae-sik.

169
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,999
Sorry, I don't know him either.

170
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:10,167
I know Woo Tae-sik
was their guardian.

171
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,709
Shouldn't at least one adult
be there to help these kids?

172
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:21,667
Is there any way
to reach them?

173
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:33,626
10

174
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,209
9

175
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:38,250
8

176
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:44,125
Come on,
you can hold longer.

177
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:48,999
10

178
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,918

179
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:54,334

180
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,999
7

181
00:13:57,999 --> 00:13:59,584
Don't come out!

182
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,876
You useless brat.

183
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:46,999
She's burning up.

184
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:48,876
I don't think she can last.

185
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:52,542
Guys, let's call Dr. Park.

186
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:56,334
Ju-an, let's go to the church.

187
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,834
We need to get some money.

188
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,500
Ju-an...

189
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,792
Is that really... the only way?

190
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,584
Coward.

191
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:13,250
What?

192
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,876
I said you're a coward.

193
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,999
- You done talking?
- No, not even close.

194
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:23,459
What if something happens to her
while you hesitate?

195
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:24,834
Will you take responsibility?

196
00:15:24,876 --> 00:15:26,000
So-mi...

197
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:29,083
I'm terrified something might happen to her!

198
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,999
Just shut up!

199
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,542
If you don't know, don't talk.

200
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:39,209
Don't speak carelessly
about other people's pain.

201
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:42,000
You have no clue
what I went through.

202
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,626
You think I don't?

203
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:47,167
You beg and scream every night.

204
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,709
Didn't you know?
We all did.

205
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:53,250
What?

206
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:56,626
God, forgive me.

207
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,292
Jesus, please save me!
I'm sorry!

208
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:00,959
Father!

209
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:04,959
Every night.
How can we not know?

210
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:12,167
Are you going to keep
running away out of fear?

211
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,417
Just going to keep hiding?

212
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:18,125
Pretending it never happened?

213
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,167
It's time to face it.

214
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:31,626
You have to confront it head-on!

215
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:34,292
And you're...

216
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,834
You're not alone anymore.

217
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,999
You were alone before.

218
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,500
But now, we're together.

219
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:53,167
So come with me,
let's go together.

220
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:10,751
Oh, you're awake already?

221
00:17:11,292 --> 00:17:12,542
Sit down.

222
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:28,459
Eat well, darling.

223
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:30,999
Yeah.

224
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:32,626
Were you shocked yesterday?

225
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:38,375
I'll assign you a bodyguard.
Don't worry too much.

226
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:44,292
Sometimes in life,
things don't go according to plan.

227
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,709
The people from yesterday
misunderstood Mom somehow.

228
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:51,584
I see...

229
00:17:53,459 --> 00:17:56,876
Eat, we'll get ready slowly.

230
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:58,459
I'm taking you somewhere today.

231
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,999
- Where?
- You'll see.

232
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:05,375
By the way,
I withdrew you from school.

233
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:10,292
I want you to study abroad,
starting next year.

234
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,918
Shoulder gunshot,
woman in her 20s, blood type Os.

235
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:24,042
- Location?
- Yeomen-dong factory district.

236
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,542
500,000 won.

237
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:26,999
I'll pay you right after surgery.

238
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:28,667
Please make your way now.

239
00:18:30,999 --> 00:18:32,167
Let's go.

240
00:18:34,042 --> 00:18:36,918
Thank you,
I'll see you in the chapel.

241
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:38,918
Good morning, Deacon!

242
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,999
Thank you.

243
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:44,042
Oh, Elder!
How's your health?

244
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,999
Much better.
Looking forward to your sermon.

245
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,959
Yes, go on in.
Up you go.

246
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, Pastor!

247
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:53,999
My son got into Seoul National University.

248
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:54,999
Congratulations!

249
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,417
It's all thanks to you and your wife.

250
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,667
Accept our special offering.

251
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:11,667
Hey, Ju-an!

252
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,250
What are you doing?
Let's go.

253
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:22,959
Our Lord is deeply saddened
by those who sin out of greed.

254
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,209
He weeps for them,
brothers and sisters!

255
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:29,334
God tells us to store
our treasures in Heaven,

256
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,083
for the sake of us all!

257
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,999
The place closest to God!

258
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,584
The place connected to him!

259
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:42,709
That very place is this church,
dear congregation!

260
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:43,999
Amen.

261
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,999
Now, let's all entrust
our treasures to the Lord.

262
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:51,834
Through the blood of the lamb,
for us foolish humans,

263
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,959
God graciously blesses us all!

264
00:19:55,083 --> 00:19:56,999
Let's give a prayer of thanks!

265
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:58,834
Let us pray.

266
00:19:58,876 --> 00:19:59,999
Nobody coming?

267
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,999
Our Father in heaven,

268
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:07,542
thank you for allowing us
to praise you.

269
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:11,292
In memory of the late Ju Eun-gyeol
2nd Memorial Service

270
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,083
Hey.

271
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,375
What did you pray about?

272
00:20:45,876 --> 00:20:46,918
Huh?

273
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,000
I just...

274
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:56,417
I pray everyday...

275
00:20:58,542 --> 00:20:59,999
...to become closer to you.

276
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,542
In memory of the late Ju Eun-gyeol
2nd Memorial Service

277
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,584
I want to be close with you too.

278
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,626
Let us pray!

279
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:30,834
Got it.

280
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,375
Dear heavenly Father...

281
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,250
Jew-an! Hey!
What are you doing?

282
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:40,125
Let's go.
Snap out of it!

283
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:41,584
Hey!

284
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,999
You told us to store up our treasures!

285
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,375
Our congregation!

286
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:51,334
What's wrong with him?

287
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,042
Property! Greed!

288
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:55,999
Jew-an!

289
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:00,999
Are you okay?

290
00:22:00,999 --> 00:22:03,334
Ju-an, seriously!
What's wrong with you?

291
00:22:03,792 --> 00:22:04,999
Why are you acting like this?

292
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:09,125
Let us pray.

293
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:13,999
Dear gracious God,
we are here today

294
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,999
to thank you for allowing us
to worship and praise you.

295
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:20,999
Oh my! Fire!

296
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:23,584
Pastor, there's a fire!
In the offering box!

297
00:22:23,626 --> 00:22:26,042
Fire? What do you mean fire?
What fire?

298
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,709
Excuse me! Excuse me!

299
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,083
Get the fire extinguisher!

300
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:32,999
Why is it lit on fire?

301
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:35,125
Why is the offering box on fire?
Who did this?

302
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:37,999
Bring the extinguisher, now!
Right now!

303
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:39,083
What do we do?

304
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,459
Who the hell set fire
to the treasure box?

305
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:48,876
Why? Why? Why?

306
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:03,500
You're glowing, dear.

307
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:06,999
Ah-hyena.

308
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:11,292
You'll be a useful daughter, right?

309
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,000
Yes, of course.

310
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:19,375
Mom really needs you right now.

311
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:23,999
You can help Mom, right?
Can you?

312
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:25,999
Of course, Mom.

313
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,000
Thank you.

314
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:54,918
You're here!

315
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:08,542
Nice to meet you, Ah-hyena.

316
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:12,918
My Maria.

317
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:19,000
Come in.

318
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,042
Madam Lady.

319
00:24:32,918 --> 00:24:34,459
May I pour the tea?

320
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:38,042
Go ahead.

321
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:52,959
She's young
but knows formal rites too?

322
00:24:54,584 --> 00:24:56,292
I give the most importance

323
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:58,999
to teaching proper manner
above all else.

324
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:25,375
You raised your daughter so well...

325
00:25:28,584 --> 00:25:30,542
It's the Lord's will.

326
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,292
Amen.

327
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:37,999
Oh, right!

328
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:41,083
I almost forgot the most important thing.

329
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,542
Mm... The physical condition.

330
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:49,083
It can be done, right?

331
00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:53,042
I mean...

332
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,792
She started menstruating
around this time last year.

333
00:26:01,375 --> 00:26:03,292
There's no need to worry.

334
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,500
Of course.

335
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:07,999
Right?

336
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,626
Sister.

337
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:17,000
May I speak with Ah-hyena in private?

338
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:53,709
Ah-hyena.

339
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,459
If you're not comfortable with it,

340
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,459
we can stop...

341
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:06,959
No, it's what I want.

342
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:09,292
Really?

343
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:12,542
Truly?

344
00:27:15,626 --> 00:27:18,083
I was so worried
you might not want it.

345
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:20,834
I've felt so guilty.

346
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:24,918
Aren't you scared?

347
00:27:25,999 --> 00:27:27,417
Or afraid?

348
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:30,292
It's what my mom wants.

349
00:27:31,999 --> 00:27:36,999
And what she wants
is also what I want.

350
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:41,999
I want to be a daughter
that's useful to my mom.

351
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:44,334
Oh my...

352
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:51,918
I hope I can have a daughter
just like you someday.

353
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,999
You will, very soon.

354
00:28:01,918 --> 00:28:02,999
Thank you.

355
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:06,709
Thank you so much.

356
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,918
She's passed
the critical stage for now.

357
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:42,209
But she lost too much blood.

358
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:44,999
Your old man isn't here.

359
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:49,542
One more in the family, though.

360
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,375
Will Ah-hyena be okay?

361
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,250
We'll have to wait and see.

362
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:58,375
Anyone else hurt?

363
00:29:02,792 --> 00:29:03,417
You?

364
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:08,999
If you're done here, please go.
And don't tell anyone about us.

365
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,334
Same goes the other way.

366
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:20,667
Who are you kids?

367
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,042
SCSI procedure complete.
Beginning embryo culture.

368
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,584
Congratulations, Director.

369
00:29:45,626 --> 00:29:48,999
I don't know.
I'm not expecting much.

370
00:29:48,999 --> 00:29:50,999
What's so special
about presidential genes?

371
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:52,999
I'm just doing this to feel better.

372
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,876
Maybe someday,
a perfect child will appear.

373
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,375
Good job, everyone.

374
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:09,584
As of 3 p.m. today,
the Bioethics Act revision,

375
00:30:09,626 --> 00:30:13,167
also known as the 'Eye Shopping Bill'
has passed the Judiciary Committee.

376
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:17,000
Is the ruling party going to
push it through the plenary session?

377
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:18,000
Yes, that's correct.

378
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:23,500
The opposition party said they'll use
all means to block it including filibusters.

379
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:26,834
A clash between the parties
in the plenary session seems inevitable.

380
00:30:26,876 --> 00:30:28,999
What happens if the bill
passes the plenary session?

381
00:30:28,999 --> 00:30:32,292
Will buying and selling children
really become possible?

382
00:30:32,334 --> 00:30:33,999
Yes, that's correct.

383
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:38,709
Religious groups, civic organizations,
and the opposition party fear this.

384
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:44,542
The justification of advancing biotechnology
is believed to be an excuse by many.

385
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:24,417
What is this place?

386
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:27,500
You'll find out.
Come with me.

387
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:50,334
Did the defects really do this?

388
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:54,584
Yeah, they're not kids.
They're total delinquents.

389
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:57,083
Congrats on
the Judiciary Committee approval.

390
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,125
Hello, ma'am.

391
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:03,542
You're the one that deserve
the congratulations.

392
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:07,626
The plenary session won't be a problem.

393
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:10,584
People are calling it unethical
because they're new to it.

394
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:16,250
But it's the law of nature that
the weak loses and the strong wins, right?

395
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:20,000
We're following nature's order.
What's their problem?

396
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:21,459
Amen.

397
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,042
Ugh, what a mess.

398
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:29,709
Thankfully, the important ones
will be moved to the new lab.

399
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:33,751
Today, I want to show
the Congressman something.

400
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,292
These are embryos
from artificial fertilization.

401
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:45,876
Only one of them is usable.

402
00:32:45,918 --> 00:32:47,959
See? That one clearly stands out.

403
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,417
What about the rest?

404
00:32:50,459 --> 00:32:51,667
Waste.

405
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:57,918
Christians believe each embryo
has a soul.

406
00:32:58,167 --> 00:32:59,999
They say it's life given by God.

407
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:07,209
That's why some people protest
against artificial fertilization like zealots.

408
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:11,999
But when the world changes,
people's minds change too.

409
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:16,042
Changing people's minds first
won't get us anywhere.

410
00:33:16,918 --> 00:33:17,959
It'll be too late.

411
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:18,999
You're right.

412
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,459
Think of it as a contribution to
helping build a new world.

413
00:33:23,959 --> 00:33:25,000
What?

414
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:28,375
You thought I was just
a crazy businesswoman,

415
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:30,999
but now you think I'm a psycho,
don't you?

416
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:45,000
This one was refunded because
of a heart defect.

417
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,500
This one was refunded
because the parents divorced.

418
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:52,542
This one had a critical error.

419
00:33:52,584 --> 00:33:54,918
It carried an ADD gene.

420
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,999
Do you get what I'm saying?

421
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:26,375
We should've picked out the good genes
and combined them from the start.

422
00:34:27,417 --> 00:34:30,125
Then we wouldn't have wastes like these.

423
00:34:31,334 --> 00:34:34,250
So I'm going to do just that.

424
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:00,999
See? I told you I'm crazy.

425
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,709
It's always the crazy ones
that change the world.

426
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:23,167
I guess not all politicians
have the guts like they say.

427
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:29,375
He's so weak.
How will he do anything?

428
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:31,999
So, you wanted to see me privately?

429
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:38,083
Actually, it took me quite a while
to bring the president and first lady

430
00:35:38,125 --> 00:35:40,042
into our church as members.

431
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,292
Besides the time spent,
I had to put in effort everywhere.

432
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:46,292
Full devotion.

433
00:35:46,792 --> 00:35:49,709
I assumed the funding was sufficient.

434
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:52,999
Amen, amen! Of course!

435
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:56,959
You have been so generous
with your salvation offerings.

436
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:03,999
Once the bill passes, you'll be busy
commercializing the Eye Shopping Bill.

437
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:08,250
If you'd just entrust me
with the bank...

438
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,999
The bank?

439
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:14,999
Yes, the sperm and egg bank
you mentioned.

440
00:36:15,834 --> 00:36:20,834
If we could later expand it
with other new services

441
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,959
from adoption to revocation...

442
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:24,959
Pastor.

443
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,167
That's a great idea.

444
00:36:28,626 --> 00:36:30,375
Truly a great idea.

445
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:32,959
I'll grant you your wish.

446
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:37,083
Amen! Amen!
Thank you, Lord!

447
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,999
Ah-hyena, you okay?

448
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:54,167
Hey everyone...

449
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,792
Careful.

450
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,542
What happened?

451
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:12,999
Who treated me?

452
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:14,334
Dr. Park came by.

453
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:15,999
What?

454
00:37:17,876 --> 00:37:19,375
Where did you get the money?

455
00:37:20,626 --> 00:37:22,876
Me and Ju-an are great
at cracking safes.

456
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:27,999
Why'd you take such a huge risk?

457
00:37:28,334 --> 00:37:31,626
Thank God...
I'm glad you woke up.

458
00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:39,584
Ah-hyena, here.

459
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:42,459
- Let me see.
- There.

460
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:48,042
I'm Detective Choi Hyeong-seok.
Please call me.

461
00:37:48,709 --> 00:37:50,542
He's been trying to reach you
while you were out.

462
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,999
Why are you outside?

463
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:16,999
Ah-hyena...

464
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,042
I thought if I ever met him again,

465
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,999
I'd be able to stand tall,

466
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:32,334
and get my revenge.

467
00:38:36,999 --> 00:38:38,999
But when the moment came,
I couldn't.

468
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:41,918
I was so terrified.

469
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:48,792
His eyes...
They were terrifying.

470
00:38:51,751 --> 00:38:54,792
It was better when we
were living in hiding.

471
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:58,125
Eating good food with the old man...

472
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,709
Playing games...

473
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:03,667
That life was much better.

474
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:06,999
I felt the same.

475
00:39:09,125 --> 00:39:10,500
I was scared.

476
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:19,292
But Ju-an...

477
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:25,209
The thought of us
living in hiding forever...

478
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,999
...is even more scarier.

479
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,000
Why do we have to run?

480
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:36,584
We didn't do anything wrong.

481
00:39:41,999 --> 00:39:44,334
We have to face it
head-on from now.

482
00:39:44,999 --> 00:39:48,167
That includes me and all of you.

483
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:51,959
I'm not going to let us
keep living in hiding anymore.

484
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,500
We deserve a normal life.

485
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:00,959
A fresh start.

486
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:04,959
We'll make it happen.

487
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:27,999
Hello.

488
00:40:40,626 --> 00:40:41,584
You ready?

489
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:45,876
Let's go.

490
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:54,709
Can you see it?

491
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:55,834
Yeah.

492
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:14,876
Remember the fire?
I found us a famous shaman.

493
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,834
They say she's legit,
should we try it?

494
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:19,959
What do you mean, shaman?
That's nonsense.

495
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:21,250
I'm a pastor, for God's sake.

496
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:22,751
Everyone does it.

497
00:41:24,626 --> 00:41:27,250
Elder Yoko In-jun,
5 million won!

498
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:30,209
Amazing!

499
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,999
Business must be going well.

500
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:35,459
Deaconess Om Soon-ha,
1 million won...

501
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,999
- I thought her shop was doing well.
- Yeah...

502
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,751
Kim Chin-nae... 50,000 won?

503
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:42,792
What?

504
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:46,999
Come on, he owns a building!
Is he joking with us?

505
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:49,751
He's crazy.
What a wanker.

506
00:41:50,584 --> 00:41:51,584
Yun Ji-seok?

507
00:41:52,999 --> 00:41:54,042
No way...

508
00:41:56,999 --> 00:42:00,042
You killed Eun-gyeol...

509
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:04,999
That crazy bastard.

510
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:07,375
Soon Jo-seek, that bastard!

511
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:10,375
That fucking bitch!

512
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:20,250
Angkor Shaman House
We lift curses for you

513
00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:44,834
Get out!

514
00:42:45,626 --> 00:42:46,999
Huh? Why?

515
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:49,584
A servant of the big god
has no business here.

516
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:53,209
There's no big or small gods...

517
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,459
We just follow whatever god
is needed at the time.

518
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,999
Can you tell where he is?

519
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:04,876
The boy?

520
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,334
The boy, you say...

521
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,250
You bastards!

522
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:24,209
The sinner is your son!

523
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:29,292
Yes, he's my son...
I mean, he was my son.

524
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,000
And he needs to die now.

525
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:36,417
Ff...

526
00:43:37,792 --> 00:43:39,042
Heartless monsters.

527
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:43,999
Do you want a talisman?
Or a killing ritual?

528
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,626
Anything.
Anything possible, right now.

529
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:51,834
You!

530
00:44:00,334 --> 00:44:03,834
If you want results,

531
00:44:03,876 --> 00:44:04,999
place this talisman
under your church's cross.

532
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,125
You need to subdue
the spirit of your god.

533
00:44:09,876 --> 00:44:10,918
Ah, okay.

534
00:44:12,542 --> 00:44:13,834
Thank you!

535
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:15,584
Amen.

536
00:44:15,626 --> 00:44:16,999
Thank you!

537
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,792
Ugh, gosh...

538
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:26,999
Well done.

539
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:29,999
Those idiots happily took the talisman.

540
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:33,375
What exactly is their religion?

541
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:36,292
Money, of course.

542
00:44:37,626 --> 00:44:38,584
Let's go.

543
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,751
Dear heavenly Father,

544
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,167
On this anniversary

545
00:44:47,876 --> 00:44:49,542
we miss Eun-gyeol dearly

546
00:44:49,584 --> 00:44:53,999
and pray that his soul may rest forever

547
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:55,584
in peace and in your embrace.

548
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:59,292
We pray in the name of our Lord,

549
00:44:59,334 --> 00:45:01,876
Jesus Christ,

550
00:45:01,918 --> 00:45:03,834
Amen.

551
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:15,125
Eun-gyeol was
my son Jo-Seoul’s best friend.

552
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,792
So on this day every year,
we gather and pray.

553
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:22,542
Hoping our Ji-seok
might be found again.

554
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,999
It is my sincere hope.

555
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:28,667
Do you think Eun-gyeol knows?

556
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:31,792
Where my Ji-seok is?

557
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:32,999
Ji-seok!

558
00:45:34,417 --> 00:45:36,167
He'll be found, madam.

559
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:39,125
I'm sure he's doing well.

560
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:41,250
Thank you, Elder.

561
00:45:46,709 --> 00:45:48,999
He is finally found!

562
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:51,999
I found Yoon Ji-seok!

563
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:55,209
How dare you!

564
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:58,999
You asked me to find your son!

565
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:00,209
Let's take this outside.

566
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,125
Hey! How dare you
touch a possessed body?

567
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:06,167
I'm so sorry!
Please forgive me!

568
00:46:06,209 --> 00:46:09,999
You disrespectful brat!
You wicked child!

569
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:11,542
Wait a minute.

570
00:46:11,584 --> 00:46:14,792
Did you hide my talisman
under the main cross?

571
00:46:15,167 --> 00:46:16,999
- A talisman, Pastor?
- Elder, no!

572
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:19,999
This is a misunderstanding!
I'm a pastor!

573
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:22,250
A talisman?
That's not true!

574
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:23,999
- What's that?
- It's nothing!

575
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,876
- What is this?
- Talisman! It's a talisman!

576
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:30,125
Oh, Ji-seok!

577
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:32,999
I found your son, Yoon Ji-seok!

578
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:37,834
Ji-seok... Ji-seok...

579
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:40,626
Why did you put this thing
on my robe?

580
00:46:40,918 --> 00:46:41,876
It's not like that...

581
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:44,167
Your son, Ji-seok...

582
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:47,167
He's in here!

583
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:52,999
Ji-seok...

584
00:46:54,334 --> 00:46:55,500
He's alive?

585
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,500
That son of a bitch...

586
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,751
Hallelujah!

587
00:47:00,999 --> 00:47:02,459
Beloved brothers and sisters!

588
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:05,876
The Lord has worked a miracle!

589
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:08,918
God has performed a miracle!

590
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:11,000
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

591
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:15,417
Our earnest prayers
have been answered by the Lord!

592
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,999
He has returned
our beloved Ji-seok to us!

593
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:20,584
Hallelujah!

594
00:47:20,626 --> 00:47:22,876
Thank You, Father!

595
00:47:22,918 --> 00:47:25,209
You have shown us a miracle!

596
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:27,999
Thank you heavenly Father...

597
00:47:28,209 --> 00:47:32,167
Ji-seok!
My Ji-seok, Ji-seok!

598
00:47:32,209 --> 00:47:34,459
You've come back to us,
my precious Ji-seok!

599
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:37,626
How dare you come here?

600
00:47:44,292 --> 00:47:46,999
Pastor! Pastor!

601
00:48:00,999 --> 00:48:03,000
You filthy bastard.

602
00:48:03,042 --> 00:48:04,918
Stop it! That's enough!

603
00:48:08,834 --> 00:48:10,167
You're the filthy one.

604
00:48:10,959 --> 00:48:12,999
You money-grubbing pig.

605
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:20,292
Yeah, what if I am?
So what?

606
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:26,083
What about you?
You're into guys, you freak!

607
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,959
You animal!

608
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:38,250
You psycho!

609
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:49,876
If you want to stand proud
before the Lord,

610
00:48:50,209 --> 00:48:52,125
repent and beg for forgiveness.

611
00:48:52,709 --> 00:48:56,876
That's your only salvation,
you disgusting freak!

612
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,000
Eun-gyeol.

613
00:49:38,459 --> 00:49:41,999
Do you really like Ji-seok?

614
00:49:42,999 --> 00:49:44,042
Huh?

615
00:49:50,709 --> 00:49:54,709
Our Ji-seok is going to be a pastor,

616
00:49:55,999 --> 00:49:58,417
and inherit this church.

617
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:16,334
A pastor who once loved a man...

618
00:50:18,876 --> 00:50:22,500
Well, maybe by then,

619
00:50:22,542 --> 00:50:25,083
the world may become
more accepting.

620
00:50:26,876 --> 00:50:32,751
But our Lord will never understand.

621
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,999
Eun-gyeol.

622
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:45,584
Do you want Ji-seok to be happy?

623
00:50:46,999 --> 00:50:48,000
Huh?

624
00:50:48,042 --> 00:50:49,626
Do you really love him?

625
00:50:51,876 --> 00:50:52,999
Yes.

626
00:50:59,626 --> 00:51:00,999
Then disappear.

627
00:51:04,209 --> 00:51:08,918
Don't you think that's the love
Jesus taught us?

628
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:14,999
Like how he died on the cross
to save all the sinners.

629
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:25,584
Dear Ji-seok,

630
00:51:29,042 --> 00:51:31,209
I want the love I had for you

631
00:51:32,334 --> 00:51:33,999
to become friendship.

632
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:38,626
And about the choice I had to make...

633
00:51:40,542 --> 00:51:42,834
I hope you don't
grieve me too much.

634
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:46,918
Every decision I made...

635
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:51,500
...was to make you happy.

636
00:51:53,999 --> 00:51:57,999
I actually thought
that when you see me,

637
00:52:00,292 --> 00:52:03,209
you'd at least look a little sorry.

638
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:08,999
But the first thing
you said to me was...

639
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:14,375
You filthy bastard.

640
00:52:18,334 --> 00:52:19,709
How could you say that?

641
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:21,167
Filthy bastard.

642
00:52:21,209 --> 00:52:23,667
You're not even human.

643
00:52:23,709 --> 00:52:26,542
What?
You think I killed Eun-gyeol?

644
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:31,375
No, you killed him.
Fucking psycho!

645
00:52:31,417 --> 00:52:34,999
If you hadn't fucked him,
he'd still be alive!

646
00:52:34,999 --> 00:52:37,000
You hear me, freak?

647
00:52:37,042 --> 00:52:38,334
Shut the hell up!

648
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:47,834
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

649
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:49,626
Put that down!
What are you doing, you psycho!

650
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,959
Joo-an, that's enough.
Stop, okay? Just stop.

651
00:52:52,999 --> 00:52:55,167
Let go.
Let me go!

652
00:52:55,209 --> 00:52:57,292
What are you doing?
Untie me!

653
00:52:57,334 --> 00:52:59,375
Put that down, bastard!

654
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:01,999
Ask and it shall be given to you.

655
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:05,375
Seek and you shall find.

656
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:08,751
A soul broken by sin...

657
00:53:11,584 --> 00:53:12,792
...shall be punished.

658
00:53:13,083 --> 00:53:14,209
Joo-an.

659
00:53:14,999 --> 00:53:15,999
Die.

660
00:53:15,999 --> 00:53:18,042
Ji-seok...
No, no, no!

661
00:53:18,584 --> 00:53:21,000
Ji-seok, money!
I'll give you money. All of it!

662
00:53:21,042 --> 00:53:23,999
Okay? I'll give you everything!
All the money...

663
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:27,417
I'm sure you need money
to do whatever you're doing!

664
00:53:27,459 --> 00:53:29,584
Giving you money
is giving my everything.

665
00:53:29,876 --> 00:53:33,375
The safe...
The safe is right there.

666
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:36,918
You need my fingerprint
to open that thing.

667
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:40,999
I'll open it for you.
You hear me, bastard?

668
00:53:40,999 --> 00:53:43,042
So please spare my life.

669
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:48,999
Please, spare me.
Please...

670
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:54,792
Spare me, please...

671
00:54:09,167 --> 00:54:13,375
Use it for the children

672
00:54:39,626 --> 00:54:41,834
Well, look who it is.

673
00:54:42,876 --> 00:54:45,292
Took you long enough, fucker.

674
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:47,459
Everything's gone.

675
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,250
Why were you so late?

676
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:53,500
What's that?

677
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:00,459
Pastor, can you talk right now?

678
00:55:00,999 --> 00:55:01,999
Yes, Director.

679
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,999
About that business you mentioned.

680
00:55:05,584 --> 00:55:07,792
I've been thinking...

681
00:55:07,834 --> 00:55:10,083
And I don't think
I can give it to you.

682
00:55:10,751 --> 00:55:11,751
What?

683
00:55:12,999 --> 00:55:15,417
What am I supposed to live off of?

684
00:55:15,459 --> 00:55:19,209
I can't just live off of my dreams.
I need to make money.

685
00:55:19,667 --> 00:55:21,292
You crazy bitch!

686
00:55:23,999 --> 00:55:25,334
So noisy.

687
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,250
Try saying it to yourself first.

688
00:55:30,584 --> 00:55:32,999
Before we were a mom,

689
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:35,417
we were women
that longed for love.

690
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:37,751
Now, shall we say it together?

691
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:40,083
I love myself.

692
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:41,542
I love myself.

693
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:43,000
I love myself.

694
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:45,292
I truly love myself.

695
00:55:45,999 --> 00:55:47,250
I love myself.

696
00:55:47,584 --> 00:55:48,792
I love myself.

697
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:50,000
I love you.

698
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:22,999
Thank you to actors Yoo Seung-mok, Hwang Seok-jeong,
and Sung Hoon for their special appearance.

699
00:56:22,999 --> 00:56:25,999
The Defects

700
00:56:25,999 --> 00:56:28,999
Effective immediately,
this is now a classified serial murder case.

701
00:56:28,999 --> 00:56:29,999
Just kill them.

702
00:56:29,999 --> 00:56:31,667
Dead people can't be arrested.

703
00:56:31,709 --> 00:56:33,334
Today is the blessed day.

704
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:34,999
I'll give you a reason to believe.

705
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:36,792
Why is Sung-woo among them?

706
00:56:36,834 --> 00:56:39,626
He wants to find and kill his son.
We should help.

707
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:41,751
You want me to go begging now?

708
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:44,083
Keep running your mouth
and I'll bring Sung-woo back!

709
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:46,459
But the ones who should be scared
now aren't us. It's them.

710
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,999
But the ones who should be scared
now aren't us. It's them.

711
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,709
He's in touch with
the Joseonjok gangsters.

712
00:56:50,751 --> 00:56:52,334
Can you kill him for me?
