1
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:09,918
Yum Jung-ah

2
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:13,500
Won Jin-ah

3
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,792
Choi Young-joon

4
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:21,876
Kim Jin-young

5
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:31,999
The Defects

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,584
Tell me where Mom is.

7
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:39,918
Tell me!

8
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:41,751
- So-mi, calm down.
- Tell me.

9
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,167
Tell me, tell me!

10
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,584
You mustn't kill him!

11
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:47,125
Gosh!

12
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,999
That crazy So-mi...

13
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,083
Do you want to live?

14
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,709
Yes, yes...

15
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:57,999
Not for long, though.

16
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:00,918
You'll regret surviving.

17
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:04,667
Almost got a heart attack,..

18
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,918
Bucheon-dong One, Bucheon-dong One.

19
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,918
- They're swarming in already.
- Multiple gunshot reports received.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,876
I repeat...

21
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:20,918
Bluebird One,
Code Zero at local jurisdiction.

22
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,417
Confirm location
of Han Chul-soo's residence.

23
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:24,918
Bluebird Two, departing now.

24
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:25,918
Bluebird...?

25
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,500
Found it!

26
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:42,667
Ah-hyeon, can you hear me?

27
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:44,626
Get out of there now. Hurry!

28
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:45,751
Okay.

29
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,250
We're out of time,
let's go.

30
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,167
Which hospital is mom in?

31
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:56,918
Daejeong Hospital!
It's not far, really close.

32
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,918
I visit her a lot and we talk
on the phone too.

33
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,042
I swear, it's true!

34
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:04,000
What about this?

35
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,918
Who made this card?

36
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,626
What is this card even for?

37
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:10,209
I don't know...

38
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,709
I really don't know.
Even if I did, I can't say.

39
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:16,918
If I talk, they'll kill me.
I'm serious.

40
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,751
You bitch!

41
00:02:20,918 --> 00:02:22,334
Then die.

42
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,999
Ah-hyeon,
get out of there now!

43
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,125
Ah-hyeon...

44
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:32,042
Let's go. Come on.
Hurry.

45
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,250
Go!

46
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:34,751
Shit...

47
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,709
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,417
I said I'm sorry.

49
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,584
I got screwed.

50
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,918
Fuck...

51
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:07,042
What are you doing, jackass?

52
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:09,417
Untie me already.

53
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:13,500
Can't even kill one damn kid...

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,459
Stay still!

55
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,626
It hurts, stop!

56
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,459
Joo-an, Joo-an!
Are you okay?

57
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,667
Untie me, bastards!

58
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,000
Say that again.

59
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:55,334
What did you say?

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,417
- Defects detected, defects detected.
- Hey, follow me!

61
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:03,500
Go!

62
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:19,667
Shit.

63
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,542
Bluebird Two, the defects disappeared.
Requesting backup.

64
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,876
Seok-su!

65
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,292
Catch them!

66
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:05,334
- Get 'em!
- Catch them!

67
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:25,918
Joo-an...

68
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,375
Fucking hell.

69
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,876
Are you okay?

70
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:12,500
Requesting ambulance.

71
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,792
Are you okay?

72
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:15,918
- Let's go.
- Hey!

73
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,250
Wait!

74
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,125
There were more survivors?

75
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:44,918
They were living
in an abandoned building.

76
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:50,500
We're checking if Woo Tae-sik
had other accomplices.

77
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:52,083
Did you see her face then?

78
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:53,667
Sorry?

79
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,542
I mean Ah-hyeon.

80
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,918
How old is she now?

81
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:02,542
She must be over 20.

82
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:05,918
So, she was alive?

83
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,459
Sorry.

84
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,626
Bring her in alive.

85
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,792
I want to see how she's grown.

86
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:18,751
I wonder if she looks like me.

87
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,167
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:22,459
How many are they?

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,667
Including Choi Si-woo,
five in total.

90
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,918
Kwon Sung-woo.

91
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,999
He's Congressman
Kwon Kang-man's son, right?

92
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:32,834
Yes.

93
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:48,167
The Defects
EP3. Survivors

94
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,125
Are we're living here now?

95
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,417
For the time being.

96
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,292
Here we go again...

97
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:46,042
Sorry.

98
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:49,709
I couldn't get a better place for us.

99
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:52,542
Don't be sorry.
Why would you be sorry?

100
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,209
This place is way bigger.

101
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,918
Wow, with multi-levels.
A definite upgrade.

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,918
Yeah, Ah-hyeon.
I like this place too.

103
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,500
Me too.

104
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,918
See? Everyone likes it.
Don't feel bad.

105
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,918
We can make it even better.

106
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:10,834
Yeah, let's look around.

107
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:12,417
Yeah.

108
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:24,834
Watch your steps.

109
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:31,834
Pull it a bit more.

110
00:09:34,584 --> 00:09:38,125
Okay, this room is for me
and Ah-hyeon.

111
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,042
This one's my room.

112
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:44,459
Impressive.

113
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,209
We're done too.

114
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,999
This is our room.

115
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,083
Ah-hyeon, come sit.

116
00:09:56,292 --> 00:09:57,918
Hey, this is nice.

117
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,417
Cozy.

118
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:11,918
You come too.

119
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,918
No, I like being alone.

120
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:34,918
Can't sleep?

121
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,125
Hey...

122
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:43,334
What were your parents like?

123
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,709
Out of the parents who abandoned us,

124
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,876
there could be another good person.

125
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,918
Like So-mi's mom.

126
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,584
I used to have one.

127
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,209
A mother.

128
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:14,918
Someone who...

129
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:19,042
...wished to shine the brightest.

130
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,459
Let all that you do be done in love.

131
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:30,417
Yes, come in.

132
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,292
When are we going
golfing together?

133
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:40,417
It's not good for a pastor
to be seen on a golf course.

134
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:44,918
That's why I go in secret
when it's closed.

135
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:45,918
Oh my.

136
00:11:46,876 --> 00:11:49,792
So, how did the talk go?

137
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,918
She was just as I heard.
Faithful and desperate.

138
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:55,792
My husband...

139
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,125
He's a perfect man.

140
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:02,999
I'm his only fault.

141
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,834
My womb is unable to bear a child.

142
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,918
Please don't say that.

143
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,918
I'm here to help you.

144
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:28,834
I want to give him
a child worthy of him.

145
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,876
A perfect child.

146
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:38,918
That's wonderful.

147
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,083
You're close to achieving your goal.

148
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,918
Much thanks to you.

149
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,918
She respects you so deeply.

150
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,918
I talk for a living, you know?

151
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,542
The Lord will be sad to hear that.

152
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:53,918
Oh, yeah?

153
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:56,918
This talent was given to me
by the Lord.

154
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,375
I see.

155
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,584
I want to make another offering.

156
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:06,918
I'll have it blessed
by the Lord's grace.

157
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,667
Hey, bring it in.

158
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:29,209
Wow, the amount is very big...

159
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,000
Creating a perfect child
isn't exactly cheap.

160
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:36,083
We can't always relay
on the foundation.

161
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:38,375
I trust you'll manage it well.

162
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,459
Don't think of this place
as a church.

163
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,876
Think of it as a laundering place.

164
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,292
But it seemed Madam Lady
hadn't discuss it with her husband.

165
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,999
I wonder if sperm collection
will go smoothly.

166
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,667
Oh, don't worry about that.

167
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:00,125
He's head over heels for her.

168
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,334
That's great then.

169
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,876
We'll need to meet
Congressman Kwon Kang-man soon.

170
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:10,918
I've been wondering
how to win him over too.

171
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,792
Got any ideas?

172
00:14:13,918 --> 00:14:16,876
We've got something
that'll work on him.

173
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,417
What's that?

174
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:22,918
People think an embryo is a child.

175
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,292
Isn't that ridiculous?

176
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:28,209
It's just a clump of cells,
like a fingernail.

177
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:31,918
People are way too emotional.

178
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,834
I agree.

179
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,584
The Holy Bible

180
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:46,834
My job is to create humans.

181
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,209
I bet I please the Lord.

182
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:54,584
God loves humans, after all.

183
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:56,500
Yes, of course.

184
00:14:56,542 --> 00:14:59,334
A true life-creating miracle act.

185
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:04,250
A creative and groundbreaking service
in this low-birth era...

186
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,542
Madam Lady

187
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,459
Yes, hello.

188
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,167
Sister, listen...

189
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:20,167
I think I may be too old

190
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,083
to give birth.

191
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,918
So, I was thinking...

192
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:32,667
Yes.

193
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,751
Sorry for the late visit, ma'am.

194
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,417
Is there...

195
00:15:44,042 --> 00:15:45,459
Ah-hyeon!

196
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:49,417
What are you doing here so late?
Shouldn't you be studying?

197
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:54,918
Well, I was wondering
if there was any news about Si-woo.

198
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,918
Si-woo...

199
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,083
We're still looking.

200
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,292
Thank you for worrying
about him and all.

201
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:16,999
He was such a sweet boy, right?

202
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:24,334
Sorry for bothering you like this...

203
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:30,500
If I hear anything,
I'll contact you right away.

204
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:32,542
Thank you, Ah-hyeon.

205
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:34,584
Get home safe.

206
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,542
By the way.

207
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,000
Where did you get those shoes?

208
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,459
Huh?

209
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,999
They are so my style.

210
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:11,667
Detective Choi,
what are you doing here?

211
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,292
You're going to die overworking.

212
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:18,000
People don't die that easily.

213
00:17:18,626 --> 00:17:19,918
Plenty of people did.

214
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,250
- Detective, over here.
- Yes? Yes.

215
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:40,000
- Yeah, tell me.
- Yes, sir.

216
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,667
We found the phone's real owner.

217
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,209
A man named Woo Tae-sik,
in his 40s.

218
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,167
We texted you his photo.

219
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:48,709
Yeah, I got it.

220
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,500
Woo Tae-sik.

221
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,000
How do we even use this?

222
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,209
Do we go somewhere with it?

223
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:19,918
Han Cheol-soo was
found dead in his home.

224
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:20,918
Dead?

225
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:26,459
Get security camera footages
from the area.

226
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:29,500
We didn't kill him.

227
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,542
I think we should leave.

228
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:35,083
Ah-hyeon.

229
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:37,918
Are we moving again?

230
00:18:43,918 --> 00:18:44,918
Who is it?

231
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:49,167
Wife

232
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:56,000
- So-mi!
- Hello?

233
00:18:57,918 --> 00:19:00,209
Mom? Mom!

234
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,250
Mom!

235
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,417
Honey.

236
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,918
Mom, can you hear me?

237
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:16,125
Honey, don't come this week.

238
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:20,292
I'm doing fine.
You really don't need to visit.

239
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:25,000
You have to prepare for
the Educational Supervisor's visit.

240
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,417
The doctors here
are very good to me.

241
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,125
- Come next week, okay?
- Mom...

242
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,167
Mom, what are you saying?

243
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,792
What are you talking about?

244
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,876
Where are you right now?

245
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,751
Honey.

246
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,167
Yoo-na's doing well, right?

247
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:49,918
Don't bring her when you come.

248
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,918
She's busy preparing for auditions.

249
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:59,083
I should be taking her
to her auditions...

250
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,918
Once I'm discharged,

251
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:07,167
I'll take her to her auditions,

252
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:09,250
pack her lunches,

253
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,918
and tell her how proud I am.

254
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:15,918
Tell her that for me, honey.

255
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Mom?

256
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,209
My husband is so sweet.

257
00:20:47,626 --> 00:20:48,918
You have no idea.

258
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:52,918
If you keep bothering me,
I'll tell on you.

259
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:18,918
Ma'am.

260
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,918
Do you really think your daughter...

261
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,250
...won't show up?

262
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,334
Guys.

263
00:21:57,876 --> 00:21:59,375
We should go find So-mi's mother.

264
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,125
Ah-hyeon...

265
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:02,292
Are you crazy?

266
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,918
They'll be flooding the place.
Why go there?

267
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:07,918
We don't even know
how to use that membership card.

268
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,042
So-mi's mother will know.

269
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:13,918
We'll go find her,

270
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,375
and ask how to use the card.

271
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:18,042
No, that's too risky.

272
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:19,667
We can't do that.
Tell her!

273
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,250
Ah-hyeon, thank you.

274
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:36,042
Si-woo, even you?

275
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:39,500
We're really going?

276
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:48,876
You know it.

277
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:53,542
You get hair loss and skin trouble
after giving birth.

278
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:58,918
Appearance matters
in my line of work.

279
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:03,209
Of course.
I completely understand.

280
00:23:06,417 --> 00:23:07,918
Using a surrogate...

281
00:23:08,417 --> 00:23:11,792
...will remain confidential, right?

282
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:17,000
We'll protect you at all cost.

283
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:27,542
It's not hard to trust
in the Lord...

284
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:30,751
But it's very hard to trust a person.

285
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,042
Excuse me?

286
00:23:32,834 --> 00:23:34,667
My job requires me

287
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:37,667
to know how to read people.

288
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,918
So...

289
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:46,918
What can I do to help with that?

290
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,542
I need collateral.

291
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:54,334
So that I can trust you completely.

292
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:56,876
Collateral?

293
00:23:57,292 --> 00:24:01,918
You said your daughter's very gifted, right?

294
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:08,792
I want a perfect woman
to carry my child.

295
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:17,167
Like Sister Kim Se-hee.

296
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,167
She's 14...

297
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:27,083
The Virgin Mary was 14
when she gave birth to Jesus.

298
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:28,834
Am I right?

299
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,918
Turns out my daughter's 14 too.

300
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,459
Do you want her?

301
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,000
Eat up, Ah-hyeon.

302
00:24:53,876 --> 00:24:54,834
Thank you.

303
00:24:58,626 --> 00:24:59,834
What's wrong?

304
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:02,918
Ah-hyeon.

305
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:09,876
You're so precious to me.
Like a gift.

306
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:15,334
Me too, Mom.
You're precious to me.

307
00:25:16,876 --> 00:25:17,918
Really?

308
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:21,250
Thank you, sweetie.

309
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:28,876
Listen, I have a favor to ask of you.

310
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:32,375
Will you help me?

311
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,292
I'll do it.

312
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:07,918
Let's go in.

313
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:22,667
Emergency Room

314
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:23,667
Damn it.

315
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:44,918
Shit...

316
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:47,459
Am I the only one who feels sus?

317
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,918
This doesn't feel like a hospital.

318
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,375
Ugh...

319
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:05,667
Let's go.

320
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,042
Who are you?

321
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:24,250
Who the fuck are you?

322
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:32,000
- Hey, get them!
- Over there!

323
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:36,626
Seok-su, let's go.

324
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:55,792
Get 'em!

325
00:29:09,459 --> 00:29:10,459
Hey, catch them!

326
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:09,209
Seok-su!

327
00:30:12,334 --> 00:30:13,709
Open it.

328
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,792
Lim Kyung-mi

329
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:31,918
Joo-an.

330
00:30:33,959 --> 00:30:34,918
Here.

331
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:41,459
Let's go.

332
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,918
- Mom!
- Yoo-na!

333
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,500
My dear baby...

334
00:30:52,542 --> 00:30:54,417
Are you okay, Yoo-na?

335
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:57,876
Why did you come here?
How did you come?

336
00:30:57,918 --> 00:31:00,667
Mom.
I'm your daughter, right?

337
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,918
You didn't abandon me, right?

338
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:05,834
What are you saying?

339
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:09,375
Yoo-na, my baby...

340
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,918
Mom, I doubted you.

341
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:16,751
I didn't trust you.
I cursed you.

342
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,000
I was wrong.

343
00:31:21,042 --> 00:31:22,918
I'm sorry, Yoo-na.

344
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:26,167
Mom, why did you
hide the adoption?

345
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:44,709
The moment I met you, I knew.

346
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:46,918
That you are truly my daughter.

347
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:50,792
So no matter what anyone says,
you're my child, okay?

348
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:55,459
Did you buy me too?

349
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,500
Yoo-na...

350
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,626
Mom, you have to tell me.
Okay?

351
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:03,292
Did you go to the place
where they sell kids?

352
00:32:03,876 --> 00:32:06,584
Mom, do you have one of these cards?

353
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:07,626
Do you know this?

354
00:32:07,667 --> 00:32:10,792
No, I don't know.
Don't ask me!

355
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:11,751
Mom...

356
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:14,709
Mom, please tell me!

357
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,918
If I do, you'll be in danger.

358
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:21,000
They're dangerous people.

359
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:24,459
Don't go near them.
Don't even try to find out.

360
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:31,083
We're out of time.
We have to go.

361
00:32:31,125 --> 00:32:33,292
Mom, come on.
Let's just go.

362
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,000
Let's go, sit.

363
00:32:52,584 --> 00:32:53,584
Mom!

364
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:27,209
Mom!

365
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:39,876
Mom, no.
You have to get up!

366
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:42,042
Yoo-na, just go!

367
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,375
- We have to go!
- No!

368
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:46,667
No, Mom! No!

369
00:33:54,959 --> 00:33:56,834
Wait, the others!

370
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:15,918
Why do you keep struggling to survive?

371
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,125
Bunch of cockroaches...

372
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:25,459
Get caught, and you're dead.
Like this!

373
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:39,918
Are you okay?

374
00:35:40,083 --> 00:35:41,000
Let's go.

375
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:45,167
Go!

376
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:49,918
Are you okay?

377
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,042
Quick, get them!

378
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:54,792
Get them!

379
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:00,375
Let's move.

380
00:36:57,584 --> 00:36:58,918
Are you okay, Jung-hyun?

381
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:00,834
I'm sorry.

382
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:04,751
Do you need more men?

383
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,417
No, ma'am.

384
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,375
It's fine.
Let me know if you do.

385
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:11,918
Sorry, it won't happen again...

386
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:17,500
You know you're my favorite, right?

387
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:20,918
So don't get hurt again.

388
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:38,834
Stop!

389
00:37:38,876 --> 00:37:41,542
Get that bastard, stop him!

390
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:44,751
Enough, that's enough.

391
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:45,709
Stop it!

392
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:47,375
You okay?

393
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:01,876
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

394
00:38:01,918 --> 00:38:03,918
That bastard...
Let's get you treated.

395
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:07,542
He's a psycho.
A murderer's son after all.

396
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:09,042
Let's go.

397
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:13,918
It's true! His dad killed his mom
and went to prison.

398
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,375
Look at those eyes.
He's a killer.

399
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:17,792
This isn't his first time,
come on.

400
00:38:30,292 --> 00:38:31,542
Are you Jung-hyun?

401
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:44,375
That must hurt.

402
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,000
I can treat you every time
you get hurt.

403
00:39:02,876 --> 00:39:03,834
Like a mother.

404
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:07,918
Want me to be your mother?

405
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:13,292
Can you be someone useful to me?

406
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:18,042
Want to call me Mom?

407
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:24,417
I will not mess up again.

408
00:39:29,542 --> 00:39:31,459
You don't call me Mom
these days.

409
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:37,918
Try it next time.

410
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:57,876
Your mother will be fine.

411
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:02,999
Let's go get her when this is over.

412
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,500
Do you think we'll make it?

413
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,125
Mom told me...

414
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:23,250
She said they're more dangerous
than we think.

415
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:27,834
Hey, don't talk like that.

416
00:40:29,417 --> 00:40:32,918
I'm tracking their movement routes.

417
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:34,417
Just give me some time.

418
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:43,918
I'll do it.

419
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:10,083
Found them!

420
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:27,125
Ah-hyeon, let me see.

421
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:30,584
What the hell is this place?

422
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:32,792
What about the signal?

423
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,999
Is there any?

424
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:38,834
No signal.

425
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,834
We can't do forensics on this.

426
00:41:46,584 --> 00:41:49,000
- The chief said not to accept it.
- What?

427
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:52,876
He said the investigation's
getting dropped, and gave us other work.

428
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:57,709
Then what should I do with this?

429
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:00,876
If it's urgent,
go to a private forensics company.

430
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:01,876
Are you serious?

431
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:07,250
A private company?

432
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,334
Sir.

433
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:17,918
Can't we just drop this?

434
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,250
This case doesn't seem right.

435
00:42:20,292 --> 00:42:22,000
That's why we have to do it.

436
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:23,918
Aren't you a cop?

437
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,709
No, I mean...

438
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:37,999
Kwon Kang-man's Son
Found Dead After School Bullying

439
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,918
3 Years Ago
- Same class as Sung-woo?
- Yes.

440
00:42:43,417 --> 00:42:44,292
Were you two close?

441
00:42:44,626 --> 00:42:47,667
Not really.
We were just classmates.

442
00:42:48,459 --> 00:42:52,000
Did you ever see Sung-woo
get bullied or anything?

443
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:54,042
No, we were all just classmates...

444
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:55,042
There he is!

445
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,334
Congressman Kwon,
how do you feel?

446
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,292
- Give us a few words.
- A word, please.

447
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,334
We would love a word.

448
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:10,000
My poor Sung-woo...

449
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,918
Sung-woo...

450
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:19,876
My poor baby!

451
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,250
What do we do now?

452
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,250
I'm at the school where the funeral
of Kwon Sung-woo is taking place,

453
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:31,500
son of New Future Party's Senior Rep.
Kwon Kang-man.

454
00:43:32,167 --> 00:43:34,042
In the attendance
are Senior Rep. Kwon,

455
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:35,918
New Future Party
Youth Supreme Council Member,

456
00:43:35,959 --> 00:43:40,125
and members of the Presidential Office's
Anti-School Violence TF Team.

457
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:43,584
There are also condolence wreaths
from opposition parties.

458
00:43:43,918 --> 00:43:47,834
And the perpetrators
didn't attend the funeral?

459
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:48,876
Yes, that's right.

460
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,125
Kwon Sung-woo suffered
from continued bullying.

461
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:54,751
Last Sunday,
he sadly took his own life.

462
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:57,417
The three students accused of bullying

463
00:43:57,459 --> 00:44:01,417
submitted withdrawal forms
the day after Sung-woo's death,

464
00:44:01,459 --> 00:44:03,918
and are currently
under police investigation.

465
00:44:10,959 --> 00:44:12,542
Sir! Sir!

466
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,584
What's his problem?

467
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:30,834
How can not a single person show up?

468
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:32,709
I'm starving.

469
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,918
We've been standing here for 7 hours.

470
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:37,792
Let's take shifts.
Give it to me.

471
00:44:47,334 --> 00:44:48,792
Nothing's happened yet?

472
00:44:50,042 --> 00:44:52,834
- Want to switch?
- Sure.

473
00:44:57,959 --> 00:44:58,834
Did you get some rest?

474
00:44:58,876 --> 00:44:59,918
Yeah.

475
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:02,751
- You must be exhausted.
- I'm fine.

476
00:45:06,209 --> 00:45:07,417
I see a lot of cars.

477
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:08,918
Huh?

478
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:12,375
Let me see.

479
00:45:29,959 --> 00:45:30,876
Got 'em!

480
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,626
Door is closing.

481
00:45:56,209 --> 00:45:57,709
B1 level.

482
00:46:02,584 --> 00:46:03,709
What is this place?

483
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,167
What are they doing?

484
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:20,918
Please pick one.

485
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:21,999
Masks?

486
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,375
Confirmed.

487
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:00,876
We'll begin the auction.

00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:17,667
An Auction?

493
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:21,167
What do you mean, auction?

494
00:47:21,542 --> 00:47:22,709
No way...

495
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:24,542

Born through surrogacy.

503
00:47:48,209 --> 00:47:51,584
Neither biological parent

504
00:47:51,959 --> 00:47:53,584
Top 1% genes.

505
00:47:53,626 --> 00:47:55,918

Partial refunds may be available

512
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:18,000
Are there any genetic defects?

513
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:22,083
A gene for ischemic heart disease
was found on the paternal side,

514
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:24,459
but was safely removed
during cell culture.

515
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,459

510 million?

523
00:48:45,876 --> 00:48:47,292
Can someone explain?

524
00:48:47,709 --> 00:48:49,918
Wait, so...

525
00:48:50,709 --> 00:48:52,250
The parents who abandoned us...

526
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,999
Did they buy us like this?

527
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,083
My mom...

528
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:04,167
She was one of them?

529
00:49:04,918 --> 00:49:05,918

Everyone remember
boy genius Song Yoo-jun?

534
00:49:29,959 --> 00:49:32,209
We secured his DNA
after great effort.

535
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:35,000
Same birth mother as the first item,

536
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:37,542

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,459
955 million!

552
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,918
955, 955!

553
00:50:14,959 --> 00:50:16,918
955 million, sold!

554
00:50:43,459 --> 00:50:46,459
Told you we got a good one.

555
00:50:46,876 --> 00:50:49,083
We can refund the other one now.

556
00:50:50,584 --> 00:50:53,292
Yeah, file a refund.
She's useless, anyway.

557
00:51:20,584 --> 00:51:21,834
What?

558
00:51:30,209 --> 00:51:34,125
The Defects - Epilogue

559
00:51:35,959 --> 00:51:37,918
Congrats on 1st place, Yoon-seo.

560
00:51:37,959 --> 00:51:39,542
You did amazing too.

561
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:40,500
Thank you.

562
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,375
Hello, Ah-hyeon's mom.

563
00:51:45,417 --> 00:51:47,918
Congrats, Yoon-seo's mom.
Congrats, Yoon-seo.

564
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:50,000
Thank you.

565
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,334
- Congrats, Yoon-seo.
- Bye.

566
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:55,709
- We'll see you later.
- Take care.

567
00:51:55,751 --> 00:51:57,876
Congrats on 1st place, Yoon-seo!

568
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,209
Ah-hyeon.

569
00:52:10,959 --> 00:52:11,918
Yeah?

570
00:52:12,751 --> 00:52:13,918
This is a joke to you?

571
00:52:14,417 --> 00:52:15,918
This is a competition.

572
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:17,626
It's a battle.

573
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:20,250
It's about standing at the top.

574
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:21,626
It's survival.

575
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,918
And today,

576
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:28,209
I congratulated Yoon-seo's mom.

577
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:30,500
Do you know what that means?

578
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:35,918
Because of you,

579
00:52:36,959 --> 00:52:39,500
I became lower than that woman.

580
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:40,918
Because of you,

581
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:43,542
she's now above me.

582
00:52:48,709 --> 00:52:51,542
Do you know why adults give
2nd and 3rd place trophies too?

583
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,918
Why?

584
00:52:53,959 --> 00:52:57,375
Because saying 2nd and 3rd are great
makes 1st place shine even brighter.

585
00:52:57,417 --> 00:53:00,334
1st place stands above
the 2nd and 3rd.

586
00:53:00,792 --> 00:53:02,584
Why do they announce 3rd place first?

587
00:53:02,959 --> 00:53:05,042
So that the 1st place is more glorified.

588
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:09,083
Normally, shouldn't the best go first?

589
00:53:09,959 --> 00:53:12,751
Still, I did better than 3rd place.

590
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:16,000
That's unimportant.

591
00:53:16,876 --> 00:53:19,751
The point is you're not 1st.

592
00:53:19,792 --> 00:53:21,209
You lost to Yoon-seo again.

593
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:24,000
I never lost to Yoon-seo.

594
00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:26,125
What?

595
00:53:26,167 --> 00:53:27,999
We never even competed.

596
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,542
You've been competing with me.

597
00:53:37,876 --> 00:53:38,918
What?

598
00:53:38,959 --> 00:53:40,250
I knew something was off.

599
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:44,918
Your grades and skills are similar to hers.
Not much different.

600
00:53:45,751 --> 00:53:47,250
Yet you always come 2nd.

601
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:49,417
And Yoon-seo always comes 1st.

602
00:53:50,918 --> 00:53:53,667
It's like you've been aiming
to come 2nd every time.

603
00:53:54,876 --> 00:53:56,667
That's not true.

604
00:53:56,709 --> 00:53:58,751
She's just better than me.

605
00:53:58,792 --> 00:53:59,834
No!

606
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:04,209
You should've placed 1st
at least once by chance.

607
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:07,375
But every time,
you always came 2nd.

608
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:10,584
Like you're trying to humiliate me.

609
00:54:12,209 --> 00:54:15,083
It's not like that, Mom.

610
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:19,459
Tell me.
Who do you really want to beat?

611
00:54:20,876 --> 00:54:23,999
It's me, right?
Right, Ah-hyeon?

612
00:54:58,626 --> 00:55:01,542
The Defects

613
00:55:01,959 --> 00:55:04,792
I need you to amend a law for me.
It's urgent.

614
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:07,042
Just a few lines in the bioethics act.

615
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:09,918
It was never legal to start with.

616
00:55:09,959 --> 00:55:11,292
Us too?

617
00:55:11,334 --> 00:55:13,584
We have to face it
head-on from now.

618
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:15,751
Let's find them ourselves.

619
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:18,918
About Kwon Sung-woo...
Did he really die?

620
00:55:18,959 --> 00:55:21,792
Handle it right, Congressman.
You do your part.

621
00:55:21,834 --> 00:55:23,292
Let's start today's extraction.

622
00:55:24,209 --> 00:55:26,918
One of the samples is missing!

623
00:55:26,959 --> 00:55:28,083
We need to move fast.

624
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:31,792
Lock down the building.
Now!

625
00:55:32,584 --> 00:55:33,709
We finally meet.

626
00:55:33,751 --> 00:55:35,918
It'll shake the whole country,
won't it?

627
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,667
Masks off!

628
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:38,792
Ah-hyeon!
