The Defects

6
00:00:44,292 --> 00:00:46,834
Why is the dog barking?

7
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:54,125
You don't even greet your father?
You're worse than the dog.

8
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:58,042
H-H-Hello...

9
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:02,500
Really, huh?
S-s-stuttering again?

10
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:04,959
Where did this useless idiot come from?

11
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:11,667
Why did you even adopt that thing?

12
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:16,209
Who knew such a cute prince
would come into my life?

13
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:19,083
Eat up.

14
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:06,999
You can't speak, and now,
you can't understand either?

15
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:10,626
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from the kitchen?

16
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:13,042
Fucking bastard.

17
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,667
Piece of shit!

18
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:21,918
You're worse than a dog!

19
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,667
You can't even talk
and all you do is eat!

20
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:30,999
Didn't I say never go
near the kitchen?

21
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:35,918
S-s-sorry...
I-I'm sorry, Father...

22
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,334
Again with the stuttering!

23
00:02:39,918 --> 00:02:40,999
You bastard!

24
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:44,792
You know what?
You should bark instead.

25
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:46,999
I said, bark!

26
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:50,999
Not barking?

27
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:55,999
Bark!

28
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,167
Fucking bastard.

29
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,542
At least you don't stutter
when you bark.

30
00:03:19,584 --> 00:03:22,250
Eat this, you bastard!

31
00:03:43,584 --> 00:03:47,417
The Defects
EP6. My Real Name

32
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:50,375
We are live at the crime scene.

33
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:56,250
This is the church where it's pastor
and his wife were found brutally murdered.

34
00:03:56,667 --> 00:04:01,042
Both Mr. Yoon and his wife were stabbed
in the neck and died on site.

35
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,000
– The police have identified their son...
– Oh, no.

36
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,626
...as the prime suspect,
who went missing years ago.

37
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,667
Authorities also confirmed that
there were accomplices,

38
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,999
and are looking into
the possibility of multiple perpetrators.

39
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:16,959
Yes, Congressman.

40
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,667
The bill has passed the plenary session.

41
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,999
Thank you for your hard work.

42
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,999
Are you satisfied?
Is it all over now?

43
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,250
Over?

44
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,375
It's only just begun.

45
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:34,209
The Eye Shopping!

46
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,959
This just in.

47
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:39,334
Police have identified the suspect of
the church murder case

48
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,417
as the son of the victims who died.

49
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:47,417
They also revealed that they currently
identifying three accomplices.

50
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:48,999
We have more news coming in.

51
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:53,626
Police have identified the key suspects
of the church murder case

52
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:57,584
while investigating the area's
security camera footage.

53
00:04:57,626 --> 00:05:01,542
There are three in total,
including the son of the pastor couple.

54
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:04,999
One of them has been revealed to be
the late son of lawmaker Kwon Kang-man,

55
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,292
who took his own life after
a school violence incident.

56
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:12,209
Wife

57
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,542
Hey.

58
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,999
Darling, did you see the news?

59
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:23,500
That pastor's son...

60
00:05:24,417 --> 00:05:26,209
They say there are three accomplices...

61
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:29,292
Why is Sung-woo among them?

62
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,999
What are you talking about?

63
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:35,999
Why are police looking for him?
He should be dead!

64
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:37,626
Hold on.

65
00:05:39,584 --> 00:05:43,125
One of them has been revealed to be
the late son of lawmaker Kwon Kang-man...

66
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,959
– I'll call you back.
– who took his own life after...

67
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:47,999
Yes, Congressman.

68
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:49,542
What the hell is going on?

69
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:52,542
Why are police after Sung-woo?
Shouldn't he be dead?

70
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:54,375
How can they be chasing
a dead person?

71
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:56,918
Are you trying to screw me?

72
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,999
Congressman,
the police aren't stupid, okay?

73
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:01,999
What?

74
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,292
Speak, so I can understand!
What's going on?

75
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,792
Did you just speak down on me?

76
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,500
What?
Bitch, are you insane?

77
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,999
Who the hell let a bitch
like you loose?

78
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:17,125
Hey, I'm the one
who passed the bill.

79
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,626
How dare you talk to me like that!

80
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:22,292
Keep running your mouth
and I'll bring Sung-woo back!

81
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:23,999
Hey!

82
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,167
Fucking bitch!

83
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,918
Sorry for losing my temper, Chief.

84
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:35,542
It's fine.
Don't mind me, please...

85
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:42,667
Authorities said the security footage
confirmed the church murder case's culprits

86
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:47,999
are the same ones responsible
for the recent home invasion murder.

87
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:52,500
It has now become a serial murder case
and switched to an open investigation.

88
00:06:52,542 --> 00:06:55,209
The suspects' identities
have been partially revealed.

89
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,459
They are said to be in their early 20s...

90
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:04,542
They're literally framing it all on us.

91
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:06,000
Serial murder?

92
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:09,667
We should've killed them back then.

93
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,999
Sir, the culprits are terrifying.

94
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,459
Is there even evidence they did this?

95
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:24,042
Look. It adds up circumstantially.

96
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,959
Everyone's after them right now.

97
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,417
If it was revenge,
they would've planning it ahead.

98
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:37,042
Don't you think the crime scene
is too messy to be premeditated?

99
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,626
As if they made it messy on purpose.

100
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:42,876
I think the real suspect
is someone else.

101
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,125
Let's go.

102
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:47,167
Isn't that the Metropolitan
Investigation Unit?

103
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,751
We're taking over the investigation.

104
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:59,542
What the hell's going on?
No one told me about this.

105
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:02,792
First the home invasion murder,

106
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:04,375
and now the church murder.

107
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:07,667
Effective immediately,
this is now a serial murder case.

108
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,918
A serial murder case?
What do you...?

109
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,334
These cases are in our jurisdiction.

110
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:17,667
There's been a top-down directive.

111
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,709
Document for Transfer of Case

112
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,292
How's your son doing?

113
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:31,125
Have you chosen his school yet?

114
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,334
Yes, he's going to Harvard.

115
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:38,500
All thanks to you, Director.

116
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,209
You raised him well.

117
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,999
I just sold him for a price.

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,500
My wife and I are very satisfied.

119
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:49,709
My wife and I are very satisfied.

120
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,999
But I heard there has been
a lot of refunds.

121
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,500
Human greed has no end.

122
00:08:57,834 --> 00:09:03,167
Still, they raised them
in person since baby.

123
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,999
Raising them doesn't mean
they become your child.

124
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:10,334
They have to deliver.
Like your son, of course.

125
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:17,626
By the way, I did as you asked
with the case.

126
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:21,500
But don't you think
you're over-doing it?

127
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:25,999
There's already a detective
in that district that's been digging things.

128
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:30,667
If any trouble comes up,
I'll take care of it quietly.

129
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,167
You don't need to worry.

130
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:35,834
As you know,
an open investigation means

131
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:39,792
that the entire process must be
exposed to the media.

132
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,876
Don't you think
it could get out of hand?

133
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:44,918
Especially as it's related to
Congressman Kwon.

134
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,000
The whole country thinks
his son is dead.

135
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,751
What if they don't get arrested?

136
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:52,167
Sorry?

137
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:56,083
Just kill them.
Dead people can't be arrested.

138
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,999
Just catch them
and send them my way.

139
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:03,000
Detective

140
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:05,959
It's that detective.

141
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:08,999
What should we do?
Should we answer?

142
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,834
No, I don't think we should.

143
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,000
He sent another text.

144
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,042
This is Detective Choi Hyung-seok
from Buchon Station.

145
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:42,667
I know you're not the perpetrators.

146
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:44,334
I want to help you.

147
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,375
What do we do?

148
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:56,834
Ah-hyeon.

149
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:58,999
Can we talk for a sec?

150
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,083
Ah-hyeon.

151
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,918
If that detective...

152
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,334
...is really someone we can trust,

153
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:18,709
must we really do it ourselves?

154
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,751
Our revenge.

155
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:22,667
What do you mean?

156
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,292
We're the victims.

157
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,709
If we can prove that,
none of us have to suffer.

158
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:36,042
Before I met you and the others,
I'd never been happy.

159
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:39,209
Do you know why?

160
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:42,876
They treated me worse than a dog.

161
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,959
This is Detective Choi Hyung-seok.
I know you're not the perpetrators.

162
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:00,959
I want to help.

163
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:34,000
Have you arrived?

164
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:17,959
I, Kwon Kang-man, agree to annul
the adoption of Kwon Sung-woo

165
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:20,751
from 18 years ago,
and to discard him.

166
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:23,459
The reason is 'defective product'.

167
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,584
Damn it, this is an annoying procedure.

168
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:42,709
If you really want to help us,
do your job as police.

169
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,459
What the hell is going on?

170
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,209
Come out!
Who's in charge here?

171
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,999
How long are you going to hide?

172
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:27,334
Say or do something!

173
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,999
Due to personal reasons,
the Director will not be attending.

174
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,459
We ask for your understanding.

175
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:40,999
Unbelievable.

176
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:44,751
Over here!
Can I say something?

177
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:46,542
Yes, please go ahead.

178
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:49,542
You're aware that
the church murder case

179
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:53,375
has now become
a serial murder case, right?

180
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:55,167
Yes, I'm aware.

181
00:14:55,751 --> 00:15:00,375
Principal Han Chul-soo of Daehan Elementary
and Pastor Yoon Se-hoon and his wife.

182
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:04,999
Rumor has it all three
were clients here.

183
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,709
Are the suspects really defective products
that weren't disposed of properly?

184
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:11,083
If that's true,

185
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:14,999
doesn't that mean other defects
could be alive as well?

186
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,999
Hey, say something!

187
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,709
We've carried out the disposals
with 100% certainty.

188
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:38,584
We made sure every defects refunded
by you all were no longer breathing,

189
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:40,167
and buried them completely.

190
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,125
There's less than 1% chance

191
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:44,999
of a refunded defect to still be alive.

192
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,999
But what if we can't trust you?

193
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:51,999
There's a 1% chance that
our refunds could still be alive!

194
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:54,834
What are you going to do then?

195
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,292
Huh?
Who is that woman?

196
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:04,167
Refunded because
of killing it by accident.

197
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,000
Refunded because it didn't listen.

198
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:11,751
Refunded because it didn't grow tall.

199
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:13,876
Refunded because
it played too many games.

200
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:18,500
You had no problem refunding them
with such pathetic reasons.

201
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:22,999
And now a 1% risk
is suddenly terrifying?

202
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:27,999
You need to have faith.

203
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:35,000
If you've been hiding behind a mask
and left everything to me, then believe.

204
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:38,292
Because there's literally
nothing else you can do.

205
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,999
But if you still don't have faith...

206
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,999
I'll give you a reason to believe.

207
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:45,334
It probably won't happen,

208
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:49,209
but if your child were to
reappear right in front of you...

209
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:54,959
Ten billion won?

210
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,417
No, I'll give you a hundred billion each.

211
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:01,834
A hundred billion won?

212
00:17:01,876 --> 00:17:02,999
A hundred billion?

213
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,999
Will that be good enough?

214
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,542
Look, he's here!

215
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:15,792
– Congressman!
– Congressman!

216
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:17,999
Is it true Kwon Sung-woo is still alive?

217
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:22,334
- Please say a word!
- Congressman!

218
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:30,999
The Buchon serial murder case
has now become a public investigation.

219
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:33,417
Kim Se-hee, that crazy bitch...

220
00:17:34,459 --> 00:17:36,459
You can't go in, sir.
Stop...

221
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:39,999
What is it?

222
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:44,250
I visited once before.
Remember me?

223
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:45,999
Leave us be.

224
00:17:48,999 --> 00:17:50,125
Have a seat.

225
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:55,626
So, what brings you back?

226
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,584
I, Kwon Kang-man,
agree to annul the adoption

227
00:18:07,626 --> 00:18:10,417
of Kwon Sung-woo from 18 years ago,
and to discard him.

228
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:12,959
The reason is 'defective product'.

229
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,959
Damn it, this is an annoying procedure.

230
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:25,500
It's a scary world.

231
00:18:27,542 --> 00:18:32,999
They make disturbing fake news
like these using AI.

232
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:35,999
So your son is really dead?

233
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,918
How many times must I repeat?

234
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,999
Let it go, already!

235
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:43,042
Your son is alive.

236
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:54,999
If our Sung-woo is really alive,

237
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:58,125
bring him to me.

238
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,334
I want to see him too.

239
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:06,042
If he really is alive,

240
00:19:06,751 --> 00:19:09,999
let me meet him first.
I'm begging you.

241
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:14,375
That's all for today.

242
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:26,999
What do you think about the police's claim
that Kwon Sung-woo is alive?

243
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,959
Is it true you were
trying to gain sympathy?

244
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,167
Can you respond to the accusation
that the death was all staged?

245
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:35,292
This is your press conference.
Why won't you say anything?

246
00:19:35,334 --> 00:19:38,167
– Just a word, Congressman!
– Please, Congressman!

247
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,876
– Please say something!
– Congressman!

248
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:41,375
Please!

249
00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:57,000
Please... that's enough.

250
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:16,999
Please stop harassing my son...

251
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:21,709
He left because
I was a worthless father...

252
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:25,167
Just stop hurting him!

253
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:27,999
I beg you.

254
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:31,709
You're literally killing our son twice!

255
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:36,459
Sung-woo, I'm sorry.

256
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,792
This is all because I'm useless.

257
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:47,083
My son! I'm sorry!

258
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,334
If he were alive,

259
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:56,000
how wonderful that would be.

260
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,125
If only he was still alive...

261
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:02,584
– Sung-woo!
– Sung-woo!

262
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,542
Sung-woo...

263
00:21:14,209 --> 00:21:15,999
I'm so tired...

264
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:18,292
What do we do now?

265
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:21,999
Kim Se-hee

266
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:24,417
This bitch isn't picking up.

267
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:34,876
That detective earlier...
He seemed to know something.

268
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:37,500
What do we do?

269
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:45,167
Shit.

270
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:49,709
Let's get rid of everything.
Wipe it all.

271
00:21:57,959 --> 00:22:01,459
My son! I'm sorry!

272
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:07,999
He's not a politician.
He's an actor.

273
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:09,959
His acting's gotten better.

274
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:11,751
– Jung-hyun.
– Yes?

275
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:13,042
Do you have their location?

276
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,834
The cops pinpointed the area.
We should hear from them today.

277
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:18,751
Once they contact us,
pass it on to that guy.

278
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:22,042
He wants to find and kill his son.
We should help.

279
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:24,999
Now, let's get on with our business.

280
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:45,709
Follow me.

281
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:19,999
How's Kwon Kang-man?

282
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:22,209
He's in touch with
the Joseonjok gangsters.

283
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:26,709
Busy, I see.

284
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,834
I've assigned our guys on him.

285
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:32,834
Good. That'll be all.

286
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:48,876
Patient Kim Ah-hyeon

287
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,709
Embryo transfer procedure is ready.

288
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,667
Uncle.

289
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:17,000
If I actually do get pregnant...

290
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,709
What if...

291
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:24,417
Just what if...

292
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:28,584
If I really do have a baby...

293
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:31,250
Then...

294
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:35,542
What happens to me after that?

295
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:38,209
I should get going.

296
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:40,626
Will I be thrown away too?

297
00:25:46,999 --> 00:25:48,792
Aren't you scared, uncle?

298
00:25:50,542 --> 00:25:51,834
That Mom might abandon you?

299
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,834
Aren't you taking me there yourself?

300
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,250
I've got something to do.

301
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:12,500
Okay, bye then.

302
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:37,834
If you're looking for someone,
you've come to the right place.

303
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:42,000
The kid you asked about,
we're already on it.

304
00:27:42,584 --> 00:27:47,542
If it were just about finding him,
I wouldn't have come here.

305
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:54,876
Okay. What do you want
us to do after we find him?

306
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,918
Can you kill him for me?

307
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:19,083
I'll be right back.

308
00:28:19,834 --> 00:28:22,125
Yeah, be careful out there.

309
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:25,999
Seok-su, you're in charge.

310
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:34,876
Let's head inside.

311
00:28:49,709 --> 00:28:51,000
Location found:
Yeommi-dong industrial complex

312
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:57,542
Don't worry.
We already found him.

313
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:01,792
A runaway like him only has
so many places to go.

314
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:19,500
100 million won for killing him, right?

315
00:29:21,751 --> 00:29:23,999
Burying him will get you
100 million more.

316
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:28,918
No, dismember him or grind him up.

317
00:29:28,959 --> 00:29:30,999
Make him disappear completely,
and it's 200 million more!

318
00:29:31,417 --> 00:29:32,999
200 million more?

319
00:29:33,292 --> 00:29:35,584
Did you hear that?
200 million!

320
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:16,626
Shit, who the hell is that?

321
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:24,250
You'll help Mom, right?

322
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:27,375
You will, right?

323
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:29,751
Of course, Mom.

324
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,999
Good... Thank you.

325
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:53,999
I'm Kim Ah-hyeon.
Please help me.

326
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:19,876
Should we try calling?

327
00:31:30,918 --> 00:31:33,542
Researcher Park Sung-geun

328
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:57,834
Um...

329
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:03,626
Thank you, Ah-hyeon.

330
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:09,792
You did the right thing
to contact us.

331
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:16,083
I didn't think you'd actually come.

332
00:32:20,751 --> 00:32:22,334
Aren't you scared?

333
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:24,999
Of Mom?

334
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:31,667
Yeah, I was scared too... back then.

335
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:37,918
But the ones who should be
scared now aren't us. It's them.

336
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,209
All we have is our lives.

337
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:46,999
But that woman has
far more to lose.

338
00:33:01,542 --> 00:33:03,417
I think they've been exposed.

339
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:05,542
Kwon Kang-man is moving
toward Yeommi-dong.

340
00:33:09,918 --> 00:33:10,999
Hey, are you on your way?

341
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:13,542
Seok-su!
Get out of there, now!

342
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:16,999
You still haven't reached her?

343
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:22,999
Why haven't we started yet?

344
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:25,125
Well, Ah-hyeon hasn't arrived yet.

345
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:26,834
She's not picking up.

346
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:30,751
Ah-hyeon has been kidnapped.

347
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:38,999
Madam Lady

348
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:42,999
Yes, Kim Se-Hee speaking.

349
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:47,000
Sister, today is the blessed day.

350
00:33:47,999 --> 00:33:51,292
I wish to be there in person.
Would that be okay?

351
00:33:53,626 --> 00:33:55,999
Thank you for showing support.

352
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,999
It's best to be careful
on the day of the procedure.

353
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:02,500
Is Ah-hyeon feeling okay?

354
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:06,834
Yes, of course.
Don't worry, thank you.

355
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,209
Kidnapped?

356
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:14,918
By who?

357
00:34:16,209 --> 00:34:17,167
We'll look into it.

358
00:34:17,999 --> 00:34:20,626
- Are you sure it's kidnapping?
- Excuse me?

359
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,334
If it's kidnap, bring her in.

360
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:24,999
If not, you know what to do.

361
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:27,417
Yes, ma'am.

362
00:34:52,999 --> 00:34:54,999
Kim Ah-hyeon

363
00:34:54,999 --> 00:34:57,542
- Yes.
- Detective Choi! The kids...

364
00:34:57,584 --> 00:34:58,999
I'm almost there.

365
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:11,959
Detective Choi?

366
00:35:13,292 --> 00:35:14,500
Detective Choi!

367
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,000
You two, go down.

368
00:35:42,999 --> 00:35:44,334
Gosh...

369
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:52,999
Joo-an. So-mi.
Watch over Si-woo.

370
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,125
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

371
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:58,751
There you are, Sung-woo!

372
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,459
Your father's looking for you.

373
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:13,667
Get him!

374
00:36:32,334 --> 00:36:33,584
No!

375
00:36:34,417 --> 00:36:35,542
No!

376
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:37,250
Si-woo!

377
00:36:45,292 --> 00:36:46,834
You son of a bitch!

378
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:57,959
Seok-su!

379
00:36:58,209 --> 00:36:59,459
Seok-su!

380
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:00,999
Seok-su!

381
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,999
The polls conducted by
the Seoul Metropolitan Government

382
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:12,375
show Kim Tae-woo of
the People's Reform Party

383
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:16,959
to be leading Kwon Kang-man
of the New Future Party by 1%.

384
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:23,375
Hey, does it make sense
for me to be losing to that guy?

385
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:26,751
What kind of sampling
led to that nonsense?

386
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:28,751
Let's connect to the political desk.

387
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,459
In Kwon Kang-man's case,

388
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:37,125
he played a major role in passing the
so-called School Violence Law revision,

389
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:39,834
so expectations were very high.

390
00:37:39,876 --> 00:37:41,542
But the result turned out unexpectedly.

391
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:43,459
What?

392
00:37:44,459 --> 00:37:45,959
Hey, you bastard.

393
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:47,999
What do you mean,
sympathy votes?

394
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:51,167
You want me to go begging now?

395
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:58,334
Will sympathy votes be enough?

396
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:02,417
Losing by just one percent
means you have some popularity,

397
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:06,792
but clearly lack cohesion.

398
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,667
My poor Sung-woo...

399
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:23,500
How could he be gone?

400
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:26,334
Sung-woo...

401
00:38:28,999 --> 00:38:31,459
- Sung-woo!
- My baby...

402
00:38:35,751 --> 00:38:38,459
There you are, Sung-woo.

403
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,959
With all the other defects as well.

404
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:46,918
You're still the same, Sung-woo.

405
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,542
Why are you even alive?

406
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:54,584
Do you know what I had to do
because of you?

407
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,876
That woman's got me wrapped
around her fingers now!

408
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:07,918
How could you disappoint me
from start to end?

409
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,417
Huh?

410
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,500
Is that why you were born,
worthless bastard?

411
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:17,959
Do what you're good at.

412
00:39:19,999 --> 00:39:20,999
Bark, for me.

413
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:23,542
Bark!

414
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:24,999
You won't bark?

415
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:29,167
Then kill them.

416
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:33,959
Seok-su...

417
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:34,999
Bro, stop. Don't!

418
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:39,876
Stop it!
Stop doing that!

419
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:41,542
What are you doing?
Stop!

420
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,459
Please!

421
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,999
Father, stop! Please!

422
00:39:58,375 --> 00:40:00,167
I'm begging you.

423
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:02,500
You've learned to speak properly?

424
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:04,751
I'll die instead.

425
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:09,834
If that's what you want,
I'll die for you.

426
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:13,626
So please,
just don't hurt the others.

427
00:40:16,792 --> 00:40:18,459
The kids are leaving today.

428
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,459
It's true. I have their passports
and everything ready.

429
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,999
Please, Father.
I'm begging you.

430
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:25,125
Yeah? Really?

431
00:40:25,999 --> 00:40:27,375
You'll die for me?

432
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,542
I'd very much like that.

433
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,292
Do it.

434
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:38,959
Seok-su, Don't do it!

435
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:41,000
- Hey, don't you dare!
- What are you doing?

436
00:40:41,042 --> 00:40:43,250
Seok-su!

437
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:47,999
Don't touch it.
Let go of that. Let it go!

438
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:50,999
Put it down, damn it!

439
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,999
Put it down!
Please, put it down!

440
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:54,667
I said put it down!

441
00:40:56,334 --> 00:40:59,209
Let them go, order them.
Or I'll kill you.

442
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:00,792
Let the kids go.

443
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,834
Let them go now!

444
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:04,999
Let them go...

445
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:08,667
Run.

446
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,000
Get out.

447
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,999
Get out of here.

448
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:16,250
What are you all doing?
Get out now!

449
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:21,125
Ow! Sung-woo...
Please...

450
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:24,751
It hurts, okay?
Daddy wants you to stop.

451
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:25,876
You...

452
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,459
You never let me be happy.

453
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:33,834
I wanted to choose my happiness
over killing you.

454
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:36,999
But you made me do this.

455
00:41:45,626 --> 00:41:46,999
Seok-su!

456
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:49,125
- Bro!
- Seok-su!

457
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:51,375
Seok-su...

458
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:54,667
- Bro...
- Seok-su...

459
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,999
Hey, it's great to see you!

460
00:42:03,459 --> 00:42:05,459
- Come on.
- Seok-su...

461
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,999
What's wrong, bro?
Wake up, please...

462
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:14,918
- What do we do...
- Wake up, bro!

463
00:42:15,876 --> 00:42:16,792
Seok-su!

464
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,250
Why aren't you saying anything...

465
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:20,375
Seok-su...

466
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,375
Seok-su!

467
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:25,125
What happened?
What happened to him?

468
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:28,250
Seok-su, look at me.
Look at me, please!

469
00:42:29,209 --> 00:42:31,542
- Ah-hyeon.
- Seok-su...

470
00:42:31,918 --> 00:42:33,250
I'm okay.

471
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:38,792
Don't talk. Don't talk!
Seok-su, don't talk. You won't die.

472
00:42:38,834 --> 00:42:42,125
It's okay. I'm good.

473
00:42:43,918 --> 00:42:45,792
We're all together again.

474
00:42:47,918 --> 00:42:50,083
Seok-su...

475
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:52,209
- I feel good.
- Don't die on us...

476
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:55,999
That's my real name.

477
00:42:55,999 --> 00:42:57,292
Seok-su...

478
00:42:57,334 --> 00:43:00,417
Fuck you, bastards!

479
00:43:00,959 --> 00:43:02,167
Seok-su...

480
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:03,709
My name's Seok-su.

481
00:43:07,125 --> 00:43:10,626
Seok-su! Seok-su!

482
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:14,876
Wake up!

483
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:18,834
Bro... No, bro...

484
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:21,751
Bro, please...

485
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:24,667
Wake up, please...

486
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:28,918
Seok-su...

487
00:43:30,584 --> 00:43:33,834
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

488
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,000
Seok-su, I'm sorry...

489
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,250
Ah-hyeon...

490
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,500
Ah-hyeon! Ah-hyeon!

491
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:53,834
Why are you doing this to us?

492
00:44:04,584 --> 00:44:06,999
Ah-hyeon... Ah-hyeon!

493
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:47,999
Ah-hyeon... Ah-hyeon...

494
00:44:48,292 --> 00:44:49,834
Seok-su...

495
00:44:57,999 --> 00:44:59,083
Wake up, bro...

496
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:37,334
The Defects

497
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:39,999
I promised we'd live
a free and normal life.

498
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:43,834
Did you lose them,
or did you let them go?

499
00:45:43,876 --> 00:45:47,125
Mom's not really our mom.
You should stop too.

500
00:45:48,334 --> 00:45:52,542
Your husband's DNA
is in my daughter, okay?

501
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:55,626
That shows your love for her
is less than 1 billion won.

502
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:56,999
Just refund her.

503
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,999
What is this 'D-day'?

504
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:00,626
Just one left now?

505
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:04,334
Please help Eun-jo
and the other kids to live on.
