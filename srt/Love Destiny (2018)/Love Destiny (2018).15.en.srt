What did he bring for you?

you will feel cold

Lady Champa

220
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,200

We just lost the head of the household,

but I'm sure Lady Champa

271

will kindly continue to keep us around.

272
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,680
We are servants, Prik.

273
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,440
We have to stay with them until we die.

274

Where else could we go?

275
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,680

We are lucky

to be servants

Are you saying that
Lady Champa is a devil?

281
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,800
Did I say that, Chik?

282
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,840
Not directly.

283
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,680
At the market, people are saying that

284
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,440
King Narai is sick.

285
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,880
We say "in poor health."

Boong, use the right term.

287
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,800
How is it different?

288
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,560
I'm going to see Lady Champa.

289
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,560
You're not upset at her
anymore, aren't you?

I'm not upset.

292

She suspected me

293
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,720
because I was the only one

294
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,840
who could go in and out of her bedroom.

295
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,280
[Prik] That's why she accused me.

296

If she hadn't

297
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,120
but thought of me as a thief,

298
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
how could we still live
under the same roof?

We live in their house.

We eat from the same pot.

302
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,640
It's not that big of a deal to be accused
of stealing for just a few days.

00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,440
Yes.

I'm not an heir to the throne

352

[tense music]

354
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,280
[Phetracha] They forced monks to leave
the monkhood and do slave labor.

355
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,000
That's demeaning.

356

But what we should be worried about
are their armed soldiers

at the Bangkok fortress.

He doesn't allow anyone to see him,

But you still need to be careful.

00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,920
that you think I should do,

506
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,800
I want you to know that

507
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,160
it's not because I want to be in power...

508
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,360
But because there's a situation

509
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,240
that will bring disaster to our country.

Get out of the way.

Why? Why are you scared of them?

-Do you want to die?

00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,880
Prik, look at his eyes.

547
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,080
[Chuang] He looks really angry.

548
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,000
I'll take responsibility
for whatever happens.

-[Prik] Go!
-[Phaulkon] I said stop!

554
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,480
Take the one who threw it

00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,400
to flog him 20 times.

556
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,480
Then, throw him in jail.

[tense music]

558
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,840
Don't do that to him! How could you?

00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960

I'm a citizen of Ayutthaya.

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,120
You will die soon.

567
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,440
-What?
-[Choi] Prik.

Well,

574
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,600
I really wanted to climb up the litter.

575
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,320
[Choi] Really?
And what would you do to him?

576
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,480
[Prik] Hey, Choi.

577
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,880
I was going to kick him.

578
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,200
Good. And you would get beheaded for that.

579

-[all chuckling]
-Well, well.

580
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,000
-Or you might end up being at the temple.
-Why, Chik?

581
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,400
Well, to have the monks chant
for you since you would be dead.

-[all chuckling]
-You brat! You're so rude.

Prik.

584
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,320
Does he even realize

585
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,920
that people hate him and his men so much?

586
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,800
-He will get beaten up one day.
-Oh.

587
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,720
[Prik] And listen to me carefully.
I will be one of those...

588
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,160
who will kick his butt.

[ominous music]

591
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,000
[Lord Rueang] King Narai is
in poor health.

592
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,440
He cannot perform his duties.

593
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,760
Duke Wichayen has been gaining
more and more power every day

594
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,520
since he was promoted to
Chancellor of Interior

595
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,800
and became in charge of all civil affairs.

596
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,440
Our people...

597
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,720
are being badly oppressed.

598
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
[tense music]

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,120
Karaked.

600
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,360
Yes?

601
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,920
Can you tell us now?

602
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,120
What did you hear

603
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,520
when you spied on Phaulkon and Desfarges?

604
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,920
[tense music]

605
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,080
Yes, I'll tell you now.

606
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,280
I heard them talking about soldiers.

607
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,320
General Desfarges is going
to bring French soldiers here

608
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,600
when Duke Wichayen sends
a messenger to him.

609
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,040
[tense music]

610
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,600
They must have planned something vicious.

611
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,240
Don't you think so, Dech?

612
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,920
Listen to Karaked first.

613
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,600
I'm sure she has more to say.

614
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,760
[ominous music]

615
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,720
Duke Wichayen said that

616
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,520
the King's health is in a critical state.

617
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,920
And their scheme

618
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,480
will be carried out soon.

619
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,280
[both] A rebellion?

620
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,200
[tense music]

621
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,400
I heard that a group of people
have been planning for an uprising.

622
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,600
Who are those people?

623
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,120
His brothers, Prince Noi

624
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,880
and Prince Apaiyatot.

625
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,240
[Lord Rueang] They have
gathered so many people.

626
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,680
We don't know when
they're going to stage a rebellion.

627
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,040
Also, Duke Wichayen
is supporting Prince Pi.

628
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,440
He could eventually convince
the prince to total conversion.

629
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:37,440
Where would Prince Pi
get military forces to stage a rebellion?

630
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,560
He needs a force.

631
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,480
He has his men in Phitsanulok.

632
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,240
What about Earl Phetracha?

633
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,560
[tense music]

634
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,320
[tense music continues]

635
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,880
I think it's time.

636
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,920
[woman 1] King Narai hasn't recovered yet.

637
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,400
That's why it's the right time to act.

638
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,680
That foreigner is supporting Prince Pi.

639
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,600
We have to get rid of Prince Pi
so that he won't have a puppet.

640
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,040
Because in fact,

641
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,760
Duke Wichayen is the one
who wants the throne.

642
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,800
[woman 2] Prince Pi has never shown up
in front of people.

643
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,840
How are we going to kill him?

644
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,080
We need to use someone close to him

645
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,560
or someone he respects to lure him out.

646
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,120
[action music]

647
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,600
I have been opposed to the King's idea

648
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,520
of bringing the French soldiers
into our country.

649
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,360
At the moment, the French
have control over our people.

650
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,520
They belittle,

651
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,280
disdain,

652
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,920
and patronize us.

653
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,920
[Phetracha] I only have one purpose

654
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,320
and one purpose alone,

655
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,160
and that is to liberate Ayutthaya
from the French's influence.

656
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
[action music]

657
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,600
[Phetracha] Duke Kosathibodi,

658
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,680
Prince Pi respects you.

659
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,000
Even Prince Noi

660
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,200
and Prince Apaiyatot

661
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:00,960
have been good friends with you
since they were little.

662
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,960
If you do not side with the French

please do as I ask.

I respect you as if
you are one of my relatives.

667
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:21,080
You know, everyone in this kingdom
thinks that you are on my side.

668
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,760
If someone else happens to be in power,

669
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,960
I don't think they will let you
and your family go that easily.

[tense music]

671

This is difficult for me,

672
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,240
because I know everyone involved.

673
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,680
Even when it comes to Duke Wichayen,

674
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,120
I still don't believe

675
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:47,080
that he wants to overthrow King Narai.

676
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,440
At this rate, you still don't believe it?

677

execute one of my men

the same thing to me,

but I didn't do such a thing to him.

I think I'll have to

691
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,680
get rid of that lord.

I feel awful about this.

698
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,640
I've told you so many times

699
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:29,800
to trust me.

700
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,840
I'm short and deformed.

How could I be a king?

702
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,160
[Shorty] I also don't have
any manpower here.

703
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,320
The only manpower I have
is in Phitsanulok.

704
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:42,560
I have.

705

Your soldiers

706

are in Bangkok, which is so far away.

707

They will come here

as soon as I call for them.

709
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,880
Prince Apaiyatot, the King's brother,

710
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,320
insulted me, saying...

711
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,960
"Shorty,

712
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,520
don't even think about it.

You have no right to it."

He knows full well that you do.

[Phaulkon] Prince Pi.

716
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,840
Even King Narai would give you the throne,

if he were conscious.

You are destined to be the new king.

Earl Phetracha and Count Sorasak?

I don't know how

before you came here.

733
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,960
But here,

734
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,360
we have to make sure that
we and our family survive,

735
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,280
even if it means that
we have to get our hands dirty.

The kingdom is in turmoil at the moment.

737
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,280
I think

738
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,840
Earl Phetracha will be
the one who can save it.

739

[Dech] If we are talking about rights,

740
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,080
Count Sorasak also has the right
as much as anyone else.

741
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,080
Also,

742
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,720
Prince Pi,

743
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,360
though he has the right to the throne,

744
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,400
he has already converted.

745
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,120
He would only enhance
the outsiders' power.

Those men are their opponents.

00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,440
Why would Earl Phetracha

keep them around

And if he doesn't,

769

we can't get rid of Prince Pi

He doesn't want to join us

773
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,640
because he doesn't believe

774
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,000
that Duke Wichayen
could betray King Narai.

that Duke Wichayen definitely could,

as sure as eggs are eggs.

You're saying odd things again.

I don't want to hear something like that.

782

Here's the thing.

783
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,560
You go and tell Lord Pan

784
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,960
that what Duke Wichayen is doing

785
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:19,040
is something that will threaten
this kingdom.

[Karaked] If we don't stop him,

787

Ayutthaya would definitely
fall into chaos.

He will give this land to his master.

791
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,840
To the King of his country, of course.
What else would it be?

[tens music]

793

That's right.

794
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,160
We have proof.

795
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,680
What proof?

796
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,960
Someone secretly wrote a letter

797
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,720
to a priest

798
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,520
who is a royal mentor of Louis XIV.

799
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,760
It was given to him discreetly.

800
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,880
What did the letter say?

801
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:10,840
It said

802
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,880
that he would do anything

803
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,360
for the benefit of the French companies.

804
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,720
He will make Bangkok and Myeik

805
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,920
fall under French influence.

806
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,960
[Dech] It also said

807
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,760
the King of this land is on his deathbed.

808
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:32,640
He is looking for someone he can use
as a puppet to take over Siam.

809
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,560
Wait.

810
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,640
What did you say they will take over?

811
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,400
Siam.

812
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,360
That's what they call us.

813
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,120
Why do they call us "Siam?"

814
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,120
This land is called Ayutthaya.

815
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,800
That's right.

816
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,680
This is bizarre.

817
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,440
Most importantly,

818
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,760
the letter said that

819
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,360
the King would have to grant him
the absolute power to rule this land,

820
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,680
and that he would do everything
for the sake of France,

821
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,160
including turning this land

822
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,880
into a land of Christians.

823
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,240
[tense music]

824

I loathe them all.

825
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,280
And I will drive all of them
out of Ayutthaya.

826
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
[tense music]

827
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,080
By the way, Dech,

828
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,920
you said you have proof.

829
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:29,960
[Lord Pan] What kind of proof?

830
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,840
If that letter had been sent secretly,
how did you know about it? Hmm?

831
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,880
Actually, Karaked did.

832
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,760
[tense music]

[tense music continues]

834
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,960
[Karaked] The proof is that

835
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,040
someone found the letter.

836
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,360
I don't know how to prove it to you,

837
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,440
but it's true.

838
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,400
The letter is real,

839
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,240
and it's in Duke Wichayen's handwriting.

840
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,960
I believe you.

841
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,840
I believe you the same way
Master believes you.

842
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,080
I have no doubt about it.

843
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,680
Are you sure about this, Lady Karaked?

844
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,920
I'm sure about this more than anything.

845
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,800
[Lord Pan] What about King Narai,
Lady Karaked?

846
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,520
Does he know about their plans?

847
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,720
There's no proof

848
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,760
that King Narai agrees with Duke Wichayen,

849
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,480
no matter how much the King favors him.

850
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:46,160
I believe the King allowed him

851
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,360
to bring 700 to 800 soldiers
into Ayutthaya.

852
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,760
I believe he allowed them
to dock those ships and terrify us.

853
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,480
[Phetracha] I feel terribly sorry for him,

854
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,760
but I cannot let him
stay on the throne anymore.

855

[Sorasak scoffs]

857
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,680
Father,

858
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,120
King Narai has been
in poor health for months.

859
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,880
Why are you hesitating?

860
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,240
[sighs]

861
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,760
[Phetracha] Constance is getting
more and more impudent every day.

862
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:36,120
Does he think that
nobody here can stop them?

863
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,080
Do they think we are so stupid

864
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,480
that we will let them
take over our land so easily?

865
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,160
Not all of us are the same as King Narai.

866
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,760
I must do this,

867
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,920
even though I don't want to.

868
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,800
[tense music]

869
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,400
What kind of a man

870
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,800
do you think

871
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,360
a king should be?

872
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,440
[tense music]

873
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,880
Then what do you think, Lady Karaked?

874
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,960
If I...

875
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,800
ever got a chance to meet

876
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,360
a king

877
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,040
or two kings,

878
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,560
I would tell them

879
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,000
that kings should possess

880
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,720
the Tenfold Virtue of the Ruler.

[tense music]

Do you have anything else to tell us?

883
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,280
I do.

884
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,240
I'm listening.

885
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:14,040
Duke Wichayen is going to be defeated

886
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,560
and punished for what he has done.

887
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,120
But his wives and children
have nothing to do with it.

888
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,840
I think...

889
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,640
they should be spared.

890

[soft chuckle]

894
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,520
Having a resourceful wife is enviable?

895
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,480
I think it's actually sad.

to bring his men to Lavo.

What about it?

1009
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,560
You know how unstable
the situation in Siam is right now.

it is in turmoil, especially in Lavo.

[Lord Pan] If you go there,

it might worsen the situation.

I've heard that thousands of people
are waiting to stop you on the way.

01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:52,640
Even if you have deadly weapons,

1015
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:56,360
you still can't defeat
thousands of people.

You mean Duke Wichayen?

If you take

You make a good point.

You should take your men back to Bangkok.

You are their commander. You know that
this will lead them to their doom.

Yes, Mother.

My lord.

1160
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,800

I have to go to Lavo

1164
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:15,880
with Lord Pan and Rueang today.

1165
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:18,160
What?

1166
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,640
Can't you go there tomorrow?

1167
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,160
I can't.

1168
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,280
I have to go there as soon as possible.

1169
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,000
Please take care of Karaked for me.

1170
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,240
This time, I might be gone
for several days.

1171
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,880
What is it about?

1172
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,200
A state affair.

1173
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,760
Please take care of Lady Mali
and her children.

Really?

He is in serious condition.

1181
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:23,400
That's why he's calling for you.

He is still alive?

1183

Why

1184
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,320
do you say such ominous things?

1185
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,760

to rule over the kingdom yourself.

Please show him mercy one last time.

You became an ambassador because of him.

1487
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,840
but she refused.

1488
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:35,440
She is strong-willed.

1489
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:39,160
That's the right thing for her to do.

1490
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:42,440
[tranquil music]

-Excuse me.
-[Lord Pan] Wait.

1492
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,040
[Lord Pan] Can you answer a question?

1493
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:57,080
You know

1494
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,480
what I'm going to ask.

1495
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,240
How did you know about that matter?

1496
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:03,680
[tense music]

1497
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,600
You have to answer that.

1498
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,920
I will, but...

1499
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:13,480
I'm just thinking
because it's hard to explain.

1500
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,040
[Dech] Even if it's hard,
you still have to answer.

1501
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:19,920
I know.

1502
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:23,800
[sighs]

1503
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:27,320
It's because

1504
01:42:28,120 --> 01:42:31,520
the era where I was actually born in
before I came here

1505
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,560
is an era in the future.

1506
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,640
[tense music]

1507
01:42:36,720 --> 01:42:37,600
What?

1508
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:42,040
Are you saying that

1509
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:45,800
you were born in the future

1510
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:48,360
and then went back in time

1511
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,760
to be reborn in the past?

1512
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,640
Yes.

1513
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,920
I was reborn here.

1514
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:56,640
I'm going to believe you

1515
01:42:57,560 --> 01:42:59,160
without any doubt.

1516
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:02,600
But I have to ask.

1517
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:05,400
Do people in the future

1518
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:09,640
know all the things
that happened in this era?

1519
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,680
Yes, they know everything.

1520
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:15,800
[Dech] Everything?

1521
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:17,800
Who told them?

1522
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,480
[giggles]

1523
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,720
Why are you laughing?

[sighs]

1525
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:27,360
Who told them?

1526
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:31,960
There are things called chronicles,

1527
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,480
research,

1528
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:35,240
analyses,

1529
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,880
testimonies,

1530
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:40,920
and written records that were passed down.

1531
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:44,120
Is that what you call

1532
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:46,360
his...

1533
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,160
"history", right?

1534
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,960
Yes, that's right.

1535
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,200
So, you know...

1536
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,640
the history of everyone?

1537
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,720
Not everyone.

1538
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:01,680
Just the important ones,

1539
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:05,800
like Lord Lek and Lord Pan.

1540
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:09,840
You two are well-known in my era.

1541
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,880
People call you "Kosa Lek" and "Kosa Pan."

[giggles]
You?

1544
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,480
There are records of you too,

1545
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:27,520
because you were the third minister
in Lord Pan's mission.

1546
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:33,200
What about my father?

1547
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,640
What does history say about him?

1548
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:38,360
That he was the one
who wrote the book, Jindamanee.

1549
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,320
They still use that book in your era?

1550
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:44,880
Not anymore.

1551
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:48,640
There are new ones but they are
written based on Jindamanee

1552
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:51,040
with added alphabets

1553
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,120
from 37 to 44.

1554
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:56,600
Hmm.

1555
01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:00,560
And how did you get here?

1556
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:03,720
Lord Pan.

1557
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,840
You said you wouldn't ask about that.

1558
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,680
Oh, that's true.

1559
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:10,960
And I don't even know how to answer that.

[Dech] How many years have passed
since then?

01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:16,800
Yes.

1564
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:19,120
Between our era and your era.

1565
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:22,960
You want the exact number?

1566
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:27,080
It's actually 329 years.

[Lord Rueang] And I adored Karaked.

01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:39,160
It's not Rueang?

When I went back there,

1655
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:54,080
I saw you in his body.

1656
01:51:56,280 --> 01:51:57,560
Me?

01:51:58,840 --> 01:51:59,720
Yes.

The reason I was reborn here in the past

1660
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:10,040
is probably because Rueangrit
got ordained to make offerings for me.

1661
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:15,320
So, I named our sons after him
as a reminder

1662
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:20,320
of how much
their father loved their mother.

1663
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:24,200
His love for her could turn back time

1664
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,640
and make them end up together.

If this is our love's destiny,

01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,800
I'm sure

1669
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,240
I'll find you and be with you

1670

What?

1676
01:53:17,080 --> 01:53:19,240
I'll be reborn as a seahorse.

A seahorse?

1678

Oh, a seahorse.

1679
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:29,360
Then I'll be reborn as a male seahorse,

1680
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:32,560
use his tail to grasp
that female seahorse,

and take her down into the deep ocean

to be with him forever.
