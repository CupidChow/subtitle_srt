that Lady Karaked, the daughter
of Marquess Horathibodi's friend,

had an argument with Count Surasakorn

That's why she was so jealous
that she tried

You need to say it clearly

because the Kritsana Kali spell is not
something to be said lightly.

332
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,440
Prik, what were you saying about me?

333
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,280
I was telling the truth
that you won't die anyway.

334
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,880
Why did I say that?

335
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
Are you trying to pick a quarrel
with a servant?

336
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,200
She was just relaying what you said.

337
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,840
What did I say?

338
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,840
Don't talk back at me.
That's incredibly rude.

339
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,640
I'm not hungry. So I told her that.

340
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
But when I saw her hurrying off like that,

341
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,120
I figured she would say
bad things about me.

342
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,160
Have you?

343
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,600
I just relayed what you said.

344
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,320
What did I say?

345
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,720
You said you wouldn't die anyway,

346
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,080
although you're in dire straits.

347
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,560
I'm in dire straits?

348
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,720
Yes.

349
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,840
Are you crazy?
Why would I be in dire straits?

350
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,200
Then what is the reason
why you're not eating dinner?

351
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
[quirky music]

352
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,480
I didn't say, "I'm in dire straits."
I said, "I'm on a diet."

353
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,840
There. She said it again.

354
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,520
It's called "diet."

355
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,640
Well, what is the meaning of "diet",

356
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,120
if it doesn't mean, "in dire straits"?

357
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,840
[Horathibodi] Champa.

358
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,760
Enough with the never-ending arguments.
Let's eat.

359
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,360
-But I'm curious.
-You can ask her later.

360
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,200
This is the time for dinner.

361
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:36,520
If you go on and on about this,
we might not get to eat at all.

362
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
[calm music]

363

[sighs]

365
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,320
Karaked asked me
to use Kritsana Kali spell on her.

366
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,760
Why is that?

367
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,680
Karaked.

368
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,440
Both Lady Champa and <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i> think
I'm a ghost possessing Karaked's body.

369
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,360
Really?

370
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,120
They are still saying that?

371
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,760
Lord Hora, please use the spell on me.

372
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,880
If I can't take it, I'll leave.

373
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,840
How arrogant of you.

374
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,920
<i><font color="white">Khun Pi.</font></i>

375
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,080
Karaked.

376
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,080
You need to be careful with what you say.

377
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,960
Yes, I will.

378
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,520
What do you think, Dech?

379
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,040
It's up to you, Father.

380
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,880
The spell is not something
to be done lightly.

381
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,320
You can't just use it
without proper reason.

382
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,000
If there's an ominous mishap,
the spell will reverse

383
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,800
to the one who's doing it instead.

384
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,040
Then you don't have to do it.

385
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,160
I can assure you I am Ketsu--

386

[foreboding music]

387
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,120
I am the real Karaked.

388
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,720
You are not making sense.

389
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
What is wrong with you, huh?

390
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,280
You weren't hurt by the spell last time.

391
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,880
[Horathibodi] That means
you didn't kill Daeng.

392
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
Therefore...

393
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,040
I believe you this time.

394
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,720
Thank you.

I respect

My lady.

Why are you crying?

00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,960
[Yaem] Please tell us.

00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,600
We will try to make you feel better.

[all sobbing]

411
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,920
[Champa] Even though the spell
didn't hurt her

412
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,960
or whatever you say,

413
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,480
I believe she is possessed.

414
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,760
I don't think so.

415
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,200
She is just confused because of the spell.

416
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:18,040
I think she had some malicious thoughts
towards Lady Chanwad.

417
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,840
But she didn't mean to kill her.

418
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,880
Perhaps the boat sank

419
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,800
by accident.

420
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,280
[Dech] Do you know for sure

421
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,800
or are you just saying that
to stop the quarrel?

422
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,360
She has gone crazy.

423
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,680
It's not what you are thinking.

424
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,200
She will get better soon. Trust me.

425
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,920
How can you be so sure about that?

426
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,640
Judging by the way she talks,

427
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,400
she has definitely gone crazy.

503
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,440
Excuse me. Please let me through.

504
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,960
What were you saying?

505
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,280
I'm going up to my bedroom.
Please make a way.

506
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:50,160
You are smiling.

507
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,680
What are you thinking?

508
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,840
Why do I have to tell you?

509
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,360
What you did back there

510
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,320
was distasteful.

511
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,120
Don't you know

512
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,280
that women
shouldn't wave their hands to people?

513
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,400
-Well--
-The other day,

514
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,960
you waved to the soldiers
at Petch Fortress.

[scoffs]

516
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,960
Soon you would wave to anyone
in the kingdom.

517
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,080
What you just did too...

518
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,320
If you aren't a ghost
possessing Karaked's body,

519
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,560
then you shouldn't act so strange

520
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,360
like you are from Himavanta Forest.

521
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,800

522
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,120

Mr. Dech.

I mean, <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>.

525
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,040
You know about the magical forest?

526
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,960
Or have you been there?

527
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,320
Do you want the lamp? It's dark.

528
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,400
Be careful not to fall down.

529
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,080

[playful music]

534
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,240
Then, you should go to sleep.

00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,120
Not yet.

Hey.

539
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,440
Take it. I made it for you.

I can't use this.

544
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,120
Maybe I can use it to wipe my mouth.

My lady.

552

We have to get ready early tomorrow.

553
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,560
Where are we going?

554
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
We are going to a religious ceremony
at Duke Kosathibodi's house.

00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,760
He is the father of Lady Chanwad.

Duke Kosathibodi,

558
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,000
whose real name is Lek, right?

559
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,440
Or is it the younger brother, Pan?

560
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,600
The one whose name is Lek.

561
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,360
Pan is his brother.

562
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,440
I'm so happy.

563
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,120
I get to see him in the flesh.

Now I don't feel so weird down there.

582
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,920
I don't want the ground to see.

583
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,800
[both] The ground to see?

-I know.

00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,000
This kind of blouse is worn
when going to temples, right?

587
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,160
And what kind of ceremony is being held

588
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,640
at Lady Chanwad's house?

589
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,640
[both] A religious ceremony.

00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,960
Mm-hmm. See?

00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,840
-But I think--
-Oh, people are leaving.

00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,760
We should go
or they might not wait for us.

[both] Oh, no.

594
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,120
Yaem, I told you not
to let her dress herself.

595
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,880
You think you can stop her?

596
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,400
Go. Hurry. Her <i><font color="white">chang kben</font></i> is uneven.

-[Yaem and Pin] My lady.

-[Yaem] Be careful, my lady.
-[Pin] My lady.

00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,240
-Don't run.
-Slow down.

600
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,040
I knew it was Karaked.

601
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,400
Her steps are so loud like horse hooves.

602
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,200
Where do you think you're going?

603
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,280
Why are you dressed so nicely?

604
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,760
-I thought I had to go too.
-Go?

605
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,120
Where?

606
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,320
What now, Champa?

607
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,720
Dech.

608
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,040
I don't think you should go.

609
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,240
I shouldn't go?

610
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,560
You can read, right?

611
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,160
You should go to the library.

612
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,400
It's fine.

613
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,200
I'm sorry. I thought...

614
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,160
The host didn't invite you.

615
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,680
How did you get the wrong idea?

616
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,320
I'm sorry.

617
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,520
Since she's already dressed,
I think she can come with us.

618
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:55,480
It's an auspicious event.
A lot of people are coming.

619
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,200
Pin, Yaem.

620
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:01,080
[Champa] You think you're so smart?

621
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,560
Who said your lady can go?

622
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,200
[sighs]
All right, let's go.

623
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,720
Karaked, come with us.
I will allow you to come.

624
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,440
Then hurry up already.
Don't just stand there dumbfoundingly.

625
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,240
Prik, Chuang. Come.

626
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,400
Yes, my lady.

627
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,240
Let's go.

628
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,280
-Lord Hora.
-[Horathibodi] Yes?

629
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:31,240
I want to read in your library.

630
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,760
Stop being capricious.

631
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,240
Why? Do you want me to go?

632
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,480
What is going on with you two?

633
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,400
She said she wants to stay at home.

634
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,200
Is that so?

635
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,640
Suit yourself.

636
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,360
Are you happy now?

637
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,520
[Yaem] Oh, no, my lady.

638
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:08,480
What did you say?

639
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,600
My lord.

640
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,600
The boat is ready.

641
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,760
-[Dech] Mm-hm.
-[Choi] Yes, my lord.

642
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,960
I'm more and more annoyed by her.

643
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,120
In the past...

644
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,120
[scoffs]

645
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,720
She was wicked,

646
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,520
foulmouthed, cruel to servants,

647
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,920
impatient,

648
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,720
and deceptive.

649
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,720
But back then,
she never hid her true color.

650
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,320
Whatever bad deeds she did,
you could see it as plain as day.

651
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,080
[Champa] But right now...

652
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,360
[Champa sighs]

653
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,760
I don't even know what she is thinking
when she's talking.

654
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,400
[Champa] That's what I think.

655
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,160
Champa.

656
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,240
I don't think so.

657
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,640
[Horathibodi] I think she has changed
for the better.

658
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,600
Her actions have good intentions now.

659
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,640
When I look at her,
I see a more honest woman.

660
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:28,520
Mm. If you were kinder to her,

661
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,440
you might see her the way I do.

662
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,720
[Champa sighs]

663
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,520
Dech, what do you think?

664
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,040
I don't want to talk about her.

665
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,120
[light music]

666
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,280
-My lady.
-My lady.

667
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,560
Pin, Yaem.

668
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:09,760
[both] Yes?

669
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,120
Go get someone to row the boat for me.

670
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,320
-[Yaem and Pin gasp]
-My lady.

671
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,360
-My lady.
-Be careful.

672
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,800
We can't do that.

673
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,480
Why not?

674
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,640
Nobody would do that.

675
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,680
They're afraid to be whipped.

676
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,960
Then the two of you
can row the boat for me.

677
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,080
[both gasp]

678
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,800
[both] We can't do that.
We won't row the boat.

679
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,960
Do you dare to disobey me?

680
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,800
[both gasp, whimper]

681
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,480
[both] No.

682
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,720
-But I won't do it no matter what.
-[both] I won't do it.

683
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,360
Then I'll do it myself.

684
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,400
Are you going to do it willingly

685
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,600
or do I have to force you?

686
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,880
[light music]

687
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,960
[Karaked giggles]

688
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,640
What's the canal next to our house called?

689
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,800
[Yaem] It's Kleab Canal.

690
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,200
Kleab Canal.
So we are in Chao Phraya River.

691
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,480
[laughs]

692
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,480
Is there a dam around here?

693
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,960
Where is it?

694
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,360
You mean the dam?

695
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,120
It's over there.

696
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,760
We have to pass the Royal Palace first.

697
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,640
Over there?

698
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,480
Oh, right.

699
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,200
[Karaked] Because Chaiwatthanaram
is over here.

700
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,480
We passed it the other day.
[laughs]

701
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,920
It was designed in Khmer style.

702
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,920
So there's no ordination hall.

703
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,920
But there's a central <i><font color="white">prang</font></i>.

704
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,560
[professor 1] <i><font color="white">Chaiwatthanaram
was the royal temple in Ayutthaya era.</font></i>

705
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:26,080
King Prasat Thong wished to build
this temple on his mother's land.

706
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,800
It is presumed that

707
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,440
the temple was built as
a symbol of the kingdom's victory over--

708
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,280
-The Khmer Kingdom.
-Good.

709
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,960
-That's correct.
-[students gasp]

710
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,840
[professor 1] That's why this temple
has a central <i><font color="white">prang</font></i>.

711
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:42,000
Now, who can tell me

712
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,080
-what style is this <i><font color="white">prang</font></i>?
-Khmer style.

713
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,480
-That's correct.
-[Ketsurang giggles]

I know the answer too.

716
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,840
[chuckles]
Okay. <i><font color="white">Prangs</font></i> have been

717
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,640
an important element in Khmer architecture
for a thousand years.

718
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:00,320
[professor 1] This temple
is a replica of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.

719
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,560
-You scrawny boy.
-[professor 1] Now, do any of you know

720

-[camera clicks]
-what year this temple was built?

What year was it?

00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,040
-What year was it?
-What year?

723
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,360
-Rueangrit.
-Yes.

724
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,640
What year was it?

725
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,840
-In 19--
-No.

726
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,360
It was 1630.

727
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,440
-Good.
-[students gasp]

728
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,320
-[student 1] She knew the answer again.
-[professor 1] You're very good at this.

729
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,240
Okay.

730
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,480
Next, we are going to see how the temple

731
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,400
-was renovated.
-He asked what year it was built.

732
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,840
[professor 1] Okay? Follow me.

I'd get to see it with my own eyes?

Mm-hm. I understand.

If I were you, I would be shocked too.

793

to lose your own daughter

[Lord Lek] Apologies
for my questions, Dech.

But many versions of the rumor
have spread so widely.

It's all right. I understand.

808
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:07,320
It's normal. The people
in this kingdom like to gossip.

believed it was your fiancÃ© who did it.

I don't care how they see her.

You really detest her, don't you?

[Dech] Hm.

821

01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,240
she must be

Hey...

829
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,960
Where are those two going?

830
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,280
They are not going home yet?

831
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,600
Maybe they're going
to Phanan Choeng Temple.

832
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,080
Why are they going there?

833
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,240
I bet they're going for a drink instead.

834
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,080
[Karaked] Hey.

835
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:10,360
Slow down. Our house is not that far away.

836
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:12,200
We will get there soon.

837
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,840
Whose boat is that? It's beautiful.

838
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,720
It has a roof on it too.

839
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,440
My lady. Please prostrate.

840
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:30,160
What?

841
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:31,240
Please prostrate.

842
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,800
We are not allowed to look.

843
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,360
Keep your head down.

Wow.

847
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:04,240
It's a woman.

848
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,080
She's so gorgeous.

849
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,360
Her <i><font color="white">sabai</font></i> is also beautiful.

850
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,480
She's gone.

851
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,080
It's so weird.

852
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:27,080
She's so beautiful.
Why aren't we allowed to look at her?

853
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:31,840
Beautiful people normally like
to get spotted and be on social media.

You don't get it, do you?

857
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:45,880
It's okay. I usually don't understand
what I'm saying either.

858
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,480
Okay?

859
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:49,720
Okay?

860
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,840
-Okay.
-[Pin] Okay.

861

Call for Choi.

[man 2] Hey.

01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,560
Choi, where are you?

01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,560
Yes, my lord?

871
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,960
Go get the boat ready.
I'll wait at the pier.

872
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,320
Yes, my lord.

-Father?
-Yes.

876
01:09:49,880 --> 01:09:52,200
You should go home.
I'll take care of the rest.

[Dech chuckles]

Why are you acting like that?

897
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:39,280

she would scold you.

-What is it?
-[panting]

903
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,360
You should go over there.

Where?

905
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,680
What is that?

When Lord Dech gets here,
give this to him.

We also prepared tea
and a towel soaked in jasmine water

at the pier.

They are for his lordship, of course.

Have I done that before?

Yes, you have.

916
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,160
You did this every day.

917
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,680
If you can't remember, go to the pier.

to his lordship?

I offered them to him.

978
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:36,880
But he refused to eat them.

979
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:40,000
Because he already had a drink
and some snacks.

980

Pin, put these away for me.
I'm going in now.

Give me that.

She's smart.

984
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,680
She's afraid that
if she goes to the main house,

Prik will slap her.

Do you have to be on duty tomorrow?

It's the day of observance,
so I don't have to be on duty.

01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:32,200
Let's go to the same temple

-[Prik] Lady Karaked.

-[laughs]
-What happened?

1009
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,880
I just asked Lady Champa
to go to the temple with her.

1010
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,360
Did you see her face? She was stunned.

1011
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,440
And she accidentally said yes.

1012
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,160
Then you need to get up early tomorrow.

1013
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:28,520
No problem.

1014
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:31,840
Because I'm going to bed early tonight.

You can't do that.

1036

You need to bathe
before going to a temple.

So you can wear perfume later.

Please hurry.

1039

Lord Dech will scold you again
if he sees you.

Bathe me again.

It was cold earlier

Yes.

Tell your lady

1048
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:36,080
to bathe quickly.

1049
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,720
Or else I won't wait for her.

1050

He won't wait for me?

1051
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,960
Does he mean
he is coming to bathe with me?

This is beautiful.

1063
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,640
This is a...

01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:19,040
Lai Yang fabric.

1065
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,600
Yes. Lai Yang fabric.

1066
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,400
This one is Lai Yang fabric,

1067
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,520
which means a type
of custom-made printed fabric

1068
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,800
and the royal court

1069
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:33,480
had designed the pattern
and then commissioned it

1070
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,480
to be printed in India and imported back.

1071
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,560
Because at that time,

1072
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,160
the required technology
hadn't been developed yet here.

1073

How so?

1077
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,760
I will look beautiful, of course.

01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,520
Wow.

1079
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:17,680
Why are there so many accessories?

1080
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:21,880
This is just three-tenth
of what you used to have.

1081

Somebody stole them.

This is plenty enough.

You can get out now. I'm getting dressed.

1084

Give me the comb.

1085

Let me do your hair.

No. I'm doing my own hair today.

-Oh, no.

Lady Karaked is here.

Tell her to redo her hair.

1104

And tell her

1105
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:25,600
she is not a daughter of some minor lord

that no one would give her
the time of day.

Lady Champa.

1117

People can wear
their hair however they want.

1118

Look at you.

1119

You are so quick to retort.

[Champa] Take her away.

1123
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,520
If she doesn't change her hair
to something normal,

1124
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:23,600
you two will get severely whipped.

1125

[Yaem and Pin] Yes, my lady.

-Don't.

Do something.

I won't let her go to the temple
with that eccentric hairdo.

1133
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:49,760
I'd be so embarrassed.

1134

No, I haven't.

1168
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:26,960
It's next to Chanuan Gate, right?

1169
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,320
That gate is for the royal concubines
to get on boats.

Lord Lek?

1231
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:02,200
[professor 2] Marquess Kosathibodi or Lek

1232
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:04,080
was an important warrior

1233
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,600
in King Narai's reign.

1234
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,920
He was His Majesty's most trusted soldier.

1235
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:15,200
King Narai sent him to conquer Burma.

1236
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:19,960
He did it successfully
and took over most of the Ava Kingdom.

1237
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,720
Since then, the Kings of Ava had not dared

1238
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:25,880
to go to war against Ayutthaya
for almost a hundred years.

1239
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,440
[professor 2] He was a great warrior,

1240
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:30,840
but he didn't only use his strength.

1241
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:35,000
He had studied the strategies of war

1242
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:37,760
and could set out
battle plans brilliantly.

1243
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,360
This made him earn the title,

1244
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:41,640
"Commander Lek."

1245
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,960
[professor 2] King Narai also liked him
as a close friend.

1246
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:49,480
Because they were the same age
and knew each other for a long time.

1247
01:40:50,200 --> 01:40:51,560
Most importantly,

1248
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:53,080
Commander Lek

1249
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:55,800
was the son of King Narai's wet nurse.

1250
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:58,400
Her name was Madam of Wat Dusidaram.

1251
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,800
Sir, then why was he executed?

1252
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:08,440
There is a record that supposedly says

1253
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:14,800
King Narai mistakenly thought
that he was corrupted.

1254
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:16,760
Oh.

1255
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,720
[professor 2] At that time, the king

1256
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:25,240
had been wanting to build large fortress,
like those in European countries.

1257
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:29,400
So he gathered a lot of men to labor.

1258
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:32,040
But there was a rule that said,

1259
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:36,320
"If a man doesn't want to labor,
he can pay money instead."

1260
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:41,720
So a lot of people gave their money
to Commander Lek,

1261
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:43,520
so that they wouldn't have to labor.

1262
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:45,680
And he took it as a courtesy.

1263
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:50,160
That is why

1264
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,320
he was accused of corruption.

1265
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:55,760
He was severely whipped

1266
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:58,600
until he died.

1274
