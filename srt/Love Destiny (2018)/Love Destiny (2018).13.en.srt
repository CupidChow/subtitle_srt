You must smoke it
over and over for three days.

00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,280
[Champa] The clay will absorb fragrances,

You have to neutralize civet musk

or finely chopped kaffir lime skin.

Next, we'll singe it to disinfect.

When the civet melts,

150
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,240
we'll add it to the smoke jar.

151
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,480
This will enhance it into a stronger
and lasting fragrance.

You've been too kind to her.

that, right now,

Lord Rueang cannot eat or sleep.

[Karaked] He can't even go to work.

I don't understand

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,800
I accepted his friendship.

I didn't cut him out.

I came here myself.

stick your nose
in someone else's business?

220

Because I know
that you will obey your mother.

That's why I came to tell you
that your life is yours.

You must choose your own destiny.

[Karaked] You love this man.
How could she make you marry another?

You'll be the one
to step into the bedroom.

You must choose your lover.

Do not let her force you
into an arranged marriage.

Act natural. Boon and Muern are back.

It'll be your first time.

You must do it if you love him.

[Karaked] Think about it.

247

It's not a difficult task at all.

248

You will get to be
with Lord Rueang in return.

It's so worth it.

you can wait for other men to propose.

00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,200
How is it sinful?

337
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,160
I can't lie to Mother.

338
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,680
Ahh.

339
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,960
It's not sinful. It's a righteous lie.

340
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
It's up to you.

341
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,360
I'll wait and see.

342
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,960
I can't go through with it.

343
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,160
I will never do it.

344
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,440
Don't come back here again.

345
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,160
Boon, Muern.

346
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,160
[Muern] Yes, my lady.

347
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,480
[Chanwad] Put this in the sun.

348

-[Muern] Yes, my lady.
-[Chanwad] Go.

[lively music]

350
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,440
Is she going there again?

351
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,160
[sighs]

352
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,400
How troublesome.

353
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,680
Aren't you visiting Lady Chanwad today?

354
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,600
No, Lady Champa.

355
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,280
Why not?

356
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,760
I guess she did something sketchy there,
Lady Champa.

357
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,760
Lady Chanwad probably
doesn't welcome her there anymore.

358
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,600
My son wants to propose to Lady Chanwad.

359
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,560
Do you have any objections, my lady?

360
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,680
Thank you very much, Marquess and Ming,

361
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,120
for showing interest in my daughter.

362
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,680
But I must say this now,

363
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,640
so you cannot use it
against my daughter in the future.

364
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,160
Right now, my house is empty
since everything was confiscated.

365
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,400
The King was kind enough
to not imprison us.

366
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,760
My daughter and I
have nothing to give you.

367

[ominous music]

368

[Nim] They were all fine with it.

369
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,040
Ming is a viscount of frontline infantry.

370
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,280
He's loaded with wealth.

371
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,960
You will live a great life
until your very last day.

Boon.

373
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,840
[Boon] My lady.

374
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,880
What's wrong with her?
Why isn't she speaking?

375
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,760
She's ill.

376
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,960
What's wrong?

377
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,800
She won't say.

378
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,480
What?

379
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,720
Her ladyship only says,

380
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,240
-"I want to die."
-I want to die.

381
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,320
I want to die.

Lord Rueang.

384
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,760
Please help me.

385
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,800
Lord Rueang.

386
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,480
I asked Choi to get you since yesterday.

387
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,120
Why are you just showing up now?

388
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,120
Is something wrong, Lady Karaked?

389
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,520
Something's very wrong. It's about you.

390
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,280
Darn it. He's as dumb as Rueang.

391
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,040
What is it?

392
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Nothing.

393
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,520
Tell me.

394
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,720
I'll tell you now,

395
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,000
but you must listen carefully.

396
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,320
You will need to work hard for it.

She has taken two pots of medicine.

400
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,080
She hasn't gotten better yet, Boon.

401

My lady.

402
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,160
She's been saying she wants to die.

403
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,400
Tell me what's wrong, Lady Chanwad.

404
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,520
So I know who to call to treat you.

I know.

many times.

that Lord Rueang is here.

All right, Lady Champa.

No, I didn't.

She looked worried.

457
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,120
I'm afraid she might tell Lady Karaked
about her husband

458
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,920
since he's quite powerful
during this time.

If he's powerful,
what can she be worried about, my lady?

00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,520
My husband talked to the French men,

464
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,960
and the mission will come back
with troops this time.

465
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,480
Why?

466
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,600
Will they be here to sightsee?

467
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,240
Six hundred soldiers are coming.

That's a lot.

Why are they coming?

471
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,840
The King has been falling ill lately.

472
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,760
I'm aware of that.

473
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,400
Government officers
are starting to take sides.

474
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,240
Higher-ranked men started to group up.

475

Who are the higher-ranked men?

[Mali] Yes.

478
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,920
Prince Apaiyatot, his younger brother,
is in a different party.

And government officers

And Count Sorasak.

It is wrong

486
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,040
to take lives

487
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,360
in order to convince someone

488
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,280
to believe in God.

[foreboding music]

I'm afraid my husband
isn't a true believer.

491
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,560
He's merely doing it...

492
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,120
for power and wealth.

493
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,840
What makes you think like that?

494
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,400
Does your husband have a hand

495
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,320
in bringing the French troops
into Ayutthaya?

496
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,920
Did he tell them to come?

497
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,880
I don't know.

498
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,960
All I know is that I side
with the righteousness.

499
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,160
Do you know

500
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,760
that everything you said

501
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,960
could be used against your husband?

502
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,280
You must find out the truth, Lady Mali.

503
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,880
It's okay.

504
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,800
We might be able to do something
by the time they come back.

505
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,520
[Karaked] If you can talk
to your husband nicely,

506
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,080
persuade him to take the right path,

507
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
it will be good for you.

508
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,480
You believe in God.

509
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,320
He taught about love,

510
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,720
even the love toward your enemy.

511
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,680
But he is your husband.

512
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,800
Perhaps,

513
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,720
your love can lower his ambition.

514
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,960
I want you to think about it.

515
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,560
You mentioned his ambition.

516
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,920
You already know
that he will commit a crime, right,

517
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,720
Lady Karaked?

518
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,360
[suspenseful music]

519
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,200
It's not just me, Lady Mali.

520
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,960
Duke Wichayen, your husband,
is very powerful right now.

521
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,720
[Karaked] Everyone's suspecting
his actions.

522
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,520
And of course,
they all think of him negatively.

523
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,400
Especially if they find out
he's bringing many French soldiers,

524
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,800
they'll expect him to use violence.

525
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,640
That's why I'm worried.

526
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,560
I only knew that I had to tell you.

527
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,560
The troops usually come with bloodshed

528
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,440
and death.

529
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,040
I'm very worried.

530
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,560
If you keep an eye on your husband,
everything should be okay.

531
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,080
What should I do
once I find out the truth?

532
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,800
Think about it.

533
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,200
You're from Ayutthaya.

534
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,200
You grew up in Ayutthaya.

535
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,480
[Karaked] But he's a foreigner
who just moved here

536
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,120
and became successful.

537
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,640
It would be very wrong of him

538
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,280
to betray this country, Lady Mali.

539
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,600
If you stand by what's right,

540
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,560
you won't be ashamed in the future.

541
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,360
Who knows?

542
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,440
Your name might be in history.

543
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,560
In tens and hundreds of years,
people will still remember you.

544
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,400
You won't be forgotten.

[tense music]

Lord Hora.

547
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,920
I have an important matter
to discuss with you.

548
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,800
What is it, Lady Karaked?

549
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,320
[inaudible dialogue]

550
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,560
[Sorasak] His wife, Tong Guyomar,

551
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,600
came to tell you?

552
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,120
Yes.

553
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,400
She probably overheard
her husband's conversation.

554
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,320
I hate this foreigner
more than I hate dog feces.

555
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,400
He is up to something.

556
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,960
His plan must be big.

557
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,160
Lord Hora.

558
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,240
Will hundreds of soldiers come back
with the mission?

559
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,120
Why did he bring in troops?

560
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,760
Is the King aware of this?

Why put a flower behind your ear?

565
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,520
Here we go again.

566
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,520
Tell me, Pin, Yaem!

567
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,720
She insisted on leaving it there.

568
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,240
She said, "It's my ear."

569
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,280
But it's unconventional.

570
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,560
Don't you know

571
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,600
what kind of women
put flowers on their ear?

572
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,720
Those two told me,

573
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,560
but I think it's pretty.

574
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,720
Pretty?

Do you know

576
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,560
what everyone will think of you?

577
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,480
A courtesan.

578
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,640
[Karaked] But, Lady Champa,

579
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,520
I'm not one.

580
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,920
-Also, isn't it pretty?
-[sighs]

If it is, then we're done.

-Chuang.
-Yes, my lady.

584
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,280
It's just a tradition, Lady Champa.

585
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,320
And I only wear it inside our house.
I don't go anywhere with it.

586
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,960
Also, it is ours.

587
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,040
What is?

588
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,440
All of our body.

589
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,440
Putting a flower behind my ear at home
won't cause any problems.

590
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,760
I'm too tired to argue with you.

591
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,600
Do you know that Dech is coming back?

592
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,440
I do.

593
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,960
Then let's go to the kitchen
to prepare him a meal.

594
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,560
-Let's go.
-All right, Lady Champa.

Whose belongings are those?

599
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,880
Hurry up, Prik.

00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,280
Quick.

601
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,320
Why are you so excited?

602
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,920
Won't you be excited too

603
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,160
if I say Lord Dech is back
from his trip abroad?

604
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,040
Don't lie to me.

605
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,520
I know that his ship is at Paknam.

606
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,400
It will take him days to arrive
in Ayutthaya.

607
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,760
He's here. Go upstairs and take a look.

[Dech] "Versailles Palace
is exquisite and enormous.

1008
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:08,200
In front, there's a statue
of King Louis XIV

1009
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,400
riding a horse elegantly.

1010

The palace is located on a highland,

01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,400
but strange enough,

1012
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,800
they were able to build a fountain

1013
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,440
and a pond decorated with God,

King Louis XIV

went to stay
at the Palace of Fontainebleau.

1039

He was kind enough to send us

Our hands were frozen.

We could barely move our fingers,
Your Majesty.

What?

1049

Was it that cold? It's hard to believe.

It was, Your Majesty.

1051
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,040
[Lord Pan] But what I found strange

1052
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,840
was that whenever white flakes fell
from the sky,

1053
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:50,120
it somehow became warmer, Your Majesty.

1054

What?

1055
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:56,160
I was told that those white flakes

1056
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:57,960
were freezing cold.

1057

Count Kanlaya, is it true?

It is true, Your Majesty.

1059

If that's the case,

1060
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:14,720
then why aren't accumulated
fallen white flakes not cold?

1061
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,640
Tell me, Viscount.

1062

They are cold, Your Majesty.

What the hell?

1064
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,200
So what's the truth?

1065
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,760
Was it cold or not?

1066
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:27,960
It was, Your Majesty.

1067

But it was colder
without the white flakes.

since it was freezing over there?

1078
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:33,920
We did, Your Majesty.

1079

Wasn't your whole body frozen, then?

We had boiled water, Your Majesty.

Sometimes, once in three days.
Sometimes, once in five days.

[Lord Pan] They often complained
about us, Your Majesty.
