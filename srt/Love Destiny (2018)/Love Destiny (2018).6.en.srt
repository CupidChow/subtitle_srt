on where you got hit

00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,640
Do you take me for a child?

333
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:35,880
Well...

334
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,760
It's the truth, sir.

335
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,920
I'm feeling sick,
so I asked her to get some medicine.

336
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,800
Bishop.

337
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,880
Thank you so much, Bishop Pallu.

338
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,080
Where's Mali?

339
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,760
Like I said...

340
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,080
Yes, she is really beautiful.

341
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,560
Has she agreed to it?

342
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,520
I haven't talked to her
or her father about it.

343
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,600
Well, that's all right. I can come back.

344
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,960
[Phaulkon] I appreciate it.

345
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,080
Once everything is settled,
I will come back.

346

[tense music]

347

Fanik.

348
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,800
I would like to talk to you
about something.

349
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,680
An important matter.

350
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,640
[Fanik] What is it, Count?

351
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,560
[suspenseful music]

352
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,080
[inaudible dialogue]

353
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,120
Count Surasakorn told me

354
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,960
that he is in love with you.

355
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,360
And he will ask Bishop Pallu
to make a proposal on his behalf.

356
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,800
What do you say, Mali?

357
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,720
I will never agree to that.

358
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:18,000
You haven't thought it through,
yet your words have voiced your decision.

359
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,560
That is unwise.

360
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,360
I've thought it through,
and my answer remains the same.

361
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,920
What is your reason, then?

362
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,040
I hate him.

Come on! Hurry up.

Or someone else will take it away.

367
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,560
Boong! Come here, you!

What's going on over there? Come here!

Is your lady in her chambers?

Yes, my lord.

381
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,440
Go and get her.

00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,080
[both] Yes, my lord.

Where are we going?

[quirky music]

391
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,520
[Dech] The other day...

392
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Uh...

393
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,520
I took Karaked out to order
a new custom-made pan.

394
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,920
We briefly stopped at the market
by Wat Nang Chi Pier.

395
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,720
When we met the curve
at the floating market,

396
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,240
a boat accident happened.

397
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,960
I got hit on the head by a boat
and drowned in the river.

398
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,680
Goodness.

399
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,960
Karaked saved my life.

400
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,200
And she helped me regain consciousness.

401
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,200
I was as good as a dead man at the time.

402
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,960
What did you say?

403
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,360
Jeez, <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>, there's no need
to thank me for such a small matter.

404
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,840
It's no big deal.

405
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,880
Are we done here?
I would like to ask you to join me--

406
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,840
It's best if Father hears it from me,
and not from someone else.

407
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,000
-Maybe no one will say anything--
-[Dech] Father.

408
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,560
Karaked used the knowledge she learned
from the missionaries to save me.

409
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:41,120
Is that so?
You sure possess a lot of knowledge.

410
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,000
Karaked blew the air from her mouth
into my mouth.

411
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,600
I did.

412
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,440
But he's alive and well now.
So let's forget it, shall we?

413
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Blowing air from her mouth, Father.

414
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,240
[Karaked chuckles nervously]

415
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,680
The air from Karaked's mouth...

416
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,600
went into your mouth?

417
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,760
That's right.

418
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,240
She...

419
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,280
blew...

420
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,320
into my mouth.

421
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,760
I cannot picture it.

422
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,880
[Horathibodi] I've never seen anyone
do such a thing.

423
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,160
How is it done?

424
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,080
She...

425
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,120
[gasps]

426
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,480
[whispers]
It's true, my lady.

427
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,280
Do you see the picture now, Father?

428
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,120
Yes.

429
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,920
I think I got it now.

430
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,440
But still not quite clear.

431
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,880
I assume the whole town
will be talking about this.

432
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,880
And what do you want to do about this?

433
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,480
[sighs]

434
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,000
I would like to marry her.

435
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,560
Is that so?

436
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,560
Yes.

437
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,080
Have you thought it through?

438
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,640
-I have.
-Hold on a second.

439
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,240
Have you slept on it?

440
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,800
I have.

441
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,440
We don't have to go that far, Lord Hora.

442
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,200
Just let people talk about it
all they want.

443
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,480
We don't have to care about them.
Why should we worry?

444
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,440
Besides, I was screaming "saving his life"
all the time while I was doing it.

445
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,840
No one would think
I had done something embarrassing.

446
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,200
It's just a small matter.
Not a big deal at all.

447
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,160
There's no need for us
to get married over this.

448
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,640
Karaked, stop babbling.

449
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,320
[Horathibodi] Right.

450
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,120
He's right, Karaked.

451
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,320
This matter should
only be discussed by adults.

452
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,440
It's not something you can intervene.

453
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,560
Dech.

454
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,240
Yes.

455
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,640
How about an engagement for now?

456
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,440
[Champa] Karaked.

457
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,800
You wench!

[ominous music]

459
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,960
What you've done is utterly shameful.
I can't stand you anymore.

460
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,840
What should I do with you?

461
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,560
Should I just lock you in this house,
so you won't ever do such shameful thing?

462
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,320
[Champa] How terrible!
You brought shame upon us.

463
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,800
You never think before you act!

464
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,280
Ever since you came here,
you've done nothing but terrible things!

465
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,880
[scoffs]

466
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,920
And now, you've done
something really shameful.

467
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,240
No lady in Ayutthaya
is as shameless as you!

468
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,720
Lady Champa.

469
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,560
If I hadn't saved him this way,
he would have died.

470
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,960
I haven't allowed you to say a word.
Why have you started babbling again?

471
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,600
[Champa] Where are your manners?

472
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,440
It must be because
you were never educated!

473
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,840
Lady Champa!

474
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,800
Stop it!

475
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,400
Do not say another word!
No one else does such things!

476
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,280
You keep talking back to the elders.

477
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,000
Look at Dech.
He's sitting there in silence. See?

478
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,360
Yes, Lady Champa.

479
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
[exhales sharply]

480
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,840
Karaked.

481
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,840
I would like to thank you
for saving Dech's life.

482
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,760
[Horathibodi] Don't you worry.

483
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,360
Even though your reputation
may have been tarnished,

484
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,160
I'll have Dech make things right
by marrying you.

485
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,760
Because if a lady's reputation
becomes tarnished like this,

486
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,240
she might have to stay single
for the rest of her life.

487
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,240
No man would want her as his wife.

488
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,000
Champa.

489
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,560
How about an engagement first?

490
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,720
That sounds great, Father.

491
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,760
What if we send her back to Song Kwae
for the time being?

492
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,120
I've made my decision.

493
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:52,040
There's no need
to discuss this any further.

You must remain in your chambers.

659
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:57,960
[Karaked] Why?

660
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,880
My lady!

661
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,360
You can't let people see you walking
with your legs wide apart like that.

662
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:07,080
And if you leave bloodstains
somewhere outside,

663
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,960
it will be embarrassing.

664
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,880
So I can't do anything
when I'm on my period?

665
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,200
[Yaem] No, you cannot.

666
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,280
[Karaked] And I'm supposed to hide away
from others for days?

667
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:23,680
[Pin] Just tell them that you're riding
a horse and they shall understand.

668
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:27,240
But do not mention anything
about menstruation.

669
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,320
[scoffs]

670
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,680
So "horse-riding" means menstruating.

671
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,240
What if I really ride a horse?
What would you call it, then?

672
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,280
[all giggling]

673
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,480
Oh, right. It's also horse-riding.

674
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,880
[Karaked] Then I'm like Manee Rattana.

675
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,960
Who is that, my lady?

676
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,400
<i><font color="white">The Horse Faced Lady</font></i>!
Haven't you seen that show?

677
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,960
[sings horse racing music]

678
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,560
[high-pitched yell]

679
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
[lively music]

680
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,040
[ladies laugh]

681
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,880
Let me wash that for you.

682
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:48,040
My gosh! No way! I'll wash it myself.

683
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,120
[Pin] You're going to wash it yourself?

684
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,280
Of course, because it has
my dirty blood on it.

685
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,840
I want to see where the stains are.

686
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,480
Just get me a basin.

687
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,760
[Karaked] The one that I can
wash clothes in.

688
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:06,360
[Pin and Yaem] A washbowl.

689
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:13,080
I'll get it from the servants' quarters
and follow you to the pier.

690
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,920
[Karaked] Put it here.

691
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,640
So this is a washbowl.

692
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,120
Yes.

693
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,320
-Go on, Pin.
-[Pin] Yes?

694
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,640
Get some water.

695
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,160
Please let Pin do it, my lady.

696
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,480
Is there something wrong, my lady?

697
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,440
[Yaem] You've never washed your clothes
ever since you were little.

698
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,640
How can you wash off
your period stains now?

699
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,160
Listen. I won't ever let
the two of you wash this.

700
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:03,320
This is my dirty clothing.
How can someone else wash it for me?

701
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:06,760
I'll wash it for you.
I'll wash it right here in the canal.

702
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,920
You can't!

703
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,400
You're going to make the water dirty!

704
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,840
Let go. I'll do it myself.

705
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,400
[lively music]

706
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,800
Who are you looking for, Dech?

707
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,200
Are you going somewhere?

708
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,760
Why did you answer me with a question?

709
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,680
How about you answer my question first?

710
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,920
I was watching Karaked.

711
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,320
She's doing something at the bathing pier.

712
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,600
She seems rather odd.

713
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,000
What are you worried about?

714
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,400
I'm not, Father.

715
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,680
I'm going to find an auspicious date
for your engagement then, Dech.

716
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,200
Let's go, Muang.

717
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,320
[light music]

718
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,160
My lady.

719
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,640
When I was getting the washbowl
from the house,

720
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,160
I saw Lady Chanwad
who came to visit Lord Dech.

721
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,520
Lady Chanwad is here?

722
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,320
Yes.

723
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,080
I assume she's here to see how he's doing.

724
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,040
[grunts]

725
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,760
[cloth rasping]

726
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,240
Change the water, please.

727
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,680
Come, Pin.
Help me pour this into the canal.

728
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,200
No! How can you pour this into the canal?

729
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,160
We use water from rivers and canals
to drink and to cook.

730
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:36,440
You can't pour the dirty laundry water
into the canal.

731
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,560
Pour it on a tree somewhere.

732
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,480
[both] All right.

733
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,080
Come on, let's go to see Lady Chanwad.

734
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,400
No, you can't, my lady.

735
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,880
You have to go back to your chambers.

736
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,800
You cannot sit and have a conversation
with Lady Chanwad.

737
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,320
[groans]
It's just for a little bit!

738
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,400
My lady!

739
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,880
[tranquil music]

740
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,880
My mother asked me
to give these desserts to you.

741
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,480
[Karaked] Lord Rueang!

742
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,360
Lord Rueang!

743
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,360
Lady Karaked.

744
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,360
As if they can read my mind.

745
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,160
I wanted to see Lady Chanwad,
but Lord Rueang also came.

746
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:02,760
[Karaked] I'm so lucky.

747
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,200
[both] Sure, my lady.

748
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:06,960
[Lord Rueang]
Is Lady Chanwad here as well?

749
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,960
Yes. She's inside. I'm about to go there.

750
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,200
And why would you want to see me?

751
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:16,640
I just do. I want to hear your stories.

752
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,840
<i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i> never tells me anything.

753
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:22,160
Is that so?

754
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,960
What story should I tell you?

755
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,320
What about your workplace?

756
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:33,400
Oh, right, I haven't got a wife yet.

757
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,640
What?

758
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,920
[both laugh]

759
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,960
I don't buy it!

760
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,760
[Karaked] You must be hiding
some girl out there.

761
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:42,640
[Lord Rueang] Well, just a few.

762
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:45,840
-Baron Rueang Ratcha Pakdi. I invited him.
-[Karaked] There are many, aren't there?

763
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:47,360
[Karaked laughs in distance]

764
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,560
I see.

765
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,800
We have to discuss some official matters.

766
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,800
Shall I leave, then?

767
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,560
Why would I want that?

768
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,440
You came all the way here to visit me.

769
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,280
We can talk for a while.

770
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,440
[Karaked] Ran away?
You ran away from them?

771
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,840
Oh, my. How manly you are!

772
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
I know when to be scared, Karaked.

773
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,800
There were four or five
of those drunkards.

774
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:20,160
[Lord Rueang] They could probably kill me.

775
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,480
So I ran for my life.

776
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,720
[both laugh]

777
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,720
Please, Lord Rueang.

778
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,040
Sorry for being late, Dech.

779
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,640
Lady Chanwad.

780
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:55,320
How have you been?

781
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:58,720
I've been well. How about you?

782
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,760
Not bad, I would say.

783
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:03,440
You must be busy with official matters.

784
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,920
Not as much as Lord Dech, I would say.

785
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:14,840
That's true. Whenever I saw <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>
discussing official matters with Father

786
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:18,320
and Uncle Pan, I feel exhausted for them.

787
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,200
[Chanwad] But you were there, too,
the other day.

788
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:26,920
I heard Mother ordering dishes.
You guys were eating until late at night.

789
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,840
[Ketsurang] <i><font color="white">Whoa, a dragging meeting.</font></i>

790
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,960
It wasn't quite over yet.
That's why Marquess Wisut is also coming.

791
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,000
We shall hear more details from him soon.

792
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:46,360
If we talk about it now,
the clueless ones might bend the truth.

793
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,280
I heard him arriving just now.

794
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,960
Let me show him in!

795
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,560
No.

796
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,080
It's none of your business.

797
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,480
It's all right. I'm happy to do it.

798
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,160
Really. It's all fine with me.

799
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:15,120
[chuckles]

800
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,840
You don't quite understand
what I'm saying, do you, Lady Chanwad?

801
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,920
In Song Kwae, we speak like this.

802
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,080
The servants are already there
to greet him.

803
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,480
Welcome, my lord!

804
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,680
Is everybody here?

805
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,240
Yes, my lord. Would you like me
to prepare some liquor now?

806
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,760
Look at this lad!

807
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,040
Why would we start drinking so early?

808
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,640
Lord Rueang and Lord Dech
always drink this early, sir.

809
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:16,800
Why?

810
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,320
Why can't I be there?
I just don't understand! Why?

811
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,840
Only men are allowed
to discuss official matters, my lady.

812
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,920
If you walk around too much,
the horse saddle might fall off.

813
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:35,320
Maybe it has?

814
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,320
Then why is Lady Chanwad allowed there?

815
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,320
Lady Chanwad has gone home.

816
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,400
For real?

817
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,600
It's true, my lady.

818
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,320
She had to go back no matter what.

819
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,800
She could not have joined
the conversation.

820
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,800
What is it about, though?

821
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,080
Chik, bring them tea.

822
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,960
Can you go, Chuang? I wouldn't dare.

823
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,440
They look so serious in there.

824
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,520
All right, then. I'll do it.

825
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,560
[sighs]
But you should follow me.

826
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,680
All right.

827
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,320
It's good that Lady Chanwad had gone home

828
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,320
because this matter cannot be discussed
in her presence...

829
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,680
since it's about her father.

830
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,240
Hasn't Marquess Lek realized

831
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:56,840
how dangerous this Count Surasakorn is?

832
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,680
[sighs]

833
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:02,720
My brother trusts him very much.

834
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,280
[Lord Pan] He doesn't suspect him one bit.

835
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,240
This count has a sinister plan.

836
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,520
He came to work with my brother

837
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:14,800
because he wished
to get close to the King.

838
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,640
And the King isn't suspicious
of him at all?

839
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,080
Not even a little.

840
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,640
My brother trusts him so much...

841
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,800
that he always brings him along
to serve His Majesty.

842
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:36,000
His Majesty favors talented people.

843
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,160
This Count Surasakorn is very clever.

844
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:40,960
Think about it.

845
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:45,400
He's just a wandering Westerner
who came from a foreign land.

846
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:46,960
Greece.

847
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:51,640
Right. Greece. He was a nobody.

848
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,200
But time was on his side.

849
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,920
He got to become an official
and get close to the King,

850
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,480
taking care of accounting and inventory,

851
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,240
which are usually difficult tasks
that nobody wants to do.

852
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:10,960
Do you guys know
that when he started to do civil work,

853
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:15,600
Indian merchants came to collect
their debts at the Treasury?

854
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:20,120
He rechecked the revenues and expenses
and recalculated everything.

855
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,360
[scoffs]

856
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:27,480
It turned out those Indian merchants owed
a lot of money to the Treasury.

857
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,080
[sighs]

858
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:33,320
The King was very pleased
and promoted him faster than anyone.

859
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,400
That is quite concerning.

860
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,120
Indeed.

861
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,520
But what's important now is...

862
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:42,280
everyone is keeping an eye out

863
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,960
to see if he shows any signs of intent
to convert the King to Christianity.

864
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:54,200
I've heard bits and pieces about that.

865
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:00,560
Do you think His Majesty
will agree to join the Christian Church?

866
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,000
I don't know.

867
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,480
Nobody knows what's on His Majesty's mind.

868
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,720
He likes foreigners.

869
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,560
He thinks that they are more capable,
and that Thais are inferior to them.

870
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,760
So perhaps...

871
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,400
Perhaps?

872
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,120
Perhaps he will convert?

873
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,160
[Lord Pan] I told you.

874
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,160
Nobody knows what's on His Majesty's mind.

875
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,080
What about Marquess Lek?

876
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:29,280
My brother would be happy for him.

877
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:33,840
If His Majesty agrees to convert,
my brother won't stand in his way,

878
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,040
even though His Majesty
always listen to him

879
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,400
every time he objects.

880
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:47,240
My lady.

881
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,560
Why do they look so serious?

[suspenseful music]

883
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,400
No woman wants to know
about men's business.

884
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,160
[Pin] Women should only know
women's business, my lady.

885
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:03,600
Like cooking, kitchen work,

886
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:08,200
making flower garlands, and pleasing men.

887

[blows air]

888

I'm coming with you.

Go ahead, so I can have a peek.

894
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,920
[Pin] Oh, no! You can't do that, my lady!

895
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:37,960
It's not ladylike.

896
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,120
She's right. Please don't go.

No more horse-riding.

It's still before dawn.
Why did you get up?

Because I want to.

01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:37,000
You can call him Narai as well.
Everyone does.

980
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,960
I've never heard anyone refer
to him like that.

981
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,360
Yaem. Have you?

982
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,640
That's right.

983
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,720
He is a king.

984
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,080
How can you only call him "Narai"?

985
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,240
Right.

986
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:58,480
Is that so?

987
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,680
It is so, my lady.

988
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,720
[in English]
Okay.

989
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,160
[both] Okay, my lady

990
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,560
So why is <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i> going to the palace?

991
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,480
Tell me!

992
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:17,840
[both] I really don't know, my lady.

993
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,880
Lord Hora said "a boatload"
will be promoted.

994
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:23,520
Will you translate it for me?

995
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:25,640
"Translate"?

996
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,440
What do you mean, my lady?

997
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,640
"Translate" means to translate.

998
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:36,440
Tell me what Lord Hora meant by that.

999
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,760
[gasps]
I see.

1000
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,880
He talked about the promotion
of many officials.

1001
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:45,800
[Pin] I see.

1002
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,760
A boatload of officials
will be promoted today.

1003
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,000
You mean many?

1004
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,800
Many what, my lady?

1005
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,360
Right.

1006
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,840
"A boatload" means many.

1007
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:06,920
You're becoming more
and more forgetful, my lady.

1008
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,080
Right! I've forgotten
a boatload of things.

1009
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,440
[all chuckling]

1010
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,680
[grandiose music]

1011
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:44,680
[grandiose music continues]

1012
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,360
[grandiose music intensifies]

1013
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:29,600
<i><font color="white">Khun Pi.</font></i>

1014
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,880
Did you get promoted today?

1015
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,120
And what about Lord Rueang?

1016
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,560
Did he get promoted too?

1017
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,280
Do you really wish to know?

1018
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:49,280
Of course.

1019
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,920
Then wait and ask him yourself.

1020
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,480
Ask him myself?

1021
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:55,480
When? And how?

1022
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,040
Where can I meet him?

1023
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,560
<i><font color="white">Khun Pi.</font></i>

1024
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:04,960
<i><font color="white">Khun Pi!</font></i>

1025
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,840
You're playing hard to get.
Fine, I don't want to know anymore.

1026
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:21,960
[comical music]

1027
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:26,240
He will be here soon.

1028
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,640
Always the solemn face.

1029
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:37,440
So will Earl Wisut Sunthorn.

1030
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:40,520
If there is anything you wish to ask him,

1031
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,080
then be prepared.

1032
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:44,600
Thank you.

1033
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:51,720
[sighs]

1034
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,440
Earl Wisut Sunthorn?

1035
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,440
It's Lord Pan!

1036
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,960
As soon as Lord Dech arrived,
she rushed to see him, my lady!

1037
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,400
What an unpleasant scene!

1038
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,600
Did you hear him talk
about the promotion, Prik?

1039
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:14,720
I did.

1040
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:20,200
The lady asked him
as soon as he stepped onto the pier.

1041
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,520
She asked what his new title is.

1042
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:26,240
She's really crazy!

1043
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:30,600
Look here, my lady.
She used to be mean and spiteful.

1044
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:35,600
But she has changed.
She's not mean or spiteful like before.

1045
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:39,720
But she always looks around
and peeks at this and that,

1046
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,200
always curious about everything.

1047
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:45,400
There's no middle ground for her.

1048
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,680
Then which version of her
do you think is better, Prik?

1049
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:53,320
[scoffs]

1050
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,360
I do not like her.

1051
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,960
So I would say
I don't like either version.

1052
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:03,600
-[sighs]
-Plus, she doesn't care about seniority.

1053
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,240
Doesn't care? How?

1054
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,400
She goes and sits next to him
and keeps asking questions.

1055
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:13,800
To whom?

1056
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,320
Earl Wisut, my lady.

1057
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:17,560
Don't forget, Lady Karaked.

1058
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,960
You promised to be our interpreter

1059
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:25,040
when we start learning French
at Saint Paolo Church.

1060
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:28,720
Of course. Certainly.

1061
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,160
Please excuse me for being late.

1062
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,680
There was an event in front
of Chaiwatthanaram Temple.

1063
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,760
There were boats all over the river.

1064
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,520
It took me a while
to get through the traffic.

1065
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:59,320
I always get caught in it.

1066
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,960
The severe boat traffic in front
of Chaiwatthanaram Temple, that is.

1067
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,560
[Lord Pan] When there's a temple event,

1068
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,840
there should be someone
to organize the traffic in that zone.

1069
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:12,600
Otherwise, people would just waste
so much of their time.

1070
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:17,760
Perhaps the new Viscount Wisarn Wacha
can use Marquess Horathibodi's authority

1071
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,720
to send words to the temple.

1072
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:25,960
Lady Karaked,
do you know that your betrothed

1073
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,360
is no longer a baron?

1074
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,200
He has been promoted to a viscount.

1075
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:36,200
And if he does a good job
when he goes abroad to do business,

1076
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,240
he will be promoted to a count.

1077
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,400
-[Lord Pan] Mm.
-Aren't you delighted?

1078
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:46,200
Viscount Rueang Apai Pakdi.

1079
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:48,800
You never learn.

1080
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,560
Always fooling around with your words.

1081
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,920
I already knew
that the two of you got promoted.

1082
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,880
-My lord.
-Hm?

1083
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,440
Are there many officials in Ayutthaya?

1084
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,040
There are plenty of us. Can't you see?

1085
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:16,720
There are so many things
that we have to work on.

1086
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:20,360
Whether it's about the civilians,
the King's work,

1087
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,520
or trading with the Westerners.

1088
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,320
The Indians and the Chinese
also trade with us.

1089
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,280
Do noblemen have salaries?

1090
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,920
You mean our wages?

1091
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,320
Yes. Do you get paid every month?

1092
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:46,200
[scoffs]
No.

1093
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:52,160
We get a yearly pension from His Majesty.

1094
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,160
What if it's not enough?

1095
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:03,320
We also earn from the work we do.

1096
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:08,960
For example, if a department collects
a tribute or some kind of fee,

1097
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,840
the officials who oversee the department

1098
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:13,400
can keep the necessary amounts
to use for themselves,

1099
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,720
and return the rest to the royal reserve.

1100
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:22,000
Is there any corruption?

1101
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:24,320
[tense music]

1102
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,480
What did you say?

1103
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,880
Is there any cheating?

1104
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:38,360
[Dech] No.

1105
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:44,760
You said such a strange word.
What language is that?

1106
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:47,880
Come on, <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>.

1107
01:31:48,080 --> 01:31:51,640
We're talking about something big here.
Don't pay attention to the small stuff.

1108
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,680
Well, my lord?

1109
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,680
Is there any cheating?

1110
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:59,880
What do you think, Karaked?

1111
01:32:04,240 --> 01:32:08,480
I think wherever there are interests,
there will always be people cheating.

1112
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:10,680
[chuckles]

1113
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,440
That is true.

1114
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,320
Do you ever catch anyone cheating?

1115
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,360
[Karaked] And how do you punish them?

1116
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:23,480
It starts from light punishment
called the "Equanimity Rule."

1117
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,240
What is it like?

1118
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:28,280
[clears throat]

1119
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,560
I'm sorry for interrupting.

1120
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,160
No worries.

1121
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:38,920
We take a deposit as parole
of an erring nobleman.

1122
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:42,720
And if he cheats again,
we keep that deposit.

1123
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:46,640
What if he cheats again and again?
Is there a death sentence?

1124
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,720
Then we behead him and seize all his land.

1125
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,240
Yes!

1126
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:53,320
That's the way to do it!

1127
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,000
But honestly, beheading is too light.

1128
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,080
You have to slash the whole body
and cut it up into little pieces!

1129
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:14,280
All right. There are many more stories
about officials' wrongdoings.

1130
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:18,400
I'll tell you more about it next time.

1131
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,760
Thank you so much, my lord.

1132
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,800
Actually, I would like to know more
about commoners.

1133
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,560
Like conscript soldiers
and King's soldiers.

1134
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,680
I'll be happy to tell you
all about it, Karaked.

1135
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,760
I also know quite a lot about it.

1136
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:46,840
I can tell you about it too.
