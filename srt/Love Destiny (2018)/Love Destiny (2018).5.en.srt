They were born to the same mother,
Madam of Wat Dusidaram,

who was the wet nurse of King Narai's son.

He was a Siamese envoy sent to France.

He was a bright, intelligent man.

35

And that's why he and the crew
were welcomed and admired by the French.

Louis XIV of France had shown

And what we know for sure

is how he was considered
to be very avant-garde in his time.

money, and taxation.

But not even a single word
of what I said is a lie.

113
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,000
Then why did you say it so obviously
as if you had foreseen something?

If you carefully take my words
into consideration,

Nobody knows what the real truth is
or what's going to happen in the future.

134
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,120
Actually, if you have a brain,
you should be able to tell

135
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,760
that Lady Chanwad's boat incident
was not an ordinary accident.

that there are people who bear ill will
towards Marquess Kosathibodi's family?

161
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,160
Scratch me!

162
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,360
Ket.

163
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,560
[both chuckle]

164
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,400
Wow!

165
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,200
It's huge.

166
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,440
It looks lovely!

167
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
[light music]

168
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,160
[soft chuckle]

169
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,200
Lady Chanwad.

170
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,640
Shall we have some mangoes
with sweet fish sauce?

171
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,120
What is it like?

172
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
You don't know?

173
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,160
Then I'm going to make some for you.
I guarantee that it's going to be delish!

174
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,000
Full of great flavors like no other!

175
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,400
Pin, Yaem. I'm going to pick
some mangoes from the orchard.

176
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
[both gasp]

177
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,160
But...

178
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,040
I'm not really dressed for it, right?

179
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,680
Come on.

180
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,560
Come...

181
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,840
Come on what, my lady?

182
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,840
[sighs, clicks tongue]

183
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,720
I'm going to pick mangoes in the orchard.

184
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,640
Make the <i><font color="white">chang kben </font></i>for me.

185
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,120
No? Then I'll do it myself.

186
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,720
I'd better make a short one.
It's perfect for the activity.

187
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,600
-No, my lady!
-My lady! That's not graceful!

188
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,080
I'd rather die, my lady!

189
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,760
Me, too! That makes two bodies, my lady!

190
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,160
[sighs deeply]

191
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,400
[Yaem] It's not graceful, my lady.

192
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,520
Are you "okay"?

193
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,040
I'm okay, all right?

194
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,320
Then the two of you
pick the mangoes for me.

195
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,880
[both gasp]

196
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,640
Us, my lady?

197
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
That's not "okay", my lady.

198
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,040
Why isn't it okay?

199
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
[Yaem sighs]

200
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,400
We don't have to pick them ourselves.

201
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,640
Darn! I know! Just wait!

202
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,360
-[Pin] Hurry up!
-Boong!

203
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,440
More to the right!

204
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,360
-I want the ones on the right.
-Yes, ma'am.

205
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,880
-[Yaem] Hey, Boong!
-Wow!

206
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,120
-Move over to that branch. Go!
-My lady.

207
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,320
[Pin] These look so good.

208
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,840
Look at them, my lady.

209
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,880
[Karaked] Pretty!

210
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,560
Lady Chanwad.

211
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,720
Let's make some mangoes
with sweet fish sauce.

212
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,320
[Karaked] Come up here, Lady Chanwad.

213
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Hurry up, Boong!

214
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,400
Sit.

215
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,960
[groans]

216
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,800
Hmm.

217
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,760
Look at these pretty mangoes!

218
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,800
They're really pretty, my lady.

219
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,440
-[screams]
-[Yaem] What is it, my lady?

220
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,720
What is it?

221
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,120
Snake!

222
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,680
Boong! Catch it!

223
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,880
[playful music]

224
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,440
[whimpers]

225
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,920
[Pin] She caught it, my lady.

226
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,280
You are afraid of snakes?

227
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,120
Who isn't?

228
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,680
I've seen you catch a snake barehanded.

229
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,440
What? I caught a snake?

230
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,280
You didn't seem to be afraid of snakes.

231
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,840
Lady Champa told me
that you have a really brave mind.

232
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,200
You caught a living snake
and swung it around.

233
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,240
Swung it around?

234
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
[Karaked] Oh, dear.

235
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,440
That was the old me, perhaps.

236
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,520
Before I was cast
with Kritsana Kali spell. But...

237
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,760
no more snakes for me.

238
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,600
Salee, I've got it!

239
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Good.

240
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,400
-Thongbai.
-[Thongbai] Yes?

241
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,040
-Go get it.
-Sure.

242
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,280
Salee!

243
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,200
-[screams]
-We've got some fat ones today!

244
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,360
-[whimpers]
-[Salee] Good.

245
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,600
What are they doing with the snakes?

246
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,680
Those are eels, not snakes.

247
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,000
But you've eaten snakes before.

248
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,600
-I ate snakes?
-Yes.

249
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,840
In Song Kwae, you used to catch snakes
from the river and eat them.

250
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,560
You would eat cobras, rat snakes...

251
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,280
You even told me
that snakes taste like chicken.

252
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,200
Good thing I didn't pass out.

253
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:53,960
[sighs]

254
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,200
Oh, well,
I guess there will be more surprises.

255
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,880
[exhales sharply]

256
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,840
All right, Chanwad.

257
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,040
I'm going to teach you
how to make sweet fish sauce.

258
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,200
-Sweet fish sauce...
-Pin, Yaem.

259
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,200
-Yes?
-Yes?

260
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,400
I need Palm sugar...

261
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,920
Hey. Cover it up!

262
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,320
Fish sauce, red onions,

263
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,920
some dried chili, dried shrimp...

264
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,360
These four things. Please get them for me.

265
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,160
-Certainly.
-Certainly.

266
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,000
We're out.

267
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
[tense music]

268
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,360
[Salee] No need to get them.

269
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,000
Salee, don't lie to us.

270
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,040
This is the kitchen.
How can you not have those?

271
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,440
I'm a kitchen maid.
If I say we're out, then we're out.

272
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,960
How did we run out?

273
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,720
Did you not get the supplies?

274
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,880
What if Lady Champa wants to eat...

275
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,960
What was it, my lady?

276
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,640
Sweet fish sauce.

277
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,560
Sweet fish sauce. What will you do then?

278
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,960
I didn't know fish sauce could be sweet.

279
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,560
Isn't that right, Lady Chanwad?

280
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
[playful music]

281
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,560
Pin. Yaem.

282
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,800
[Pin and Yeam] Yes?

283
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,720
Go get them.

284
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,160
[Pin and Yeam] Right away.

285
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,800
[Yeam] I've got them, my lady.

286
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,040
[playful music]

287
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,280
-[Karaked] Yaem.
-[Yaem] Yes?

288
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,640
[Karaked] Palm sugar, please.

289
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
[light music]

290
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,680
Here you go. Taste it.

291
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,920
But not too much or your tummy will hurt.

292
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,760
Don't blame me if you get diarrhea.

293
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,200
Hey, everyone.

294
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,400
[rooster crowing]

295
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,120
Bring the rest to the main house.
Let the gentlemen have a taste of it.

296
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,400
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

297
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
[playful music]

298
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,560
Why do you look so dazed, Lady Chanwad?

299
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,000
Try it!

300
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,880
I don't understand what you're saying,
Lady Karaked.

301
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,440
Your words sound rather odd.

302
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,280
Do people of Song Kwae
speak in such a way?

303
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,800
That's why Pin and Yaem
can understand your words.

304
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,200
They're just used to it.

305
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,720
Come on. Help yourself, Lady Chanwad.

306
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,920
Once you take a bite, you won't stop.
I guarantee you.

307
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,600
"I guarantee you"?

308
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,920
[sighs]
It's like... "I'm telling you."

309
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,120
Come on. Here, let me show you how.

310
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,360
[Karaked] Dip it.

311
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,320
Open wide.

312
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,760
And chew away.

313
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,520
[light music]

314
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,960
Mmm!

Yummy!

[rooster crowing]

317
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,680
Go for it.

00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,880

Let's go in.

327
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,480
Is it delicious, Lord Hora?

328
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,080
I never knew that Song Kwae people knew
how to make such great dips.

329
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,440
[Horathibodi and Lord Lek chuckle]

330
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,680
[Lord Lek] I agree.

331
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,880
Eating mango with dipping sauce like this,

332
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,080
-I've never had this anywhere else.
-Right.

333
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,160
-[Lord Lek chuckles]
-[Horathibodi] Please have some more.

334
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,040
I guess from now on,

335
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,120
one more menu shall be added
to the table of every household.

[mouths]
Let's go eat mango!

339
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,800
But probably not in this household, sir.

340
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,840
[Dech] The dipping sauce is way too sweet.

341
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,440
When one flavor is too dominant,
it's not good for the stomach, sir.

342
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,360
Are you saying a good medicine
tastes bitter and not otherwise?

343
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,880
[Karaked] But this is called an appetizer.

344
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,800
Just don't eat too much, that's all.

345
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,560
You sure take care of your health so well.

346
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,000
I agree.

Champa has been away for the past few days

349
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,880
and left the three of us alone in meals.

350
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,160
If you, Lord Pan, and Lady Chanwad
could join us for dinner,

351
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,480
we sure would have a much better appetite.

352
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,440
-Absolutely.
-Now that we've finished eating,

353
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,960
shall we play a game of poetry?

354
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,440
Splendid, sir.

355
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Chanwad here is not a bad poet herself.

356
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
[Horathibodi] Really?

357
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,360
[Lord Lek] Please listen
to her composition.

I'm done, sir.

"Sun leaves the sky,
making way for humble moon.

Dimmed, faded light

Soon covered by the clouds,
doom of the light.

It's done.

Look. He had composed
in such a short period of time.

375
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,040
Seems like it would be
comparably excellent.

Birds chirping from their nests,
welcoming the new light.

Making its way through the clouds,
the moon shines.

Stars fade their light

to the moon."

It was lovely.

Both poems are excellent.

-Sir.
-[Horathibodi] Hmm.

Don't you want to join us?

She's never done this before, sir.

402
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm not so sure if she knows
how to compose a poem.

-Compete in what, Lord Rueang?
-[soft chuckle]

Well, this.

408
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,240
You may compose some sort of poetry.

Karaked's words are humorous.

But we can only see half of the moon.

Is it more beautiful
than where you're from?

Never.

I want to sing a tune.

Why would I sing a boating tune
when gazing at the moon?

00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,400
Well...

in my heart.

Is the curry boiling yet?

[Salee] We have to add some vegetables.

Salee! Where do you keep
the onions and garlic?

00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,040
There.

[Yaem] Out of my way!

00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,720
What about fresh hot chili and lime?

I'm taking these limes to my lady.

I'm taking some onion, garlic,

[Prik] That's the whole story, my lady.

729
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,560
It sounds obvious
that you started this first.

730
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,320
Sorry?

731
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,800
She is the daughter
of my husband's friend,

732
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,120
yet you dared to prevent her
from giving alms to the monks.

733
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,960
That is not our tradition.

734
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,880
You're a servant, Prik.
Have you forgotten your root?

735
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,920
But she even mentioned your name.

736
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,360
Hmm. I don't see how it's odd.

737

She may mention me all she wants.

What did she say?

739

She said one day, she's going
to do the offering all by herself.

740
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,120
She won't even let you do it.

What did you say?

01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,360
You have returned, Champa.

Yes.

01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,240
Did the funeral go well?

746
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,560
It went perfectly fine.

747
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,360
That's because you went there
to manage everything.

748
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,600
It was graceful ceremony.

749

But now that I'm home,
my ears are already burning with news.

So just don't waste your ears
on such foul words.

Shut your mouth at times.

01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,120
I'll be off to work.

01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,200
Yes?

Come here.

Yes, my lady.

Swear to me, loud and clear.

763
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:10,360
-Swear that...
-That what you told me

764
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,040
was not from your own imagination.

[tense music]

01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,680
Um...

My lady.

768
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,320
I really heard it with my own ears.

769
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,680
Since Lady Karaked doesn't fear anyone,

770
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:47,520
when you were away,
she became haughty like before.

771
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,000
That's not what I want to hear.

772
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,000
I already know what she was like.

773
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,760
I noticed that Lady Karaked

774
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,280
is behaving so arrogantly
as if she wants to take your place.

775
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,760
One day, she might kick you out
to live under the house, my lady.

All right.

You're not talking to me.

I know what. It must be you, maid.

Prik must have told you something.

She did not.

797
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,920
Don't blame her.

798
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,320
Are you sure she didn't say a word?

and will make some grilled shrimps.

I'll serve it to you once it's ready.

Go and check Yaem.

Don't hold a grudge against Prik.

I mean, where is your workplace?

Another man?

So which man am I allowed to miss?

I want a custom-made pan.

There are plenty in the kitchen.

It's not an ordinary pan,
but a state-of-the-art pan.

Then draw it.

I'll take it to the Chinese smith.

A noblewoman shall not gallivant
around the city

[Karaked] Only I know what the truth is,
and that's enough.

1035
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,160
What a beautiful poem.

1036
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:37,080
But your glaces weren't ladylike.

1037
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:43,520
I didn't compose the poem myself.
I just memorized it.

1038
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,840
And I was born with these glaces.

1039

I would like to draw it for you.

1040
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,720
But even when I draw a pig,
it looks like a duck.

1041
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,600
So I'm afraid if I draw a pan,
it will look like a pig.

Grill a pig on a pig.

Very well. I shall take you out.

I shall prepare a boat
for you two tomorrow then?

Have I given you an order, Choi?

1066
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:46,240
You haven't, sir.

1067

What a fluke!

1068

Oh, don't waste your ears on me.

1070
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,600
But you still need to come up
with a better drawing.

1071
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,120
And explain it to the Chinese smith.

1072
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:20,440
Then you might get the pan
that you are hoping for.

1073
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,880
So get ready for tomorrow.

[Dech] Chakrai Noi Canal Gate.

1086

[Karaked] Do they sell books
and pencils there?

A stone pencil.
It's used for writing on slates.

01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,240
I see.

1091
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,440
But to write on a paper,

1092
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:36,960
you need the one with a black core.

1093
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,920
I'd like half a dozen of this, please.

[light music]

1095

The texture isn't smooth.
It feels like mulberry paper.

1096
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:05,080
But somehow smoother.

1097
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,000
Good! So I can write smoothly.

1098
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,960
I'd like three of this, please.

1099
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:12,720
Why do you need so many of them?

1100
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:14,920
Because they aren't on me.

1101
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,280
If it is, I'll buy just one.

What do you expect us
to see from this, my lady?

Make me a thick one, Cheen Hong.

1122
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,160
And don't forget that
the handle must be made out of wood.

1123
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,360
Otherwise, it's too hot.

1124
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,000
I'll keep that in mind.
Is this the size that you want?

Yes.

Oh, and don't forget
to make these holes even.

Otherwise, the pork
won't be cooked evenly.
