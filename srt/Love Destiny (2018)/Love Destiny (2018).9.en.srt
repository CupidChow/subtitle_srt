00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,320
to be seen in this situation.

168
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,480
What a gentleman.

169
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
[light music]

170
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,440
How much is a net?

171
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,240
It costs 200 bia each, my lady.

172
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,960
Then, you put these in bags,
two-hundred each.

173
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,560
And give them to the servants
so they can buy nets for themselves.

174
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,120
You're giving it to everyone?

175
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,680
Of course.

176
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,840
It's not enough, my lady.

177
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,120
What about this?
Can I break one baht into bia?

178
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,960
Of course, my lady.

179
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,960
Eight fueang is one baht.

180
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,320
One fueang is 800 bia.

181
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
We can buy four nets with that.

182
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,120
One fueang can buy four nets.

183
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,480
Then one baht can buy...

184
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,480
thirty-two nets!

185
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,360
Wow. That's a lot of nets.

186
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,360
In my time, we can barely buy anything
with two baht.

187
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,200
Here. Take these two baht and exchange it

188
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,360
then give it to every servant for me.

189
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,920
-This is yours. Take it.
-Thank you.

-This one is yours.
-[servant 3] Take it.

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,440
Don't thank me.

193
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,680
Thank Lady Karaked, not me.

194
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,720
She's over there.

-My lady.
-[Karaked] What is it, Yaem?

196
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,200
It's not enough money, my lady.

197
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,840
There are around ten servants
still waiting.

198
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,240
Then, go back and tell them
that I'll give them some more.

199
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,800
Yes, my lady.

Hey.

[laughs]

206
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,320
I know you have a lot of money.

207
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,480
But the owner of the house

208
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,920
has to buy things for his servants.

209

It's fine.

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,880
-I--
-My mother is asking for you.

211

Me?

212
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,080
Yes.

213
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,760
I told you. Who else could it be?

214

Well, it might be someone named Yu.

215
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,520
Then let's go. What are you waiting for?

Let's go.

217
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,640
Get out of the way, please.

218
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,560
What is this?

219
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,240
Here's the money to buy nets.

220
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,920
Two baht.

Thank you so much, Lady Champa.

We'll take care of them ourselves.

to give the money to Pin and Yaem then.

Please don't rush her about it, Mother.

she doesn't want to marry me now.

I have no idea.

But I don't think it's a serious matter.

I met him at the warehouse yesterday.

and he didn't say anything.

Count Surasakorn

to commit fraud.

Who did they steal money from?

265
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,680
Their own trading company.

[gasps]

267
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,040
How did they do that?

268
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,240
Those two westerners are working
for the British trading company.

269
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,960
They bought some goods from the Treasury.

270
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,120
[Chanwad] They said
it was for their company.

271
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,560
Constance permitted them.

272
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,160
However, they sold the goods
for their own profit.

273
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,640
Is that true, Mr. Phaulkon?

274
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,120
Who told you about this, my lord?

275
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,440
Count Sorasak.

276
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,000
What did he say?

277
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,240
To tell you the truth,

278
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,680
he said that your British friends,

279
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,200
Mr. White and Mr. Burnaby,

280
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,200
bought some goods from the Treasury

281
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,920
with your permission.

282
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,960
[Lord Lek] They bought various things

283
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,360
including gold

284
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,080
and some sought-after precious stones.

285
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,240
That's what happened.

286
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,520
But they absolutely did
follow the regulation.

287
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,320
Do you realize

288
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,240
that they didn't do that for the purpose
of the British trade company

289
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,200
but for their own profit?

290
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,240
Is that true?

291
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,200
This has caused
great damage to the British

292
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,840
because that was
a significant financial loss.

293
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,560
I'm afraid that

294
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,960
there might be a claim
and then the King will find out.

295
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,360
Oh, my god.

296
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,360
[sighs deeply]

297
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,680
But I told Count Sorasak that
you're definitely not involved in this

298
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,280
because I'm certain
that you're truly an honest man.

299
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,320
It must be those two foreigners

300
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,120
who committed fraud
against their own company.

301
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,880
I'm afraid the rumor will be spread out.

302
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,560
Make sure you find ways to prevent it.

303
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,840
Thank you for your kindness, my lord.

As you wish.

307
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,400
Was it an important matter?

308
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,920
It was someone else's fraud.

309
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,960
I wasn't involved.

310
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,560
Then, I'm happy for you.

Please come in.

-Yes.
-Yes.

Please wait.

Lord Hora.

00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,440
Hello.

00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,840
Please excuse me.

I am glad you're here.

323
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,920
We haven't finished
our last conversation yet.

324
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,960
We were distracted
by all the talk about nets.

325
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,040
Well...

326
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,920
I want to know
whether Constantine Phaulkon

327
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,560
is loyal to Marquess Kosathibodi.

328
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,160
That is an odd question.

329
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,920
Why do you think

330
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,560
he is not loyal to him?

331
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,200
[Horathibodi] Phaulkon
has been working for him for ten years.

332
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,720
Marquess Kosathibodi
trusts and supports him.

333
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,960
He introduced him to the King
and made him an official.

334
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,040
Even His Majesty trusts him the most.

335
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,320
King Narai trusts him the most?

336
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
[gasps]

337
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,760
Is he a good guy or a bad guy?

338
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,840
[Dech] Who?

339
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,080
Who?

340
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,760
Don't play innocent.

341
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,080
Play innocent?

342
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,760
No. I'm not playing anything.

343
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,760
Karaked.

344
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,400
What you asked was odd just
like my father said.

345
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,040
Why did you ask him that?

346
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,480
It's nothing, <i><font color="white">Khun Pi.</font></i>

347
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,120
I don't believe it.

348
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,960
[Karaked sighs]

349
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,440
Tell me.

350
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,480
What do you know about Count Surasakorn?

351
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,400
What is he like?

352
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
[foreboding music]

353
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,440
I don't know anything.

354
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,440
You don't know?

355
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,560
Then why did you ask that?

356
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,400
Because I don't know him.

357
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,120
So I thought he could be
both good and bad.

358
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,560
Why are you interested in this foreigner?

359
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,960
Because I argued with him once.

360
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,160
He acted mean.

361
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,160
He threatened Mali and her father,

362
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,200
but Lord Hora said he is a good man.

363
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,560
His Majesty also thinks the same.

364
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,240
That means he has some good in him.

365
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,280
That's the truth.

366
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,760
Everyone has a good side and a bad side.

367
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,160
The important thing is

368
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,320
whether the bad side
is harming other people or not.

369
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,080
Then when will we know that?

370
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
[theme music]

their good or bad deeds for so long.

No.

377
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,800
You didn't hear anything?

378
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,320
Yes.

[sobbing continues]

381
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,360
Your father said Marquess Kosathibodi
loves him like his own son.

382
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Marquess Kosathibodi did say that

383
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,920
since Phaulkon can complete
any task he's given.

384
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,160
Even with the King's commands,
he carries them out perfectly.

[foreboding music]

[foreboding music continues]

387
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,800
[Narai] Today, I will talk about
the fortress construction.

388
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,840
Count Surasakorn.

389
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,520
I gave you an order to research
on how to build it.

390
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,480
Did you take the action?

391
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,520
[Phaulkon] Yes, Your Majesty.

392
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,320
Should we build it or not?

393
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,040
It should be built, Your Majesty.

394
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,040
I have drawn up a plan for the fortress
for you to see.

395
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,840
[foreboding music]

396
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,560
[foreboding music continues]

397
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
How excellent.

398
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,840
Then supervise the construction
according to this plan.

399
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,680
If you do it well,

400
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,240
I will promote you.

401
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,200
I'm most grateful
for Your Majesty's kindness.

402
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,200
Even if the manual work
can be put to the royal soldiers

403
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,320
who perform unpaid labor,

404
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,120
we still have to buy bricks, cement

405
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,440
and sugar cane juice
for sealing those bricks.

406
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,320
Where could I receive the grant
for the construction, Your Majesty?

407
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,840
There.

408
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,520
[Narai] Ask Lord Lek.

409
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,120
Does Treasury in your control
collect a lot of money, Lek?

410
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,560
Then spare me some of it
for the construction, will you?

411
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,160
Of course, Your Majesty.

412
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,920
[tense music]

413
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
[tense music continues]

414
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,080
I don't agree with
the construction of the fortress.

415
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,400
[sighs]
But it is His Majesty's order.

416
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,160
You're right.

417
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,520
I know it is the King's order.

418
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,360
But it stemmed from you, didn't it?

419
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,960
Why didn't you tell him

420
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,120
that it shouldn't be built?

421
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,960
Who could oppose
the King's decision, my lord?

422
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,480
He always has plans to build things.

423
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,560
In the last three or four years,

424
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,120
he has ordered a palace to be built

425
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,200
and also the roads in Lavo.

426
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,880
Now it's time to build a fortress.

427
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,840
People here are not used
to having a fortress.

428
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,120
Do you know why?

429
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,120
It makes us feel like we are confined.

430
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,960
But we are not actually confined, my lord.

431
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,280
Also, there are not that many commoners
in the minor cities

432
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,560
where the fortress will be built.

433
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,160
Many of them will be working
for the crown at that time.

434
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,880
[Lord Lek] Therefore,
they might be overworked.

435
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,520
They have to make a living
for themselves too.

436
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,720
But it has to be done.

437
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,440
I take pity on them.

438
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,680
Then you have to express your concern
to the King yourself.

439
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
[tense music]

440
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,920
Wait.

441
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
I'm going to do it.

442
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,760
Count Surasakorn.

443
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,360
Do warn those two British friends of yours

444
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,560
about the fraud against their own company.

445
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,200
The British are not stupid.

446
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,400
[Lord Lek] It's a serious matter
involving many people.

447
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,520
You can't cover it up.

448
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,920
Where there's a fire, there's smoke.

449
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,080
And you can't stop smoke

450
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,280
from spreading.

451
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,960
Then, you might be drawn into this

452
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,720
because you permitted them
to buy those goods.

453
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,160
And at the same time,

454
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,280
you were selling goods
to the British company.

455
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,680
That amounts to a lot of money you got.

456
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,560
It's over the regulated number of goods.

457
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,800
And you

458
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,560
will end up as a conspirator with them.

459
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,720
What are you waiting for? Go!

460
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,880
[servants] Yes.

464
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,160
Someone told him.

It's Count Sorasak

Earl Phetracha?

469
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:33,760
That means he has a lot of power.
Is that right?

He's the head of the Royal Elephant Corps.

00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,160
Is she beautiful?

498
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,320
[sighs]

499
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,880
Stunning.

500
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,280
That Constance is lucky.

501
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,680
He is untrustworthy.

502
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,280
I'm afraid he might convince King Narai

503
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,360
to convert.

504
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,240
King Narai is wise.

505
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,880
He wouldn't be so gullible to convert.

506
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,480
[elephant trumpets]

507
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,520
Hey, Mahout.

508
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,120
What are you doing to the male elephant?
Why is he crying out so loud?

509
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,400
[elephant moaning]

510
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,800
It might be Kwan, the female elephant.
She's injured.

511
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,760
I'll see if I can find some medicine
for her.

512
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,520
Hey, Duea.

513
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,200
What happened when you told Lord Lek

514
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,560
about how Constance is committing fraud?

515
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,760
[sighs]

516
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,040
When I told him,

517
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,120
he just sat there listening.

518
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,120
He didn't say anything?

519
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,320
He did, Father.

520
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,640
He said...

521
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,520
That man is hard-working and determined.

522
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,240
He works to serve King Narai.

523
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,920
He's also smart and quick-witted.

524
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,480
I don't think he could have done that

525
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,520
to someone he respects
like his own father, Duea.

526
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,160
I knew it.

527
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,440
That Constance must have given him
so many gifts.

528
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,040
Lord Lek loves gifts so much, you know?

529
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,400
There's such a rumor, Father.

530
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,360
That foreigner just knows
how to gain favor with him.

531
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,520
[calm music]

532
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,920
[calm music continues]

533
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,280
Chanwad.

534
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,360
How come we are having
many guests visiting today?

535
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,880
The officials of administrative
departments are here to see Father.

536
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,400
He asked me to prepare food for them
after they finish talking.

537
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,520
I see. They came from the minor cities.

538
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,160
They could have brought along
a lot of gifts.

539
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,200
[sighs]
Get someone to welcome them.

540
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,120
I'll take care of the food myself.

541
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,920
Yes, Mother.

542
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,120
-Boon. Muern.
-Yes, my lady.

543
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
-Follow me to the kitchen.
-Yes, my lady.

544
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,560
Are you Lady Chanwad?

545
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,040
Yes, my lord.

546
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,480
Did you bring anything along?

547
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,440
I'll get some servants to carry it.

548
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,200
No, my lady.

549
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,960
I only have something to talk about
with your father.

550
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,080
Duang.

551
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,800
-[Chanwad] You two, follow me.
-This way, please.

552
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,800
[servants] Yes, my lady.

553
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,760
What happened?

554
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,520
They didn't bring anything.

555
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,040
What? How unusual.

556
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,960
How do they act
with such uncustomary behavior?

557
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,840
[Nim] They should bring something
when they are visiting people's houses.

558
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,160
Then why are they here?

559
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,240
I would like to ask you for a favor.

560
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,560
What is it?

561
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
It's about the construction
of the fortress, my lord.

562
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,680
What about it?

563
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,560
Building a large and durable fortress
according to the King's wishes

564
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,040
would require a lot of labor

565
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,280
and take a long period of time.

566
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,880
It would also require
long-lasting building tools

567
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,080
which we need to find more of
since we don't have any of them.

568
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,960
Families would be without
the head of the house.

569
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,280
Who would find food to support them?

570
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,680
Hey.
[chuckles]

571
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:13,200
I don't see them finding food
to feed their family anyway.

572
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,840
All they do is gamble
and drink, don't they?

573
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,640
[sighs]
Every one of them.

574
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,320
I only see the women of the house
sweating it out of the work.

575
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,760
They clear out thickets.

576
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,680
Fill up the water jar
and prepare for food.

577
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,280
[sighs]
The men like you

578
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,680
are always in gambling dens.

579
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,240
It is not that I don't hear what you said.

580
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,200
I don't agree with
His Majesty's decision either

581
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,200
because

582
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,680
we are not used to having a fortress.

583
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,920
I think

584
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,240
it would make us feel like
we are imprisoned.

585
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,200
I'm also thinking about

586
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,520
telling him what I told you earlier.

587
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,880
I don't know what he would think.

588
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,480
[Lord Lek] You all know that

589
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,360
if he decides to do something,
nobody can change his mind.

590
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,280
It's all because that westerner
told His Majesty so, isn't it?

591
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,560
[tuts]
Be careful what you say.

592
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,520
He can come to my house anytime.

593
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,120
Why would he trust such foreigner

594
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,240
more than his own people?

595
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,160
His Majesty has his reasons.

596
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,040
That man is capable of many things.

597
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,520
All of which King Narai
doesn't know about.

598
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,880
It makes him excited.

599
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,160
People have their good and bad side.

600
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,240
Don't believe in anything
you haven't witnessed yourself.

601
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,920
-Yes, my lord.
-Yes, my lord.

602
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,440
Don't let anyone know about

603
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,960
what we discussed today.

604
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,320
Or else you will be in serious trouble.

605
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,960
[Lord Lek] I will be fine

606
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,560
since I'm one of His Majesty's favorites.

607
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,680
Do you understand?

608
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,280
Yes, my lord.

609
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,440
We will keep it a secret forever.

610
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,960
Now that we are done talking.
You can leave.

611
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,600
[foreboding music]

612
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:14,960
What is it?

613
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:26,640
[man 5] This is 50 chang
that we have gathered for you.

614
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,320
It's to show our support for you
advising against the King's wish.

615
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,200
All right. You can go now.

616
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,040
-Farewell.
-Farewell.

617
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
[foreboding music]

618
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,720
[foreboding music continues]

619
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,600
-[Lord Lek] Put this in my room
-[servant 4] Yes, my lord.

620
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,800
Father.

621
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,680
If this gets to King Narai,

622
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,400
wouldn't it look like you took a bribe?

623
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,040
Oh, that money?

624
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,320
[sighs]
It's not exactly a bribe

625
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,800
since I was planning to advise against
the construction to the King

626
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,040
with or without the money.

627
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,520
But...

628
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:45,720
Chanwad.

629
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,560
Don't worry about it.
It's not that much money.

630
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,720
[sighs]
Do you know

631
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,200
how much money other masters receive
from servants in their protection?

632
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,800
People think it's normal to do this.

633
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,320
You don't have to worry about it.

634
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,240
[Chanwad] But Mother,

635
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,720
I've heard people talking about our house.

636
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,120
They said, for example,

637
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,760
that the trays with a pedestal for fruits
people bought from us--

638
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,440
[Nim] Chanwad.

639
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,840
Those trays came with the fruits.
They were given to your father as gifts.

640
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,560
How could we keep all of them?

641
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,080
Some of them were made of gold and silver.

642
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,960
That's because they respect him so much.

643
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,920
Don't make a fuss about it.

644
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,360
Boon, Muern, follow me.

645
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,040
There is nothing to worry about, Chanwad.

646
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,480
Yes, Father.

647
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,520
[foreboding music]

648
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,080
[all] Please take me in.
I work hard.

649
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,320
[man 6] I'm strong.

650
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,640
-Take me in.
-[woman 1] Take me in.

651
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,560
I can do everything.

652
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,400
[man 7] I work hard. I can do everything.

653
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,360
Lord Hora
isn't going to buy any more of you.

654
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,200
-I work hard. I'm strong.
-I can do everything.

655
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,240
Please take me in.

656
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,200
-Hey!
-[man 6] I can do everything.

657
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,160
He has bought so many.
He won't buy any more of you.

658
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,000
-Why don't you understand?
-[man 7] But I'm a hard worker.

659
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,600
[Prik] Hey. Go back home for today.

660
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,880
You can come back some other day.
He is not buying any more.

661
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,520
-Leave. Just go!
-[man 7] Please take me in.

662
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,720
-[Prik] Leave!
-Lady Karaked.

663
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,240
-[woman 2] Please take me in.
-[man 6] Please take me in.

664
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,360
I'm--

665
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,840
-[Prik] Go!
-[man 6] Lady Karaked.

666
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,240
[woman 2] Please take me in.

667
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,640
-[man 6] Lady Karaked.
-[Prik] Go!

668
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,760
-Leave.
-Lady Karaked.

669
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,920
-I'm here.
-[Champa] Karaked.

670
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,440
-[man 6] Please take me in. I work hard.
-[woman 1] Lady Karaked.

671
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,440
[Prik] Go!

672
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,640
-[woman 1] Please take me in.
-[man 6] Please take me in.

673
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,040
Prik.

674
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,360
[woman 3] I work hard.

675
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,760
-[man 6] Lady Karaked.
-[woman 2] Please take me in.

676
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:15,920
Yes?

677
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,480
Why are they here?

678
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,120
[chuckles]
They are selling themselves as slaves.

679
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,920
Oh!

680
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,480
[Champa] I have bought ten of them already
in the last couple of days.

681
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,160
I won't buy any more.

682
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,000
[man 7] Please take me in. I work hard.

683
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,200
[man 6] Lady Karaked.

684
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,840
-All of you.
-[woman 3] Please take me in.

685
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,600
Why do you want
to sell yourselves here so much?

686
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,040
[all] I want a net. I want a net.

687
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,280
-I want a net.
-[man 6] Please take me in.

688
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,720
-Please take me in.
-[man 7] Me too.

689
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,440
-[woman 3] I want a net.
-[man 6] Lady Karaked.

690
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,000
-Please help me.
-[woman 2] I want a net.

691
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,960
-[man 6] I work hard. I'm strong.
-[woman 2] My lady.

692
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,200
I want a net.

693
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,520
-[man 7] I want a net.
-[woman 3] I work hard. I want a net.

694
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,760
[man 6] I can do everything.

695
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,120
[all] Take me in.

696
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,080
It's because of the nets.

697
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,640
This is surprising.

698
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,760
[scoffs]

699
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,520
Do you realize what you have done?

700
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,160
What do you mean, Lady Champa?

701
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,040
[scoffs]

702
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,640
Are they all gone, Prik?

703
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,040
Yes, my lady.

704
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:24,360
I'll wait at the pier to chase them away.

705
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,040
Chase who away?

706
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,400
The people

707
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,560
who want to sell themselves
as slaves here.

708
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,920
There will be many more.

709
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,560
The whole city is talking about this.

710
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,040
They are saying that

711
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,400
at Marquess Horathibodi's house,

712
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,160
there are mosquito nets
given to every servant for free.

713
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,600
[scoffs]

714
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,960
What are you going to do now?

715
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,520
If you buy more servants,

716
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,520
I'll buy more nets.

717
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,360
Now I know you are so wealthy.

718
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,160
You have so much money to spend.

719
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,400
[sighs]
Chuang, let's go.

720
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,720
Yes, my lady.

721
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,960
[scoffs]

722
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,800
I think they are commoners

723
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,960
who don't want to be conscript soldiers.

724
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,480
I think so too.

725
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,560
Or they want to avoid paying taxes.

726
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,800
[Horathibodi] There are many of them
that are lazy.

727
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,080
They don't want to work for the crown
or pay taxes.

728
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,760
Being slaves in masters' houses is easier.

729
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,120
Being slaves is easier?

730
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,840
It is so.

731
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,840
To ensure they can fill their stomachs
and not go hungry.

732
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,800
I see.

733
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,560
Karaked.

734
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:57,920
I still don't understand

735
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,280
the thing about Count Surasakorn.

736
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,840
Do you have anything else
to tell my father?

737
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,080
You know exactly what I'm thinking.

738
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,560
I'm wondering about the same thing.

739
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,040
[sighs]

740
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,240
No.

741
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,560
But...

742
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,200
Are you worried that he might be harmful
to Duke Kosathibodi?

743
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,440
Do you really think so, Karaked?

744
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,680
He might be or might not be.

745
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,680
How do you know about him?

746
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,160
He's both a good man and a bad man.

747
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,760
[Karaked] So, I can't tell.

748
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,760
But Lord Hora

749
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,120
and <i><font color="white">Khun Pi,</font></i>

750
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,240
shouldn't we be cautious?

751
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,280
How?

752
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,760
We should assume he's a bad man.

753
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,080
I won't sell anything to
the British East India Company this time.

754
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,240
Those two westerners are deceitful.

755
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,040
They even committed fraud
against their company.

756
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,920
You should leave.

757
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,840
[foreboding music]

758
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,040
[foreboding music continues]

759
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,960
[George] I knew someone
would get in the way of our plan.

760
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,760
[Richard] The one we expected.

761
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,600
[George] Constance.

762
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,920
There's only one way to solve this.

763
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,680
[Richard] Make the head of Treasury
lose his influence.

764
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,000
The King granted him the title,
so he can take it back.

765
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,480
[Phaulkon] The head of Treasury

766
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:20,880
is one of the sons
of the King's wet nurse.

767
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,040
They shared breast milk
from the same breasts.

768
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,080
He's also one of his close friends

769
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,080
and they fought in wars together.

770
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,000
Now he serves as the head of Treasury.

771
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,760
He makes a lot of profit for it.

772
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,440
Everyone knows that's your own doing.

773
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,760
You made the money for the Treasury
and the King knows it.

774
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,240
The King favors you, Constance.

775
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:55,040
[Richard] Find ways to remove his title.

776
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,560
That's the only way
we can continue doing this.

777
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,040

780
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,520
[Mali] Count Surasakorn.

00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,200
Are you tired?

00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,840
[somber music continues]

784
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,560
[Mali] I haven't seen my parents
since I married you.

785
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,080
I miss them so much

786
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,800
at this moment.

787
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,760
I would like to ask you

788
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,440
to have someone take me to the capital.

789
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:04,680
Please.

790
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,560
If you go,

791
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,880
who will I hold in my arms?

792
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,320
[Mali sighs]

793
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,960
I haven't been feeling well
both physically and mentally.

794
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,760
If I get to see my parents,

795
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:34,800
I will feel better.

796
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,040
Why do you not feel well?

797
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,720
I...

798
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,560
It's my pregnancy.

799
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,000
I want to ask my mother for advice

800
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,520
on what I should and shouldn't do.

801
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,080
If I didn't have to stay
and oversee the construction,

802
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,400
I would go with you.

803
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,360
I promise it will not be long

804
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,400
until I come back.

805

Tong Guyomar.

810
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:57,520
Yes, my lord.

[calm music continues]

813

What did you say?

814
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,800
[Lord Lek] I think fortresses

815
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,600
are not in our tradition.

816
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,120
People are not used to them.

817
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,400
It would be like we are confined.

818
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,320
The enemy can take over them more easily.

819
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,160
It's also harder to drive them out.

820
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,600
Hey.

821
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,680
Lord Lek, I already gave my order.

822
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:13,760
It's not so important
that it can't be changed.

823
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,800
Please do not waste money
for no apparent reason, Your Majesty.

824
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,560
Don't you want to give me the money?

825
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,280
No, Your Majesty.

826
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,680
The money is yours.

827
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:26,640
You can use it the way you see fit,

828
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,840
but using it for the fortress

829
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:32,560
could end up being abandoned.

830
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,520
Did you just insult me?

831
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,720
When they are attacked or taken over,

832
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,120
it will give a stronghold for the enemy.

833
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:53,960
Lek.

834
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,160
[Narai] Tell me the truth.

835
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,680
Why do you advise against the fortress?

836
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,800
For the reason I have just said,
Your Majesty.

837
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,280
You don't want to spend the money?

838
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,760
I shouldn't feel anything about it

839
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:14,360
because it's all yours.

840
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,240
Isn't it because you accepted a bribe

841
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,200
from those who do not want
the fortress to be built, Lek?

842
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,040
No, Your Majesty.

843
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,520
I didn't take bribes from anyone.

844
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,400
I will ask you again.

845
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,760
Did you take bribes

846
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,160
from those who don't want
the fortress to be built?

847
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,080
No, Your Majesty.

848
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,400
Again, Lek.

849
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,560
Answer me again!

850
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,520
I stand behind my words, Your Majesty.

851
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,200
Everyone, out.

852
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,400
[foreboding music]

853
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,600
You stay, Lek.

854
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:43,640
My lady, don't run. You will fall.

855
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,920
[Pin and Yaem] My lady.

856
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,120
What? Stop calling me.

857
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,360
My tummy hurts.

858
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,960
[both] Take medicine.

859
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,120
I mean I need to poop.

860
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,360
[both] Privy?

861
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,400
Yes.

862
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,880
[Karaked groans]

863
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:02,720
Oh, no. Yaem, let's follow her.

864
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:05,840
-Wait.
-Wait. Get some cloth.

865
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,440
That's not enough.

866
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,600
-Make sure to buy all of what I said.
- [servant 5] Yes.

867
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:16,360
[Chuang] Hey.

868
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,280
Lady Karaked.

869
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,720
I was about to come and see you
at your quarter.

870
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,840
What is it?

871
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,920
There's a foreign lady
waiting to see you at the pier.

872
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,480
[both] My lady.

873
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:31,240
-What?
-[Yaem] Pin.

874
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,440
-Chuang.
-What?

875
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,840
You will get slapped.

876
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,880
Don't you know she's going to the privy?

877
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,960
-Let's go, my lady. Go straight.
-Let's go, my lady.

878
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,840
What about the foreign lady?

879
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,880
Yes, you're right.

880
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,320
Pin. Yaem.
You shouldn't be so alarmed by that.

881
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:00,440
This is Tong Guyomar,
Count Surasakorn's wife.

882
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,160
[Champa] Oh.

883
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:06,680
That's very kind of you.

884
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:08,920
[Champa] Well.

885
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,120
Do you have an urgent matter with Karaked?

886
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:16,760
Yes, my lady.

887
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,280
[Mali] May I be excused
for taking her to talk downstairs?

888
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,240
Sure.

889
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,480
Let's go, Mali.

890
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,280
She's a human being like us.

891
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,040
[Prik] Hmm...

892
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,200
Look at the way she dresses.

893
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,040
Do you think she ever trips on
her own hem, my lady?

894
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,280
Do you want to dress like her?

895
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,120
-[Prik] Gosh!
-So, you can see for yourself.

896
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,240
[gasps]

897
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,320
That would be hideous.

898
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,440
[quirky music]

899
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,640
[light music]

900
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,480
I'm five months pregnant.

901
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:30,760
Really?

902
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,160
-Oh?
-See?

903
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:38,880
[Karaked giggling]

904
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,040
Congratulations.

905
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:43,560
[Mali] Thank you.

906
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,080
Did you come all the way here
to tell me this?

907
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,080
There's something else.

908
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,160
Tell me.

909
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,360
I have a warning.

910
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,320
A couple of days ago,

911
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:07,920
I heard my husband
talking to his friends who do trading.

912
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,480
They talked about Marquess Kosathibodi.

913
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:13,560
I couldn't hear it very well.

914
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,760
But I don't think it's a good thing.

915
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,800
Can you warn him?

916
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,680
Oh, no.

917
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:27,560
It's getting closer.

918
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:30,040
[professor] King Narai was furious

919
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:33,120
that Duke Kosathibodi denied
any wrongdoing.

920
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,720
The King ordered him to be flogged

921
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,680
and that eventually took his life.

922
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:46,160
What is getting close, Karaked?

923
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,320
[laughs]
It's nothing.

924
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:54,040
You can continue.

925
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:58,240
I'm afraid it might be serious

926
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,040
and dangerous.

927
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,640
[Karaked sighs]

928
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,800
It really is.

929
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,560
What do you know?

930
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,200
I only know from
what you just told me, Tong Guyomar.

931
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,680
You know more than I do, don't you?
That's why you are here.

932
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,840
Is this not enough for you, Karaked?

933
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,200
You are smart.

934
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,880
You usually predict
what's going to happen correctly.

935
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,760
I have to go, Karaked.

936
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,840
My helpers might find it suspicious

937
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,120
if I leave home for too long.

938
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,400
I'm leaving then.

939
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,640
Good luck, Mali.

940
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,760
Mali.

941
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,320
I just want to tell you this.

942
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:31,240
I am still the same old Mali.

943
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,760
It's just that...

944
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,080
It's just that what?

945
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,800
[soft chuckle]

946
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:49,360
Let me see you off at the pier.

947
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,520
Okay.

948
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:00,360
[foreboding music]

949
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:09,840
[ominous music]

950
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,880
[ominous music continues]

951
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,520
My lady.

952
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,680
Are you waiting for Lord Dech?

953
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,800
Yes.

954
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,200
Do you know why he hasn't come back?

955
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,480
I'm here to tell you
that he didn't take the boat.

956
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,520
What?

957
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,080
-Give him some water.
-Yes, my lord.

958
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,080
[Pin] My lord.

959
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,920
What is it, Pin?

960
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,320
It's my lady.

961
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,320
She has been waiting for you
all afternoon.

962
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,840
What is it about?

963
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,120
I don't know, my lord.

964
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,960
Where is she?

965
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,880
She is waiting for you at the pier.

966
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:33,840
Pin.

967
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:36,320
What's with you, Choi?

968
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:37,760
[Choi] What's going on?

969
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,880
I don't know either.

970
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:44,400
My lady paced back and forth.
Then she wrote something down.

971
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,840
Then, she paced back and forth
and looked over to the pier.

972
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:49,600
Then, she wrote down again and

973
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,560
-Paced back and forth?
-...paced back and forth.

974
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,400
What? How did you know that?

975
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,120
[sighs]

976
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,480
You haven't answered me.
Where are you going?

977
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,040
I'm going to pick up elephant dung.

978
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:03,080
[calm music]

979
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,400
[calm music continues]

980
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:19,680
Have some desserts,<i><font color="white"> Khun Pi</font></i>.

981
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:23,680
Tell me what's going on.

982
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,360
Mali came to see me today

983
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,760
to tell me something important.

984
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,320

[Prik] Mm-hm!

989
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:55,480
I want to know too.

01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,280
Hey!
[laughs]

991
01:11:58,360 --> 01:11:59,360
My lady.

992
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,480
I'm worried about Lord Lek.

993
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,320
What do you think is going to happen next?

994
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,000
You can tell me.

[Narai] Lek.

Your Majesty.

1000
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,320
I will ask you one last time.

1001
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,960
Are you standing by your answer?

1002
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,560
What is it?

1003
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,000
I am, Your Majesty.

1004
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:41,560
You are my friend,

1005
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:45,160
my brother,

1006
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:47,920
my sibling.

1007
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,560
Your mother also breastfed me.

1008
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,400
We studied together.

1009
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:04,640
We ate together.

1010
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,720
We played together.

We fought side by side.

We worked together.

1013

I love you like you are my blood brother,

1014
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:29,480
like we came out of the same womb.

1015

Have you known that?

I have, Your Majesty.

All right.

Know that

1020
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,280
it will be like that forever.

that Lord Lek is in danger.

[Karaked] I don't know how

1029
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:11,560
but I feel like it's related
to Count Surasakorn.

1030
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,120
I knew it.

1031
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,640
How is it related to him?

1032
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,040
It might be about trading.

1033
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:25,280
I don't think so.

1034
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:30,640
Lord Lek likes that westerner so much.

1035
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,840
He admires him for his excellent trading.

01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:41,760
-Choi.
-Yes, my lord.

1043
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,560
I'm going to Lord Lek's house.

1044
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,560
Okay.

1045
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,560
On the way there,
go see Earl Wisut Sunthorn

1046
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,040
to inform him about this.

1047

Yes, Father.

-Choi.
-Yes, my lord.

You go and take Earl Wisut Sunthorn
to Lord Lek's house.

1050
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,640
I'm going to pick up Lord Rueang.

Yes, my lord.

1052

[Karaked] What about me?

1053
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:13,840
You stay here.

Again?

1055
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,240
I mean all the time, Lord Hora.

01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,160
Okay.

His Majesty asked about the money
three times.

I didn't answer him.

1062
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,040
[Lord Lek] He was probably bluffing me.

1063
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,920
Those in administrative departments
would not sell me out

1064
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,160
because they know
they would end up guilty too.

Do you mean Song Kwae?

No.

They did not, Pan.

1090
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,280
They just took him.

[sighs]

1092
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,800
They should have said something.

1093
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,040
Father is a high-ranking official.

1094
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,680
They only said
that it was the King's order.

1095
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,920
What can I do
to find out how my father is doing?

1096
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,680
That would be so difficult, Chanwad.

1097
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,120
[Lord Pan] When it comes
to the King's order,

1098
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,360
the people who took your father

1099
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,120
must be the disciplinary officers

1100
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,720
from the Royal Police Force.

1101
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,640
They receive orders directly
from the King.

[sobbing]

1103

-Lady Chanwad.

1106
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,520
[Lord Rueang] I have a friend
in the Royal Police force.

1107
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,440
I can ask him about it.

1108

Please don't be saddened
before anything happens.

1109
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,880
[Lord Rueang] It might not be
as bad as you think.

1110
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,960
Because the Duke is like a friend
to King Narai.

1111
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:42,000
That's right, Lady Chanwad.

1112
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,960
Greetings, Lord Pan and Lady Nim.

1113
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,560
What happened to make you gather here?

1114
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,160
The Royal Police took Lord Lek away, Duea.

1115
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:10,920
It must be Constance.

1116
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,200
Are you sure?

1117
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,240
Who else could it be
except for that lowly westerner?

1118
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,600
It's no surprise
if the King falls on his words.

1119
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,280
However, why does he have to do this
to Lord Lek?

1120
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:30,840
[Phetracha] Duea.

1121
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,880
Go back to Lord Lek's house.

1122
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,320
Why, Father?

1123
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,400
To ask Lady Nim...

1124
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:44,320
If Lord Lek took a bribe to advise
against the construction?

1125
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,840
It wasn't a bribe, Duea.

1126
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,520
The administrative departments

1127
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,320
gave him a gift.

1128
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,760
His Majesty asked him three times.

1129
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:07,640
But Lord Lek denied taking
any bribes every time.

1130
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:10,560
The King didn't believe him?

1131
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:11,920
[Lord Rueang] Yes.

1132
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,800
He didn't believe him.

1133
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,080
A messenger from Lavo took the order
to the Royal Police

1134
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,160
to capture Lord Lek immediately.

1135
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:22,560
And...

1136
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,800
What is it?

1137
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:30,640
The King ordered him...

1138
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:32,680
to be whipped.

One round is 40 times.

1145

[Lord Rueang] After he is whipped,

1146
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:58,040
he will be sent home without imprisonment.

to serve the King
to the best of your ability,

that Lord Lek received bribes from people?

Yes.

you just ordered the execution
of your own brother,

I didn't mean for him to die.

From now on, I won't waste a second

any of the decisions.

I don't, Father.

It's the day the King falls on his words

and convert.

to find every way to destroy him

by using his fraud against him

or the trading with the British company.

1252

will be revealed somehow.

My father wants to see him demolished
as soon as possible.

We can start with the British company
he took advantage of.

I will be a prominent figure

What are you talking about?

I was promoted to be Earl Rit Kamhaeng

and I won't stop here.

I will be the highest-ranking official

their main branch in India
sent their representatives to do an audit

1305

because of suspicious circumstances

Hm. It's just like what I said.

They conspired to steal
from their own company.

You're right.

He also said

1310
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,800
they ordered two sets of goods.

1311
01:44:58,800 --> 01:44:59,720
When the goods arrive,

1312

those two British men
would take them away at once.

I knew it.

1314
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:06,120
Though their warehouse is full of goods,

1315
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,520
it couldn't sell out anything

1316
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:11,880
because people were buying
from these men instead.

1317
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,960
Even if the representatives
found any wrongdoing,

1318
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:21,680
Constantine Phaulkon wouldn't be at fault.

1319
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:24,040
The blame will be on those two.

1320
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,240
[sighs]

1321
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:29,720
It's as you said, Dech.

1322
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:32,760
If that's the case,

1323
01:45:33,880 --> 01:45:36,320
then how can we put the blame on him,

1324
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:38,040
this bastard?

1325
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,240
[tense music]

1326
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:51,760
We have to prove to the British company

1327
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:55,160
that he is involved.

1328
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:08,040
I think I know what to do.

[playful music continues]

1335
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,040
[Prik] She seemed strange, my lady.

1336
01:47:41,200 --> 01:47:42,760
-How come?
-Hm!

1337
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:47,600
Like she was sneaking around.

1338
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:51,680
And her eyes were focused on Lord Dech.

1339
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:54,560
What was he doing?

1340
01:47:55,400 --> 01:47:56,280
[Prik] Who?

1341
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:00,480
-My son.
-Well...

1342
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:06,600
He was pacing back and forth,
then he picked up a book.

1343
01:48:07,960 --> 01:48:09,520
And she watched him do what?

1344
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:11,560
Well...

1345
01:48:11,720 --> 01:48:17,160
She watched him pacing back and forth,
then picking up a book, my lady.

1346
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:22,960
What do you want me to do, Prik?

1347
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:26,920
Hmm. It was inappropriate.

1348
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,120
-Inappropriate?
-[Prik] Yes.

1349
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:32,560
-Really?
-It is, my lady.

1350

[foreboding music]

1351
01:48:54,040 --> 01:48:55,080
Are you leaving, son?

1352
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:56,880
Yes, Father.

1353
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:01,280
Be careful.

1354
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:06,320
Muang.

1355
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,200

1358
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:51,000
Would you mind if I come to visit you
from time to time?

1359
01:49:52,120 --> 01:49:54,360
Why did you kill Duke Kosathibodi?

1360
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:57,400
-I did not do anything.
-Liar.

1361
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:59,320
[Phetracha] Do you think
you're his favorite?

1362
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:02,880
Your shadow will be headless soon.
You better watch out.

1363
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,560
-What ceremony do you have in mind?
-Please organize a wedding for me.
