00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,920
All of you, go.

169
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,400
[Pin] I said leave.

170
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,520
-What are you looking at?
-[Yaem] Go.

171
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,240
-[Pin] There's nothing to see here.
-[Yaem] Go.

172
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,200
[Pin] Get out of here, all of you.

173
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,440
Pin.

174
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,320
Of course, I came back...

175
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,160
because I'm so hungry,
I could eat a horse.

176
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,080
[laughing]

177
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,000
-What are you looking at?
-[Prik] Hey!

178
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,800
-What's going on?
-What is it? Get out of the way.

179
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
[Prik grunts]

180
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,720
-Get out of the way.
-Wait.

181
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,400
-You can't go in there.
-[Pin and Prik grunts]

182

[scoffs]

183
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,520
Why can't I go in there?

184
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,600
[Pin] Well...

185
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,600
His lordship is...

186
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,720
What?

187
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,960
He's doing this.

188
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,280
Just say it. What is he doing?

189
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,280
He is hugging her

190
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,960
-and kissing her a little bit.
-[servants giggle]

191
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,120
Really?

192
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,720
Oh, then I won't go in.

193
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,960
You, too.

194
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,360
-Go.
-[both] Yes.

195
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
[dramatic music]

196
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
[dramatic music continues]

197
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,480
I was heartbroken.

198
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,040
I felt like my soul had left my body.

199
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,280
Please don't ever leave me again.

200
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,680
I didn't want to go anywhere.

201
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,040
[Dech chuckles]

202
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,880
But when I touched that book,

203
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,280
my head just exploded.

204
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,680
Then everything went black.

205
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
[foreboding music]

206
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
[foreboding music continues]

207
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,960
[Horathibodi] Dech.

208
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,520
I'm going to destroy this book.

209
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,840
If she touches it again,

210
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,840
we might not be as lucky
as we are this time.

211
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,040
It might affect her in some ways.

212
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,320
[Dech] I know what I have to do.

213
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,280
Please let me handle this, Father.

214
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,600
[Karaked] Lord Hora.

215
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,640
Where is he going?

216
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,200
He's going to take care
of the book of the <i><font color="white">Kritsana Kali</font></i> spell.

217
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,280
What?

218
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,480
[sighs]

219
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,920
He's afraid that

220
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,760
you might not come back into this body

221
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,920
and the real Karaked
would come back instead.

222
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
He would never let that happen.

223
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,120
The real Karaked?

224
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,720
Yes.

225
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,480
[Karaked gasps]

226
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,640
When you called us sisters,

227
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,800
I knew that you're not the same person.

228
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,800
You called me sister, too.

229
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,200
And you just called me "Chik."

230
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,760
What did I call you before?

231
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,440
Mmm...

232
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,240
You used to call me "wench."

233
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,360
[Boong] You called me that, too.

234
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,360
You gave out money.

235
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,800
You never did that.

236
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,520
[Pin] You hugged me.

237
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,240
You smile and are always in a good mood.

238
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,200
You never see us as your servants.

239
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
Then as what?

240
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,240
Her loyal friends.

241
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,160
I used to think...

242
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,360
you were pretending to be nice

243
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,040
to hide your wickedness.

244
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,880
I hated you so much.

245
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,960
[Karaked laughing]

246
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,800
No wonder you were always mean to me.

247
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,560
-Well, I hated you then.
-[Karaked laughs]

248
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,080
What about now?

249
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,320
I love you.

250
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,240
If Lady Champa scolds you,

251
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,360
I will defend you with all my might.

252
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,440
That's a little too much.

253
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,760
Taking me for a thief
was a little too much, too.

254
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
[clears throat]

255
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,680
Look at you.

256
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,680
Are you really going to keep that up?

257
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,520
As for me,

258
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,880
I knew when his lordship knew.

259
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,280
[Pin and Yaem] What?

260
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,280
What does it have to do with me?

261
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,040
When I saw that he stopped hating you
and started to fall for you,

262
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,920
I changed my mind about you, too.

263
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,240
[giggles]

264
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,040
Choi, what are you saying?

265
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,600
Look at his face.

266
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,680
[Karaked] He's blushing.

267
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,800
Karaked, that's enough.

268
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,960
You should know when to stop.

269
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,560
[sighs]

270
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,200
It turns out you have won
the hearts of everyone in this house.

271
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,640
And that includes me, too.

272
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,320
[Horathibodi chuckles]

273
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,520
Now, can you tell us

274
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,920
who you really are
and where you came from?

275
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
[foreboding music]

276
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,120
If I tell you I'm someone else
who came to live in Karaked's body,

277
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,360
will I be kicked out of the house?

278
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,400
Are you asking me?

279
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,120
Yes.

280
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,680
I'm not someone else.

281
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,320
And I didn't come from anywhere.

282
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,920
I am Karaked

283
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,320
and the old Lady Karaked is a part of me.

284
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,600
It's just that this side of me
has just emerged.

285
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,360
From now on,
Lady Karaked will be how I am now,

286
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,000
and there will be no more
of the old Karaked.

287
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,960
Okay, Pin and Yaem?

288
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,680
[both] Okay.

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,640
Okay, everyone?

Okay.

Yes.

Prik, are you okay with that?

00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,280
Okay.

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,000
-Hey, Prik.
-[Prik] What?

296
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,120
Like this?
[laughs]

00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,960
Okay.

-Lady Champa.
-Yes?

Can I have <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i> take me
to see Lady Chanwad?

300
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,640
Mm-hm.

Yes?

I didn't know that you're married...

310
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,680
or did you just...

311
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,320
Just what?

312
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,280
Just gained a little weight,
like how a woman normally does.

[Dech chuckles]

314

only gains weight on her belly?

315
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,200
If so, then she would have gone to a gym.

Pregnant?

[Dech] Uh...

With whose child?

[Rueang] Dech.

326
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,760
Are you really that surprised?

327
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,760
I am surprised.

328
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,320
I didn't know about this.

329

Congratulations.

Thanks.

331
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,600
I was thinking about
taking Chanwad to see you.

332
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,320
I heard you're back.

333

That's why I came to see you first.

00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,880
[chuckles]

335
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
Where is your mother?

336
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,760
I haven't greeted her.

337
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,360
My mother went to live
with my grandmother.

338
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,960
Your grandmother?

339
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,680
The Madam of Dusitaram?

340
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,600
Yes.

341
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,520
She was a wet nurse of the King,
wasn't she?

342
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,920
A royal wet nurse.

343
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,640
Was she a royal wet nurse?

344
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,760
Yes.

345
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,000
She stays at Dusitaram Temple outside
the city and observes the eight precepts.

346
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,080
But I don't get it.

347
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,040
King Narai and Lord Lek have been friends
since they were young.

348
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,840
Why did he order him to be flogged,
then...

349
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,320
[somber music]

350
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,520
Come with me, Dech.

351
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,680
I'm so sorry, Chanwad.

352
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,240
Everything that happens
is caused by our own karma.

353
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,720
I don't blame anyone.

354
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,840
You're good,

355
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,120
to be able to convince Lady Nim

356
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,960
to give you her daughter.

357
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,600
You should compliment your fiancÃ©e.

358
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,720
[Dech sighs]

359
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,280
I'm not trying to insult you here,

360
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,080
but I can totally believe

361
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,440
that it's her doing.

362
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,720
[Rueang and Dech laugh]

363
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,880
I was granted the title
of Count Rueang Narongdecha.

364
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,880
That's good news.

365
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,640
Congratulations!

366
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,120
You will be granted a new title soon.

367
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,560
Mm-hm.

368
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,200
Lord Pan should be highly rewarded.

369
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,080
He should be a minister.

370
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,560
Who are in the French embassy?

371
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
[thrilling music]

372
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,320
[thrilling music continues]

373
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
[lively music]

374
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,320
My lady.

375
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,960
[Prik] Let me teach you
how to make cotton fruit compote.

376
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,520
It's Lord Dech's favorite.

377
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,880
No. I don't want to do it today.

378
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,640
[gasps]
This is bad.

379
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,040
His lordship has been craving it

380
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,280
and I already told him.

381
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,200
[gasps]
What do I do?

382
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,400
It looks like you are going to be whipped.

383
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,640
[scoffs]

384
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,320
You're funny, Prik.

385
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,040
The ambassadors are having a meeting
with King Narai.

386
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,200
It's customary.

387
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,720
Why are you interested in that?

388
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,440
I want to know how it goes.

389
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,040
Oh...

390
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,240
If I could turn into a fly
and go with him,

391
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,160
I would.

392
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,320
Karaked.

393
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,400
[Dech] You look like
you have more questions.

394
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,800
Everyone has already told you everything.

395
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,400
What does Monsieur la LoubÃ¨re look like?

396
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,560
He looks like a French man.

397
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,760
That was a weird question.

398
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,920
Does he like to take notes?

399
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,520
It seems like it.

400
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,920
He was always writing.

401
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,280
-How did you know about that?
-[Horathibodi] Mm-hm.

402
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,080
I was guessing.

403
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,360
Ambassadors like to take notes.

404
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,160
<i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i> does. And so does Lord Pan.

405
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,840
The food is ready.

406
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,960
Viscount Rueang, please eat up.
You haven't been here for a while.

407
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,560
-You too, Marquess.
-[Lord Pan chuckles]

408
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,800
You called them by the wrong titles.

409
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,240
Oh?

410
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,320
How?

411
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,280
The Viscount is now a count.

412
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,080
It's Count Rueang Narongdecha.

413
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,840
The Marquess was also given
a really high-ranking position.

414
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,920
He is now Duke Kosathibodi,
and the Minister of Treasury.

415
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,520
I see.

416
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,200
That was Lek's title.

417
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,640
What about you?

418
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,480
You fiancÃ© was promoted to

419
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,600
Earl Wisarn Sunthorn.

420
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,400
[Lord Rueang clears throat]

421
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,560
As for Marquess Wichayen,

422
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
he is now Duke Wichayen.

423
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,600
He is also the Chancellor of Interior.

424
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,520
The King gave him a lot of power.

425
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,720
[Horathibodi]
That's like his right-hand man.

426
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,280
It had been empty for a while.

427
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,000
How much more
could he extend his influence?

428
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,760
And how much more
could the people dislike him?

429
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,040
Can you make a guess?

430
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,680
There's a rumor that he forced many monks
to leave monkhood

431
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,720
to build the fortress.

432
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,680
Do you think
King Narai would be mad about that?

433
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,280

[foreboding music continues]

436
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,640
You agreed with him?

437
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,280
I told him to build the fortress.
He needs labor.

438
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,000
You don't mind that he forced
people out of monkhood?

439
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,960
They are contributing to society.
What is so bad about that?

440
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,120
Not only are you letting
that lowly foreigner harass your people,

441
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,680
but you're also letting him
harass the monks.

442
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,480
He is using them for a good cause.

443
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,880
Why do you keep making such a big fuss?

444
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,680
It makes me think that
you are going to convert like Prince Pi.

445
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,040
Why did you insult him?

446
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,360
-Am I right or not?
-I won't answer you.

447
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,640
It's none of your business.

448
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,760
I didn't forbid Prince Pi from converting.

449
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,720
He can do what he wants.

450
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,200
I see, you have to keep your promise
to Ambassador de Chaumont

451
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,320
that you will let anyone who wants
to join Christianity do so

452
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,480
and go to their churches.

453
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,840
What a disgraceful promise.

454
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,280
Stop it.

455
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,520
I know that it was the right thing to do
when I signed the contract.

456
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,880
I have my reasons.

457
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,040
I told you this so many times
but you never listen.

458
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,480
Why don't you be King yourself?

459
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
[ominous music]

460
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,480
Stop right there!

Come back and prostrate yourself
before me.

You are my subordinate.

463
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,840
Don't think that you can act this way
just because you're my milk sibling.

464

Thongkam! Thongkam!

465
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,360
Can you see

466
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,200
the consequence of you converting, Shorty?

467
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,640
What did Duke Wichayen use
to persuade you?

468
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,800
Why did you trust him so much?

469
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,520
[ominous music]

470
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,080
[Sorasak] You forced many people
out of monkhood...

471
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,680
and use them as laborers.

472
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,840
Can you tell me
your reasoning behind this?

473
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,160
I would like to hear it.

475
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,680
Building the fortress is an urgent task.

[snickers]

477
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:36,880
Those monks do nothing
but mumble nonsense.

478
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,800
We should make use of them.

00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,640
Hey!

481
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,480
[Sorasak] Let's go!

Damn it!

485
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,520
Count Sorasak didn't receive
any punishment.

486
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,440
He almost knocked my tooth off.

487
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,040
Look!

488
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,720
Get the children to bed.

Just you wait.

491
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,840
One day, I'll have him
kneel down before me.

492
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,440
When that time comes,
it will be my pleasure to cut him up.

You convinced Prince Pi to be your ally

519

that they're starting to push against you.

they let water into the trench,
making it into a canal.

They can also drain the water out

00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,560
The people are saying that

665
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,960
there are hundreds of French soldiers

666
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,400
all over the city of Bangkok.

667
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,760
King Narai also gave out provisions
to the troops at the Bangkok fortress.

668
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,520
The King gave them food?

669
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,480
Why did he have to do that?

670
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,200
[foreboding music]

671
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:10,920
[inaudible dialogue]

672
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,680
[tense music]

673
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,040
Did you allow them to stay
in the Bangkok fortress?

674
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:47,280
[sighs]

675
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,600
What are you making a fuss about?

676
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,880
Did you also give them provisions?

677
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,600
They are here to help us.

678
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,240
They are here to give us knowledge,
to teach us what we don't know.

679
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,760
People all over the city are saying that

680
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,120
it's strange of you
to give an entire city to the French.

681
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,160
This is Bangkok we are talking about.

682
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,920
It's a strategic land that
is just a few days' walk to the capital.

683
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,360
I know what I'm doing.

684
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,000
They are friendly.

685
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,120
[Narai] They are here to teach us.

686
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:29,400
Besides, you know
how the Dutch are invading us.

687
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:34,240
But you are making the people
all over the city, even the monks.

688
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,520
They are worried about whether the city
has been taken over.

689
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,880
That Duke is getting bolder
and bolder every day.

690
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,040
Everyone knows that he was the reason
they sent almost a thousand soldiers

691
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,160
and five heavily-armed warships.

692
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,480
He and General Desfarges,

693
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,840
and that bastard, de Chaumont.

694
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,560
You had them oversee
the construction of the Bangkok fortress.

695
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,960
I just let them oversee the construction.

696
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,080
Can you stop making it a big deal?

697
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,480
[foreboding music]

698
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,880
You are letting foreigners
oppress your people.

699
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,360
They are arrogant and conceited.

700
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,000
They are abusing their power.

701
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,040
They look down on Ayutthaya soldiers.

702
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,640
They drove people out of the place
they're building the fortress in Thonburi.

703
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,960
The people had to leave
because that duke is your official!

704
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,760
Your son, Duea, was the arrogant one!

705
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:50,720
He punched the Duke in the face.

706
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,440
I ask you.

707
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,760
Who do you think is being arrogant?

708
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,760
And where is he?

709
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,480
Duea!

710
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,720
Where is he?

711
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,800
A man must take responsibility
for what he has done!

712
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,200
Do you know that...

713
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,760
even the monks are disheartened
by the Christians?

714
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,960
[sniffles]

715
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,400
Duke Wichayen forced hundreds of monks
out of monkhood to work as slaves.

716
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,800
Don't you think that's wrong,
Your Majesty?

717
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,640
[somber music]

718
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,960
[Phaulkon] Does he think
he can get away with that?

719
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,960
[foreboding music]

720
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,840
That was satisfying.

721
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:11,600
You deserve much worse than that,
you lowly foreigner.

722
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,960
That man is dangerous.

723
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:30,680
That's right.
We should get rid of him first.

724
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,760
He can't do anything.

725
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:40,560
He doesn't have the manpower.
He has no soldiers.

726
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,320
He only has elephants.

727
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,040
Even if he had hundreds of them,

728
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,120
he still can't use them

729
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,720
to fight bullets.

730
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:57,880
This way, please.

731
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,000
I'm glad to see you.

732
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:08,320
I haven't seen you in a long time.

733
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,520
Yes, my lord.

734
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,280
I went to see you at your house
but they said you were here.

735
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,480
I came to see my disciples.

736
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,080
I have so many here.

737
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,600
I just had a meeting with King Narai.

738
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,080
[Phetracha] Master.

739
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,800
Things are getting out of hand.

740
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,120
[Phetracha] The thing about the monks
has become a big issue.

741
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,560
How could we, Buddhists,
let the foreigners terrorize us like this?

742
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,800
It seems someone already took care

743
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,720
of the man
who forced people out of monkhood.

744
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,840
I already sent Duea away to Bangkok.

745
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,600
[Phetracha]
That man won't let this go easily.

746
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,440
The King will back him up.

747
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,520
Let's wait until he cools down.

748
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,440
Cools down?
[laughs]

749
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,160
How can he do that

750
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,120
when there's someone fanning the fire?

751
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,040
And he's probably doing that
with both hands.

752
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,200
I really want all of you to hear
what he said.

753
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,680
I have lost all hope for this kingdom.

754
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:38,440
It looks like it's going to fall into
the hands of foreigners just like India.

755
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:50,120
Whatever happens, happens.

756
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,200
That's true.

757
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,200
Whatever happens, happens.

758
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,600
Karaked.

759
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,160
Karaked.

760
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,120
What is going to happen?

761
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,480
Why do you think I know?

762
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,640
You said it like you know
what is going to happen.

763
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,440
Like the way you know
about everything else.

764
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,200
It applies to everything, Lord Rueang.

765
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,960
[Karaked] Everything.

766
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,160
If it's destined to happen,
nobody can stop it.

767
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,400
I mean everything, <i><font color="white">Khun Pi.</font></i>

768
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:55,800
There's no exception.

769
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,560
Tell Duea to come back from Bangkok

770
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,920
and go to Dusit Temple.

771
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,360
Ask the Madam of Dusit to help him

772
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,480
ask King Narai to grant him a pardon.

773
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,120
If Duea tells the King the truth

774
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:17,600
that the Duke forced so many monks
and novices out of monkhood

775
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,440
to build the fortress,

776
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,680
the King won't be mad at Duea

777
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,160
because he is still fond of him.

778
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,360
But that foreigner is his favorite.

779
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,600
I'm afraid that even
Madam Bua can't save him.

780
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,440
Lord Pan, do you think you can help?

781
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:46,960
Yes.

782
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,320
The Madam of Dusit is your mother.

783
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:55,120
It would carry more weight if you asked.

784
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,640
Can you help your nephew this one time?

785
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,160
Yes.

786
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:08,280
But I would like to ask him
to be more careful.

787
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,640
To not let his emotions take over.

788
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:16,400
It would be better for him
if he wants to fulfill his ambition.

789
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,480
Thank you for your advice.

790
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,360
Earl Phetracha, don't misjudge King Narai.

791
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:27,640
He likes intelligent people

792
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,840
but he doesn't like cunning people.

793
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,400
I understand now.

794
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,840
Don't worry too much about him.

795
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,600
We all know...

796
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,400
who the father of Duea is.

797
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,760
Hey.

798
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,960
Did anything bad happen in our house?

799
01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:00,640
Why is Master Chi Pa Khao here?

800
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,520
What is it?

801
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,040
[Choi gasps]

802
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:20,440
Choi.

803
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,840
-What do you know?
-[sighs]

804
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,360
Prik, I tried to avoid eye contact.
How could you still smell my fear?

805
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,640
[both laugh]

806
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,960
Are you saying I'm a dog?

807
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,280
Don't get upset if you're not one.

808
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:36,880
Then don't get upset about this,
Choi, the doggie.

809
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,360
[Prik scoffs]

810
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:41,200
I was going to answer your question.

811
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:42,440
I won't anymore.

812
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,320
-Are you going to answer me?
-Goodness.

813
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,240
Are you?

814
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,160
-[Choi] I will tell you!
-Prik.

815
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,880
You don't have to force it out of him.

816
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,160
[sighs]

817
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,880
Choi, you can go.

818
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:54,840
Okay.

819
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,280
-Listen to me, Prik.
-Yes.

820
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,120
I think it's about...

821
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,720
about...

822
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,320
about...
[giggles]

823
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,040
-Hey!
-[gasps]

824
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,560
That got on my face.

825
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:12,520
Take this.

826
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:15,360
[Chik] If she hadn't done that, I would...

827
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,920
Chik, don't be disrespectful.

828
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,400
Just say it, Chuang.

829
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,720
-Right. Do you really know?
-I do.

830
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:26,440
Of course, he's here to set
the auspicious date

831
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:29,240
for our lord and lady's wedding.

832
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,680
[Chik] Are you sure?

833
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,120
Really?
[Chik giggles]

834
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,480
That holy thread I gave you,

835
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,240
do not take it off
unless you really have to.

836
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,440
Yes, Master.

837
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,560
Are you really leaving?

838
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,080
You know what's going to happen,
don't you?

839
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:14,960
I told you.

840
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,640
Whatever happens, happens.

841
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,400
Why are you worried about it?

842
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,200
Don't be afraid.

843
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,720
Your fiancÃ© can't be harmed that easily.

844
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,680
He was born with the gift of charm.

845
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,320
[Chi Pa Khao] Whoever he meets
will grow fond of him.

846
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,600
Even his enemy can't harm him.

847
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,520
Now that he's with you,
his lucky star shines even brighter.

848
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,400
A terrible accident happened

849
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,000
but you still managed to bring him back,

850
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:56,000
even though the whole town
made a big fuss out of it.

851
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,640
Master.

852
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:15,280
I want to ask you about...

853
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,640
me coming to live in this body.

854
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,880
That man became a monk for you.

855
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,840
It's all because of his love for you,

856
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,680
combined with your sister,
Karaked's strong desire

857
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,400
for your help,

858
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,640
and the power of the Kritsana Kali spell.

859
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:46,040
All these things contributed
to you being reborn here

860
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:50,480
in your sister's grown-up body

861
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,600
four years ago.

862
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,240
He became a monk to send me here?

863
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,720
[Chi Pa Khao chuckles]

864
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:05,640
It's your destiny that brought you here.

865
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,120
What?

866
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,400
In this life, you died at a young age.

867
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,120
So, you have to come back here
to be with your soulmate.

868
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,200
Even when there are obstacles,

869
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,240
they cannot keep you two apart.

870
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,080
Because of destiny?

871
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,320
[Chi Pa Khao chuckles]

872
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,440
Right, I understand now.

873
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:47,320
He became a monk to send me here
so I can be with the one I'm destined for.

874
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,240
[Chi Pa Khao chuckles]

875
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,520
I have to go now.

876
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,680
[romantic music]

877
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,400
Who were you talking about?

878
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:22,920
Oh, no.

879
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,480
Who is the man you were talking about?

880
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:40,160
[sighs]
It's Rueangrit.

881
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,040
He's my friend.

882
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,920
He became a monk
because you came here, didn't he?

883
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,120
He must look like Rueang.

884
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,200
That's why you act strange around him.

885
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,520
And you two got along so quickly.

886
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:10,960
It's because he looks like him
and has the same name, wasn't it?

887
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,840
You're smart.

888
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:18,240
Does he love you?

889
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,880
Yes.

890
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,200
He already told me he loves me.

891
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,040
[Dech sighs]

892
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,200
What?

893
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,880
You are not mad or jealous at all?

894
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,360
Why would I?

895
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,200
From what I heard,

896
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,440
you died there and were reborn here.

897
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,880
You cannot go back there now.

898
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:59,040
You two have been separated forever
and will never see each other again.

899
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,320
Why would I be jealous?

900
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,120
That would be embarrassing.

901
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,360
Stop saying such nonsense.

902
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,920
Come up to the house.

903
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,200
My mother would have been worried by now.

904
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,720
I don't know about that.

905
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,040
[Karaked] <i><font color="white">What was that?</font></i>

906
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,200
Is this the important thing
you told me about?

907
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,400
[babbling]

908
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,800
I wasn't kidding at all.
[grumbles]

909
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:51,320
You're funny.

910
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:54,600
-My lady.
-[both giggling]

911
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,800
[spits]

912
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,920
You have to do something.

913
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,840
Don't kid around like this.

914
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,520
I saw that

915
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:10,600
you and the foreign lady are friends,
so that's why I rushed here to tell you.

916
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,960
Hmm... I'm not messing around.

917
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:16,280
But I'm thinking about what I should do.

918
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:20,440
Come to think of it.

919
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:21,800
What is it?

920
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,080
The lady of Duke Wichayen
will never leave him.

921
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,960
Hmm?

922
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,360
Why do you think that?

923
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,000
People are saying that the lady

924
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:39,120
is moving back to stay with her father
in the Portuguese community.

925
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,040
-Well, they will make up eventually.
-[Prik] Hm?

926
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,560
-I don't have to intervene.
-You have to stick your nose in.

927
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,400
Huh?

928
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:50,840
-I have to...
-Stick your nose in their business.

929
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,800
You said it yourself.

[sighs, clicks tongue]

931
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,480
It's nothing serious.

932
01:14:57,880 --> 01:14:59,200
How do you know?

933
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,080
[gasps, grunts]

934
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,640
Did "History" tell you that?

935
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,040
[gasps]
What did you say?

936
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,320
Well...
[whimpers]

937
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,400
Pin and Yaem

938
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,520
told me that...
[whimpers]

939
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,880
you have a <i><font color="white">Kuman Thong</font></i> named "History".

940
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,760
[Prik] It's making my skin crawl.

941
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,960
This is so scary.
[whimpers]

My lady.

943
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,920
Don't make that face. It's not okay.

944
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:33,840
Okay. Okay.

945
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,960
I'll persuade her
to go back to her husband.

946
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,120
That's a very good idea.
[chuckles]

947
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,200
Can you tell her this for me?

948
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,760
It's normal

949
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,840
for noblemen to have multiple wives.

950
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:55,640
Lord Pan has 22 wives.

951
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,520
The only nobleman who only has one

952
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,440
is probably the Earl of this house.

953

she has nothing to worry about.

I'm fine now.

01:33:54,200 --> 01:33:57,240
-I will go grind some <i><font color="white">plai</font></i> root.
-I'm coming with you.

1152
01:33:58,240 --> 01:33:59,280
Why?

1153
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,280
You stay.

1154
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:06,320
Oh, okay.

1155
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:08,720
[Dech] I'll go.

1156
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,080
Don't you worry about it too much.

1157
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,720
Do you understand, Pin?

1158
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:26,800
Yes, my lord.

Pin, I could hardly breathe.

She keeps reading that over and over.

No.

1168
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,960
That's her notebook.
She writes in it every day.

[Pin] She acts strangely.

01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:03,760
She looks worried, then relieved.

1184
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:06,080
Then, she looks worried again.

1185

The wedding is getting close.

Will I give birth
before the Earl and Karaked's wedding?

If not,

1190
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:41,680
you can go while you're pregnant.

1191
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,320
People will stare at me.

1192

People will stare

1193

nonetheless.

1194
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:08,480
Why?

1195
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,960
Because you're very beautiful.

Lady Chanwad gave birth a few days ago.

Why hasn't Karaked gotten
her body scrub and treatment yet?

1210
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,120
She is going to be a bride in a few days.

-I will--
-[Prik] My lady.

1212

It's her skin.

Why should you care?

1214
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,520
You are not the one getting married.

1215
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:35,160
Prik, are you my servant or a lady?

1216
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,960
I'm a servant.

1217
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:39,560
If I were a lady,
I would say more than this.

Goodness.
I'm going to see Lady Karaked then.

That was harsh.

You are not doing anything.

-I'm doing this.
-You can do it later.

1233
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,080
No. I'll forget.

1234
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:22,720
Hmm. Then forget about it.

1235
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:26,120
That's a good thing.
That way, you don't have to worry.

The wedding is very important.

Lord Hora has picked
an auspicious day for it.

1238

If you keep avoiding it, it will look like
you are disrespecting him.

1239
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:47,320
Lady Champa is worried too.

1240
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,320
You shouldn't do this to the elders.

1241
01:39:58,480 --> 01:39:59,640
Okay?

-Okay.

Today is an auspicious day.

[Horathibodi] I would like to ask
for Karaked's hand on behalf of my son,

Thank you, Chanwad, for staying with me.

I'm afraid you might be lonely.

You have to stay inside for three days.
It's a tradition.

Yes. Why can't I?

I thought you can't wait to be married.

You're right.

Not at all.

A junk as in a boat?

I've seen it but I've never been on one.
