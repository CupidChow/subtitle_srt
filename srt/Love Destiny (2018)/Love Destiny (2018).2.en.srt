[suspenseful music]

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,840
I asked you a question.
Why aren't you answering me?

00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,640
-I don't know what to say.
-Answer my question!

332
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,360
And why did you have to ask that question?

333
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,520
What? You are so odd.

334
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,080
It's true. Since...

335
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,960
you already know who Karaked...

336
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,640
You already know...

337
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,000
who I am.

338
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,840

[sucks teeth]

00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,640
Man, he's like an x-ray machine.

341
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,120
What did you say? Say it again.

342
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,480
Nothing. I was just musing.

343
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,040
-That's a lie.
-[Karaked] That hurts.

344
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,920
What you said sounded odd.

345
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,720
What language was that?

[suspenseful music]

347
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,760
You're hurting me.

348
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,640
Tell me who you are right now!

349
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,800
-[Dech] Who?
-I'm Karaked!

-That's not true!
-[Karaked squeals]

Jeez, why are the men of Ayutthaya
so brutal?

352
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,800
Answer me.

353
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,600
Don't come near me, or I'll fight you.

354
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,360
What did you say?

355
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,040
I'll fight you.

356
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,600
You really have gone mad.

357
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,240
[Dech] You're a woman,
but you want to fight a man.

358
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,840
I've never seen anything like this.

359
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,960
So what? Men or women, we're all human.

I need you two to be quiet.

I heard some yelling.

What happened, Dech?

374
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,640
Nothing.

375
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,280
I was just talking to Karaked.

376
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,480
Talking?

377
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,960
Why were you talking so loudly?

378
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,680
What's wrong with her?

379
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,040
She's gone mad.

Dech,

381
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,480
did you just figure that out?

382
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,080
All the servants know that
she has gone mad.

383

Isn't that right, Prik, Chuang?

This is Ayutthaya, right?

-Yes.
-Yes.

-What?
-What?

393
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,800
I mean the King. What's the King's name?

394
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,360
Oh, do you mean His Majesty?

395
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,800
Tell me his name.

396
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,920
King Narai, my lady.

397
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,800
King Narai.

398
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,840
What year is it then?

399
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,440
We were invaded
for the first time in 1569...

400
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,120
during the reign of King Mahinthrathirat,
and King Narai came after that,

before Phra Phetracha.

402
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,720
So this year...

403
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,880
must be...

404
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,480
[Pin] It's late, my lady.

You should go to bed.

I can't yet. I haven't brushed my teeth.

Do you need to brush your teeth
before going to bed?

408

Well, of course, I do.
Can you bring me my toothbrush?

No,

do we usually give alms
to just five monks?

665
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,240
This is the Chao Phraya River.

666
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,040
I see.

667
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,640
Then the Lopburi River must be over there!

668
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,200
You have never been there.
How do you know?

669
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,840
What? Well, I studied it.

670
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,280
Oh, it's my father.

671
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,240
My father taught me.

672
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,480
Of all the things you have said,

673
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,240
how many of them are true?

674
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:03,920
All of them.

[whimsical music]

684
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,400
Are those the Portuguese?

685
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,080
Yes.

686
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,280
Maybe not. They're probably Dutch.

687
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,440
If I was not certain,
how could I have answered you?

688
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,360
-[Karaked] They look the same.
-[Dech] They dress differently.

00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,680
That's true.

[grandiose music]

691
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,760
[Dech] What else do you see?

692
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,920
Wat Chai.

693
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,080
Chaiwatthanaram Temple.

694
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,680
[Karaked] Is it over there?

695
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,840
[Dech] Yes, that's Wat Chai.

696
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,360
So we live near Wat Chai?

697
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,640
Yes.

698
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,200
I was there on my last day.

699
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,000
What did you just say?

-[Choi] Yes, my lady.

703
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,160
Which fortress is this?

704
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,000
Khun Lakorn Chai Canal Fortress.

705
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,320
Khun Lakorn Chai Canal.

706
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,200
It leads to the city.

707
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,400
Yes.

708
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,120
[Dech] Through Chong Kud Gate over there.

709
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,440
This canal stretches to the river
on that side.

710
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,960
Why is the canal called
Khun Lakorn Chai Canal?

711
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,320
Are there any plays to watch?

712
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,880
Yes.

713
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,280
There's a Baan Cheen Market,

714
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,840
a tavern, a playhouse,

715
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,000
a Chinese opera house,
and also a teahouse.

716
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,960
So this is the place.

717

[whispers]
Well, Rueang, this is it,

718
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,360
the Ayutthaya brothel
that you wanted to visit.

719

What did you say?

722
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,280
Oh, there are so many boats.

723
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,560
What kind of boats are they?

724
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,640
-Yod, go.
-[Yod] Yes, my lord.

[quirky music]

726
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,680
[Dech] They are cargo boats owned
by both the royal state and merchants.

727
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,640
Marquess Ratcha Bangsan lives around here.

728
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,040
He takes care of cargo ships for the King.

729
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,040
And over there

730
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,720
is Marquess Wisut Sakorn's house.

731
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,000
He's a harbormaster who oversees
all the rafts in the capital.

732
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,400
Over there in the middle, right?

733
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,120
Wow, that's true. There are so many rafts.

-Yes, my lord?

01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,040
Go along the river...

737
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,280
and enter the capital
through Chakrai Noi Canal Gate.

738
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,840
To the Yellow Cloth Jungle,
right, my lord?

739
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,480
Yes.

740
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,160

[lively music continues]

746
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,760
You said the Yellow Cloth Jungle
was strange.

747
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,480
How is it strange?

748
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,200
Well, it's obviously a market.
Why is it called a jungle?

749
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:03,120
Because a jungle
is where many trees are together.

750
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,960
Oh, you're right.

751
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,040
That's cool.

752
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,120
[comical music]

753
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:17,120
Oh, those are monks' robes.

754
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,680
Mm.

755
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,600
We've only walked past monks' robes.

756
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,040
Didn't you see them?

757
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,320
Oh, man.

758
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,520
That's right.

759
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,480
Because there are
a lot of monks' robes here,

760
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,160
this place is called
the Yellow Cloth Jungle.

761
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,720
[Champa] Mm-hm.

762
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,680
[tranquil music]

763
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,240
When is the ceremony, Chanwad?

764
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,840
The day after tomorrow, Lady Champa.

765
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,640
Father wanted me to ask you

766
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,840
for two of your servants
who are good at fruit carving.

767
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,720
Certainly.

768
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:25,680
I will tell them to go back
with you today.

769
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:31,800
The ceremony is on the day after tomorrow,
so you'll have to start carving tomorrow.

770
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:37,960
Thank you, Lady Champa.

771
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,800
[Chanwad] Father also told me
to invite <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i> Dech.

772
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,360
He said he wanted to have
a chess rematch with him.

773
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:49,440
I'm certain he would go if he's free.

774
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,400
When is <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i> coming back?

775
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,400
I would like to invite him myself.

776
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,640
Oh, it's just that...

777
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,120
he has taken Karaked to the market
for a day out.

778
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,360
[Champa] They've been gone
for a long time.

779
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,800
They should be back soon.

780
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,480
For a day out?

781
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,320
[somber music]

782
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,760

[whimsical music]

784
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,520
[Pin] Hey, hey.

785
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,920
Don't just stop and stare.
Are you going to sell the robes or what?

786
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,240
Right, if you're not selling them,
then we can go to another stall.

787
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,000
You servants have foul mouths.

788
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,640
Why won't I sell them?

789
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,600
You were just staring at her so hard,
I thought you weren't selling them.

790
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,400
My lady,

791
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,200
you are gorgeous.

792
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:10,480
Your face is lovely,
and your words are sweet.

793
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,400
Is she your wife?

794
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,680
No, I just live in his house.

797
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,800
My lady has made an order.
Why don't you prepare it for her?

798
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,080
I know, I'm doing it right now.

799
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,440
[woman 1] Jeez, you're in such a rush.

800
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:55,400
[Yaem] Here, Waen, take them.

801
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,040
Whoever heard of a merchant not selling?

802
01:06:58,280 --> 01:07:00,760
[woman 1] Shut up
if you don't know anything.

803
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,760
Well, well, someday I'm going to
sell products right next to you,

804
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:07,520
you loud-mouthed merchant.

805
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,080
[woman 1] Come on. I'll be waiting.

806
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,560
Right here.

807
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:13,800
-Keep a spot for me right here.
-Yes, yes.

808
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:16,240
I'm going to sell monks' robes
just like you.

809
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,560
-Yes.
-[chuckles]

810
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,200
[woman 1] You had better sell
better than me.

811
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,560
[Yaem and Pin chuckles]

812
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,480
What are you looking at?

813
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:27,120
You were watching them like you've
never seen anything like this before.

814
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,720
I thought they were fighting.

815
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:32,960
[tense music]

816
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,840
Let's go, Waen, Yod.

817
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,120
-Yes, my lady.
-[Yod] Yes, my lady.

818
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,600
-What did you say?
-Which temple is that?

Yaem. Our lady is playing up to Lord Dech.

Where is Wat Nang Chi Market?

You're the one who bumped into me.

You can't blame us
for how your goods got dirty.

You were in our way.

984
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,200
I wasn't in your way.
I was carrying things into my shop.

985
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,560
Don't put the blame on me.

What the heck?

988

I am Count Surasakorn's personal guard,

989

He is, as well.

Is that so?

993
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,560
All right, we'll let this one
slide this time.

994
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,120
You can go now.

995
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,040
Wait.

[tense music]

997
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:34,600
You bumped into him.
He's the one who should blame you.

998
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:40,440
Young lady, don't you know
who you're talking to?

999
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:44,680
You want to know more about us,

1000
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,560
don't you?

1001
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,880
You flirty jerk!

1002
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,520
Quite a honeypot, aren't you, young lady?

1003
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:03,960
You bumped into him and you spat on him.

1004
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,640
That was very rude.

1005
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,080
It's not for you to decide
whether to let him slide or not.

1006

He's the one who should decide
whether to let you slide or not.

01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,720
[Pin] Oh, dear.

1008
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:18,880
My lady, these <i><font color="white">farangkees</font></i>
are Count Surasakorn's personal guards.

1009
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,400
I don't care whose guards they are.

1010
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,400
Oh, dear.

1011
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:26,000
I don't agree with this sort
of harassment.

1012

Thank you so much, my kind lady.

1013
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,200
It's fine. This is nothing.

1014
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,760
You're government officers.
Aren't you ashamed of bullying civilians?

1015
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,240
This kingdom lets foreigners
enter and trade freely,

1016
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,960
but not persecute civilians like this.

1017
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,480

the King's royal teacher.

No one can push our lady around

just like that.

1030

Mali.

1042
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,520
I haven't forgotten about you.

1043

You are outspoken, young lady.
You speak more boldly than many men.

[exhales heavily]

1144
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,280
You have to bear in mind, Ketsurang,

1145
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,920
that you don't like Chanwad,

1146
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,360
because she's trying to steal
Mr. Dech away from you.

[grunts]

1148
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:13,880
She can have him if she wants.
I don't feel anything.

1149
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,560
Good grief!

1150
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,640
He's not that handsome
and he's not my type anyway.

1151
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:26,040
[comical music]

1152
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:40,880
Should I be Karaked or Ketsurang?

1153
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,240
I'm so confused.

1154

[calm music]

1155
01:31:58,520 --> 01:32:01,320
Tell your father that I will be there.

1156
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:05,440
<i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>,

1157
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,680
I have something to talk to you about.

1158
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,600
I'm not sure if it's appropriate.

1159
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,480
Yes, my lord.

1160
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:26,040
What is it, Chanwad?

1161
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:27,920
For the ceremony,

1162
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,360
my father

1163
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,200
does not want...

1164
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,160
[Chanwad] Uh...

1165
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,880
Karaked.

1166
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:43,440
He told me not to invite her.

1167
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,240
Why is that?

1168
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:51,880
You and Lord Horathibodi cast
the Kritsana Kali spell.

1169
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:56,760
Father believes that there must be
an important reason behind it.

1170
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:59,480
[Chanwad] He knows the reason.

1171
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:05,200
He would like to discuss it with you

1172
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,200
at our house on the day of the ceremony.

[playful music]

1174
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:26,960
-Has Chanwad already left?
-Yes, Mother.

1175
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:35,440
I think it is very strange.

1176
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:38,360
-[Champa] It is really strange.
-Yes.

1177
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,760
What is this, Dech?

1178
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,040
Are you going to say just one word?

1179
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,240
How is it strange?

1180
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,920
Don't you see what I see?

[softly]
My lady.

1183
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:00,960
[Dech] I do, actually.

1184
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,600
But I don't think much of it.

1185
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:07,520
I think it's because of
the Kritsana Kali spell

1186
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,480
-that almost killed her.
-Right.

1187
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:15,400
She did not die,
so that means she didn't do it.

1188
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:20,360
[mouths]
My lady.

1189
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:27,760
[all] Oh, my goodness!

[shushes]

1191
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,320
[Champa] That's Pin and Yaem.

1192
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:36,280
Those two servants. Even if we ask them,
they wouldn't tell us anything.

1193
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,800
They're on their lady's side.

1194
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:45,320
Anyway, Karaked seems eccentric recently.

1195
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,920
She used to be so nasty,

1196
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:50,560
but now, she's being unnaturally good.

1197
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:54,080
Why do you think
she's being like that, Mother?

1198
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:57,520
I think she's being possessed by a ghost.

come here now.

[tense music]

Why didn't you heed me?

Dech,

1210
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:31,560
your voice is too loud.

1211
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,160
You startled me.

1212

[tense music]

1213
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,480

[tense music]

1215
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:57,400
Sit down.

1216

All right.

1217

Pin, Yaem.

1218
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,280
Why did you call for them?

1219
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:14,760
Don't ask. It's not your business.

1220
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,240
Well, then I'll be going.

1221
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:18,600
Stay where you are.

1222
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,360
You said that it's not Ked's...

1223

that it's not my business.

1224

Pin, Yaem, did you not hear?

1225
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:31,640
Lord Dech is calling for you two.

1226
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,200
Why do you stay still?

1227
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:36,960
[both] Yes, my lady.

1228
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:39,880

the matter with her.

-Careful, my lady.
-Right.

1235
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,440
You two, tell me...

1236
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,280
who your lady talked to today
and what she talked about.

[both whimper]

1240
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,360
I'll tell you.

why did you lie
that you hadn't done anything?

1243
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:31,440
I was scared of getting scolded.

1244
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:33,960
You had not been scared then.

1245

-I was not.
-Had not.

1246

Right, I had not.

Who are you and where are you from?

[tense music]

Why do you think like that?

I'm right, am I not?

What?

1255

Are you surprised that I know?

[Dech scoffs]

1257

Well, are you going to leave quietly,

1258
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:22,240
or do I need to call a shaman?

-Go.

Suffer no more...

and be reborn.

1263
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:35,160
Any later, and your soul will be lost

1264
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,800
and will be unable to pass on
to the next life.

[Dech] Actually, I pity you.

1267
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:51,200
You are a lost soul without kith or kin,
so you need someone to rely on.

Do you think I'm a ghost?

Mr. Dech,

1275
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,880
I'm not a ghost. I'm Karaked.

1276
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:25,840
It's because of the Kritsana Kali spell

1277
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,040
that I became like a mad amnesiac
who speaks nonsense.

1278
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:33,200
You're the one who's responsible for this
since it was you who cast the spell on me.

1279
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,720
And you accuse me of killing a person.
I did no such thing.

1280

You accuse me, curse me,
and now, you're saying I'm a ghost.

I could sue you for defamation.

1282

Stop saying such abominable things!

You are an insolent, mannerless woman.

[Dech] Your words make no sense.

1288

You are hard-hearted
and have no kindness for your servants.

You do not care to work
and just laze around all day.

Lord Dech has always spoken like that.

you are an orphan.

And you're also the daughter
of Lord Horathibodi's best friend.

1304
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:11,520
I see.

1305
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:18,680
Considering what you told me
about my past behavior,

1306
01:41:19,440 --> 01:41:22,800
it's probably right for him
to berate me like that.

1307
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:28,240
He probably thinks of me as a witch.

1308
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,640
"Hard-hearted. Have no kindness."

1309
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,600
"Do not care to work."

1310
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:37,480
"All day, just..."

1311
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,200
What was it?

1312
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:43,480
-Laze around.
-"Laze around."

1313
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:44,840
Right.

1314
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,160
But I don't know what it means.

1315
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,680
It's...

1316
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,360
Stop, I don't want to know that much.

1317
01:41:54,640 --> 01:41:57,600
All I do is dress up and...

1318
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:01,480
flirt around.

1319
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:05,720
Like this?

1320
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:10,480
I've never done that.

1321
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:13,840
And then what?

1322
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,800
My words make no sense.

1323
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,320
[scoffs]

1324
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:20,320
Well, I'm afraid it's probably true

1325
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:23,120
because that's who I am.

1326
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:29,320
[Champa] Dech.

1327
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:32,960
Yes, Mother?

1328
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,080
Is it as I thought?

1329
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:45,880
She said no.

1330
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:48,280
What?

1331
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:50,720
Did you just ask her?

1332
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:54,680
Yes, I asked her directly.

1333
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:59,240
Come on, who would answer directly?

1334
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:01,720

[sighs]

1337
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:11,360
That's true.

1338
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:15,720
Well, then why did you ask her?

1339
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:23,920
Do you have another way
of getting the truth out of her?

1340
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:32,000
The Kritsana Kali spell
is stronger than any shaman.

1341
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:33,600
Yet she survived it.

1342
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:42,560
Whoever she is, she won't be able
to hide the truth for that long.

1343
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:44,000
[sighs]

1344
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:48,240
I'm worried about this
because she is your betrothed, Dech.

1345
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:50,080
I still have time.

1346
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:53,760
Time? Time for what?

1347
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,080

[foreboding music continues]

1351
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:42,120
I'll have to do something.

1352
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:46,320
What will you do, my lady?

1353
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:48,920
[foreboding music]

1354
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:00,360
Both Lady Champa and <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i> think
I'm a ghost possessing Karaked's body.

1355
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:03,360
Lord Hora, please use the spell on me.
If I can't take it, I'll leave.

1356
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:06,960
What you did back there was distasteful.

1357
01:45:07,280 --> 01:45:09,920
The host didn't invite you.

1358
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,960
Are you happy now?

-[gasps]

1360

Baron Sunthorn Thewa?

1361
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,520
This is my hair.
I can do whatever I want with it.

1362
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,000
What did I do wrong?

1363
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:25,240
You will have to face everyone
at the temple like that,

1364
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,200
which won't be good for you.
