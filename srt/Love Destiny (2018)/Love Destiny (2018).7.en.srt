Well, it's for someone I know.

Someone who has both Lady Chanwad
and Mali as love interests.

I think you forgot one more.

If you don't finish it in time,
you'll be the one who gets whipped.

What is it?

242
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,680
Why did you have to whip Choi that hard?

243
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,360
That wasn't the hardest I can do.

244
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,080
And he knows that if it was Prik,
his back would be--

[Prik] Watch your mouth.

What else could it be?
You shouldn't have asked.

250

That's right.

251
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,960
If I'm going to whip someone,
I might as well do it for real.

252
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,320
If I don't, then what's the point?

253
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,400
And you. You're one to talk.

254
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
You're not so different from me.

You shouldn't have whipped him so hard.

258

If I were to be whipped,

259
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,720
would you be that harsh on me?

[sighs]

261
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,560
Of course, I wouldn't be.

262
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,160
Ask Prik.

263
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,560
If it were Boong, what would you do?

264
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,440
I wouldn't be too hard either.

265
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,040
Oh, that's a relief.

266
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,800
You think so?

If one day,

270
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,080
my lady let me

271
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,920
whip Lady Karaked again,

272
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,800
just you wait,

273
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,360
I would whip her with all my strength.

274
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,040
Just you wait.

275
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,280
[tense music]

276
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,680
Prik.

277
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,440
The lady is not who she used to be.

278
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,120
That's right.

279
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,080
I think so too.

280
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,840
What do you think?

281
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,840
We'll see.

282
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,360
If she really has changed,

283
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,520
it wouldn't be too hard for me
to accept her

284
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,200
as my lady.

285
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,120
We are servants.

286
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,320
Obviously, we want our lords and ladies
to be kind to us,

287
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,520
right?

288
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,360
[Chuang] That's right.

289
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
We are servants,

290
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,720
so we will surely serve them until we die.

291
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,240
Even when Lady Karaked was vicious,

292
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,240
Pin and Yaem were willing
to serve her until the end.

293
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,320
Right.

294
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
That's true.

295
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,560
That's because we servants
are taught that way.

296
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,560
Servants must be loyal
to their lords and ladies.

297
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,360
You see,

298
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,200
there are no two-faced servants.

299
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,880
None.

300
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,480
If there is,

301
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,880
that servant would surely be condemned.

302
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,320
As for loyal servants,

303
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,360
they will be taken care of
by their lords until they die.

304
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,760
That's right.

305
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
Hey, Chik.

306
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,560
Take this over from me.

307
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,880
I'm going to check on my lady.

308
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,320
She must be awake by now.

Come.

He is my son. I want the best for him.

I don't want him to marry
that wicked woman.

I already know the answer.

Get the boat ready.

[Muang] Yes, my lord.

326
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,360
[Prik] Go on.

327
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,400
Put all of those away.

328
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,120
-Yes.
-Go.

329

Prik.

330
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,160
Yes?

331
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,960

-[Prik] Yes, my lady.

I don't know what else to do.

335
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,960
Soon, they will be married.

336
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,600
That is worrisome.

337
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,800
Who is worried?

338
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,160
I am worried.

But now, he seems indifferent.

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,640
He doesn't look for chances
to insult her anymore.

363

This is odd.

This is so strange.

I agree.

You don't have to stay.
You can go back to the house.

And then what?

541
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,640
This is a water filter.

542
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,320
It has kapok on the first layer.

543
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,400
The next layer has charcoal
which absorbs the smell

544
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,360
because the water from the canal
has the smell of mud and grass.

545
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,800
The pebbles and the sand

546
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,400
are for filtering small animals and germs.

You can use alum.

550

The sediments would settle down.

But it won't stay down for long.

01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,840
Yes, my lady.

848
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,520
Here. Thank you.

849
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,360
Here.

850
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,200
Mmm.

851
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,400
It's good.

852
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,360
You are spoiling the servants.

853
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,480
How?

854
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,680
Normally, nobody spoils
their servants like this.

855
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,240
Specifically,

856
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,800
they don't share food like this.

857
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,160
They are here to serve me.

858
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,320
They get tired
from having to walk with me.

859
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,880
Why can't I do something nice for them?

860
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,160
It's not that you can't.

861
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:08,520
It's just that people don't do it.

862
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,480
Then I'm going to start the trend.

863
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,920
[chuckles]

864
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,400
I guess so.

865
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:19,480
Now,

866
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,480
it's time for you to go home.

867
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,360
I told Yod, Waen, and Choi

868
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,360
to take you home.

869
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,480
Wait, what about you?

870
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,160
I'm going for a drink at Cheekun Market.

871
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,960
I'm coming with you.

872
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,600
You can't.

873
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,720
I'm meeting Lord Rueang.

874
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,240
Then I'm going to see Lord Rueang too.

No.

877

You have to get on the boat and go home.

878
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,160
Men are going out drinking.

879
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:07,760
Women shouldn't come along.

880
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,200
What? You're leaving me again?

881
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,160
Last time, when we were
at Wat Nang Chi Pier,

882
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,960
I could come with you.

883
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,840
You can let me walk around like last time.

884
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,960
I can explore the market.
I won't be bored.

885
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,680
It's going to take long.

886
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,640
I don't want to feel rushed.

887
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,440
Why would it take so long?
It's just drinking and socializing.

It's not what you think.

I don't just drink and socialize.

891
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,760
Stop complaining.

892
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,960
If you don't listen to me,

893
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,600
I won't take you out anymore.

This is no place for noblewomen.

Why should I be worried?

You seemed weird

the niece of Marquess Horathibodi,

Yes.

There were only two

Soon, people will say

that I can kill a buffalo

Those who went with her are all at fault.

They will be whipped.

Lady Champa.

It wasn't their fault.

1084
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,440
It was mine.

1085
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,440
I forced them to take me
to Baan Cheen Market.

1086
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,360
I told them that
if they didn't do what I said,

1087
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,720
they would be punished.

1088
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:49,880
If they just did what they were told,
would you still punish them?

Karaked.

1090
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:52,720
Be quiet.

1091
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,280
If you want to punish someone,
it should be me.

Chuang, Chik, Choi, Yod, and Waen.

1097
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,040
They all tried to stop me.

1098
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,200
None of them wanted me to go there.

1099
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,040
But I insisted on going.

1100
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:17,040
I can't stand seeing them
being punished because of me.

If you want to take the blame so much,

then fine.

Don't worry.

I'll get Prik to whip you.

they will keep getting in trouble.

This is so that next time,

1123
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,880
they would think before they act.

[Dech] Mother.

1192
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,880
Actually, if you look at it closely,

1193
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,920
I was the one who started all this

1194
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,320
because I didn't take her home myself.

1195
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,600
That's why it happened.

[dramatic music]

1197

It was my fault

because I didn't take good care of her.

1199

The rest of the whipping,

1200
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:46,120
I'll be the one to take it.

You are just as disappointing
as the servants.

Do whatever you want.

1213

[whimpers]

1221
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,840
Nobody has ever done what you did.

1222
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,280
That was the boldest
any woman has ever been.

1223
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,760
The fact that the news traveled so fast

1224
01:20:30,640 --> 01:20:32,160
is no surprise.

1225
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:35,520
[whimpers]
I understand.

1226
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,960
Although what you did was disastrous,

1227
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:42,920
the punishment for it
doesn't have to be so severe.

1228
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,120
Just giving you a warning

1229
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,960
and you giving us your word
should be enough.

1230
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:55,200
I know that Lady Champa
didn't want to punish you.

1231
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,800
But she thinks ahead.

1232
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,840
If you make a bigger mistake next time,

1233
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,240
it will be even more dangerous for you.

1234
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,440
It may even cost you your life.

1235
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,360
You are brave

1236
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,800
and honest.

1237
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,320
You don't blame the servants

I'll grind them for you.

Applying it on the wounds

1275

will make the sting go away.

01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:04,920
Yes, my lord.

1348
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,240
When you have a fever,

1349
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:08,840
don't take any medicine.

1350
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:12,040
A fever will lose to you, too.

-Yes, my lord.

Remember what I say.

Yes?

1361
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,480
Do you have some medicine for her fever?

1362
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:56,400
I'm preparing it.

1363
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:01,320
I got it.

1364
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,160
Grind this thoroughly.

1365
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,560
[Dech] Dissolve it in water
and have her drink it.

1366
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,960
Thank you, my lord.

What is it?

1370
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:46,800
I hope that the housework lessons
you taught her won't be in vain.

1371
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:49,040
Oh, well.

1372
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,680
I really hope it will.

1373
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:52,960
I agree.

1374
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,560
You're his mother.

1375
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,320
Don't you want him to be happy?

1376
01:33:03,400 --> 01:33:04,560
My lord.

1377
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:06,880
How could you ask me that?

1378
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,800
Of course, I want him to be happy.

1379
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:11,880
Oh, so you do?

1380
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,520
Yes.

1381
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:17,320
But I would be happy too if it's not her.

1382
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:21,040
If it is,

1383

then...

1384
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:27,440
They are soulmates.

1385
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,760
They are destined to be together.

I can see it even if I'm not home all day,

you are here all the time.

I think I see it too, my lord.

1394

I can see it too.

[Horathibodi chuckles]

1396
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:02,040
Then why doesn't the lady of the house

1397
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,840
and the head of the servants see it?

1398

Don't be scared, Prik.

1399
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,240
But watch yourself.

1400
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,040
But I was wronged by her more than anyone.

1401
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,560
I still have to be cautious.

1402

What's with you, Prik?

1403
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:27,960
Can't you see
that she is not the same person?

[suspenseful music]

1405
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:33,840
I still don't trust her.

[sighs]

1407
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:40,320
Are you waiting for her
to chase you out or what?

1408
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,160
If she chases me out,

1409
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:44,880
then she hasn't changed.

1410
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:47,960
That's true.

1411
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:50,480
If she chases anyone out,

1412
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,640
she is still the same person she was.

1413
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,640
And if that's the case,
then I'll hate her.

Forever.

being my daughter-in-law.

Don't be scared. Just say it!

Yes, Lek.

I see.

I assume you two already know that
King Narai is sending Thai ambassadors

on a diplomatic mission to France.

1452

I have told him

that my brother

can be an ambassador.

You'll have four years to prepare.

1460
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:53,680
Did King Narai agree

1461
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:55,960
to send a diplomat there?

1462

[sighs]

1463
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:00,880
Well,

1464
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,040
it was Count Surasakorn

1465
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,120
who recommended it.

1466
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,200
And he agreed.

1467
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:10,160
The reason was

1468
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,120
that he plans to use French merchants

1469
01:39:12,440 --> 01:39:14,960
to counterbalance
the Dutch merchants' power.

1470
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:17,520
They are becoming more arrogant each day.

1471
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,480
You have four years to prepare.

1472
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:24,920
One important thing is the language.

1473
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,200
You need to learn French

1474
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,080
and speak it fluently

1475
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,600
so that you can talk to them.

1476
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,080
I'll get an interpreter.

1477
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,560
[Lord Lek] You cannot use an interpreter.

1478
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,680
You have to speak every word yourself.

1479

If we include everything,

1490
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,840
it could be two years.

Yes.

Those who go away will surely be missed.

But who knows who they're going to miss.

1500

It's not him, Mother.

1508

That crazy woman
is not from a noble family.

1509

She is the daughter
of an unimportant official.

1510

Her viciousness is well-known.

1511

I don't see any reason

1512
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,160
why Marquess Horathibodi
would want her as his daughter-in-law

1513
