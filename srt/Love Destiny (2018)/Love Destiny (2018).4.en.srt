That's not what I meant.

Yaem, I said that because

both of us are definitely
going to get whipped 20 times.

was being disgraceful.

What happened?

01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:33,840
Well...

1019
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,320
I just fainted.

1020

It's nothing.

You're still mad at me.

That was close.

I won't do that again. I swear.

I've already checked, my lady.

And I didn't see it.

today...

Ow!

1048

Did you use your hands or your claws

My lady.

I think I'll have an audience

Yes.

I need to tell him something.

The Westerners' ship
that has just arrived here,

brought the news

1071
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,960
that the Royal Embassy's ship
that we had sent to France...

1072
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,400
had sunk.

1076
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:06,520
the second ambassador,

1077
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:08,560
and the third ambassador...

1078
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,240
all died.

1079
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,440
Earl Pipat Ratchamaitri,
the royal ambassador, was so talented.

1080
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:21,680
It's such a shame.

1081
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:24,640
[sighs]

1082
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:29,480
I've heard that you told King Narai

1083
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,760
that we should wait at least four years

1084
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,120
for our people to have
more nautical experience

1085
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,440
before going overseas.

1086

You're right.

1087
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,360
It was because
of that Constantine Phaulkon

1088
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,560
who urged His Majesty
to hurry and arrange a trip.

1089
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,600
It caused people to die.

1090
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,960
This is infuriating!

1091
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:54,560
[sighs]

1092
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:58,480
This Phaulkon is not French.

1093
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:00,640
[Dech] He shouldn't have been so eager

1094
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,480
to make Ayutthaya send
its ambassadors to France.

1095
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:06,760
They say...

1096
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,200
that the name Constantine Phaulkon...

1097
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:13,800
is not French,

1098
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,440
but Greek.

1099
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,680
And Greece is in the Western world
like France.

1100
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,760
The French are so shrewd.

1101
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,640
[Dech] They know His Majesty
likes this man Phaulkon.

1102
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,560
So they used him to have
an audience with His Majesty.

1103
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,960
They surely know
that he is the King's favorite.

1104
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:38,120
He has been climbing up the ranks quicker
than any other royal servants

1105
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:39,680
who are even from Ayutthaya.

1106
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,160
He surpassed them one by one.

1107
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,320
[Horathibodi] He has only been here
for a while,

1108
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,080
but he already has the title of count.

Mali...

1117

She is...

1118
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:52,720
She is not here.

1119
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:57,760
She is at the back.

[stutters]
[Fanik] My lord...

1121
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,520
I saw her walking in there.

1122
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:09,920
You lied to a nobleman of King Narai.

1123
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,360
If I want to punish you,

1124
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:17,760
you know I can do it, right?

1125
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:18,760
Please, my lord.

1126
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:20,240
Your lordship.

[suspenseful music]

1128
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:42,920
Your lordship, please let go of my hand.

1129
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:45,160
How can I?

1130
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,360
I'm afraid you will fall down.

1131
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:54,800
I won't fall down.

1132
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:56,120
I walk around here every day.

1133
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,320
Why would I fall down?

1134
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,680
This is my own house, isn't it?

1135
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:11,560
[laughs]

1136
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:15,080
You're smart.

1137
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,080
I like smart women like you.

1139
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,440
Your daughter is fearless.

1140

Can I see her every day?

1141
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,240
Uh...

1142
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:39,640
I'm afraid it would be
a waste of your time.

1143
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:42,760
No.

1144
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:46,080
It's not a waste of time...

1145
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:48,400
if it's for a thing I like.

1146
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:56,680
Your lordship,

1147
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,680
you are a high-ranking nobleman.

1148
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,040
[Mali] You have a lot of duties to attend.

1149
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,960
Please don't waste your time
on a peasant like me.

1150
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:14,640
[ominous music]

1151
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:23,080
Mali.

1152
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,200
You're so beautiful.

1153
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,960
Your lips are so...

1154
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:35,400
Please.

1155
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:36,880
Shut up.

1156
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:40,400
You're just a humble mercer.

1157
01:30:40,920 --> 01:30:43,200
[Phaulkon] I'm going to make
your daughter's life comfortable.

1158
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:45,960
Don't you wish to be a nobleman's wife?

1159
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,040
Answer me.

1160
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,800
Don't you like it?

1161
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,360
But she's... she's still so young.

Count Surasakorn.

1163
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:03,200
Please let me think it over.

1164
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:04,880
Think about what?

1165
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:06,920
No.

1166
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:10,160
You don't have to think.

[suspenseful music]

1168
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:39,320
Do you like her?

1169
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:40,480
Very much.

1170
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:43,560
I'm going to make her
my wife someday... you'll see.

May you live long, happy,

1178
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:53,560
[woman 1] So be it.

1179
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:57,160
[Pin and Yaem] My lady. Don't run.

Be careful.

-[Karaked] Let me help you.
-No.

1186
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,120
It's fine. Let me help.

1187
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:21,240
Receive this blessing.

May you live long, happy,
and healthy lives.

1189
01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,520
Dear Prik.

1190
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:41,480
Don't you get chummy with me.

1191
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:44,480
Take these away.

1192
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,880
Dear Prik, Yaem was just--

1193
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:52,960
Stop it.

1194
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:55,240
[Prik] You can't call me that either.

1195
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,440
Since when did you call me that?

1196
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,880
I knew it.

1197
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,960
You don't like it when we're trying
to be nice to you, do you, you prick?

1198
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,200
-What?
-[Yaem] No, Pin.

1199
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,680
You can't call her a prick.

1200
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:12,280
Then what should I call her?

1201
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:14,280
I just called her a prick.

1202
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:16,840
[Yaem] No, you can't.

1203

You're younger than her.

1204

You cannot call her a prick.

1205
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:26,040
You need to remember
that you can't call her a prick.

1206
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:27,960
Fine.

1207
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:31,320
I'll bear in mind
that I can't call her a prick.

1208
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:34,800
What should I call her, then,
if I can't call her a prick?

1209
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:36,760
Are you trying to insult me?

Just you wait!

1211
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,400
When Lady Champa comes back,
I'll tell her.

[both] Go on and tell her.

Yes, you'll see.

You'll see?

What if I can't see it?

1216
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,520
If you can't see it?

01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,560

Stop it, Boong!

1229
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,720
Or I'll slap all of you.

It's fine.

1234
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,080
We can offer food to monks tomorrow.

1235
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:38,880
[Prik] You don't have to.

1236
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:40,920
I already said it.

1237
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,960
It's my job to offer food to monks.

1238
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,880
Her ladyship had me do this task.

1239
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,200
Sooner or later,

1240
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:50,120
my lady will be your lady too, you prick.

1241
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,520
I mean, Prik.

1242
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:54,960
I said don't call me that.

1243
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:58,880
Keep Lady Karaked away.

1244
01:35:58,960 --> 01:35:59,920
Yes.

You don't have to keep me away.

1249
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,640
I've decided not to do it.

1250
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:12,880
[Prik] That's good.

1251
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,640
You don't really practice Buddhism.

1252
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:18,920
[Prik] Why would you want to make merit?

1253
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,080
It's going to cause you more karma.

That's true.

But bad people can still change.

Do you remember what you did to me?

1258

I will never believe that you can change.

But when your belongings had been found,

1277
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:34,560
did you even think of apologizing to me?

Have I been that horrible to you?

Why do you want to come here to see Prik?

Oh!

I know.

What?

1286
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:23,360
You are taking Yaem to slap Prik
and teach her a lesson.

1287

I'm going to slap you first, Pin.

I'm sorry.

When people say
they can see your true colors,

would you be mad?

It's who we are now.

1321

So, it's not insulting.

How is it insulting?

[sighs]

1324
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:38,960
Okay. I understand now.

1325
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,040
It must be who I am.

1326
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:44,960
[exhales sharply]
But I think I can change who I am.

1327
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,440
It shouldn't be that hard.

1328
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:55,680
[comical music]

1329
01:40:58,280 --> 01:40:59,120
Choi.

1330
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:00,080
Yes?

1331
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:01,720
[Karaked] Where are you going?

1332
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,160
Lord Dech is going to work.

1333
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,480
What is in that chest? Betel nuts?

1334
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,400
It's just rank decorations.

1335
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:13,760
Can I see?

1336
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,200
Oh, it's only a betel nut set.

1337
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,920
Is this the royal fabric
for meeting the King?

1338
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,360
[teacher] <i><font color="white">What we are seeing</font></i>

1339
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,040
is <i><font color="white">sompak</font></i> fabric,

Why doesn't he have <i><font color="white">sompak</font></i> fabric?

1346
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,960
Because he only has the title of baron.

1347
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,200
Oh, I see.

1348
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,240
Where is he going to change into that?

1349
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,280
There is a building for it.

1350
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:08,000
A building...

1351
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:11,080
Oh, I remember now.

1352
01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:13,000
My teacher has told me

1353
01:42:13,080 --> 01:42:15,400
that there's a building
for the noblemen to change their clothes.

[tranquil music]

1355

Who is this teacher of yours?

1356
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:33,120
Oh...

1357
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:36,240
You don't have to say it like that.

1358
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,880
Anyone who has taught me things,
I call him or her my teacher.

1359
01:42:44,320 --> 01:42:46,320
Out of respect.

1360
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:52,280
You're not mad at me anymore?

1361
01:42:55,240 --> 01:42:57,400
I don't see why I should be mad at you.

1362
01:42:59,160 --> 01:43:00,280
Thank you.

1363
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:06,480
What kind of work do you do?
And where do you work?

1364
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:12,360
I forgot.

1365
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,720
-It must be because of the Kritsana Kali--
-[Dech] Stop it.

1366
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:19,040
The spell has worn off.

1367
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,320
Don't use it as an excuse anymore.

1368
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:25,360
If you go crazy,

1369
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,920
it would be because of your own doing

1370
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,800
or the ghost that is possessing you.

1371
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:43,800
Let's go.

1372
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:45,760
[servant] Yes, my lord.

1373
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:53,240
[sighs]
Man, he lectured me again.

1374
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:56,880
Hey.

1375
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:59,680
Do you know what kind of work he does?

1376
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,840
[both] Ahh!

1377
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:04,800
What?

1378
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,000
[both] We don't know.

1382
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:06,880
I just met King Narai,

1383
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:10,320
and talked about
the Royal Embassy ship that sank.

1384
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:12,600
Yes.

1385
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,600
What did His Majesty say?

1386
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:21,520
What he said makes me worry.

1387
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:25,240
Let me guess.

1388
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,800
He wants to send another ship.

1389
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,080
Yes.

1390
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,240
Who else would tell him to do so,

1391
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,280
except Count Surasakorn?

1392
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:45,240
He is a thorn in our government's side.

1393
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:47,480
Hey.

1394
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:49,880
Let's not discuss this here.

1395
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,120
After work today,

1396
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:55,720
I'm going to see Marquess Horathibodi,

1397

1398
