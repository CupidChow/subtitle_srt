00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,640
Who's making a fuss down there?

171
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,160
Chuang, go take a look.

172
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,720
Yes, my lady.

173
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,360
A boat capsized by the riverbend.

174
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,480
-Come help.
-[woman 2] Hurry.

-[woman 2] Quickly! Don't ask questions.

178
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,840
-Hurry.
-Choi, go see what's happening.

179
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,760
Yes, my lord.

180
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,400
-[woman 2] Why did the boat capsize?
-[man 2] There, over there.

181
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,640
What happened?

182
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,040
Hey, Muang.

183
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,080
Lady Chanwad's boat keeled over
by the riverbend near Kruay's house.

184
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,680
What happened, Choi?

185
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,360
Lady Chanwad's boat capsized.

186
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,120
Her servant, Daeng, fell into the water.

187
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,840
She still hasn't been found.

[gasps]
Oh, my goodness.

189
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,120
Doesn't she know how to swim?

190
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,800
The servants said that she doesn't.

191
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,800
She probably drowned already.

192
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,440
And where is Lady Chanwad?

193
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,080
She has returned home.

194
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,480
How?

195
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,800
Another of the Governor's boats
came after her and took her.

196
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
[Chanwad whimpers]

Help Daeng, please. Help Daeng.

198
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,560
Help her.

199
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,880
We are trying to find her.

Did you hear that?

204
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,120
[Karaked] What rotten luck.

205
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,840
Why wasn't it Chanwad who drowned?

206
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,640
That hussy!

207
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,280
She thinks she can compare to me.

208
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,880
Does she want to be Dech's wife that much?

209
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,480
She got what she deserves.

210
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,319
Her father's just as bad,

211
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,400
trying to serve
his daughter up on a plate.

212
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
They are so shameless.

[thunder crashes]

214
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
[Pin] Will Daeng's ghost

215
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,360
come to haunt me, my lady?
[sobs]

-Don't be ridiculous!
-[Pin whimpers]

217
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
Shut up, Pin,

Please don't get angry, my lady.

Now...

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,440
To reward you for helping me
exact my revenge,

235
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,160
I have prepared a roll of silk for you.

236
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Yaem, for you too.

237

I shall not forget about you.

[thunder crashes]

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,600
when l will marry Dech?

244
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,680
I'm tired of waiting.

I'm going outside.

Don't you think it's too quiet?

Pin is with Lady Karaked in her room.

You and Pin

268

conspired with your lady to do this,
didn't you?

335
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,320
But if not, in the end,
they will part ways.

336
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,760
[Prik] Believe me, my lady.

337
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,440
[calm music]

338
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,920
[Champa] <i>You're right.</i>

339
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,520
<i>Nobody can interfere with destiny.</i>

340
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,320
[inaudible dialogue]

341
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,800
For the rest,

342
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,080
pack up and follow me.

343
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,120
Okay.

344
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,640
[Ketsurang] Hey, Rueang.

345
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,760
Here.

346
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,800
I made you a cup of coffee.

347
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,440
Thanks.

348
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,040
Oh, wow.

349
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,360
It smells good.

350
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,080
Of course, it does. I made it.

351
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,920
It's instant coffee.

352
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,360
[sighs]

353
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,280
Today is the last day,

354
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,960
we'll finally get to go home.

355
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,680
I miss my mom and grandma.

356
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,800
Hey.

357
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,160
Why is the coffee today
more delicious than usual?

358
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,240
What are you saying?

359
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,160
I make it the same way every day.

360
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,240
But today, it's...

361
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,120
extra sweet.

362
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,240
It's extra sweet.

363
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,800
Are you crazy? I didn't add more sugar.

364
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,640
Drink up before you lose the chance to.

365
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,200
You're so stern.

366
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,880
Here comes the professor.
Get back to work.

367
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,880
Oh, that's hot. Mm.

368
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,480
-I have to clean it up too?
-Come on.

369
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,960
Stop dilly-dallying or we'll get scolded.

370
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,000
[Rueang] Professor.

371
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
[upbeat music]

372
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
[grandiose music]

373
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,680
[grandiose music continues]

374
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
[foreboding music]

375
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,760
[foreboding music continues]

376
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,560
What?

377
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,480
Karaked still hasn't come out?

378
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,280
Do I need to drag her out here?

379
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,000
<i>Khun Pi</i>, are you just going to sit
and do nothing?

380
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,680
Here I am, Lady Champa.

381
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,280
Lady Karaked.

382
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,560
I went to the temple for a while,

383
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,880
and you've just come out?

384
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,600
Chaiwatthanaram Temple is located
at the mouth of the canal near our house.

385
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,760
It takes less than three hours
back and forth.

386
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,400
Even so.
[scoffs]

387
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,760
Why didn't you come when I called for you?
What were you doing?

388
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,400
I was getting dressed.

389
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,200
What do I need to say to make you realize

390
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,800
your disgusting behavior?

391
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,960
[sighs]

392
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,960
[Chuang and Prik] My lady. My lady.

393
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,960
What's the matter?

394
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,280
Why did you want to see me
since before dawn?

395
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,920
Since before dawn?

396
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
Didn't you hear the roosters crowing?

397
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,680
After hearing what my mother said,

398
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,120
don't you feel any shame?

399
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,200
Do you know what happened last night?

400
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,960
What happened, Lord Hora?

401
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,000
Lady Chanwad's servant drowned.

402
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,200
[gasps]

403
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,720
Oh, my goodness.

404
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,760
I've just seen her.

405
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,480
Poor Daeng.

406
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,640
[Karaked] Who could have been so cruel

407
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,720
to do that to Lady Chanwad's boat?

408
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,240
[Karaked] Is Lady Chanwad all right?

409
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,280
She's not a strong swimmer.

410
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
[foreboding music]

411
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Father.

412
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,760
She is cold-blooded and cruel.

413
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,040
-I would rather die than marry her.
-[sighs]

414
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,040
She might have heard
what people were saying.

415
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,200
Don't blame her yet, Dech.

416
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,600
Father,

417
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,040
I am not wrong.

418
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,240
Lady Karaked is vicious.

419
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,680
I hate her.

420
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,240
How did she know

421
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,240
that Lady Chanwad's boat got overturned?

422
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,480
Nobody said a word.

423
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,960
And Daeng, how did she know

424
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,440
that Daeng was also on the boat?

425
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,440
She did it.

426
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,680
She claimed she went to the privy

427
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,640
because she was afraid Pin and Yaem
wouldn't be able to stand the smell

428
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,400
if she used her chamber pot.

429
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,960
I do not believe
in a heartless woman like her.

430
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,600
She would never care about them that much

431
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,760
even though those two servants
do everything for her.

432
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,120
They let her treat them
like animals every day.

433
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,440
That is true.

434
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,800
Champa.
[grunts]

435
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,240
I hate her...

436
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,040
more than anything.

437
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,000
To me, even animal dung
is not as disgusting as her flesh.

438
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,440
I will never marry her.

439
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,560
Lord Dech didn't believe us.

440
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
[exhales sharply]

441
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,600
He looked so frightening.

442
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
[foreboding music]

443
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,160
You...

444
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,200
[whimpering]
I didn't do it, my lady.

445
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,600
You two...

446
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,320
Keep an eye on Dech.

447
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,600
I would like to see what he will do

448
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,720
if he doesn't believe me.

449
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,160
How spiteful it is

450
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,840
that we can't punish her

451
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,000
even though we know she did it.

452
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,760
<i>Khun Pi,</i>

453
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,280
you should do something about this.

454
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,760
She infuriates me.

455
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,520
That shameless girl.

456
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,120
[Champa sighs]

457
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,760
Is there any way, Father?

458
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,680
Of course, there is.

459
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,480
The Kritsana Kali spell.

[foreboding music]

461
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,680
I know

462
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,280
that you do not want to punish her
because you care about

463
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,280
your late friend.

464
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,680
I am pondering.

465
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,960
You talk too much, Champa.

466
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,760
You will never be at peace until you die

467
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,960
if you do not use this spell.

468
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,920

[Dech] Choi!

Yes, my lord?

473
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,480
Go to Lord Kosathibodi's house,

474
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,080
and ask for a piece of Daeng's clothes.

475
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,960
-Yes, my lord.
-[Dech] Go.

476

[ominous music]

477
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,320
[whispering]
Lord Dech wants Daeng's piece of cloth.

478
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,400
The Kritsana Kali spell.

479
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,280
What are you whispering about?

480
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,760
[Yaem pants]

481
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,520
If you don't tell me

482
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,040
and something happens,

483
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,280
you're both dead.

484
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,200
My lady.

485
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,080
I heard that...

486
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,640
[ominous music]

487
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,520
Dech,

488
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,760
it's not wrong
that I care about her father

489
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,200
since he was a good friend of mine.

490
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,680
You have to understand me.

491
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,760
I understand things as Mother does.

492
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,720
Now, if she's not the one
behind all of this,

493
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,440
the Kritsana Kali spell

494
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,960
won't hurt her.

495
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,440
[Horathibodi] But if she is guilty,

496
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,680
this spell will do its job.

[Horathibodi] <i>This is somewhat odd.</i>

1011
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,600
She has definitely gone mad, Father.

1012
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:01,240
Is that so?

1013
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:03,400
I'm sure of it.

1014
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,200
Think about it.

1015
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,080
Think?

1016
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,040
The way she speaks is so strange.

1017
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,360
It's different from how we speak here.

1018
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,440
I heard that.

1019
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,440
Then...
[sighs]

1020
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,560
The Kritsana Kali spell worked, Father.

1021
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:32,600
Those who are guilty,

1022
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,440
if they don't die,

1023

they go mad.

1024
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,280
That woman definitely killed Daeng,

Who's everybody?

1033
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,160
I think--

1034
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,560
-What?
-Hey.

1035
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,040
-Maybe a ghost is possessing her body.

[scoffs]

1041
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:43,320
You don't have to wait
until the next life,

1042
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,520
remember that.

1043

[both] Yes, my lady.

[calm music continues]

1048

Where are Lord Horathibodi, Lord Dech,
and Lady Champa?

1049
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,160
They all went back inside.

1050
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:03,200
What are the servants saying?

1051
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,400
They're still talking about our lady.

1052
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,440
It makes me feel like I want her
to teach them a lesson.

[sighs]
Those people!

1054

It's already late.
Why don't they go to sleep?

1055
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,560
I heard that they're preparing things
for tomorrow's guest.

It's morning.

01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:59,960
Why hasn't Mom and Grandma
come to wake me up?

1062
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:01,840
I'm starving.

So this isn't a dream?

1068
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,480
Then where am I?

1069
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,360
How did I get here?

1070
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,480
And what's your name?

1071
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:52,720
My name is Karaked.

1072

I'm the daughter of Marquess Ramnarong
of Song Kwae.

Do you mean Phitsanulok?

Please do good deeds
while you take over my body.

Show all the people
that Lady Karaked can be good too.

All right.

It's my duty.

Of course, I'm acting strange.

1172
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:18,480
I'm sick.

1173
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,160
[Pin] My lady.

1174
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,040
Is it really you?

1175
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,920
There's no ghost possessing you?

1176
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:32,320
No.

1177
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:33,640
I'm sure.

1178
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,720
[whispers]

1179
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,280
"Sure." It means yes.

1180
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,240
Sure.

1181
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:49,800
It means true, certain, and reliable.

1182
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,320
[both sobbing]

1183
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,440
-My lady.
-My lady.

1184
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,040
[Pin] May you live a long life.

1185
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,040
All right.

1186
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:04,120
There, there.

1187
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,440
Don't cry.

1188
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,200
I'm fine now.

1189
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:15,200
Oh, wait.

1190
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:19,680
I need to pee.

1191
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,760
Then go pee.

1192
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:24,000
Where?

1193
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:25,920
In there?

1194
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:27,880
It's outside.

1195
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,160
Oh. Outside this room?

1196
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,080
Downstairs.

1197
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:35,800
Downstairs?

1198
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,280
Fine, then. I'll go.

1199
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:44,960
This way, my lady.

1200
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,960
[playful music]

1201
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,160
[playful music continues]

1202
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:13,960
No.

1203
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:16,680
It's not proper.

1204
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:31,240
Where is it?

1205
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:32,760
What do you call it?

1206
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:34,000
Privy, my lady.

1207
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:36,440
[Yaem] It's where you take a dump and pee.

1208
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:38,520
Take a dump and pee.

1209
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:40,480
That's so frank.

1210
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,120
[giggles]
It's kind of fun.

1211
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:44,800
Well...

1212
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:47,360
Take me there.

1213
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:49,800
Which way is it?

1214
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,560
This way.

1215
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:54,120
Yes.

1216
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,840
Yaem, Lord Dech has a guest today.

1217
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,360
Right.

1218
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:04,480
Lord Rueang is coming.

1219
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:06,880
Lord Rueang.

1220
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,200
[Pin] Then we'll have to use
the backstairs.

1221
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,360
My lady.

1222
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:14,640
This way.

1223
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:15,720
[Yaem] Yes.

1224
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:23,120
-[Pin] This way.
-Who is Lord Rueang?

1225
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,280
[Karaked] I want to see him.

1226
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:30,720
-My lady.
-[Karaked grumbles]

1227
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,160
[Karaked] Let me see for a moment.

1228
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:35,920
-My lady.
-Why do you want to see him?

1229
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:38,280
You already know Lord Rueang.

1230
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:39,960
I do?

1231
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:42,520
Of course, you do. Lord Rueang.

1232
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,480
His name is like...

1233
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,120
[Yaem] Like what, my lady?

1234
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:52,880
[quirky music]

1235
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:55,720
-Huh?
-Hey!

1236
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:00,280
My lady.

1237
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:01,960
-My lady.
-Oh, my lady.

1238
01:34:05,160 --> 01:34:07,160
[quirky music]

1239
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,160
Like...

1240
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,000
Like what, my lady?

1241
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,120
[quirky music]

1242
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,240
Oh!

1243
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,200
[grandiose music]

1244
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:03,600
What is it, my lady?

1245
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:06,200
Nothing.

1246
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:07,520
Let's go.

1247
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:09,040
This way, my lady.

1248
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,360
-Gosh.
-[Pin] This way.

1249
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:19,120
[Karaked] Wow, the lotus blossoms
are dazzling.

1250
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:21,480
And they're humongous.

1251
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,880
-What?
-What?

1252
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:24,800
What's wrong?

1253
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,960
You speak eccentrically.

1254
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:29,760
Right, Yaem?

1255
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:33,400
Your words make no sense.

1256
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:37,760
Where's the privy?
I really need to pee now. It's so far!

1257
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:39,720
This way, my lady.

1258
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:43,800
[Pin] Here we are.

1259
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:50,960
I knew it.

1260
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:53,760
You knew what?

1261
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,640
It looks even better
than those in my class.

1262
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:03,320
[Karaked] Gosh, I'm so excited
to see the real thing.

1263
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,960
Go away, why are you standing there?

1264
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:15,760
[both] Yes, my lady.

1265
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,360
[birds cawing]

1266
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,960
[Karaked] I'm done.

1267
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:32,960
[both] Yes, my lady.

1268
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:35,760
Do you have any papers?

1269
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:37,920
Paper?

1270
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,320
What do you need it for?

1271
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,560
Well, for wiping my butt, of course.

1272
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,040
Go check on her.

1273
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,320
You do it, Pin.

1274
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:50,440
-No, stop right there, sisters.
-[Yaem gasps]

1275
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,560
She called us her sisters.

1276
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:55,720
What's wrong?
What am I supposed to call you?

1277
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,160
Pin.

1278
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:00,040
Yaem, my lady.

1279
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:03,200
I used to call you that?

1280
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:04,960
[both] Yes, my lady.

1281
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,600
But I already forgot.

1282
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,560
Then let's start over.

1283
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,600
Sisters.

1284
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:15,120
[both] Yes, my lady.

1285
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:19,720
-[Pin] Oh, my lady.
-[Yaem] My lady.

1286
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,520
-[Pin] My lady.
-[Yaem] Where are you going?

1287
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:22,680
Where are you going?

1288
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,720
The lotus blossoms are pretty.
I want to pick them.

1289
01:37:26,840 --> 01:37:29,000
-[Yaem] Oh, you can't.
-[Pin] You can't, my lady.

1290
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,520
-You can't.
-You can't.

1291
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:33,720
The servants are preparing food.
You need to hurry back, my lady.

1292
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,240
I want to wash myself.

1293
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,760
You can do that in the evening.

1294
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,080
I want to do it right now, right here.

1295
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:40,840
You can't do it here.

1296
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:42,680
You have to go to the dock.

1297
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,320
Then take me there.

1298
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:46,680
[calm music]

1299
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,400
Tamarind paste and turmeric

1300
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:03,040
for scrubbing the body.

1301
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:10,360
[Ketsurang] <i>Wow,
it's just like what I studied.</i>

1302
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,360
<i>Tamarind paste to scrub away scurf,</i>

1303
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,920
<i>turmeric to make the skin glow,</i>

1304
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,840
<i>and kaffir lime to wash the hair.</i>

1305
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:28,360
Kaffir lime, for washing your hair.

1306
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:33,040
The servants have taken the food upstairs.

1307
01:38:47,360 --> 01:38:49,000
Sisters.

1308
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,520
[Yaem and Pin] We're not done yet.

1309
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:56,960
[sighs]

1310
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:20,840
Give it to me. I'll do it myself.

1311
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,400
[Yaem] No, not like that, my lady.

1312
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:25,560
Not like that.

1313
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:29,120
Gosh, why are the clothes here
so tricky to put on?

1314
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:30,840
It's not tricky at all.

1315
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,440
Let me do it for you, my lady.

1316
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,640
Why is it so breezy?

1317
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:42,720
I wish I had panties.

1318
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:57,160
Let me say something
about your friend's daughter, Karaked.

1319
01:39:57,800 --> 01:40:00,760
[sighs]
It's been weighing on my mind.

1320
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,160
She's not a little girl,

1321
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:05,480
yet she keeps doing nonsensical things,

1322
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:08,960
and you are so determined
to have her as your daughter-in-law.

1323
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:13,120
No matter how much I oppose,
you're not listening to me.

1324
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,520
Karaked's father
was a close friend of mine.

1325
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:20,760
We promised each other that we would
make our son and daughter marry.

1326
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:25,520
I would never go back on a promise
I made to my dead friend.

1327
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,280
Then I shall keep delaying it

1328
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:31,320
and she can wait for all she wants.

1329
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:36,840
Right, Dech?

1330
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:40,000
[Ketsurang] <i>His name's Dech?</i>

1331
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:42,120
<i>He really looks like people
in the old days.</i>

1332
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:44,720
Yes, Mother.

1333
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:47,560
[Ketsurang] <i>Wow, what a mama's boy.</i>

1334
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,200
My lady.

1335
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:53,960
You'd better go in.

1336
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:56,840
[Pin] Go ahead.

1337
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:59,160
[playful music]

1338
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:01,680
Well...

1339
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:04,200
You walk gracelessly
like someone who has no manners.

1340
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:26,840
Are you willing to join us today?

1341
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:32,120
Otherwise, the servants can serve you
inside your room.

1342
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:39,800
Come on, let's eat.

1343
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:52,440
-[Champa] Prik.
-Yes, my lady?

1344
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:54,520
Get some rice for Lady Karaked.

1345
01:41:55,240 --> 01:41:56,440
Yes, my lady.

1346
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:04,840
[whispers]
My lady.

1347
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,320
I have to wash my hands?

1348
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:10,560
[both] Yes, my lady.

1349
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:23,840
I didn't know you would eat with us,

1350
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,520
so we didn't prepare a meal for you.

1351
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,440
Are you feeling all right now?

1352
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:31,480
Yes.

1353
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,160
Well...

1354
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,840
That's good then.

1355
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:43,360
Let's eat.

1356
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:47,800
[playful music]

1357
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:01,200
[playful music continues]

1358
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:25,480
[playful music continues]

1359
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,400
Water, please.

1360
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,800
Wash your hands first, my lady.

1361
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:09,680
You usually can eat more spicy food.

1362
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:11,320
Yes.

1363
01:44:11,680 --> 01:44:14,000
I can take it, but it's so spicy.

1364
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,640
[Horathibodi] It's good that you can eat.

1365
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:21,560
You are really fine now.

1366
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:25,200
[loud thump]

1367
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:29,680
You have evil thoughts and do evil things,

1368
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:34,200
yet you still have an appetite.

1369
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:40,640
How cruel you are.

1370
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,960
[foreboding music]

1371
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:50,800
[Dech] <i>She has been living here
for almost a year now</i>

1372
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:52,200
and there was never a day

1373
01:44:52,280 --> 01:44:54,320
<i>she didn't act wickedly.</i>

1374
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,640
[Champa] <i>Why did you hurt your servants?</i>

1375
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:02,360
Someday, I'm going to kill her
and my rival will finally be gone.

1376
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:05,520
[Champa] This type of behavior
is considered disrespectful.

1377
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:10,160
That pretentious jerk and I are betrothed?

1378
01:45:10,240 --> 01:45:11,720
[Mali] <i>My father's name is Fanik.</i>

1379
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,480
<i>My name is Mali.</i>

1380
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:14,520
Mali.

1381
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,240
Who are you and where are you from?

1382
01:45:16,320 --> 01:45:18,080
And why are you taking over
Karaked's body?

1383
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,160
