00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,200
She didn't mean a sullied win.

167
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,160
-She said we'd win for sure.
-[Chuang] Sure.

168
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,640
Was that okay?

169
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,160
Pin, everyone heard
that she said she'd play dirty.

170
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,720
Are you saying my ears are bad?

171
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,400
-[Pin] Your ears are bad.
-Prik.

172
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,880
-[Prik] Don't stop me.
-Lady Chanwad.

173
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,560
You should cheer with us.

174
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,920
"Cheer"?

175
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,760
Cheer.

176
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,960
We'll encourage them.

177
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,840
Well...

178
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,840
Why didn't you join the competition?

179
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,920
I'm in another department.

180
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,760
The racers are from the City Department.

181
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,720
I'm in the Treasury Department.

182
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,000
All I can do

183
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,840
is to "cheer" right here.

184
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,800
[laughs]

185
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,680
I get it now that you can only "cheer."

186
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,280
[giggling]

187
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,400
[sighs]

188
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,000
We are at Kalahome Pier, aren't we?

189
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Yes.

190
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,920
Where's the Takan Fortress?

191
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,560
It's right here.

192
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,240
The pavilion is over there.

193
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,520
[gasps]

194
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,320
[Karaked] I see it.

195
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,960
Is King Narai visiting?

196
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,280
No, His Majesty will not.

197
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,400
There are only the Chancellor of Interior
and the Chancellor of Defense,

198
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,480
and the officers from the Four Pillars.

199
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,000
Really?

200
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,200
I wish I could see them up close.

201
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,800
Hmm...

202
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,720
Well, I've heard about them
for a long time.

203
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,160
The City, Royal, Treasury,
Agriculture, the Four Pillars.

204
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,800
-[Karaked humming]
-[Dech sighs]

205
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,160
The Minister of the City Department
is Phra Nakornbal Muang.

206
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,280
[Dech] The Minister
of the Royal Department

207
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,520
is Phra Thummathikorn.

208
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,320
The Minister of Agriculture is Kaset.

209
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,840
The Minister of Treasury is Kosathibodi.

210
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,760
Those four make up the Four Pillars.

211
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
[lively music]

212
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Also,

213
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,200
a royal concubine is here
to watch the match too.

214
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
[grandiose music]

215
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,160
[man 2] Prepare the boats!

216
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,640
Everyone,

217
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,000
get ready.

218
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
[tense music]

219
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,880
[tense music continues]

220
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,520
[man 2] Start!

221
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,200
[all] Go, Lord Rueang! Go, Count Sriyot!

222
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,240
You can do it, Count Sorasak! Go!

223
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,640
Go, Lord Rueang!

224

Go, Lord Rueang! Go, Count Sriyot!

Faster! Faster!

232
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,880
[all] Go, noblemen!

[all cheering]

235
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,040
We won, <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>!

[dramatic music continues]

238
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,400
If I knew you were going
to be this excited,

239
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,320
I would have joined the race.

240
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,320
[mouthing]
What's going on?

241
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,360
Please accept my apology.

242
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,600
We won.

[calm music continues]

246
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,160
Hm?

247
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,320
There she goes again.

248
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,680
[somber music]

249
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
[somber music continues]

[upbeat music]

251
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,440
What are you making, Prik?

252
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,360
-Nothing.
-Hm?

253
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
-Then why are you sitting here?
-Hm?

254
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,120
-To watch.
-Watch what?

255
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,880
To watch you make a sand pagoda.

256
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,960
Is it something new to you?

257
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,960
[Prik] No, it's not.

258
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,480
[Karaked] How is it though?

259
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,120
It's incomparable to a five-year-old's.

260
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,880
Of course, I am a lot older after all.

261
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,720
It's worse than a five-year-old's.

262
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,240
[Pin] Here's some more sand.

263
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
My lady.

264
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,480
What are you making, Karaked?

265
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
[romantic music]

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
[romantic music continues]

267
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Lord Rueang.

268
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,520
That's her, the one I met
at Baan Cheen Market.

269
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,000
[Lord Rueang] If it's her,
then I'm not surprised at all

270
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,280
by the story you told me about.

271
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,240
How come?

272
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,920
I won't tell you yet.

273
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,280
You'll find out soon enough.

274
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,080
Can I join you?

275
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,560
Lady Karaked.

276
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Rueang!

277
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,760
Lord Rueang, you are the best.

278
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,600
I heard you shouting my name.

279
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,440
If you hadn't done that,
we wouldn't have won.

280
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,080
[chuckles]
Thanks to these guys too.

281
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,600
What were you chanting for us?

282
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,480
Ready, go.

283
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,880
[all] Go, Lord Rueang! Go, Count Sriyot!

284
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,320
You can do it, Count Sorasak!
Go, noblemen!

285
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,080
Go, Lord Rueang! Go, Count Sriyot!

286
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,400
You can do it, Count Sorasak!

287
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,680
-[all] Go, noblemen!
-Go!

288
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,200
[Karaked laughs]

289
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,640
All right.

290
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,280
It's all done.

291
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,160
Lord Rueang, look at my sand pagodas.

292
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,920
I made them all myself.

293
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,960
I made this. I also made that.

294
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,400
[Karaked] And all
of the pagodas over there.

295
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,880
Look at the next one
which is like a conch horn.

296
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,680
That one is a bit further.

297

Lady Chanwad.

301
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,120
Please accept my apology.

302
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,640
Are you all right?

303
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,600
I'm fine.

304
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,400
I'll get more sand.

305
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,800
Why don't you let a servant do it?

306
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,760
I want to get it myself.

307
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,800
Lord Rueang.

308
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,960
Please lend her a hand.

309
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,280
Lady Chanwad, let me help you.

310
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,440
[Lord Rueang] Follow me.

311
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,640
[laughing]
I ship them.

312
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,000
Let's walk over there.

313
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,600
All right.

314
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,480
-Hey--

Lady Chanwad.

00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,680
Let me help.

323
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,640
You can continue.

324
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,720
You are very kind. Thank you.

Do you want to?

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,120
Plays performed outside the palace
are done by men.

334
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,280
And plays performed inside the palace
are done by women.

335
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,280
Some plays are forbidden.

336
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,960
For instance, <i><font color="white">Ramayana,</font></i>

337
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,560
<i><font color="white">Inao</font></i>,

338
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
and <i><font color="white">Oonnarut.</font></i>

339
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,320
Those three are strongly forbidden.

340
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,680
But...

341
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,360
Uh...

342
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,080
So...

343
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,000
what plays could be performed?

344
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,120
Well, folk plays are allowed,

345
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,320
such as <i><font color="white">Sang tong,</font></i>

346
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,000
<i><font color="white">Manora</font></i>,

347
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,000
and <i><font color="white">Kawee</font></i>.

One day,

356
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,440
you will know.

[ominous music]

367
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,440
I know she is not Lady Karaked.

368
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,040
This woman's personality...

369
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,920
is not like Lady Karaked's at all.

370
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,880
[Dech] Also, the other day, I saw a woman

371
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,840
who looked like Lady Karaked

372
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,040
but I know it wasn't her.

373
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,760
She seems more beautiful due to her heart,

374
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,720
her manners and words,

375
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,280
and her thoughts.

376
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,760
Besides the fact that they look identical,
everything about them is different.

377
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,560
They are different people.

378
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,360
You see her

379
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,080
but you don't know who she is, right?

380
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
That's right.

381
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,760
I know she isn't Lady Karaked

382
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,680
but I don't know who she is,
where she came from,

383
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,000
and why she is in Lady Karaked's body.

384
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,680
It's destiny from the past

385
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,080
that sent this strange woman

386
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,120
into Lady Karaked's body who passed away.

387
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,760
How long will she
be in Lady Karaked's body?

388
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,280
Destiny will decide that.

389
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,520
You don't need to be curious.

390
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,680
She isn't a devil.

391
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,320
[Chi Pa Khao]
She isn't a giant in disguise.

392
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,840
She's human.

393
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,560
She's human.

394
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,560
Can I just be straightforward and ask her?

395
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,800
I'll leave that for you to decide.

My lady, let's take a bath.

408
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,920
Wait. Can I ask you something?

409
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,880
[Yaem sighs]

410
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,080
Who are these kids' parents?

411
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,720
The servants in this house.

412
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,560
Why don't some of them
look like a servant's kid?

413
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,360
[sighs]
Some aren't.

414
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,680
Those who have flowers on their buns

415
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,400
belong to his lordship.

416
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,320
Don't they live with him?

417
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,600
Their houses are nearby.
Some are in the back.

418
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,120
Are they educated?

419
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,000
Yes, they are.

420
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,240
That's good. Who's their teacher?

421
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,320
A monk at Yai Chaimongkol Temple.

422
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,080
I see. Do girls get educated too?

423
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,560
No. How can girls get educated?

424
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,080
I'm wondering about the same thing.

425
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,960
Lady Chanwad is educated though.

426
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,240
Lady Chanwad is a daughter
of a high-ranked nobleman.

427
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,920
I believe a teacher
even goes to her house.

428
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,360
I see.

429
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,280
[Pin] My lady.

430
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,080
Let's take a bath.

431
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
I'll play with you guys again.

432
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,680
[children] Okay.

433
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,840
Bye.

434
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,720
[Karaked] By the way,

435
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,160
which children belong to <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>?

436
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,760
[Pin] My lady.

437
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,560
How could you ask that?

438
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,480
Why not?

439
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,960
Is your memory loss this severe?

440
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,840
Those children look similar.

441
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,840
They have flowers on their buns too.

442
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,880
How can I tell them apart?

443
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,680
His lordship never got involved
with the servants.

444
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,320
Those servants put on makeup just for him,

445
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,480
but he always shows no interest in them.

446
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,720
He hasn't even laid his eyes on them.

447
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,120
We've kept an eye on him, my lady.

448
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,200
I'm not surprised.
He even acts all tough around me.

449
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,320
He hasn't laid his eyes on me either.

450
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,080
He probably thinks he's handsome and all.

451
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,840
Let's go.

452
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,480
[gasps]

453
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,600
Did he hear me?

454
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,320
I did.

455
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,320
Were you eavesdropping?

456
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,480
[both] My lady.

457
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,280
I want to know if you were eavesdropping.

458
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,440
You probably sense
that people want to talk behind your back.

459
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,160
I don't know what to say to you

460
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,120
because you do not speak
our local language.

461
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,840
Hm. You should go upstairs.

462
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,200
What are you waiting for?
I want to take a shower.

463
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,240
Pin, Yaem.

464
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,040
Both of you, wait at the harbor.

465
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,680
[Pin and Yaem] Yes, my lord.

[romantic music]

467
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,280
Are you here to ask me?

468
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,120
Ask you what?

469
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,120
"Who am I?"

[romantic music]

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,360
I don't want to know who you are anymore.

472
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,520
Why?

473
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,760
I will know when the time comes.

[calm music continues]

476
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,280
I'm sorry.

477
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,520
I wanted to know
why you were paying me respect.

478
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,160
I owe you for not forcing me
to answer the question.

479
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,360
"I owe you"?

480
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,600
[laughs]
What does that mean?

481
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,600
"I owe you"?

482
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,760
Is that not how you say it?

483
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,160
It's the same as "thank you."

484
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,640
If so, then why didn't you say
"thank you" instead?

485
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,960
What I said is used
for showing gratitude toward the senior.

486
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,960
[Dech chuckles]

487
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,680
They don't say "thank you" to the senior.

488
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,120
What? What do they say then?

489
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,160
They pay respect and say, "I respect you."

490
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,920
I see.

491
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,640
Really? Wait.

492
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,880
Hm?

493
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,640
Why didn't you let me
pay respect to you just now?

494
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,600
I haven't done anything for you.
You don't need to thank me.

495
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,200
All right.

496
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,880
Please wait.

497
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,040

Greetings, Count.

00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,080
Greetings, Lord Rueang.

661
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,680
You look beautiful today.

662
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,280
I was about to say it.

663
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,760
But the Count cut me off.

Karaked.

673
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,480
I thought you weren't going to make it.

674
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,680
I heard you were grounded in your house.

675
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:13,160
How can I miss your wedding?

676
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,880
Clara, Claudia, wait outside.

677
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:34,560
Are you not mad at me

678
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,040
for marrying Count Surasakorn?

679
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:40,920
I am...

680
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,200
not.

[sighs]

682
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,360
Even though I don't really agree
with your decision,

683
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:52,160
I'm sure you had thought it through.

684
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,280
Yes.

685
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,560
I had.

686
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,920
Then I wish you nothing
but happiness, Mali.

687
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,520
Thank you very much.

688
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:13,560
From now on, even if everything changes,

689
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,960
please know that my goodwill
and respect to you

690
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,360
will never change.

691
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,520
Even though I'm marrying a man
who is under the protection of France,

692
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,600
I was born in Ayutthaya.

693
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,120
I grew up in Ayutthaya.

694
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,680
I will never forget my roots
and betray my homeland.

695
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,360
Why are you saying that?

696
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:55,760
What are you thinking?

697
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,760
Do you know that

698
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,120
just because my father
is a mixed-race, half-Bengali,

699
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:09,480
that makes people disrespect us
as if we're slaves?

700
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,440
The western looks down on us.
Thai people disdain us.

701
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,800
I may have a royal bloodline,

702
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,560
but I am from a lost and exiled family.

703
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,880
Exiled?

704
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,840
From where?

705
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,280
Japan.

706
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:30,680
How come?

707
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,440
My grandfather
was the first Japanese prince

708
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,160
to get baptized.

709
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
His relatives hated him for that.

710
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,800
Really?

711
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,840
Any Japanese who believed in God

712
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,960
were exiled and shipped out.

713
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,320
My grandfather and grandmother
met on the boat.

714
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:06,520
They fell in love
and migrated to Ayutthaya.

715
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,800
How romantic.

716
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,600
That's an English word, right?

717
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,720
Yes.

718
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,720
Mali, I don't think
you should worry too much.

719
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,640
The past is in the past.

720
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,680
You're about to have a bright future.

721
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,800
Today is an auspicious day.

722
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,880
Even though I dislike Count Surasakorn,

723
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,160
I hear that he will make you
his first wife.

724
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:50,880
It's enough to prove
that he truly loves you.

725
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,760
That's why he treasures you this much.

01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,280
I don't know where she went.

Come on.

732

I'm sure she knows some manners.

[Dech sighs]

She doesn't. She's very self-centered.

She's gorgeous.

736
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,640
No one will punish her for anything.

737
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,000
How is that a matter?

738

I'll side with Rueang on this.

If she's crazy,

01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,600
Does it sound like an elephant
or a horse's name?

987
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,560
Stop joking around.

988
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,480
I'm sorry, <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>.

989
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,520
I'm sorry.

990
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,520
Lord Hora.

991
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:54,840
So, who is Constantine?

992
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:56,360
He's a Greek man.

993
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,760
[professor] <i><font color="white">When he was young,</font></i>

994
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:02,440
<i><font color="white">he worked as a servant on a ship
that traded with Ayutthaya.</font></i>

995
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:07,000
[professor]
Phaulkon saw business opportunities

996
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:10,560
so he decided to settle down in Ayutthaya.

997
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,520
[professor] <i><font color="white">He got to know some noblemen.</font></i>

998
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:15,840
<i><font color="white">They introduced him
to Marquess Kosathibodi</font></i>

999
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:20,280
who was the Minister of Treasury
at the time.

1000
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,680
[Horathibodi] He had a chance
to work for Duke Kosathibodi.

1001
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:27,200
He was smart and wise.

1002
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:30,720
He quickly became fluent in Thai.

1003
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,520
So he became successful in his career.

1004
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:38,720
He was brought to serve King Narai
by Duke Kosathibodi.

1005
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:47,360
[chuckles]
Wow.

1006
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:51,360
He's a foreigner who knows
how to pay respects, Officer.

1007
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:52,840
That's right.

1008
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:55,320
[Wichai] You can put him to good use.

1009
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,440
He's quite wise.

1010
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,480
What shall I call him, Officer?

1011
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,320
[in French]
My name is Constance.

1012
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:14,160
Constantine Phaulkon.

1013
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:20,560
Constantine Phaulkon.

1014
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:25,560
[in Thai]
You can call me "Phaulkon."

1015
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,240
[in English]
Mr. Phaulkon.

1016
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,080
[Lord Lek and Phaulkon laugh]

1017
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,080
Mr. Phaulkon.

1018
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,680
Did you hear about Persian merchants
claiming for their debt?

1019
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:54,760
I did.

1020
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,640
How could that be?

1021
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:06,320
How could the Treasury owe them
that much debt?

1022
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:11,840
Just taking a look at the account,

1023
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,480
that's not how it should be.

1024
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:17,880
I agree.

1025
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:21,720
Please look into it, Mr. Phaulkon.

1026
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:24,000
Of course, my lord.

1027
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:33,120
Did he figure it out, Lord Hora?

1028
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:37,840
Yes. After his inspection,
he figured it out.

1029
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,240
[professor] <i><font color="white">Marquess Kosathibodi
was the minister.</font></i>

1030
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,280
So, he ordered Phaulkon
who was an accountant

1031
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,040
to examine the whole account from scratch.

1032
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:50,880
After Phaulkon calculated
the profit and loss account

1033
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:52,920
with the debt,

1034
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:57,000
it turned out the Muslim merchants

1035
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:01,360
owed Treasury a massive amount of money.

1036
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,600
He found out that

1037
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,840
those Persian merchants
owed Treasury a huge debt.

1038
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:12,960
So a large amount of revenue
was collected for the treasury.

1039
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,520
That's why King Narai favors him

1040
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,560
and allows him to appear
before His Majesty anytime.

1041
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,760
The history was accurate indeed.

1042
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,280
What did you mumble about?

1043
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:36,000
-Lord Hora.
-Hm?

1044
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:39,320
Since His Majesty
favors a foreigner that much,

1045
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,720
aren't Thai noblemen jelly of him?

1046
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,800
[playful music]

1047
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,080
"Jelly"?

1048
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:49,840
[Horathibodi chuckles]

1049
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:50,880
Mmm...

1050
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,520
I mean, dislike.

1051
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,360
Ah...

1052
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,920
[Horathibodi sighs]

1053
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,400
King Narai favors smart people,

1054
01:28:02,920 --> 01:28:05,360
especially if they are knowledgeable
in many fields.

1055
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,440
Constance is knowledgeable in trading,

1056
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,120
navigation, craftsmanship,

1057
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:16,560
and even weaponry.

1058
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,840
His Majesty would love to know
more about kings from places.

1059
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,680
This man could tell him what he wanted.

1060
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:27,680
No one knows whether his stories are true.
Right?

1061
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:31,480
His Majesty is fond of him

1062
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,480
and allows him to appear
before His Majesty at any time.

1063
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,760
[Horathibodi] Because of this,

1064
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,440
there's no surprise if
high-ranked noblemen become...

1065
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:50,440
-"jelly."
-[giggles]

1066

[Horathibodi] Right?
[chuckles]

1067
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,560
Did I use it correctly?

1068

-[Horathibodi] Hm?

01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:00,480
Yes, you did.

"Jelly."

1072
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:05,760
It means to dislike.

1073
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,560
-Oh.

1074

Is that our master's new wife, Tuan?

You already know the answer.
No need to ask me.

Lady Tong Guyomar.

1084

You can call her Madam.

1085
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,560
Madam stands first in this house.

1086
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,120
[Phaulkon] Everyone must listen to her.

1087

Do everything

Do you understand?

[both] Yes, my lord.

Don't cause any trouble with your mouth.

You better put this in your head.

[both] Yes, my lord.

1094

[Phaulkon] Don't be surprised, my darling.

They're servants.

1096

Their job is to obey
their masters' orders.

Every single order.

She's wise. You better watch your words.

1123

[George] She doesn't know anything,
does she?

1124
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:34,720
No.

1125
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:41,320
She must be suspicious,
judging from her questions.

1126
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,120
She wisely asked those questions.

1127
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,520
She isn't suspecting anything.

1128
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,720
Because today
she has something else to focus on.

01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:16,680
I asked so that I know
how to behave towards them.

1147
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,000
Are you suspicious of those girls?

1148
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:28,560
And what should I be suspicious about?

1149
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,400
I'm a man.

1150
01:36:37,920 --> 01:36:40,360
I can pick up any flowers

1151
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:43,680
growing on the street.

1152
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,520
I can pick them up
even though they're ugly

1153
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:52,280
or without any scent.

1154
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,160
But now,

1155
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:57,040
I have this beautiful...

1156
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,480
and fragrant flower.

1157
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:07,440
I managed to place it as something
to be honored at home.

1158
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,320
Greatly honored more than anyone.

1159
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,880
I can crush those flowers any time.

1160
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:34,200
Is anything else bothering you?

1161
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:43,840
Your words are beautiful
as if you're a native.

1162
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:49,520
I put a lot of effort into it.

1163
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:52,560
It's very difficult.

1164
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,560
You're very good at it.

1165
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:02,240
I gained King Narai's trust

1166
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:06,400
by speaking Thai.

1167
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,160

1171

Pin, Yaem,

1172
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,920
you can just leave them there.
I'll put them in the chest myself.

1173
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:19,200
"The chest"?

1174
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,360
What "chest"?

1175
01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:25,560
What? Well...

1176
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:28,240
Oh...

1177
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:31,520
You don't call it a chest. You call it...

1178
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:32,960
[all] "A box."

1179
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,040
[Pin and Yaem] My lady.

1180
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:37,360
Right, it's not called a chest.
I keep forgetting.

1181
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:38,520
[laughs]

1182
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:41,440
Just leave them there.
I'll put them in the box myself.

1183
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:44,280
You should go eat. You must be starving.

1184
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:46,600
[Pin and Yaem] Yes, my lady.

1185
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:53,320
Pin, place the box up here for our lady.

1186
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:54,400
[Pin] Okay.

1187
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:20,920
I came to Chulasakarat 1044.

1188
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:27,360
If it's added with 1181, it'll make...

1189
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:32,400
2225 BE.

1190
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:43,120
Lord Lek will be flogged to death.

1191
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:46,760
[professor] King Narai was devastated

1192
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:49,960
that Lord Lek wouldn't admit
to his charges.

1193
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:55,480
He ordered Lord Lek
to be flogged by a rattan cane.

1194
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:57,560
Do you know how it was done?

1195
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:02,920
Both of his hands were tied up.
He was flogged on his bareback,

1196
01:41:03,680 --> 01:41:05,360
on bare skin.

1197
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:08,960
And the rattan cane was tied
in with strong ropes.

1198
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:13,360
Every slash caused his flesh
to tear up bit by bit.

1199
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,520
[professor] We don't know
how many times he was flogged.

1200
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,200
But what we knew for sure,

1201
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,480
he was definitely embarrassed

1202
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:25,280
because he was the son
of King Narai's wet nurse.

1203
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:28,640
They shared his mother's breasts.
They were friends.

1204
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:32,600
He was King Narai's
right-hand warrior in battle.

1205
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:37,560
He was the Minister of Treasury,
one of the Four Pillars.

1206
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:39,640
Mm.

-[groans]
-What are the Four Pillars?

1209
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:48,160
It's a ruling system
during Ayutthaya period, Professor.

1210
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:52,080
It consists of four departments,
City, Royal, Treasury, Agriculture.

1211
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:53,800
Was Ketsurang's answer correct?

1212
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:56,360
No.

1213
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:59,640
It consists of 15 wooden bridges
and 15 brick bridges,

1214
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:01,160
together it makes up 30 bridges.

1215
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:03,360
It's at Cheekun Bridge. It's very lively.

[students laughing]

Are you nuts?

1218
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:11,000
My answer was right.
I was talking about the Four Pillars.

1219
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:15,240
The Four Pillars consist of
City, Royal, Treasury, Agriculture.

1220
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:21,360
Rueang, what a friend.
Of course, my answer was right.

1221
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:24,240
How did you not know
about the Four Pillars?

1222
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,360
[chuckles]

1223
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:34,520
Lord Lek got flogged.

1224
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:37,200
What was the reason for it?

1225
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:45,560
[professor] <i><font color="white">He was the minister

How accurate is it this time?

1230
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:07,680
Lord Lek was flogged to death

1231
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:12,520
in the year 2226.

1232

That's this year.

1233
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:31,800
Corruption?

1234
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:34,000
He cheated?

1235
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:38,440
How could someone like Lord Lek
be a cheater?

1237
