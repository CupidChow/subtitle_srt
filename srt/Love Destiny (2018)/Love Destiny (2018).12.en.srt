00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,400
Is it beautiful, Lord Hora?

166
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,160
Yes.
[laughs]

167
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,160
Whose song is this?
I've never heard it before.

168
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
[Karaked laughs]

169
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,920
What kind of song is that?
It sounds peculiar.

170
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,640
Is it beautiful, Lady Champa?

171
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,120
Hmm.

172
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,320
It is, but it's unlike songs
from Ayutthaya.

173
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,240
Is it a song from your home
in Song Kwae, Lady Karaked?

174
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,480
Yes, my lady. It's a song from my town.

175
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Hmm...

176
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,560
I've listened to songs from Song Kwae,
but they're different from yours.

177
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,960
[Champa sighs]

178
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,240
Come, Prik. Chuang.
I'm going to my chambers.

179
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,600
-Yes, my lady.
-Yes, my lady.

180
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,920
It's a modernized version, Lady Champa.

181
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,040
Okay.

182
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,560
[clicks tongue]

183
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,200
Is it a beautiful song, <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>?

184
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,360
His lordship wasn't listening.
He is busy working.

185
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,080
Choi.

186
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,440
You are dismissed.

187
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,360
Yes, my lord.

188
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,400
[soft chuckle]

189
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200

[romantic music continues]

192
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,680
It's the sweetest song I've ever heard
to praise the moon's beauty.

193
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,320
Did you hear me sing?

194
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,200
Every word of it.

195
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,440
I sang my song for you.
Next time, you will have to sing for me.

196
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,080
Indeed. I should be the one singing.

197
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,640
-Why?
-Why?

198
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,840
Uh...

199
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,480
It's a song to praise
Karaked's beauty, Father.

200
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,680
-I see.
-[Dech chuckles]

201
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,920
Then, you must learn to sing it.

202
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,320
Yes, Father.
[chuckles]

203
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,440
-You can go, Muang.
-[Muang] Yes, my lord.

204
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,880
[Horathibodi] I'm going to bed.

205
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
[romantic music]

206
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,360

Can you--

209
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,360
You've been to every temple here.
Where else do you want to go?

210
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,440
I think you must know Ayutthaya
better than me by now.

211
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,160
Your curiosity is impossible to satisfy.

212
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,960
[groans]

213
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,320
There's no other temple here.

214
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,440
Why don't we go to Lavo?

215

I'm here to see Madam. Is she here?

00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,480
She's making desserts inside. Follow me.

228
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,840
He thinks himself
equal to the King, my lady.

229
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,280
His audacity will be his downfall.

Who do you mean?

231
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,520
His home is as grand as the King's palace.

232
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,280
No one is as shameless as this westerner.

233
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,520
Buildings in his homeland
are built with concrete.

234
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,840
He must be used to it.

235
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,960
Plus, this building may be used
to welcome western guests

236
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,240
and make known the glory of Ayutthaya.

237
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,520
Don't think too much into it.

238
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,960
But it is still wrong.

239
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,400
No one would dare put themselves
on the same level as their masters.

240
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,960
[servant 1] It is uncustomary, my lady.

241
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,480
The King favors this westerner.

242
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,480
[Abb] The person who criticizes him
may be punished instead, my lady.

Are you okay, Lady Mali?

I'm fine.

My youngest is called JoÃ£o.
He's still a baby.

256
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,840
I breastfeed him myself,
and without a wet nurse.

257
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,880
[Karaked] But you still find time
to make desserts.

[Karaked] What is this, Lady Mali?

265
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,880
[Mali] I came up with the recipe,
but it doesn't have a name yet.

266
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,960
It's made from duck egg yolk and flour.

267
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,560
I figure that if I simmer the sugar,
it will make the desserts last longer.

You have found your calling.

Well...

It looks appetizing and smells good.

273
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,960
[Karaked] It should taste delightful.

What is it called, madam?

286
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,800

the Chinese sweets?

Then, I will call it...

<i><font color="white">thong yip.</font></i>

[laughs]
That's it.

294
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,560
I put more flour in this one.
I will call it <i><font color="white">thong yod</font></i>.

295
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,800
The dessert over there is made
by dripping batter into boiled sugar.

296
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,680
I call it <i><font color="white">thong pae</font></i>.

297

That's not good.

I'm sitting here with you.
How would I know?

But you're his lordship's mother.

Huh? You speak like
you have never had a child.

312
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,360
Don't you know that
mothers and sons live separate lives?

313
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,360
Prik did have a child, my lady.

Don't you dare.

My lady, dogs are more loyal than people.

324
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,520
I would rather have a dog as a child
than a human being.

325

You already have one indeed, Prik.

Once we are married,

I will let you be
the principal mistress of the house.

338

I don't want to be a principal wife.

[Dech] You won't have to be.

340
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,280
Because I will not put you
in that position by having someone else.

341
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,840
Oh, what is this?

342
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,360

Pork <i><font color="white">sarongs</font></i>. How nice.

What do you mean by what you said?

344
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,960
I will take you

Not anymore.

Why is that?

Whose horse is that?

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,360
It's the horse I've arranged.

Lavo has no canal

Only the two of us will go
on a horse riding tour.

Can't you see there is only one horse?

I did.

483
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,360
Get women, children, and priests.

484
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,480
Yes, Master.

485
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,880
Your lordship.

[foreboding music]

487
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,160
Viscount Wisarn Wacha.

488
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,080
Lady Karaked.

489
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,080
Are you here to see Tong Guyomar?

490
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,320
Yes, Earl Rit Kamhaeng.

491
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,640
Are you on your way out?

492
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,480
Yes, I'm going to oversee
the construction of the fort.

493
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:01,920
Yes, sir. Can I go in
to see Lady Tong Guyomar?

494
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,120
Come, <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>.

495
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,040
[Phaulkon] Wait.

496
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,800
Take the men to the fort.

497
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,200
I'll follow you
once I'm done with my business here.

498
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,160
Yes, Master.

499
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,400
His mind changes fast.

500
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,880
I just realized your visit
is more important than my obligation.

501
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,720
If you want to see
Tong Guyomar, follow me.

502
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,400
Come, <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>.

00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,920

506
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,840
I know how to make them.

507
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,640
Lady Mali is an excellent cook.

[foreboding music continues]

00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,520
I should get down to business.

511
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,480
I am here to bid you farewell
before I leave for Ayutthaya.

512
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,080
You're leaving so soon, Lady Karaked.

513
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,280
The French ambassador is leaving soon.

514
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,120
[Karaked] My betrothed and I have
to go back

515
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,280
to get ready for the voyage.

516
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,800
[Mali] Have a safe journey, Lady Karaked.

517
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:21,160
Don't forget to visit me
next time you come to Lavo.

518
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,720
I won't.

519
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,880
Goodbye.

520
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,160
Farewell, Lady Tong Guyomar.

521
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,440
It is good that you two
got to see each other.

522
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,840
[Karaked] <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>, look at him.

523
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,040
He's glaring at us.

524
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:07,200
His eyes are blazing,
like he's going to shoot fire at us.

525
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:09,640
[Dech sighs]

526
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,560
Do not joke around.

527

Let's leave.

528
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,520
I will see you off.

529
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,800
Goodbye, sir.

530
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,320
-Good luck, my lady.
-Farewell.

531

[Phaulkon] Tong Guyomar.

532
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,640
Tong Guyomar.

[foreboding music]

Leave them be.

535
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,960
This is between husband and wife.
Don't let it bother you.

[tense music]

537
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,120
Is this common, <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i>?

538
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,920
Is what common?

539
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,880
That a husband beats his wife.

540
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,920
It is. Why can't he?

541
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,040
He can't. Wives are human beings too.

542
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,120
You're talking strangely again.
Who says they aren't?

543
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,880
Men and women are equal.

544
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,280
How are they equal?

545
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:50,560
A woman is under a man's protection.
She is under his patronage.

546
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,600
How can they be equal?

547
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,040
[gasps]
Patronage?

548
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,440
That's right. Patronage.

549
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,960
I can't accept it.

550
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,160
Accept what?

551
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,240
If my husband beats me,

552
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,000
one of us will not live to see
another day for sure.

553
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,720
I mean it.

554
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,320
Can you compose yourself?

555
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,520
Your language disturbs me.

556
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,280
If you are disobedient,
won't you let me lay my hands on you?

557
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,280
You need to be whipped at least,
to be disciplined.

558
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,000
I will lock you in the house
and forbid you to go out.

559
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,000
It seems like a good idea.
[chuckles]

560
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,560
You can forget that idea.

561
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,600
[laughs]

562
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,360
[Phaulkon] After all this time,
are you still longing for him?

563
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:00,400
What are you talking about?

564
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,520
Viscount Wisarn Wacha has the nerve

565
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,600
to come here on the pretense
of bringing his betrothed.

566
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,960
He probably wanted to see
how his ex-lover was doing.

567
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,720
What will others think
if they hear you speak like that?

568
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,880
[Mali] Won't they think
his lordship commits misconduct

569
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,920
and that I am a whore?

570
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,800
Don't think everyone will be like you.

571
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,920
You have never been so provoked.

572
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,240
Now, you dare argue with me

573
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,720
only because I'm disgracing
Viscount Wisarn Wacha's name.

so it was quick.

Lord Hora has shown me kindness,

It's better to wear it underneath,

Go sit over there, my lady.

It's improper for a lady

Our kingdom is presently at peace,

but we can't predict
what will happen in the future.

710
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:40,400
So many westerners are in Ayutthaya.

Prince Pi, the King's son,

714
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,080
and his brother, Prince Apaiyatot, Master.

715
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,560
[Sorasak] Both of them have their eyes
on the throne.

716
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:04,040
Thus, they seek support
from the westerner, Earl Rit Kamhaeng.

717
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,960
That will be your task,
