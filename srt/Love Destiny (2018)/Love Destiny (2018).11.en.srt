I was sad yesterday, so I cried.

How come your mood changes so quickly?

What's wrong with that?
Can't my mood change?

Even our hearts can change.

185
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,680
Do you want me to grieve until I die?

186
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,400
If so, inform me this instant

of the cause for your lament.

Because you're my betrothed.

You must heed my every command.

Not only must you inform me

I can give you as many beatings as I want.

You don't need to know.

You only need to know
that it isn't considered adultery

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,760
for a man to have sexual relations
with an unmarried woman.

249
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,720
Having sexual relations
with unmarried women is still adultery

250
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,480
since the man is cheating on his wife.

I'd like to know the King's reply

00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,600
to the ambassador de Chaumont
about religious conversion.

676
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,640
It would be unlike you not to ask.

Of course.

Lord Hora?

679
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,840
I'll tell you that His Majesty, the King,

680
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,160
is very wise.

681
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,520
He rejected the offer
in a diplomatic manner.

682
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,880
He neither agreed

683

nor rejected their offer.

684
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,120
The envoys think they still have hope.

685

Don't you want to know as well?

Every religion teaches people
to do good deeds,

to fear sins, and to make an offering.

People with beliefs in any religion

are easier for the King to rule
than those without faith.

May the wise King of France be informed.

Do tell him that...

714

for a king to abandon a religion

that his ancestry had observed
for over two thousand years

01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,840
Yes, my lady.

835
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:25,040
Karaked, you're not sad anymore, are you?

836
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:26,960
No, my lady.

837
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,120
Good.

838
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,200
[romantic music]

839
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:58,800
This lady.

840
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,760
Who is she and where is she from?

841
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:05,320
[ominous music]

842
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,400
She will be a faithful wife to you.

843
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,440
Who is she?

844
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:19,600
Can you use divination to find out?

845
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,400
What will it do?

846
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:27,920
Do not worry, Dech.

847
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,920
She's here because she has to.

848
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,200
Everything has been destined.

849
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,920
Yes, Father.

850
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,840
The King calls for a royal meeting today.

851
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:01,400
[Horathibodi] He grants audiences
to many officials.

852
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,160
I suppose it's about the French envoys.

853
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,040
He still hasn't come back
from Lavo since then.

854
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,040
Do you know what the meeting is about?

855
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,200
[intense music]

856
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,520
The Chevalier de Chaumont is scheduled
to leave in two months.

857
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,480
That would be in December.

858
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,520
[Narai] I want to send
another diplomatic mission with him

859
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,080
for the third time.

860
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,800
We have failed twice.

861
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,680
The first mission...

862
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:41,360
was shipwrecked halfway.

863
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,280
What a pity that Earl Pipat Ratchamaitri

864
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,160
lost his life on that journey.

865
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:48,480
On the second mission,

866
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,640
Lord Pichai Wathit.

867
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,400
Your Majesty.

868
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,680
Lord Pichit Maitree.

869
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,640
Your Majesty.

870
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,280
You two were keen enough

871
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,120
to have made your way to France.

872
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:08,280
It's a shame I didn't appoint you
as ambassadors,

873
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,320
so you couldn't forge relations
with their King.

874
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:15,080
But you're very fortunate
to have made it back to your families.

875
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,600
[both] Yes, sir.

876
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,640
You two were stuck there for a long time.

877
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,040
Do you have any western wives?

878
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,880
[laughs]

879
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,800
I have consulted with Rit Kamhaeng.

880
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:39,080
[Narai] I'll send a diplomatic mission
with them.

881
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,600
King Louis XIV of France

882
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,720
is a monarch with extensive power.

883
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:51,560
He sent his envoys to Ayutthaya
to pay homage to me.

884
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,040
It is a great honor

885
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:55,800
and a sign of a good alliance.

886
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,040
The westerners
who display aggression towards us,

887
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,240
especially the Dutch,

888
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,480
will no longer dare to tyrannize us.

889
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,400
[suspenseful music]

890
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:14,760
The Dutch treat us
like we are inferior to them.

891
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:17,320
[Phaulkon] Once, 20 years ago,

892
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:21,680
they used their warships
to seize our merchant ships

893
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,280
heading to China and Japan.

894
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:30,520
They also declared war on us,
the people of Siam.

895
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:32,640
Your Majesty.

896
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,600
[tense music]

897
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,360
It's worth noting that

898
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:49,160
the matter ensued

899
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:54,040
because we got Japan to trade with us
instead of them, my lord.

900
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,120
We sent 12 merchant ships to Japan.

901
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,600
They were loaded with goods.

902
01:18:01,560 --> 01:18:05,400
Thus, Japan was no longer forced
to trade with the Dutch.

903
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,400
Ayutthaya is the capital of Siam.

904
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:13,160
We have the right to send merchant ships
to any possible destination

905
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,440
that will buy our goods.

906
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:24,120
It wouldn't have been a problem
if most of our trading goods with Japan

907
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,640
hadn't been animal hides.

908
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,840
They have been granted a monopoly

909
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:35,960
on animal hide trade
since the reign of King Prasat Thong.

910
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,520
The contract has had us
at a disadvantage for decades.

911
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,240
Why can't we break it?

912
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:50,360
That's why they thought blocking
our river mouth with their warships

913
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,360
was not wrong.

914
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,400
[tense music]

915
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,200
Earl Wisut Sunthorn.

916
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:11,000
Do you think the Dutch were right
in doing so?

917
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,200
It's not right or wrong.

918
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:16,480
I'm explaining the reason for the action

919
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,400
that you accuse them of,

920
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,320
that they dared send warships
to invade Ayutthaya.

921
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,560
Why waste time talking about incidents
that happened decades ago?

922
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,920
In the end, Ayutthaya was forced
to sign an unequal treaty with the Dutch.

923
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,520
That's right.

924
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,440
So why are you all arguing?

925
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,440
[Narai] Nevertheless,

926
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,360
at present,

927
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,160
we still have to yield to them.

928
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:55,400
We can't send out our own merchant ships

929
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,400
for we haven't excelled in navigation.

930
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:01,120
Our last treaty with the Dutch

931
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:06,080
had us at a great disadvantage,
as you are all aware.

932
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,760
Earl Rit Kamhaeng brought it up first.

933
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:15,920
[Phetracha] The warship incident

934
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,160
and the declaration of war
had happened over two decades ago,

935
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,920
yet he still mentioned it
and caused dispute.

936
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,680
What a waste of time.

937
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,680
We should have been doing
more useful things.

938
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,880
Oh, my, Duea.

939
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,120
You would have been wandering
and picking fights with people, no doubt.

940
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,960
How useful is that?

941
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:46,360
It's still better than listening
to a useless old tale, Your Majesty.

942
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:48,840
[Narai] Very well.

943
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:54,840
I decided to send a mission
back with the French.

944
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,520
Rit Kamhaeng.

945
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,520
Arrange the matter for me
as soon as possible

946
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:07,760
before the French set sail back home.

947
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,280
Lord Hora.

948
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,040
Your Majesty.

949
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,560
Find an auspicious time for traveling.

950
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:22,240
Aren't they the ones
to set the departure date, Your Majesty?

951
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,320
[Narai] I will decide.

952
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,640
An auspicious time is crucial...

953
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,200
since our men will travel with them.

954
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

955
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,800
[Narai] Phra Sadej.

956
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,360
Your Majesty.

957
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
You're the head of the Royal Department.

958
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,440
Help Rit Kamhaeng form the mission.

959
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,160
[Narai] Find a couple of ambassadors

960
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:52,080
and seven or eight
high-ranked noblemen as escorts.

961
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,200
Who else do we need, Rit Kamhaeng?

962
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:03,600
[Phaulkon] The workmen, Your Majesty.

963
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:09,440
We need a duty officer, an interpreter,
a clerk, a scribe, a physician,

964
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,800
kitchen crew,

965
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,480
and servants, Your Majesty.

966
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,360
I will decide later

967
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,920
who will be the chief ambassador.

968
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,960
I would like to suggest

969
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,320
Earl Wisut Sunthorn, Your Majesty.

970
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,800
[tense music]

971
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,760
Lady Champa, what will you teach me today?

972
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,400
I will give it a hundred percent

973
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:20,440
because you rock.

974
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,280
[sighs]

975
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,560
I'm so vexed by your manner.

976
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,000
But I'm not vexed by you at all.

977
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:31,640
-Prik.
-Yes, my lady?

978
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,160
Prepare the kitchen.

979
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,120
Teach Lady Karaked how to cook.

980
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,960
Teach her to make
my son's favorite dishes.

981
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,120
My lady.

982
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,520
Lord Dech likes <i><font color="white">Moo Sarong</font></i>.

983
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:51,760
I beg you to consider
the arduous task of teaching Lady Karaked

984
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,720
to make edible wicker balls.

985
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:55,640
[Prik scoffs]

986
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,280
She won't be able to do it.

987
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,360
Prik.

988
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,320
You're complaining
when you haven't even taught her yet.

989
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,640
I'm so tired of you.

990
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,080
[sighs]
You're dismissed.

991
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,680
If you won't teach her, I will.

992
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:12,840
-Is that what you want?
-Yes, my lady.

993
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:14,960
Wait, Lady Champa.

994
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:19,480
Are you sure sarongs
and wicker balls are edible?

995
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,800
See?

996
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,360
What did I say?
[scoffs]

997
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:28,480
It would be unlike Lady Karaked
not to ask strange questions.

998
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,960
Prik, why can't I have suspicions?

999
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,680
You can't, my lady. Everybody eats it.

1000
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,040
Why are you suspicious?

1001
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,640
Do you eat sarongs and wicker balls?

1002
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,520
It's <i><font color="white">Moo Sarong</font></i>, not a real sarong.

1003
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:44,080
That's enough.

1004
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,640
Prik, Chuang. Prepare the ingredients.

1005
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,920
-Let me see you cook.
-Yes, my lady.

1006
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:07,960
Chop the pork finely.

1007
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:12,080
She can't even chop
the pork properly, my lady.

1008
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:14,800
[rapid clanging]

1009
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,360
[both snicker]

1010
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,000
Are you satisfied, Prik?

1011
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,200
[grumbles]

1012
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,920
Add coriander roots and garlic too.

1013
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:39,720
How much?

1014
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,960
As much as needed.

1015
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,640
Let Karaked do it.

1016
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,800
You asked me to teach her, my lady.

1017
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,440
Doing it for her is not teaching, Prik.

1018
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,640
Chuang.

1019
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:57,600
I agree with Chuang.

1020
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,360
I agree with Chik.

1021
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,520
Start pounding. Why are you confused?

1022
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,960
[chuckles softly]
All right.

1023
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,240
[thumping heavily]

1024
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,320
Isn't that too hard?

1025
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:15,120
[lively music]

1026
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:21,880
[light music]

1027
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,520
Add a pinch of salt.

1028
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Why are grains of salt here so big?

1029
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:45,720
-Well--
-They're from the Sea Town

1030
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,520
at the river mouth.

1031
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:48,960
Okay, my lady.

1032
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,520
[lively music]

[hissing]

1034
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:20,000
These are called <i><font color="white">shou mian</font></i> noodles.

1035
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:22,840
They're imported by the Chinese.

1036
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:28,040
[Champa] Wrap them around the pork
slowly and gently.

1037
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:30,160
Thank you, my lady.

1038
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:32,600
You are the kindest...

1039
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,840
and the most beautiful.

1040
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,520
Just like someone here.

1041
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:43,720
[Karaked] She is a real beauty.

1042
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,120
She's pretty despite her old age.

1043
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:51,120
The only difference is that

1044
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,640
she is unkind, my lady.

1045

[light music continues]

1048
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,120
It's done, Lady Champa.

1049
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:45,760
Mm.

1050
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:53,080
Do you know why the dish
is called <i><font color="white">Moo Sarong</font></i>, Karaked?

1051
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:57,200
Here. The pork is wearing sarongs.

1052
01:28:57,280 --> 01:28:58,320
[chuckles]

1053
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:09,440
Is it good?

1054
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:10,680
Yes.

1055
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:17,080
[suspenseful music]

1056
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,560
What do you say, Pan?

1057
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,600
Your Majesty.

1058
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:34,800
Rit Kamhaeng named you as the envoy.

1059
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,120
Will you do it?

1060
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,200
[suspenseful music]

1061
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,640
Do you have to consult your friends?

1062
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,880
You always do as your peers say.

1063
01:29:58,040 --> 01:29:58,880
[Narai sighs]

1064
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:05,560
You have to separate personal matters
from official duties, Pan.

1065
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,640
[Narai] Will you ever get to go
if you always listen to others?

1066
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:12,080
Right, Thongkam?

1067
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,320
It's as you said, Your Majesty.

1068
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,920
What did I say?

1069
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:25,640
Some people can't be trusted,
Your Majesty.

1070
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:36,040
Therefore, we should learn
to distinguish honest people

1071
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:37,960
from the corrupted ones.

1072
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,840
Some can be read easily, Your Majesty.

1073
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:43,360
[suspenseful music]

1074
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,600
His origin alone indicates
his corrupt nature.

1075
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,240
Those who trust him must be
of the same nature, then!

1076
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:54,960
[tense music]

1077
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,480
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

1078
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:10,120
-Phra Sadej.
-Your Majesty.

1079
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:15,120
Recruit officials to join the mission.
Ask for volunteers.

1080
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:19,080
Reward their families
as you deem appropriate.

1081
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:20,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

1082
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,360
Lord Hora.

1083
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,360
Your Majesty.

1084
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:25,720
Find an auspicious date.

1085
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,040
It seems the French will decide.

1086
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:30,760
An auspicious time

1087
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:34,920
pales in comparison
with a time of good weather.

1088
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:37,320
Waves and winds occur every day,

1089
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:42,120
but there can only be
one auspicious date, is that right?

1090
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

1091
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:47,480
An auspicious time is our main concern.

1092
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:48,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

1093
01:31:59,720 --> 01:32:01,920
What will you say, Shorty?

1094
01:32:04,160 --> 01:32:05,120
Your Majesty.

1095
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:08,840
Why did you come so late?

1096
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,720
I went to get a compressed ball,
Your Majesty.

1097
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:17,680
The old one has no aroma
and does no good, Your Majesty.

1098
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:19,520
[Narai] I see.
[chuckles]

1099
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:22,600
Good. I'm feeling sore at the moment.

1100
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,240
Give me a massage.

1101
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,440
[suspenseful music]

1102
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,440
[suspenseful music continues]

1103
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:11,280
What are you plotting
with Prince Pi, my lord?

1104
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,160
Nothing.

1105
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,240
Can we trust him, Duea?

1106
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,600
Not at all, Father.

1107
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,360
I agree with you.

1108
01:33:31,960 --> 01:33:34,320
Do you think
no one saw you exchange glances?

1109
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:43,760
[Phetracha] Since he got the title
of Earl Rit Kamhaeng,

1110
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,120
he starts to think he's important too.

1111
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,440
[tense music]

1112
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:56,640
Shall we take the wind out of his sails
for three months, Father?

1113
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:05,320
Please hear me, my lord.

1114
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:10,640
I don't see anyone more suitable than you

1115
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,400
to be the ambassador.

1116
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:25,320
Why do we have to pay homage
to the French in their home?

1117
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,240
Farewell.

1118
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,960
Come and have a meal at my place.

1119
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,280
I'm not hungry.

1120
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:40,120
Come, Lord Wisut.

1121
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:41,960
We can discuss the matter.

1122
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,040
Let's dine with his lordship.

1123
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,000
Let's hear them out.

1124
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:53,360
[tense music]

1125
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,480
[tranquil music]

1126
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,040
Don't you believe I made this?

1127
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:52,200
-I do.
-Yes.

1128
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:58,640
But <i><font color="white">Khun Pi</font></i> doesn't.

1129
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,120
Why do you think so?

1130
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:07,440
You're just sitting there
not saying a word.

1131
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,560
[soft chuckle]

1132
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:11,760
Keeping quiet doesn't mean
I don't believe you.

1133
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:15,600
Are bullet wood flowers falling
from your mouth?

1134
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,320
What flowers?

1135
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:21,080
Don't you know the tale
about golden bullet wood flowers?

1136
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,200
I know bullet wood flowers,

1137
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,560
but not the golden ones.

1138
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:30,040
I suppose it hasn't been written.

1139
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,520
Well...

1140
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:36,880
Lady Karaked never fails to amaze me.

1141
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,480
Didn't you say she was good for nothing?

1142
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:43,600
Oh.

1143
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,040
She is good.

1144
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,280
Good for a laugh.

1145
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:54,440
[Dech chuckles]

1146
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,080
Like your golden
bullet wood flowers story.

1147
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:01,360
[lively music]

1148
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,280
Just admit it's delicious.

1149
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,240
[men] It is.

1150
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,040
Thank you.

1151
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,280
What was the meeting with the King about?

1152
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:18,640
Good gracious.

1153
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,680
Did you hear her, my lady?

1154
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,120
She spoke so bluntly.

1155
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,480
Good. I would like to know as well.

1156
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,400
You are dismissed.

1157
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:37,120
You're so nosy
about your master's affairs.

1158
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:38,720
Yes, my lady.

he is the son of King Narai?

It's not a secret.
It's just that nobody talks about it.

It's something people only whisper about.

Why doesn't King Narai acknowledge him
as his son?

Is it because he's unappealing?

That can't be.

It says Prince Pi is a short man

with a hunched back and limping legs.

But he has good manners
and speaks politely.

King Narai adopted him as his son
because he loves him very much.

King Narai has two younger brothers
of the same mother,

Prince Noi and Prince Apaiyatot.

Prince Noi had fallen ill,
