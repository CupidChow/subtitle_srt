But if you don't want to, then don't.

377
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,880
I'll tell you, then.

378
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,960
I've been dying to tell someone.

379
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,480
Lady Karaked's afraid that
she won't get to marry Lord Dech.

380
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,760
In the past, she took her engagement

381
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,080
to his lordship for granted

382
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,000
since she thought that
they would get married no matter what.

383
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,040
That's why she was never well-behaved.

384
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,280
She expressed
her entire dark side to the world.

385
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,120
But now, she is realizing

386
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,680
that his lordship hates her.

387
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,160
So she...

388
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,120
Prik.

389
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,880
Spit it out now.

390
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,160
Otherwise, I will leave.

-Me too. Let's go, Chuang.
-Let's go.

00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,400
Wait.

Hold on.

394
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,520
So she's pretending to be nice
to win his lordship's trust.

395
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,120
I don't think so, Prik.

396
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,560
[Chuang] She would get to marry him anyway

397
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,880
despite her personality.

398

Well,

00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,360
Lord Horathibodi

401
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,440
would not break a promise
he swore to keep.

402
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,640
[both] He will have to marry her
eventually.

403

He can only delay the wedding.

I don't want to cause you trouble...

that he is someone who can be bribed.

was the one who told on him.

Surely, my father knew
who was good and who wasn't.

00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,960
I don't know why.

680
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,120
I will close down this company.
Just you wait.

681
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,960

686
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:55,880
Tiang.

687
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,160
[Choi] Don't ever do that again

688
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,560
or my foot will end up in your mouth.

689
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,840
Your mouth might end up on my foot too.

690
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,440
Why didn't you just take the stairs?

691
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,760
-Are you here for Lord Rueang?
-Mm.

692
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:09,920
Follow me.

693
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,760
[tense music]

694
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,760
Tiang is here.

695
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,640
Greetings.

696
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,240
So what did you find out?

697
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,640
The company's representative is very upset

698
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,240
because the King wouldn't see him.

699
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,960
Why did he want to meet the King?

700
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,360
Just because his warehouse caught fire?

701
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,160
[scoffs]

702
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,680
He probably suspects
that it wasn't a coincidence.

703
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,480
He might want to tell the King
that someone burned it.

704
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,120
The King denied their request.

705
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,320
That's strange.

706
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,320
The King always pays attention

707
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,440
to matters that involve trading.

708
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,600
All that money,

709
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,520
how could His Majesty not care?

710
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,280
[scoffs]

711
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,880
What else could it be?

712
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,160
I bet Constantine Phaulkon
advised him against it.

713
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,960
And the King believed him.

714
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,560
What a vicious bastard.

715
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,320
So the King didn't get to know
about the fraud.

716
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,880
I believe my father
will be quite troubled by this.

717
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,720
I will tell him right after I leave.

718
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,040

Lord Hora.

722
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,440
What now, Karaked?

723
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,960
I just want to gain more knowledge,
Lady Champa.

724
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,920
You already know so much.

725
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,200
How much more do you need to know?

726
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,400
Come on, Lady Champa.

727
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,840
Knowledge is the most powerful weapon.

728
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,200
Listen to yourself.

729
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,680
Hm. Did you take it from someone?

730
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,280
[Champa] You wouldn't be able
to come up with that phrase.

731
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,800
You're right.

732
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,560
What do you mean?

733
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,560
I took it from someone else.

734
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,680
I knew it.

735
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,800
Prik.

736
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,080
Yes, my lady.

737
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,200
I didn't say anything wrong this time.

738
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,680
But you joined in.

739
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,880
[sighs]

740
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,920
I did.

741
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,920
[quirky music]

742
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,800
What is your question, Karaked?

743
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,160
I want to know about trading in Ayutthaya.

744
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,040
What did you say?

745
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,920
-[stutters]
-[tuts]

746
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,240
What do you wish to know?

747
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,400
Ayutthaya trades with many cities, right?

748
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,240
I want to know what we export.

749
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,920
Ayutthaya is an important trading center.

750
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,880
You've probably seen
many ships in our waters

751
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,720
due to our busy trading.

752
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,560
I have.

753
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,440
What is our bestseller?

754
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,240
Hmm.

755
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,080
Our bestseller

756
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,560
is leather.

757
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,760
Do we have a lot of leather?

758
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,800
Where do we get it?

759
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:37,960
Oh, my.

760
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,760
What kind of question is that?

761
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,640
Of course, we get it from the forest.

762
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,560
[light music]

763
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,520
I guess there are many forests here,

765
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,000
Unlike what?

[exhales sharply]
Prik.

769

-[Prik] Yes, my lady.
-Let's go make preparations.

770
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,480
I'm going to the temple.

771
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,400
Let's go, Chuang.

772
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,160
-[Prik] Yes, my lady.
-[Chuang] Yes, my lady.

[somber music]

775
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,720
Are there no forests where you came from?

776
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,760
There used to be,

777
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,160
but selfish people
destroyed almost all of them.

778
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,320
I've never heard that people
from Song Kwae did any deforestation.

779
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,040
[Horathibodi] Forests are home
to trees, animals,

780
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,240
and rivers.

781
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,920
Why would people there
want to destroy them?

[somber music]

783

Karaked.

784
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,440
Yes?

785
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,040
Do you miss your home?

786
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,040

[somber music]

788
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,800
You cannot change your past.

789
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:25,920
Why would you bury yourself in it?

790
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:32,040
It's more important
to focus on the present.

791
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,360
Yes, Lord Hora.

792
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,440
[sniffles]

[somber music]

794
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,720
Ayutthaya exports many goods.

795
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,080
Besides deer leather,
cow leather, and buffalo leather,

796
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,560
we also have stingray leather.

797
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,960
Do you mean stingrays in the ocean?

798
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,200
Yes, stingrays in the ocean.

799
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,920
We also export sappanwood,

800
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,240
agarwood,

801
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,160
ivory,

802
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,680
and also, elephants.

803
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:34,960
Elephants?

804
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,600
Do you mean living elephants?

She's unbearable, my lady.

808
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,240
She talks so loud.

809
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,320
She's not suitable to be a lady.

810
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,440
A lady is always a lady, Prik.

811
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,480
That's right.

812
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,160
Boong, stay out of this.

813
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,520
Am I right, though?

00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,400
-Hey.
-Quiet.

815
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,720
All of you, stay quiet.

816
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,520
You are all the same.

817
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,720
[all] My lady.

818
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,880
Why was she surprised about elephants?

819
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,720
I wonder the same thing.

820
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,160
Ayutthaya exports elephants and ivory.

821
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,240
The only thing left unsold is their feces.

822
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,000
[soft chuckle]

823
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,640
If you can sell that,

824
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,280
Earl Phetracha, your father

825
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,720
would be incredibly wealthy,

826
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,520
since he oversees
the Royal Elephant Corps.

827
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,760
You can always sell it yourself too.

828
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,640
[chuckles]

829
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,280
[playful music]

830
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,840
Uncle,

831
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,680
where does the King

832
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,800
get his inventory from?

833
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,120
From the people, of course.

834
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,720
Why don't the people sell it themselves?

835
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,840
Ah.

836
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,160
The law states that people cannot
trade with anyone,

837
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,440
except with the King's Treasury.

838
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,720
I see.

839
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,240
Then the Treasury
sells those goods to foreigners.

840
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,360
They buy goods at low prices,
then sell them at high prices, right?

841
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,000
That's absolutely right.

842
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,160
The Treasury is in charge
of regulating the price.

843
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,520
Both buying and selling prices, right?

844
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,560
That's right.

845
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,120
The Treasury is the only trading partner
anyone can have business with.

846
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,200
It's a monopoly.
Treasury's the sole seller.

847
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,560
Come again?

848
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,440
What did you say?

849
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,560
Um,

850
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,040
I said

851
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,080
the King is the sole seller.

852
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:47,280
Every merchandise must go through him.

853
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,920
That's why the Treasury is
the only party that's rich.

854
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,680
[sighs]

855
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,240
People who work hard can become rich too.

856
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,640
If they work hard and are persistent

857
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,960
to gather goods from the forest,
they will get paid

858
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,840
without investing in anything

859
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,360
besides their effort.

860
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,840
But they would earn more money
by selling those goods

861
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,760
to foreigners directly.

862
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,320
Everything that lies within this land

863
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,200
belongs to the King.

864
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,520
[sighs]

865
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,520
I think we should have the wedding soon

866
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,520
so she can become a housewife.

867
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,080
Otherwise,

868
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,360
she'll keep sticking her nose
in matters that don't concern a lady.

869
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,840
[light music]

870
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,480
[percussive music]

871
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,520
You will promote Earl Rit Kamhaeng

872
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:14,680
to be Duke Kosathibodi,
the Minister of Treasury?

873
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,120
I wanted to promote you,

874
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,640
but you declined.

875
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,360
Business isn't in my field of expertise.

876
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,520
Besides, I don't like foreigners.

877
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,840
[tense music]

878
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,840
Who told you

879
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,080
that I wanted to promote Constance?

880
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,240
I didn't need anyone to tell me.

881
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:39,560
I can read the situation.

882
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,240
You didn't let the representative
from the British company meet you,

883
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,760
which means that you are not willing
to hear about how dishonest he is.

884
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,560
[Phetracha] Lord Lek is now gone.

885
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,160
Of course, he would want his position.

886
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,400
Can you not read the situation at all?

887
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,680
I wanted to promote him
as the Minister of Treasury.

888
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,680
I knew it.

889
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,040
But he declined my offer.

890
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,640
I need to promote someone else.

891
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,720
[tense music]

892
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,800
Who do you have in mind?

893
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,480
Marquess Phra Sadej.

894
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,240
Marquess Phra Sadej
as the Minister of Treasury?

895
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,720
But he's very old.

896
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,560
[Phetracha] He knows nothing
about trading.

897
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,280
How can you promote him?

898
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:25,040
You don't approve of whoever I want.

899
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,480
You don't want Earl Rit Kamhaeng
as the minister

900
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,080
so I won't appoint him.

901
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,040
What do I have to do to satisfy you?

902
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,560
If you promote Marquess Phra Sadej,

903
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,720
that foreigner will do
whatever he pleases.

904
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,640
He will be able to cheat
however he wants and no one will know.

905
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,240
Do you have any idea how rich he is?

906
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,040
And are you not rich, Phetracha?

907
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,560
[tense music]

908

[tense music continues]

909
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,840
Why are you looking at me,
Earl Rit Kamhaeng?

910
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,320
[tense music]

911
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,560
You just got promoted.

912
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:33,600
You should know your place.

913
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,800
We are both earls now.

914
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,560
Do you think you're his favorite?

915
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,960
Your shadow will be headless soon.

916
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,960
You better watch out.

917
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:11,560
Come here, Rit Kamhaeng.

918
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,160
[tense music]

919
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,160
Sit over here.

920
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,440
I have something to ask you.

921
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:41,040
About Louis XIV of Paris.

922
01:03:41,640 --> 01:03:44,480
What are his fields of expertise?

923
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,160
Your Majesty.

924
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,640
[tense music]

925
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,400
[playful music]

926
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,520
[Choi] Lady Karaked is here.

927
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,400
[Karaked] So what if I'm here, Choi?

928
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,880
Must you report it to him?

929
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:24,080
My apologies.

930
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,200
Please excuse me then.

931
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,840
Mm-hm.

932
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,760
[Choi] I'll see you off.

933
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,360
[playful music]

934
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,160
[Karaked] Hmm.

935
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,760
Sugarcane!

936
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,120
Mmm.

937
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:56,760
Guys,

938
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,560
I want to go to the temple.

939
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:00,480
Would anyone like to take me?

940
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,560
[comical music]

941
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,480
[clears throat]

942
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,920
You can only ask

943
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,920
people in this house to take you.

944
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,160
Why would you ask other people?

945
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,840
[Karaked] So you're going
to take me, right?

946
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:14,920
Thank you.

947
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,640
[grunts]

948
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,680
Which temple do you wish to visit?

949
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,680
[Karaked] I want to go make an offering
in nine temples

950
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,240
and attend a watch night service.

951
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:29,240
Songkran is many months away.

952
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,520
Why would you want to attend
a watch night service now?

953
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,160
That's right. New Year is in April.

954
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,920
[Karaked] It is different from our time.

955
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:44,960
I want to...

956
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,480
attend the watch night service
on the 31st of December.

957

959
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,560
Lord Dech, Lord Rueang,

960
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,880
my father must be waiting for me.

961
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,480
What?

962
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,360
I believe someone
is waiting for me as well.

963
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,040
Lord Rueang, I'll walk you. Come on.

964
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,760
All right.

965
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,480
[comical music]

966
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,840
Lord Rueang, wait for me.

967
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,640
[Karaked] Lord Rueang.

968
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,680
Lord Rueang, wait for me.

970
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,560
I have something to ask you.

971
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,400
Had you seen me before?

972
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:37,880
Of course.

973
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,320
I know, right?

974
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,600
You saw me a long time ago, right?

975
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,360
It was last year

976
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,400
when I saw you coming from Song Kwae.

977
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,040
That's not what I meant.

978
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,440
When I said "a long time ago",

979
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,360
I meant a very, very long time ago.

980
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:59,440
If it's been that long,

981
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,960
I must have forgotten.

982
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,160
[clicks tongue]
Lord Rueang.

983
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,720
You can't forget.
You have a very good memory.

984
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,560
Try to think back, please.

985
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,640
Have you seen me before?

986
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:15,880
Had we known each other before?

987
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:20,080
Because I'm sure that
we knew each other before this.

Um,

994
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:47,720
no.

995
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,440
I mean, a while back.

996
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,440
Don't look so confused.

Yes, my lord.

Choi.

1004
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,640
Yes, my lord.

1005
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,360
Why didn't you answer me the first time?

1006
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:49,320
I did.

1007
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,640
If I didn't hear you,
it means you didn't answer.

1008
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,280
I really did, my lord.

1009
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:55,960
Are you talking back to me?

1010
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,320
But...

1011
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,160
Get out of my sight.

Don't mind him.

01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,240
He could be possessed by
a ghost or something.

1016
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,080
Prik.

1017
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:23,280
Why are you blaming a ghost?

1018
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,640
I don't think he's possessed.

1019
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,600
I agree with you, Chik.

1020
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,960
Have you ever seen him like this before?

1021
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:34,840
Today is the first time

1022
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,640
but I don't think he's possessed.

1023
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,240
I think he is.

1024
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,560
I don't think he is.

1025
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,480
Then who made him like that?

1026
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,200
Hmm. How would I know?

1027
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,320
[scoffs]

1028
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,800
Dang it, Choi.

1029
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:53,040
Why are you still sitting here?

1030
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:55,080
Go after him now.

1031
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,800
Things might get better. Go.

1032
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:00,960
All right.

Have some tea, my lord.

01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,880
Get out of my sight!

1036
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:21,960
Yes, my lord.

1043
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:42,480
[whispering]
I think I know why he's upset.

1044
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,080
Boong knows too, Prik.

1045
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,560
[Chik]
Right, Boong?

1046
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,800
I saw Lord Rueang

1047
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,520
talking to Lady Karaked at the pier.

1048
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:55,400
What does it have to do with Lord Rueang?

1049
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,520
[Prik gasps]

1050
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,920
Could it be...

1051
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,360
[gasps]

1052
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,760
Oh, my...

1053
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,400
You're starting to understand

1054
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,960
because Lord Rueang is in the picture.

1055
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,840
Oh, my. We were thinking the same thing.

[scoffs]

1057
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,480
She's very ill-mannered.

1058
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,560
How can she get married?

1059

Dech.

1065
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,320
Is something wrong?

1066
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,920
Please organize a ceremony for me.

1067
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,640
Sure, what ceremony do you have in mind?

1068
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:11,680
[Champa] Where do you like to hold it?

1069
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:13,880
What about the Kathin Ceremony?

1070
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,560
We can have a big religious ceremony.

1071
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,840
Please organize a wedding for me.

1072

[light music]

Where?

1081
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,080
Over here.

[sighs]

1083
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:32,800
Please forgive me.

1084
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,320
I lost it for a second there.

1085

[dramatic music]

1086
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,600
Yes, my lord.

1087
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,360
Has he gone back?

1088
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:48,800
Who?

1089
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,160
[dramatic music]

1090
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:58,520
The one at the pier.

1091
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,720
He's still here.

1092
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:03,840
Lord Rueang is still here.

1093
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:09,080
Mm-hm.

1094

Choi, go take a look.

1095
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,880
I think my ink ran out.

1096
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,280
Yes, my lord.

[light music]

Our house will hold a big ceremony soon.

1104
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,160
You should be prepared.

1105
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,160
Really?

1106
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,840
I'm glad. What ceremony is it?

1107
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:18,480
How big will it be?

1108
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:20,200
Well...

1109
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,680
Quite big.

Then, I'll help you with everything I can.

1113
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,120
It's important to you too.

1114
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,680
If that's the case,
I'll help you even more.

By the way,

1130
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,720
do you know what ceremony it is?

1131
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
How big will it be?

1132
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,840
We know.

1133
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,120
Everyone in this house knows.

1134
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,440
It will definitely be enormous.

1135
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,560
I won't dress up too elegantly though,
or it will be really heavy.

1136
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,080
You must.

1137
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:06,240
You must go all out for this ceremony.

Really?

1139
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,880
Trading in Ayutthaya

1140
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,480
is monopolized.

1141

There's only one buyer.

1142
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,680
Besides, bargaining is not an option.

1143
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,280
This is a wedding
we are talking about, my lady.

1144

What did you say?

1145
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:33,680
A wedding?
