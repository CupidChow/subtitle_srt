23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,400
Hello, Ms. Zhuang.

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,760
Qin Mo's little lover.

25
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,519
We meet again.

26
00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,239
You can tie me up,

27
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:00,920
but don't humiliate me.

28
00:02:02,862 --> 00:02:03,661
No.

29
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,319
Aren't you two already living together?

30
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,719
Why rush to deny it?

31
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,759
Since you live together,

32
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,759
I want to make a deal with you.

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,080
Why don't you consider me?

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,840
I'm no worse than Qin Mo.

35
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,400
Who gave you the confidence?

36
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
He may be trash,

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,039
but at least he's handsome.

38
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:26,885
No, what did you say?

39
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,151
Oh.

40
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:29,233
Nothing.

41
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,759
I said there's still quite a difference.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Besides, I don't do deals.

43
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,199
Hey, don't move.

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
You should

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,360
think it over before answering me.

46
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:45,400
Jinxin isn't
the only company in Haicheng.

47
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,240
And in terms of seniority,

48
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,039
Qin Mo

49
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,520
comes after me.

Guolong Food closed in 1996.)

52

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,790
(Does it
have something to do with Qin Mo?)

54
00:03:09,975 --> 00:03:12,496
I wonder your deal with me

55
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:15,032
is about Jinxin or Qin Mo?

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,919
Does it matter?

57
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:19,240
If you want to crush Jinxin,

58
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:20,975
I can't help.

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,000
If you want to crush Qin Mo,

60
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,530
we might have something to discuss.

61
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,055
Qin Mo.

62
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,360
I hate his arrogant attitude.

63
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,199
And Jinxin is just a company.

64
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:39,120
It doesn't have to be owned
by someone surnamed Qin.

65
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,199
You're clever.

66
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,639
An enemy's enemy is a friend.

67
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,840
If you solve one problem for me,

68
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:49,074
then you're my ally

69
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,425
from now on.

70
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,199

75
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,400
Any word on Zhuang Yan yet?

76
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,439
The train to Haicheng is tonight.

Mo.

80
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,800
Since when do you learn to frame people?

81
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:38,033
Zhou Zeyang
is Zhuang Shanshan's boyfriend.

82
00:04:38,275 --> 00:04:39,475
Stay away from him.

83
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,720
Zhuang Shanshan.

84
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,160
Why do you always take her side?

85
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,959
I'm your birth sister.

86
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,759
Had enough watching?

87
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
I was just passing by.

88
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Sibling fights

89
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,439
shouldn't involve me.

90
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:09,977
Only close friends and family
know my private number.

91
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,639
Who'd give it to a kid other than you?

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,439
I'm not Dou E.

93
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,199
God won't clear my name.

94

If I want justice,

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,120
I must do it myself.

96

Zhuang Yan.

97
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:30,608
Be direct.

98
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,720
What do you want?

99
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,120
Jinxin belongs to the Zhuang family.

100
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,839
You took what's not yours.

101
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,800
Shouldn't you return it?

102
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,900
What a bold claim.

103
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:47,839
I just wonder

104
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,720
if you can stomach it later.

105
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,800
I've got a strong stomach.

106
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,199
Except for disgusting people,

107
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,639

Alright.

00:06:03,637 --> 00:06:04,676
In that case,

110
00:06:04,975 --> 00:06:06,454
I'll give you a swift death.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Mr. Qin, Zhuang Yan's identity
has been confirmed.

114
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,120

115

Zhuang Yan is real.

118
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:34,240
Are you sure?

119
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,639
Absolutely.

120
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,600
Did you investigate me

Mr. Qin.

129
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Guolong Food launched a new campaign.

130

(Instant Noodle Buddies)
They bundle noodles with blind boxes.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,519
Once it went live, sales surged.

132
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,160
They've beaten Jinxin's sales.

133
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:29,772
Zhang Guolong must have
found someone good.

00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,000

00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,399
(She really is good.)

138
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:52,287
Love was never easy

139
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,240
to begin with.

140
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,439
How satisfying.

141
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,040
Hahaha.

142
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,759
Ms. Zhuang.

143
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,000
Thanks to you.

144

If not for you,

145
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,360
I couldn't have topped that brat.

146
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,439
How satisfying.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,800
It's just a deal.

148
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,439
You fixed my identity issue.

149
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,839
Of course I'll return the favor.

150
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,519
Saying that makes us a stranger.

151
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,360
Ms. Zhuang.

152
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,160
Since we're friends,

153
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,920
why not tell me

154
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,000
who you are?

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,360
You drank too much.

156
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,839
I'm Zhuang Yan.

157
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,559
Yes.

158
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:36,626
Ms. Zhuang.

159
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:38,462
Hey.

160
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
Tell me.

161
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,846
If Qin Mo knew we worked together,

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,440
could you stay in Haicheng?

163
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,512
Plan ahead.

164
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:49,873
Join Guolong Food.

165
00:08:50,275 --> 00:08:51,434
I'll pay double

166
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:52,732
whatever he offers.

167
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:58,240
Your business isn't just in Haicheng.

168
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:01,378
I heard

169
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,720
many overseas like to eat

170

rare Chinese animals.

171
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,919
Smuggling protected animals is a felony.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,639
But some can't resist profit.

173
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,320
How did you know?

174
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,039
I know nothing.

175
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,399
You know nothing too.

176
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,960
Nice fruit.

177
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:33,053
Carry on.

178
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,530
Take care, Ms. Zhuang.

179
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,120
Boss, she knows too much.

180
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,511
Should we...

181
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,440
Do nothing for now.

182
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,840
Do we just let her go?

183
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,360
Better one more friend

184
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,840
than one more enemy.

185
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:08,960
Boss.

186
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,000
One Beibingyang soda.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Sure.

188
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:26,200
(Cigarettes, Alcohol, Sweets, Tea)

189
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,399
Dealing with Zhang Guolong is risky.

190
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,819
Evil will meet its end.

191
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,269
The law will punish him.

192
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,840
(Cigarettes, Alcohol, Sweets, Tea)

193
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,919
It's so cold.

194
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,462
(Today is November 6.)

195
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,600
(Thanks to this calm night...)

196
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,799
It's already November.

197
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,837
I'm about to be born.

198
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,320
Gosh.

199
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,840
Guolong Food is aggressive.

200
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,919
Think of solutions now.

201
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Blind boxes?

202
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,000
If their plan is so popular,

203
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,399
we can launch our own.

204
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:07,720
With good marketing,

205
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,519
catching up isn't impossible.

206
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,320
Copycats will fall behind.

207
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,039
Jinxin needs its own edge.

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,440
Ms. Zhuang's eating contest
worked well last time.

209
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,321
Let her handle this plan.

210
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,765
Did you forget what she did to you?

211
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,112
You still recommend her?

212
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,519
She's outstanding talent.

213
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,759
I can't let personal grudges

214
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,480
hurt company interests.

215
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:34,639
Zhuang Yan.

216
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,159
What do you think?

217
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:39,679
Mr. Qin.

218
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,600
I do have a way

219
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,200
to win back Haicheng's market
in 1 month.

220
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,600
I need the proposal

221
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,559
in three days.

222
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,399
This time,

223
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,960
I hope it's truly for the company.

224
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,842
What are you doing here?

225
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:02,494
You used my name

226
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,720
to ask Finance for confidential files.

227
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,399
I was afraid to delay your work,

228
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,960
so I brought them myself.

229
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,200
Such a big company,

230
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,120
yet you tattle like a kid.

231
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,600
Thanks.

232
00:12:16,312 --> 00:12:17,039
Zhuang Yan.

233
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,399
What are you trying to do now?

234
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,240
Guolong Food is pressing Jinxin.

235
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:27,733
I'm drafting a plan to beat them.

236
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,399
I'm curious.

237
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,150
What kind of plan

238
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:36,399
needs early company records?

239
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,159
There must be something fishy in here.
