23
00:01:46,712 --> 00:01:47,352
Mr. Qin.

24
00:01:48,012 --> 00:01:49,652
Don't be unreasonable.

25
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,959
I just looked at early company files.

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
Did that offend you?

27
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,200
Or is there

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,959
really a secret I can't know?

29
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,560
Fine.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,000
Take a good look.

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,599
See whether I did anything

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,479
to the Zhuang family.

33
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,900
Why don't you come over,

34
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,120
sit on my lap and read?

35
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,000
Why are you mad?

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,560
Work's over.

37
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,919
Bye.

38
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:07,960
Goodbye.

39
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:22,879
Wait!

40
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,319
I haven't left yet.

41
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,360
Hey.

42
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,400
What am I supposed to do?

43
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,439
Am I staying here tonight?

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,599
I'm starving.

45
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,960
The 21st century is so much better.

46
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,520
It has my favorite
hot and sour noodles and luosifen.

47
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,960
I can also put everything in one bowl.

48
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,439
Instant noodle cups in the 1990s

49
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
were made of foam, right?

50
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,520
Polystyrene.

51
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,680
I'm a total genius.

52
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:35,000
(Jinxin Food Co. Ltd)
All done.

53
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,319
Heartless boss.

54
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,519
Heartless executives.

55
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,720
Despicable coworkers.

56
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,160
It's so late, yet no one saved me.

57
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,279
Jinxin isn't worth it.

58
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,879
Jinxin really isn't worth it.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,800
What the hell?

60
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,399
The Ring?

61
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,959
Is it really haunted?

62
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,399
Ah!

63
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,399
Why are you here?

64
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,360
I was going for a night run.

65
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,279
A night run?

66
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:36,160
Running in a suit at night?

67
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,759
Around the company?

68
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,959
Did work give you muscle memory?

69
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:46,560
Or are you worried about me,

70
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,800
so you're circling on purpose?

71
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,399
Who's worried about you?

72
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,000
Zhuang Yan, let me tell you.

73
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,600
Slow birds should fly early,

74
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,959
but everything has its limits.

75
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,759
You work overtime this late.

76
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,690
It's alright
that you don't care about your health.

77
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,980
If word gets out,
they'll say I mistreat my subordinates.

78
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Heartless, sharp-tongued, and fake.

79
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,959
What are you muttering?

80
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,079
I'm praising you.

81
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:11,079
If there's nothing else,
I'm heading home.

82
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:15,920
You're just going

83
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,800
to go home with your stomach growling?

84
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,480
You boss the sky and the earth,

85
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,759
and now even my stomach?

86
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,879
(She really is finding ways
to save Jinxin.)

87
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,519
Want to eat?

88
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,399
Why are you still standing there?

89
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,319
Hurry up and eat.

90
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,959
Darn CEO.

91
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,000
Mo.

92
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,279
Why did you come back with her?

93
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,079
We're going the same way.

94
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:09,586
Why wasn't it same before?

95
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,800
You stayed late on purpose

96
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,900
to be alone with my brother, right?

97
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,459
How scheming.

98
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,399
Qin.

99
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,120
Your sister called me scheming

100
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,480
for waiting on purpose
to come home with you.

101
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,360
Help explain it for me.

102
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,240
How fake.

103
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
Act normal.

104
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,399
Dear Qin.

105
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,600
What's wrong with you?

106
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,399
She shoved me right in front of you.

107
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,720
Mo.

108
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,600
Did you pick me up, so she got jealous?

109
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,680
Mo.

110
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,319
She's jealous of me.

111
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,480
Mo.

112
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,120
Well, Zhuang Yan.

113
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,720
Qin.

114
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,920
Go back and sleep.

115
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,879
Jiamin, go back too.

116
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,240
Mo, I really hate her.

117
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,279
I won't allow her
to be my sister-in-law.

118
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,360
What sister-in-law?

119
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,500
What nonsense are you saying?

120
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,720

Do you know?

132
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,960
Ji Hong somehow offended Boss

133
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,799
and was sent to manage the warehouse.

134
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,759
They said it was to use her strengths.

137
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.

138
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,559
Mr. Qin said this morning she's scheming

139
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:38,879
and good with locks.

140
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,799
Who would've thought

141
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:42,919
Mr. Qin doesn't have
many other strengths,

142
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,759
but he's sharp at judging people.

143
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,000
Get back to work.

144
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,279
What are you smug about?

145
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,360
You just seduced Mr. Qin to back you up.

146
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:57,720
Zhuang Yan.

147
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,279
How dare you hit me?

148
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,120
I can make Mr. Qin back me up

149
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:05,200
and I can take revenge myself.

150
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,240
I heard recently

151
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,360
Qin Jiamin hooked up with Zhou Zeyang.

152
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,519
If Qin Jiamin knew
you wanted Zhou Zeyang,

153
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,879
what do you think she'd do?

154
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,399
Don't talk nonsense.

155
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,399
I didn't.

156
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:20,960
Then watch your warehouse well.

157
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,200
Don't cause trouble.

158
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,879
You're too kind, Mr. Qin.

159
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,360
It's what I should do.

160
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,600
Zhuang Yan.

161
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,679
Perfect timing.

162
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,799
Take a look.

163
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,120
Mr. Zhou's creative proposal
is excellent.

164
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,399
We'll focus on cup instant noodles

165
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,159
with health, portability,
and eco-friendly appeal.

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,600
Using noodles and eggs,

167
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,600
we can cooperate
with the railway system.

168
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,679
With proper promotion,

169
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:55,759
sales will surely open up.

170
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,399
Zhou Zeyang.

171
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,120
I knew you were fake,

172
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,600
but I didn't know
you were shameless too.

173
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,480
Why are you suddenly insulting him?

174
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,759
He stole my idea
and used it to take credit.

175
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:09,480
I was polite enough not to hit him.

176
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,600
Ms. Zhuang.

177
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,360
I know there might be some disagreements
between us at work,

178
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,799
but I really don't know what you mean.

179
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,840
(Cup Instant Noodle Proposal)
I worked overtime on this proposal.

180
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,080
(Cup Instant Noodle Proposal)
The ideas in here

181
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,320
are almost identical to Zhou Zeyang's.

182
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,000
If this isn't plagiarism, what is?

183
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,919
Did we read each other's minds?

184
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,720
Zhuang Yan, you're really something.

185
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,000
Mr. Zhou presented the proposal first,
so who really plagiarized whom?

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,600
Shut up.

187
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,559
Alright.

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,799
Mr. Zhou.

189
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,519
Ms. Zhuang claims
you stole her proposal.

190
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,080
Do you want to explain?

191
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,960
There are indeed many similarities
in the ideas,

192
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,050
but Ms. Zhuang's proposal
is mostly conceptual.

193
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,879
I excel at execution, not debate.

194
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,799
If she insists I plagiarized,

195
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,799
no amount of explanation will help.

196
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:05,759
Mr. Qin.

197
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,039
I trust

198
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,200
your judgment.

199
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,799
Zhou Zeyang,
did you have a high fever as a kid

200
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,300
that burned away your sense of shame?

201
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,279
The two proposals
is indeed highly similar,

202
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,480
but Mr. Zhou's
is more complete and organized.

203
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,090
Its execution feasibility
and promotional strength are stronger.

204
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,159
In comparison,

205
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,480
your proposal

206
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,919
is just an undeveloped
conceptual framework.

207
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,320
Sorry.

208
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,600
Mr. Zhou

209
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,000
indeed did better this time.

210
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,762
(Jinxin Food Co. Ltd)

211
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,879
Mr. Zhou is indeed
Jinxin's all-round talent.

212
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,159
It's only been a week,

213
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,000
and the cup instant noodles are a hit.

214
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,559
Unlike some who talk big

215
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,320
but end up admitting defeat
when it comes to actual skills.

216
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,240
Where's my desk?

217
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,039
Isn't it over there?

218
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,639
(Toilet)
Qin Jiamin.

219
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,530
- Zhuang Yan, what are you doing?
- Ms. Zhuang.

220
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,720
You dragged my desk so far.

221
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,519
Aren't you tired?

222
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,200
Who was it that bragged
they could beat Guolong Food?

223
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,559
But she herself is useless

224
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,879
and now tries to blame others?

225
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,080
If I were you,

226
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,960
I'd just leave.

227
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,480
Don't argue with her.

228
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,399
Ms. Qin.

229
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,990
