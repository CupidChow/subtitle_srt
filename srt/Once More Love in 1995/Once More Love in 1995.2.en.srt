Are you really Yan?

25
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,040
Of course.

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,760
Remember the time when I was seven,

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,120
and you were six?

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,519
We went to the amusement park.

29
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,719
You were holding a milk candy,

30
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,120
and you dropped it.

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,840
You cried like a baby.

32
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,159
You forgot?

33
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:18,039
Yan,

34
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,199
it really is you.

35
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,039
It's been so long.

36
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,439
I've almost forgotten you.

37
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,759
(Luckily, my mom told me)

38
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,400
(this anecdote about her cousin.)

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,640
We haven't met for so long.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,110
It's great to see you again.

41
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,840
Why don't I move in with you,

42
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,120
and we can have fun again?

43
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:31,912
Sure.

44
00:02:31,912 --> 00:02:32,592
No!

45
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:35,039
(I almost forgot.)

46
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,400
(After Grandpa passed away,)

47
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,919
(Mom moved in with the Qins.)

48
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,240
(I must stay here)

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,400
(to defend her from these bullies.)

50
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,240
Sorry, Qin.

51
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,719
I should have consulted you.

52
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,599
It's not your fault.

53
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,159
Shanshan,

54
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,599
from the day you moved in here,

55
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,240
I've treated you like family.

56
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,960
But we don't know who she is,

57
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,159
and she has violent tendencies.

58
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,439
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,639
There must have been
some sort of misunderstanding.

60
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,719
Qin...

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,560
You're calling me Qin?

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,800
Do I even know you?

63
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,439
I know you.

64
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,840
Qin...

65
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:20,976
Shanshan, I'm embarrassed to say this,

66
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:23,319
but I fell in love with Qin
on first sight.

67
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:25,487
He's the reason I want to move in.

68
00:03:25,487 --> 00:03:27,787
Qin, let me move in.

69
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:29,919
It's a perfect arrangement.

70
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,280
Let go of me!

71
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,680
Qin,

72
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,237
just let Yan stay here.

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,000
(Qin Mo.)

74
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,280
(Prepare to die.)

75
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,680
Your skin is flawless.

76
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,599
It's so smooth and tender,

77
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,960
like a baby's.

78
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,280
Your hands are silky too.

79
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,719
So soft and tender.

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,919

81
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,479
and the rich young lady in Haicheng.

82
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,919
How could you be so pretty?

83
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,280
No, you're prettier than me.

84
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,159
Is that so?

85
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,040
I don't think so.

86
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,519

00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:46,519
I'm serious about us.

188
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,221
She's your only family,

189
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:49,420
so I need to win her favor.

190
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,279
I have you,

191
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,519
Qin,

192
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,080
and now, Yan.

193
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:54,912
How nice.

199
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,820
Zhang Guolong is launching
a price war at all costs

200
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,860
just to take over
our market presence in Haicheng.

201
00:11:23,162 --> 00:11:24,282
If this goes on,

202
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,990
our market share in Haicheng
would plummet.

203
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,200
Okay.

204
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:31,279
Hello, Mr. Qin.

205
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,399
I heard you're hiring.

206
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,120
You've failed the interview.

207
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:41,759
Why?

208
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,000
No particular reason.

209
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,120
You can leave now.

210
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,559
Personal vendetta, huh?

211
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,039
Since you know about our vendetta,

212
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,200
how dare you come?

213
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:57,840
Li,

214
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,320
pass this to the sales department.

215
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:03,671
Mr. Qin.

216
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,240
If I can improve Jinxin's sales,

217
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,799
you're going to give me the job, okay?

218
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,200
Ten days.

219
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,679
I will increase the sales
of Jinxin's instant noodles by 10%.

220
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,879
In one month,
we'll take down Guolong Food.

221
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,679
If I can pull that off,

222
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:17,512
make me the manager
of Jinxin's sales department,

223
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:19,191
as well as a 5% commission of our sales.

224
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,039
If I fail,

225
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,383
I won't appear in front of you again.

226
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,440
Li.

227
00:12:31,962 --> 00:12:33,200
Give her a copy.

228
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,399
Thanks.

229
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:40,720
(Zhuang Yan.)

230

(Let's see what tricks
you have in your bag.)

231

(Resume: Zhuang Yan)

232
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,440
Mr. Zhou is young, successful

233
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,600
and so humble.

234
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
We managed to enter the North China market

235
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,440
all thanks to you.

236
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,320
We can bear witness to that.

237
00:12:58,519 --> 00:12:59,840
Thank you for your support.

238
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,950
We entered the North China
market so quickly

239
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:04,159
because of everyone's hard work.

240
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,679
I was just doing my job.

241
00:13:07,137 --> 00:13:08,816
I feel like I don't deserve

242
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,800
having this celebratory party
in my name.

(How could I forget him?)

246
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:23,225
Without guidance
and support from Mr. Qin,

247
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,620
as well as
my fellow colleagues' hard work,

248
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,350
I wouldn't have achieved
what I have now.

249
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,120
Here's to everyone.

250
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,519
