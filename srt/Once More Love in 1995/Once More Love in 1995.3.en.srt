23
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:45,538
Hello.

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,000
(Congratulations to Mr. Zhou)
We haven't met.

25
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:48,959
You are?

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,359
I am Zhuang Yan,
Jinxin's next Sales Manager.

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,079
I'm also Shanshan's cousin.

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,159
I am Zhou Zeyang,
the current Sales Manager.

29
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,359
Mr. Qin didn't tell me

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,959
he found

31
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,120
a new Sales Manager.

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,639
He didn't have the heart
to tell you directly.

33
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,987
After all, you are

34
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:16,560
the boyfriend of the daughter
of the previous Director.

35
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,960
You're a lucky man, Mr. Zhou.

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,520
You have good looks.

37
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,700
I wonder how much Shanshan has done

38
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,080
to make this party happen.

39
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,960
Ms. Zhuang,

40
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,039
do we have some sort
of misunderstanding?

41
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,650
I love Shanshan,

42
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,560
but as a man,

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,919
I won't let the woman I love
get insulted by rumors.

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,879
I came here to prove

45
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,612
that I can make her happy

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,879
with my own hard work.

47
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,560
Mr. Zhou, if you want to prove yourself,

48
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,719
let's make a bet.

49
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,479
Whoever sets a higher sales record

50
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:56,162
will stay here as Sales Manager.

51
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,479
If you win,

52
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,199
no one would accuse you of nepotism.

53
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,560
If you lose,

54
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,120
get out of Jinxin

55
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,719
and stay away from Shanshan.

56
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:06,520
Well?

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,560
Challenge accepted?

58
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:12,960
Very well.

59
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,560
I can read palms, you know.

60
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:18,960
Mr. Zhou,

61
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,060
there's a breakage at the intersection
between your love line and career line.

62
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,840
I reckon

63
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,439
something bad will happen
because of a romantic fling.

64
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,080
Stay away from women.

65
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,560
Who's there?

66
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,919
Mr. Qin.

67
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,560
What did Mr. Zhou do

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,840
to make you beat him up?

69
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,280
Mr. Qin, did I offend you?

70
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,360
You can tell me.

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,240
Tell him.

72
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,519
Mr. Zhou, are you okay?

73
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,120
Should we call the police?

74
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,639
I can be an eyewitness.

75
00:04:25,562 --> 00:04:26,519
Zhuang Yan.

76
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,480
Don't try to threaten me.

77
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,720
It's up to the victim to decide.

78
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,160
Zeyang.

79
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,839
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,360
I thought you were someone else.

81
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,720
Get yourself checked at the hospital.

82
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:44,275
I'll pay the bill.

83
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,959
Remember to get a checkup.

84
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,762
Stop dragging me, Qin.

85
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:58,400
Pack your bags and get out of my house.

86
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,160
I was just joking.

87
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,560
You're a magnanimous man.

88
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,100
You wouldn't mind, right?

89
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,720
Leave now.

90
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,839
Shanshan, you're finally back.

91
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,079
What's wrong with Yan?

92
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,360
It's not Qin's fault.

93
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,920
I was the one who got too clingy.

94
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,279
Qin,

95
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,439
you don't have to explain to Shanshan.

96
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,040
I'll leave.

97
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,839
Shanshan is also living under your roof.

98
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:29,511
She doesn't have to take me in.

99
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:32,022
I'll just live on the streets

100
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,319
and sleep in the park.

101
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,720
I don't mind getting bullied
by those ruffians,

102
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,839
as long as it makes you happy.

103
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:41,075
Qin.

104
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,375
I'm leaving.

105
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,040
Take care of yourself.

106
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,240
May you find true love one day.

107
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,360
Qin,

108
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,712
I don't know what Yan did,

109
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,319
but I'm her only family in Haicheng.

110
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,079
Can you let her stay for another night?

111
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,759
Tomorrow.

112
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,319
We'll move out tomorrow.

113
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,000
Fine.

114
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,839
You win.

115
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,079
You don't need to leave.

116
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,319
Stay here with Shanshan.

117
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,160
You can keep each other company.

118
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,120
Thank you, Qin.

119
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,759
Let's go.

120
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,879
Qin, you're the best.

121
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,000
Huh?

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,920
Why the sudden work trip?

123
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,560
It was a last-minute decision.

124
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,720
I can't help it.

125
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,040
I'll go with you.

126
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,079
I can take care of you.

127
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,040
Sure.

128
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,920
Give me your passport,

129
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,260
and I'll arrange for your ticket.

130
00:06:34,475 --> 00:06:35,076
Passport?

131
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:35,720
Yeah.

132
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,576
We're performing overseas.

133
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,959
Didn't you know that?

134
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,879
Of course I know,

135
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,759
but I don't have a passport.

136
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,879
I'm afraid you can't go, then.

137
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,160
It's okay, I'll skip this round.

138
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,959
I'll wait for you at home.

139
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,639
I'll keep an eye on everything.

140
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:57,759
Don't worry.

141
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
I've asked Qin to take care of you.

142
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,319
He won't make you leave.

143
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:03,037
Yeah.

144
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,079
Let me pack my bags.

145
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:05,835
Go ahead.

146
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,120
Okay.

147
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,759
Do you know why Shanshan
has to leave suddenly?

148
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,319
Because you don't have a passport,

149
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:14,720
so you can't follow her.

150
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,920
I knew it was you

151
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,480
who sent Shanshan away.

152
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,439
What are you thinking?

153
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,480
What am I thinking?

154
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:31,040
I should be asking you that.

155
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,360
You're not Zhuang Yan.

156
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:36,120
So,

157
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,040
who are you?

158
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:45,759
Sigh.

159
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,639
Mr. Qin, you're paranoid.

160
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,879
Who else could I be, if not Zhuang Yan?

161
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,680
Zhuang Yan is a village girl.

162
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,990
She couldn't possibly
speak Mandarin so fluently.

163
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,879
Thank you for your compliment.

164
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,040
I mastered Mandarin while working.

165
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,040
This is in line with national policy,

166
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,040
and you're using it against me?

167
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,240
You can change your speech,

168
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,079
but not your physical characteristics.

169
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,890
Zhuang Yan did a lot of farm work,

170
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,040
yet your hands are free of calluses.

171
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,279
How do you explain that?

172
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,720
(He found a loophole for real.)

173
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,320
Mr. Qin, are you looking down
on village peasants?

174
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,759
Farming is automated now.

175
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,480
No one carries a hoe anymore.

176
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,240
The same can be said about you.

177
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,679
You were a street ruffian,

178
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,480
but you're now the mighty Mr. Qin,

179
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,770
Director of Jinxin Food Co. Ltd.

180
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,840
I know you're good at debating.

181
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:49,720
Very well.

182
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,519
Even if your arguments stand...

183
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,840
Show me your ID.

184
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,399
Fine.

185
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,639
I admit.

186
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,937
I'm not Zhuang Yan.

187
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,720
Shanshan,

188
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,879
Qin wants me to leave.

189
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,960
I'm telling you,

190
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,240
I will find the real Zhuang Yan.

191
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:31,279
Before that,

192
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,919
you'd better behave yourself.

193
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,919
Don't let me find faults with you.

194
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,360
If there's nothing else,

195
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,679
I'd like to retire for the night.

196
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:40,812
Good night.

197
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,559
(Jinxin Food Co. Ltd.)
Since early this month,

198
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,240
Guolong Food has been launching
massive promotions in Haicheng.

199
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,919
Our market share in Haicheng

200
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,720
has dropped to 39.2%.

201
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,279
However, our market shares
in Northeast and North China

202
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,400
have significantly increased.

203
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,759
Mr. Zhou is rising up
to Ms. Zhuang's challenge.

204
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,679
He's working with
a new, local supermarket,

205
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,039
and has hired many salespeople.

206
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,480
It's only been two months
since he joined Jinxin,

207
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,639
but his sales records
exceed those of last quarter.

208
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,759
He's a gem.

209
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,919
What about Zhuang Yan?

210
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,279
What has she been up to?

211
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,559
Ms. Zhuang? Nothing much.

212
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,760
All she does is visiting
the printing factory every day.

213
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,960
Mr. Qin.

214
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,559
I think it's obvious

215
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,039
who will win the bet.

216
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,639
Don't jump to conclusions.

217
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,039
Who knows, Zhuang Yan
may pull a dirty trick off.

218
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,000
Mr. Zhou.

219
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,120
Not only have we controlled

220
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,360
30% of North China market,

221
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,759
we're even getting calls from distributors
in three northeast provinces' Hashi.

222
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,759
Meanwhile, no one has seen
Zhuang Yan working.

223
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,679
She probably heard of our triumph

224
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,840
and knew she's losing,

225
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,039
so she's hiding in an alley
to wipe her tears off.

226
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,320
Winning or losing doesn't matter to me.

227
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,320
Even without the bet,

228
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,679
I'd still perform my duties.

229
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,559
What's wrong?

230
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,679
Zhuang Yan is up to something big.

231
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,279
Hello, everyone.

232
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:15,799
I am your host, Fang.

233
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,399

234
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,639
first ever noodle eating contest!

235
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,039
Let's take a look at our contestants.

236
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,960
All three of them

237
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,200

238
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:35,440

239
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:37,960
Let's cheer for our contestants!

240
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,039
Quick!

241
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,679
Go!

242
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,840
He's finished eating!

243
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,480
Look at him!

244
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,240
He's full! Hurry up!

245
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,639
22 packs!

246
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,120
Time's up!

247
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,320
We have a winner!

248
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,559
Hello to everyone.

249
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,720
To thank all of you

250
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,759
for supporting Jinxin Food,

251
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,519
(Jinxin Food)
we're partnering with designers

252
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,759
to create these
Journey to the West trading cards.

253
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,360
For every purchase of
Jinxin Instant Noodles,

254
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,720
you get to collect a card,
and if you get all 81 of them,

255
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
you will win a mystery prize!

256
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,240
(To think these cards)

257
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,879
(can boost our noodles sales so much.)

258
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,360
(What in the world)

259
00:12:52,187 --> 00:12:53,667
(is Zhuang Yan thinking?)

260
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Don't challenge my bottom line,

261
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,919
and don't get close to Jinxin,

262
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,480
unless...

263
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,159
You want to die.
