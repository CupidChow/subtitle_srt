Mr. Qin,

24
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:50,600
Jinxin's instant noodles were
all sold out at the supermarket today.

25
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,120
It's time for you
to fulfill your promise.

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,560
Tomorrow!

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,450
Announce to everyone that I'm the
Sales Department's GM tomorrow!

28
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:19,312
(Jinxin)

29
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:20,520
(Jinxin Food Co. Ltd)

30
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,479
Everyone, from today onward,

31
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,520
Ms. Zhuang Yan

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,400
is officially the Sales Department's GM.

33
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,000
Please give her a round of applause.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Welcome.

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,240
Mr. Li, all of us
are old-timers at Jinxin.

36
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,680
We managed to reach
where we are step by step.

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,680
I know Ms. Zhuang has
achieved some remarkable results.

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,520
But she was promoted to a
leadership role right after joining us.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,840
I'm afraid everyone isn't convinced.

40
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:47,080
Your name is Ji Hong, right?

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,879
That's right.

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,400
Stop trying to apply pressure on me
with your experience.

43
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,462
Although you've been in
the Sales Department for many years,

44
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:53,919
you didn't achieve anything remarkable.

45
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:54,800
You!

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,879
Don't think that I don't know.

47
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,680
I saw you flirting
with Mr. Qin all the time.

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm sure there's some padding
in the sales figure.

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,680
I refuse to accept this.

50
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,000
Do you need me to send you
the financial statements?

51
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,639
The Sales Department's performance

52
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,680
in Haicheng has been declining
for the past two months.

53
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,560
But there was a 30% improvement in sales

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,479
right after we hired Ms. Zhuang.

55
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,319
If you think you're capable enough,

56
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,919
you may assume her position as the GM.

57
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,199
Since no one has any objections,

58
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,120
I'll be making the call here now.

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,639
As for Mr. Zhou,

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,840
please fulfill your promise

61
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,879
and get out of Jinxin.

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,199
I don't agree with it.

63
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:48,879
It's only been a few days since I left,

64
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,800
yet there's one more parasite
in the house now, huh?

65
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,479
Both you and your sister,
Zhuang Shanshan, are just as detestable.

66
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,479
I assume you must be Mr. Qin's sister.

67
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,199
I suppose you like
to eat stinky tofu, huh?

68
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,520
What's with the stinky mouth?

69
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,919
Enough.

70
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,639
We're at the company.

71
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,439
Both of you should stop.

72
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,479
Mo,

73
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,680
Mr. Zhou opened up
the North China market for us

74
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,800
not long after joining Jinxin.

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,439
He's a rare talent.

76
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,199
If he leaves Jinxin

77
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,680
and joins our competitor,

78
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,120
it'll be a huge blow to our company.

79
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,920
But he should be a good sport.

80
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,450
I don't care about your bet.

81
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,600
I only know that Jinxin isn't dumb
enough to offer talents to our rivals.

82
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,279
One lucky break
doesn't count for anything.

83
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,480
Zhuang Yan,

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,879
if you're that capable,

85
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,199
why don't you make a bet with me?

86
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,839
If you win,

87
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,519
not only will you remain
as Sales Department's GM,

88
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,519
but Mr. Zhou and I
will also be at your disposal.

89
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,600
Jiamin,

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,199
what's with all that nonsense?

91
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,879
Nonsense?

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,879
Mo,

93
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,360
how could you recruit a woman
of unknown background like her?

94
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,680
Even if she's Zhuang Shanshan's cousin,

95
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,920
don't you think we should put a stop

96
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,439
to the relatives of the Zhuang family
sponging off our company?

97
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,775
Jinxin isn't a welfare home, you know?

98
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,480
That's enough.

99
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,519
Stop right now.

100
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,279
Fine.

101
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,839
I accept your challenge.

102
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
I'll crush you,

103
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,240
just like how I crushed Zhou Zeyang.

104
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,800
Don't think that I have no idea.

105
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,800
You should look at yourself
in the mirror

106
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,480
before trying to seduce my brother.

107
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,399
Take your luggage with you

108
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,319
and scram.

109
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,639
I'm talking to you!

110
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,240
Don't you know basic courtesy?

111
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:45,879
I'm telling you to scram!

112
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,600
If only I could.

113
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,560
Your brother was the one

114
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,839
who wanted me to stay.

115
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,319
I can't bear to see him grow old alone

116
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,399
and lead a desolate life.

117
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,519
Listen,

118
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,319
as long as I'm around,

119
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,000
I won't let you
marry into the Qin family.

120
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,000
You're just his sister, yet you're
acting like an evil mother-in-law.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,920
You should drop the pretense.

122
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,040
Be a good girl,

123
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,600
and call me Sister-in-law.

124
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,079
What a shameless person.

125
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,720
I'll show you no mercy
if you remain here!

126
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,560
Oh, is that so?

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,399
Tell me, then.
How can a weak girl like you

128
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,879
show me no mercy?

129
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,480
Mo,

130
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,879
she did it on purpose.

131
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,279
If I hadn't dodged in time,

132
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,050
it wouldn't just be
my leg that's hurt now.

133
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:31,633
She was trying to harm me.

134
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,639
Mo, she's the culprit.

135
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,160
Buddy,

136
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:40,720
I didn't need to wait for us to be alone

137
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,079
for me to push you
to the ground, you know?

138
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,720
Mo, look at her!

139
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,839
She's still trying to deny it!

140
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,279
Enough already.

141
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,800
Tell me.

142
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,319
What happened?

143
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:51,519
I have nothing to do
with her leg injury.

144
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,519
She can only blame herself
for being evil and dumb.

145
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,399
Zhuang Yan,

146
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,879
Jiamin's already injured.

147
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,720
Even if you wish to cause trouble,

148
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,920
you shouldn't go too far.

149
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,839
Since you've already determined
that I'm at fault here,

150
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,279
you should just jump to your conclusion.

151
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,120
There's no need
to go through all the trouble

152
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,000
just to bring me here.

153
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,759
You and your sister condemn people
without listening to the entire story

154
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,800
anyway.

155
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,759
Mo, just look at
how arrogant she looked!

156
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:20,687
(Newspapers and Magazines,
Long-distance Calls)

157
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,399
Hello, is this Yan?

158
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,839
How have you been lately?

159
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,720
I'm doing great.

160
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:31,800
What about you?

161
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,319
My performance went well.

162
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:35,480
I'll head over once
the performance is over.

163
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,720
I even bought some presents
for you and Mr. Qin.

164
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,079
Don't be that nice to the Qin family.

165
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,120
They aren't worth it.

166
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,839
What happened?

167
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,959
Did you and Mr. Qin argue again?

168
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,519
That's not it.

169
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,040
I just missed you.

170
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,639
You're still thinking about Mr. Qin
even though you're not here.

171
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,537
I... I'm jealous of him.

172
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,879
Yan, I still miss you the most.

173
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,720
I'll head back very soon.

174
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,519
Okay.

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,920
I'll wait for your return.

176
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,000
The world is a wonderful place.

177
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,720
There's no need to get angry
over a certain person.

178
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,399
I need to stay happy

179
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:13,720
and fight for Mom.

180
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,399
I will definitely get the dirt
on Qin Jiamin and Zhou Zeyang,

181
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,480
that dirty pair.

182
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,639
Thank you.

183
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,840
Did you come here alone?

184
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,240
Do you need me to teach you
how to roller skate?

185
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,120
Scram.

186
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,679
What are you doing?

187
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,039
You're being shy, aren't you?

188
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,000
Stay away from her.

189
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,399
You want to rescue
the damsel in distress?

190
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
You look well-educated.

191
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,440
I just wonder if you have a sturdy body.

192
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:22,440
Go ahead if you wish to die.

193
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,559
Not bad.

194
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,799
What are you guys doing?

195
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,600
Scram if you're
not here to roller skate!

196
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,960
Ms. Qin,

197
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,200
are you okay?

198
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,679
Don't think that I'll be grateful
to you because you helped me.

199
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,120
I hate everyone
related to Zhuang Shanshan,

200
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,120
including you.

201
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,879
If Shanshan has offended you in any way,

202
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,519
please let me apologize
to you on her behalf.

203
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,600
You helped me out when
Zhuang Yan tried to cause me trouble.

204
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,639
I haven't had the chance
to thank you yet.

205
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,679
No need for that.

206
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,000
Watch out!

207
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,679
Ms. Qin,

208
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,399
you have a sprained ankle.

209
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,720
You shouldn't roller skate today.

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
Mind your own business.

211
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,519
I haven't even started yet.

212
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,039
Just sit down.

213
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,399
Here?

214
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,120
(She pretended to sprain her ankle)

215
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,879
(and frame me
in front of Qin Mo yesterday.)

216
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,440
(But now, she's having
a private date with Zhou Zeyang.)

217
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,720
This must be a medical miracle.

218
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,919
Qin Mo really ought
to see his sister's masterful acting.

219
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,399
Kid!

220
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,279
Do you want to earn some pocket money?

221
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,240
Yeah.

222
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,200
Later, you...

223
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,879
Hey, wait up.

224
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:29,120
Remember to tell him

225
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,399
that his sister
sprained her other ankle as well.

226
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:32,915
