=Episode 1=

23
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,400
Your brother's not coming.

24
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,480
He's never thought much of me.

25
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,640
I know you're not the kind
of man he says you are,

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,239
someone who'd chase money
and walk away when things got hard.

27
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,560
One day, he'll see your worth.

28
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,000
But I have a bad feeling.

29
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,959
Your perfect daughter

30
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,680
is not going to show up and
cause trouble again, is she?

31
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,120
Your brother sent her overseas.

32
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,639
She isn't here.

33
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,560
(My name is Zhuang Manying.)

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,120
(When I was six,)

35
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:19,080
(my dad attached himself to the Qin
family's daughter for power and status.)

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,159
(The Qin family even seized Jinxin,
the business my grandpa left behind.)

37
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,919
(My mom was driven from place to place,
until depression finally took her life.)

38
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,120
(Today is that wretched
couple's wedding anniversary.)

39
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:33,280
(And it's also the anniversary
of my mom's death.)

40
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,319
(Zhou Zeyang, Qin Jiamin,)

41
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,680
(do you still remember my mother?)

42
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:45,800
Zhuang Manying,

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,240
do you really have to
humiliate me like this?

44
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,120
Humiliate you?

45
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,639
When you drove my mother to her death,

46
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,879
did you ever feel ashamed?

47
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,000
Zhuang Manying, I've been far
too lenient with you!

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,719
Let go of me!

49
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,199
Have you had enough?

50
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,400
Are you trying to make
tomorrow's headlines?

51
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,680
You can't take it anymore?

52
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,599
If the media found out that you,

53
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,360
harbored filthy thoughts

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,680
about your own niece,

55
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,719
that would be

56
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,639
the real headline tomorrow.

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,479
You have no sense of shame.

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,159
Where are your manners?

59
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:32,759
Shame and manners

60
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,280
are things parents teach.

61
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,960
Unfortunately, my mother was
driven to her death by all of you,

62
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,439
and my father never had
those qualities to begin with.

63
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,240
Zhuang Manying,

64
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,680
my patience with you has its limits.

65
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,080
Don't test me.

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,039
I've booked your ticket.

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,000
Once you leave the country,

68
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,159
don't ever

69
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,000
come back.

70
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,120
Qin Mo,

71
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,439
you seized Jinxin, the company
my grandfather founded.

72
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,159
Your walls are covered in
pictures of your own niece.

73
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,360
And you dare lecture me
about shame and manners?

74
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,400
Don't you find that ridiculous?

75
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,159
What are you trying to do?

76
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,800
You stood by while your sister
destroyed my mother's life.

77
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,920
As long as I'm alive,

78
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,519
I won't let any of you off the hook.

79
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,360
Zhuang Manying,

80
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,687
don't push me.

81
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:30,800
And stay away from Jinxin for good.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,759
Unless...

83
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,600
You have a death wish.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,079
Mom, look at all these milk candies.

85
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:48,375
(Late mother, Zhuang Shanshan)

86
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:52,879
I'm so sorry.

87
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,959
I used to be nothing
but a burden to you.

88
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,000
If there is another life,

89
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,000
I promise I won't let you suffer again.

90
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:06,160
(Late mother, Zhuang Shanshan)

91
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,680
(Qin Mo seized the Jinxin
my grandfather left for you.)

92
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:10,816
(He drove you to your death.)

93
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,480
(I swear,)

94
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,120
(as long as I'm still alive,)

95
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,319
(I will never stop fighting him.)

96
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:37,000
MY.

97
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,519
Qin Mo...

98
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,480
Qin Mo!

99
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,675
Don't push me.

100
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,759
Unless...

101
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:21,950
You have a death wish.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,800
(Mom,)

103
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,480
(I wanted to destroy the Qin family,)

104
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,600
(to get justice for you.)

105
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,120
(But I never expected)

106
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,639
(I would also die by their hands.)

107
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,959
(If there is a next life,)

108
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,600
(I will make Qin Mo
and all of them pay.)

109
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,360
(Year 2025)
Zhuang Manying, have you had enough?

110
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,150
(Year 2025)
I'm your niece.

111
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,700
How could you spy on me
with such disgusting intentions?

112
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,175
(Year 2002)
You illegitimate daughter.

113
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,300
(Year 2002)
Get out of Qin family.

114
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:52,160
(Year 2002)
You're nothing but trouble.

115
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,887
(Year 2001)
If you weren't the Jinxin heiress,

116
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:56,720
(Year 2001)
why would I ever have been with you?

117
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,519
(Year 2001)
Don't try to trap me with a child.

118
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,360
(Year 2001)
She's just an unwanted illegitimate daughter.

119
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,319
Zhuang Shanshan, what right
do you have to try and steal my man?

120
00:07:03,387 --> 00:07:04,759
(Year 2000)
Qin Mo is my brother.

121
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,879
(Year 2000)
Zeyang loves me.

122
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,025
You and your daughter
should just go die.

123
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,160
Am I dead?

124
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,560
Is this the underworld?

125
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,240
There's someone playing
snooker in the underworld?

126
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,079
Qin Mo...

127
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,480
I'm dead. I'm not afraid of you anymore.

128
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,200
You murderer!

129
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,759
Who are you? Get off me!

130
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,279
You murderer!

131
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,279
Everyone else, out!

132
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,360
What's going on?

133
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,519
Do the underworld have gangs too?

134
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,279
Qin Mo,

135
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,399
what kind of show are you
two putting on in my pool hall?

136
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,759
Is she your sweetheart?

137
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,399
Sweetheart?

138
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,662
Dude, were you killed
by sheer stupidity?

139
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,000
Trying to scare me?

140
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,200
We're all ghosts here.

141
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,039
I'm not afraid of you.

142
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:47,162
If you don't shut up,

143
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:48,162
I'll make you.

144
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,879
I'm dead. You think I'm scared of you?

145
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:50,799
I won't shut up.

146
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,639
Not a chance.

147
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,840
Qin Mo,

148
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,039
let me give you
a little piece of advice.

149
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,440
The waters in Haicheng run deep,

150
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,200
too deep for a little boat
like you to navigate.

151
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,039
I'd quit

152
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,212
while you're ahead.

153
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:02,943
Scram!

154
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,137
Got no manners, huh?

155
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,519
I've been too nice to you, haven't I?

156
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,787
You,

157
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:08,639
go slap him.

158
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,440
Slap him hard!

159
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,287
Get him!

160
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:24,720
Hit him!

161
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:29,919
Get him!

162
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,120
Hang on.

163
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,837
Get him!

164
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,200
A dead person doesn't feel pain.

165
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,075
(Year 1995)

166
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,251
Year 1995?

167
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,440
I've come back to 1995?

168
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,720
So Qin Mo is alive too?

169
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,559
I couldn't take
on the Qin Mo in the future.

170
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,639
But the Qin Mo from 30 years ago?

171
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,240
I can get rid of him now.

172
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:55,159
Sorry, that was an accident.

173
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,399
Qin Mo,

174
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:07,399
I'm warning you, get out of Haicheng.

175
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,399
Or...

176
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,799
I'll kill your little sweetheart.

177
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:11,825
Hey.

178
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,639
Are you my little sweetheart?

179
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:15,200
Darn it!

180
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,039
I'd rather die than be with you.

181
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,159
You hear that?

182
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,320
She wants nothing to do with me.

183
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:26,720
You're a fast learner.

184
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,559
Go. Go rip

185
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,879
his balls off.

186
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,519
That's right.

187
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,960
I learned it from you.

188
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,960
Ah!

189
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,450
Qin Mo,

190
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,039
consider that my return gift.

191
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,159
Rest in peace.

192
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,200
May you reincarnate soon.

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,799
You...

194
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,240
You're safe?

195
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,200
Why did you call me a murderer?

196
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,240
Because you are a murderer.

197
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,840
Who did I kill?

198
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,639
Me.

199
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,039
I killed you?

200
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,039
Then what are you now?

201
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,720
Not only are you vicious,

202
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,840
but you're also glib,

203
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,039
speaking nonsense.

204
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,639
I'll give you one last chance
to tell the truth.

205
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,799
Who are you?

206
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,320
I'm your retribution!

207
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,240
I've never been hit in my life.

208
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,519
Answer my question honestly

209
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,799
while I still have patience for you.

210
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,720
Where did you come from?

211
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,519
What do you want?

212
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,799
And why do you keep
calling me a murderer?

213
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,840
Qin.

214
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:00,879
