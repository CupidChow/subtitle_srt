[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP13]

2
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:06,333
Director, what's going on?

3
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:08,133
Why is there negative news?

4
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,166
That customer in your shop yesterday

5
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:11,466
brought a few reporters.

6
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:13,766
These reporters, to grab attention,

7
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:15,733
say the nastiest things.

8
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,766
So reporters can twist facts?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,533
I'm going to find them now.

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,866
Viewers only want to see what they like.

11
00:00:24,866 --> 00:00:27,299
[They love to stand on moral high ground]

12
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,466
[and condemn so-called sinners.]

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,766
Yes, the online criticism is relentless.

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,066
Someone even sent us

15
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:36,333
some nasty things this morning.

16
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,066
How could this be?

17
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:43,266
If we gave them money back then

18
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:44,466
to smooth things over,

19
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:46,766
would this have happened?

20
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:50,733
No worries. Many don't turn out

21
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:53,133
the way you expect.

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,300
Well, you're caught up in this mess too.

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,766
What do you mean?

24
00:01:00,366 --> 00:01:02,733
From the string of fights on the island

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,000
to the smear campaign against your shop,

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,400
it seems someone is behind all this.

27
00:01:09,766 --> 00:01:10,733
Zhu Group.

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,966
Zhu Group?

29
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,966
What do they do?

30
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,499
Why are they targeting us?

31
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:22,066
[They want to develop Aman Island,]

32
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,066
and we don't want to leave.

33
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,300
So they're forcing us out.

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,066
Since they want us to surrender,

35
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:38,899
[maybe we should just comply.]

36
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,700
Huh?

37
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:43,933
Director, call them to beg for mercy.

38
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,266
You want me to

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,800
play the victim

40
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,500
and then turn the tables?

41
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,800
Sounds good. Let's get ready.

42
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:00,733
Let's go.

43
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,900
Hello everyone, I'm Summer.

44
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:07,966
Today, I'm showing you

45
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:10,999
the true color of a big corporation.

46
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,366
Do you see it?

47
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:16,466
Zhu Group.

48
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,700
So,

49
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,499
you've come to your senses?

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,533
DM Zhu,

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,700
[you sent those customers, didn't you?]

52
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:28,699
[You controlled the media, right?]

53
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,166
[You can't just]

54
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,566
disregard our lives for your own gain.

55
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,133
Sign this,

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,133
and it'll be good for all of us.

57
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,466
Miss Zhu, please, I beg you.

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,700
Hundreds of families live here.

59
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:46,266
If we leave, we won't survive.

60
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,366
Please, I beg you.

61
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,866
Could you help me by recording this

62
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:52,099
and sharing it later?

63
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,000
What is it?

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,933
Please, everyone, share this.

65
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:56,733
Wait...

66
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:59,766
Who is it? What? Shen Jinchuan?

67
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,600
What are you doing?

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,466
What's going on?

69
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:10,266
What?

70
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:11,899
Wait,

71
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,333
Miss Zhu.

72
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,133
Miss Zhu.

73
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:19,766
If you're going to kill me, do it!

74
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,733
Why did you pull me away?

75
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,866
It makes it look like I'm scared of her.

76
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Criminals will hide their faces.

77
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,800
Yet you're off the beaten path.

78
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,999
True, you have a good point.

79
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,266
How did you know I was here?

80
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,366
It's all over the news.

81
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:06,699
I came to congratulate you.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,200
Really?

83
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:13,866
Now they can't twist the truth.

84
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,933
How about we have dinner together?

85
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,733
You promised to make me coffee before,

86
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,199
but I ended up being a laborer again.

87
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,866
You're so good to me.

88
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:38,999
Alright, fine.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,933
Let's go, my treat.

90
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:52,266
Zhu...

91
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,666
[Zhu Jinhao?]

92
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,600
You shouldn't be alive.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,466
Why are you back so late?

94
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,866
[You didn't reply to my messages.]

95
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,699
[Have you eaten?]

96
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,966
Boss, why so many questions?

97
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,200
I've eaten.

98
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,666
My phone died, see?

99
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,499
Were you waiting for me?

100
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,500
Were you worried about me?

101
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,799
Hey, did you eat?

102
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,900
No way, you really haven't eaten?

103
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:39,066
Stop bothering me.

104
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,166
I'll make the food for you.

105
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:47,266
Go ahead.

106
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:02,866
I had dinner with Shen Jinchuan tonight

107
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,400
to repay him for his help before.

108
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,599
But

109
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,666
he asked me

110
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,100
if I wanted to regain my memory.

111
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Lin Qingyi,

112
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,933
do you want me to regain my memory?

113
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:23,466
Wouldn't you still be you,

114
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,999
even if you did?

115
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,333
You're right.

116
00:06:31,066 --> 00:06:32,333
I am who I am,

117
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
no matter what.
