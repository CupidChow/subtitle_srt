1
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:11,326
Boss.

2
00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:13,793
You want me to pay for your clothes?

3
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,226
Do you think I'm made of money?

4
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:18,926
We don't want to embarrass you.

5
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:20,726
I didn't even ask you to go.

6
00:00:20,793 --> 00:00:21,759
Well,

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,660
we don't want to go either,

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,326
but she offered too much money.

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:27,393
Yeah.

10
00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:32,359
Use my next month's salary.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,593
And her? She doesn't have any money.

12
00:00:44,626 --> 00:00:45,559
It's on me.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,160
Alright.

14
00:00:48,826 --> 00:00:50,626
Wait outside, I'll change my clothes.

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,160
Thank you, Jia.

16
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:02,526
Wow!

17
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:05,459
Hi there, can I help you with anything?

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,160
[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP08]

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,360
Summer, can you grab that one for me?

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,226
- Which one?
- That one.

21
00:01:10,826 --> 00:01:12,126
- This one?
- Yes.

22
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,460
- You sure?
- Yep, that one.

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,526
Hey, if I wear this

24
00:01:18,526 --> 00:01:23,041
and you wear that,

25
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:23,726
we'll be the twin flowers of Aman Island.

26
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:25,826
Me, wear this?

27
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:27,326
Yeah.

28
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:28,626
Does it look good?

29
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,726
Jia,

30
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:34,426
I think only you

31
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:35,426
can pull off that style.

32
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:36,526
I can't.

33
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:39,759
Really? Oh, don't be sad, Summer.

34
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:42,659
I'm sure you'll find your style.

35
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:45,759
I'll try.

36
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:47,526
Watch out for my dress.

37
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:53,159
Try this one.

38
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:54,226
This one?

39
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,660
Isn't that one too plain?

40
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,260
Are you trying to make a scene?

41
00:02:01,726 --> 00:02:02,859
You're right.

42
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:05,059
Jia, we're going for work,

43
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,593
so let's not be too showy.

44
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:08,626
I'll try this one.

45
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:14,026
Hey, boss,

46
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:15,993
help me pick one too.

47
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:17,593
Pick one for her.

48
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:18,626
Sure.

49
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,326
Miss, how about these two?

50
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:28,793
I'll try both.

51
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,126
Alright, this way.

52
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,060
[Jia,]

53
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,426
[come in and help me.]

54
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:45,426
[Jia?]

55
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,760
[Come help me, Jia.]

56
00:02:54,326 --> 00:02:55,259
My zipper...

57
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:01,126
Where's Jia?

58
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:03,393
She went next door.

59
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:06,426
What's up?

60
00:03:08,126 --> 00:03:10,126
I can't get my zipper up.

61
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:11,993
Can you find someone to help me?

62
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:13,559
I'll help you.

63
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:18,127
I won't look.

64
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:19,926
Who's interested in you anyway?

65
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,060
Like I'm interested in you.

66
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,826
Close your eyes.

67
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,226
I'm turning around.

68
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:43,059
Hey, don't touch randomly. Lower.

69
00:03:44,393 --> 00:03:47,959
Lower. Here.

70
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,560
Done.

71
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:05,993
Thanks.

72
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:13,459
Does it look good?

73
00:04:13,593 --> 00:04:15,559
Yes, it looks fantastic on you.

74
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,326
Let me fix the back hem for you

75
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:18,959
It really suits your style.

76
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:22,826
Qingyi,

77
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:24,326
your fashion sense might not be great,

78
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,926
but you have a good eye.

79
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:26,926
[Summer,]

80
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:29,526
you look amazing in that outfit!

81
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:31,926
- Right? I think so too.
- It suits you perfectly!

82
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:33,426
You look stunning!

83
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:34,426
Yours looks great on you too!

84
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:37,059
That dress is perfect for you!

85
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,193
[I think so too.]

86
00:04:41,193 --> 00:04:42,859
I remember you have a styling service.

87
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,926
Yes, sir.

88
00:04:43,926 --> 00:04:45,993
[Should I arrange a styling session?]

89
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:47,959
Make it quick, we're in a hurry.

90
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,193
Of course. This way. Liu, assist them!

91
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:51,359
- [Yes!]
- [Miss,]

92
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,193
[take this and give it to the stylist.]

93
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:53,859
This way,

94
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,760
please.

95
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:57,193
This way, sir.

96
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,593
Hello, sir. How can I assist you?

97
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,626
Bring out your latest collection.

98
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:10,959
Certainly.

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,160
Please have a seat here.

100
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,726
This way.

101
00:05:14,726 --> 00:05:15,959
Wrap this up for me.

102
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:17,593
Feel free to browse our magazine.

103
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:19,659
Let me know if you need anything.

104
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:20,859
[Excuse me, ma'am.]

105
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:22,959
Just a moment, I need to check something.

106
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:25,259
What?

107
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,993
That can't be right.

108
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,826
Try again.

109
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,226
Hello, what's going on?

110
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:32,226
This lady's card has been frozen.

111
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:33,226
Are you sure you checked it properly?

112
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:34,859
I'm sure, I've tried it several times.

113
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:38,726
Miss, sorry, but your card is frozen.

114
00:05:38,726 --> 00:05:40,793
Do you have another payment method?

115
00:05:41,526 --> 00:05:43,026
Is there no other way?

116
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,460
What kind of store is this?

117
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:46,793
I'm sorry, ma'am.

118
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:55,559
[Excuse me, my card is frozen.]

119
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:57,593
Can you cover the bill for me?

120
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:01,793
Sure, my pleasure.

121
00:06:02,393 --> 00:06:03,359
[Put it on my tab.]

122
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,560
Of course. I'll wrap it up for the lady.

123
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,993
Can I have your contact information?

124
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,659
That way I can transfer the money to you.

125
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:16,993
It's my birthday today.

126
00:06:16,993 --> 00:06:18,993
Care to join me for cake tonight?

127
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:22,593
Sure, I'd be honored.

128
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:24,159
Great, I'll see you then.
