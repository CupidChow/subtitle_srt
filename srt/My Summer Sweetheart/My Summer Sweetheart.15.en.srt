[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP15]

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:09,210
Still asleep?

3
00:00:12,243 --> 00:00:13,043
Here,

4
00:00:13,443 --> 00:00:14,243
a gift.

5
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:16,477
Wow, a gift!

6
00:00:16,477 --> 00:00:17,277
[Yes.]

7
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:18,877
What is it?

8
00:00:18,877 --> 00:00:20,243
[My birthday's already passed.]

9
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:22,443
To celebrate my first paycheck,

10
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:24,643
I got you a little something.

11
00:00:24,643 --> 00:00:27,210
Summer, you're the best!

12
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:29,010
Open it and see if you like it.

13
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:36,010
Summer!

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,143
You always need

15
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:40,376
a nice dress for a date, right?

16
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:42,243
So I got one for you.

17
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:44,410
Look, the size is perfect.

18
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:48,810
Summer, you're the best, right after

19
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,276
my mom and my boss.

20
00:00:51,643 --> 00:00:53,143
I'll hang it in the best spot

21
00:00:53,143 --> 00:00:54,376
in my closet.

22
00:00:54,743 --> 00:00:56,076
Alright, alright, put it away.

23
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:58,677
- [Waiter.]
- Coming.

24
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:00,010
Go on.

25
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:33,077
What are you sneaking around for?

26
00:01:34,077 --> 00:01:36,443
A bracelet I made using coffee beans.

27
00:01:36,443 --> 00:01:38,076
Look, do you like it?

28
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:41,843
Hmm.

29
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:45,077
Just "hmm"? Give it back then.

30
00:01:58,643 --> 00:01:59,543
I like it,

31
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:01,410
I really like it.

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,043
[Excuse me.]

33
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,610
[Jia!]

34
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:19,277
Mr. Lin, I'm really sincere this time.

35
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:27,443
The guests just left. Go clean up.

36
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:29,010
Alright.

37
00:02:37,577 --> 00:02:39,143
Say what you need to say.

38
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:42,810
Do you know her real identity?

39
00:02:43,177 --> 00:02:46,043
[She's Zhu Jinhao, the GM of the Zhu Group]

40
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:49,076
and in charge of the Aman Island project.

41
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:51,576
[Take a guess,]

42
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,243
what will happen when she regains memory?

43
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:59,376
[If she came to talk personally,]

44
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:00,876
I might consider it.

45
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:05,210
Lin Qingyi, don't be stubborn.

46
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:08,876
[Once she remembers, she'll leave you.]

47
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:10,677
With her skills,

48
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,610
she has plenty of ways to deal with you.

49
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,210
I'll handle the cleaning.

50
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:26,643
I've already cleaned up.

51
00:04:01,643 --> 00:04:04,210
[Hey, you finally called.]

52
00:04:04,543 --> 00:04:05,376
Where are you?

53
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:08,376
[I'm at the food street. Come find me.]

54
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,610
Wait for me there.

55
00:04:14,877 --> 00:04:17,477
Lin Qingyi, I'm here.

56
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:25,143
Summer!

57
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:02,043
Summer!

58
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,410
Summer!

59
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,676
[Jinhao, I came to see you.]

60
00:05:31,677 --> 00:05:32,477
[Jinhao?]

61
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:33,976
Coming.

62
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:42,377
Hi.

63
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:48,077
You,

64
00:05:48,477 --> 00:05:49,477
remembered everything?

65
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:54,743
Thanks for taking care of the company.

66
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,943
What's wrong?

67
00:06:00,843 --> 00:06:02,543
Do you remember Summer?

68
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,643
Summer? Who's that?

69
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,176
Should I?

70
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:15,243
Alright then, go home and rest.

71
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:16,677
See you at the office tomorrow.

72
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:22,577
I'll pick you up.

73
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:25,877
Good night.

74
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:41,810
[Zhu Jinhao.]

75
00:06:47,577 --> 00:06:48,477
Who are you?

76
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:50,376
- Security!
- Ms. Zhu,

77
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,010
[I'm returning something to you.]

78
00:07:03,943 --> 00:07:05,010
Now it's back to its rightful owner.

79
00:07:07,977 --> 00:07:09,043
Do we know each other?

80
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:14,743
No.

81
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,010
Let's go.
