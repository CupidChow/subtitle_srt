1
00:00:15,046 --> 00:00:17,279
Alright, I need to go. I'm still looking.

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,080
Okay?

3
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,880
Why isn't she answering?

4
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:04,746
Are you trying to commit suicide again?

5
00:01:05,113 --> 00:01:06,679
What are you doing?

6
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,946
I've been looking for you.

7
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,246
Why?

8
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,160
[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP07]

9
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,180
What's wrong?

10
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:17,446
Nothing.

11
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:18,646
Ouch.

12
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:33,513
[Does it hurt?]

13
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,980
No.

14
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:40,046
But how did you know I'd be here?

15
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,980
Where else would you go?

16
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:48,313
True,

17
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:52,313
I'm like driftwood in the sea now,

18
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,979
with no direction or home.

19
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,713
[But I also feel like]

20
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,380
[this is a gift from the heavens.]

21
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:02,046
I don't remember the past,

22
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:04,979
but every day here is a happy one.

23
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,780
But with happiness comes fear,

24
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:11,979
like this time is borrowed.

25
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:18,113
Lin Qingyi, I want to stay.

26
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:25,346
- Okay.
- Okay?

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,846
That's all you've got to say?

28
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:33,546
You're not a child.

29
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,146
Your life, your own decisions.

30
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:42,113
So you agree I can stay?

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,280
Give me your hand.

32
00:02:49,246 --> 00:02:50,113
Pinky promise,

33
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:52,646
seal it!

34
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:58,546
This has legal significance,

35
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,846
no backing out.

36
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:03,679
Right. What's this?

37
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:05,313
Cedar,

38
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:07,346
for decorating the house.

39
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:10,246
Your place is so bare, no warmth at all.

40
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:12,379
So you've got me all figured out, huh?

41
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,380
Jia must be looking for us.

42
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,680
Let's go back and not make her worry.

43
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,546
Jia, we're back.

44
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:25,279
Summer, you're finally back!

45
00:03:25,313 --> 00:03:27,713
- What happened?
- It's fine.

46
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,046
Help her sit down.

47
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,446
Qingyi,

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,280
would you come to my birthday party?

49
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,080
I'm busy.

50
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:46,979
This is Chu Lili.

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,680
Her family owns the largest mall here.

52
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:51,879
She's pretentious and petty.

53
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,113
Actually, I'm inviting you to work.

54
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,780
Your coffee

55
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,780
is the best on the island.

56
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,246
[Be my personal barista for a day.]

57
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,113
That's some good acting.

58
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,380
100,000 yuan for one day.

59
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:14,979
[I'll go!]

60
00:04:15,513 --> 00:04:18,279
[I'm the boss's top disciple. I'll do it.]

61
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,113
Fine. She can be your assistant.

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,180
Wear formal attire.

63
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,580
[You know what's a formal attire, right?]

64
00:04:28,746 --> 00:04:30,579
[If you don't have any,]

65
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,480
[I can lend you mine.]

66
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,913
Don't worry.

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,480
Well,

68
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,946
about the fee...

69
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:47,279
Qingyi, here's the deposit.

70
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:52,946
I'll see you tomorrow.

71
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,180
Boss,

72
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:01,146
about the money....

73
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,846
Do a good job.

74
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:04,679
Don't embarrass me.

75
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:07,779
What are you staring at?

76
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:31,046
Oh no, I don't have any formal clothes.

77
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:40,246
Jia, I was about to call you.

78
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,780
Summer, what do we do?

79
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:44,846
I don't even have a decent outfit,

80
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,313
let alone formal wear.

81
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,146
Hmm...

82
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:50,279
how about we go buy something tomorrow?

83
00:05:51,246 --> 00:05:52,046
Yeah,

84
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,546
that's our only option.

85
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:57,879
[But we're not paying for it.]

86
00:05:59,046 --> 00:05:59,879
What do you mean?

87
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,380
Just wait for me tomorrow morning.

88
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:03,079
Okay, see you in the morning.

89
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,080
[Got it.]

90
00:06:32,513 --> 00:06:33,746
[July 28th,]

91
00:06:34,713 --> 00:06:35,979
[I'm Summer.]

92
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,646
[Today is my third day on Aman Island.]

93
00:06:40,446 --> 00:06:42,779
[I've met some really great people here.]

94
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,380
[I really enjoy my life here.]

95
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,480
Boss.

96
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:06,913
Boss.

97
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:10,579
What are you doing?

98
00:07:11,513 --> 00:07:12,679
Good morning, boss.

99
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:15,646
We've been waiting for you.

100
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:16,746
Good morning.

101
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:19,913
Hm,

102
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:21,746
what do you want?

103
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:28,713
- Boss, we want to buy clothes!
- Boss!
