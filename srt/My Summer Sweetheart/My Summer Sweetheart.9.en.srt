00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,010
Happy birthday.

2
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:18,450
Thanks.

3
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,770
Hello, Miss Chu.

4
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,590
Dressed so plainly,

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,930
you really do look like waitstaff.

6
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,810
Today's all about the birthday girl.

7
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,890
Let's head in. Come on.

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,630
Hold on.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:40,810
Today's theme is

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,330
masquerade.

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,770
Put this on.

12
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,790
Let's go.

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,350
What's wrong?

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,850
[I'm nervous and need to use the restroom.]

15
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,690
Are you okay?

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:56,690
I'll go in first.

17
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,690
Wait for me.

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,290
Easy.

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:10,790
You finally made it.

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,000
[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP09]

21
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,150
I was worried you might bail last minute.

22
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,870
I took some time to prepare this.

23
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,550
Happy birthday.

24
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,390
It's beautiful.

25
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,210
Glad you like it.

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,890
Help me put it on.

27
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:25,670
Sure.

28
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,550
It looks perfect on you.

29
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,630
Thanks.

30
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,490
I got this mask just for you.

31
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,490
Let me put it on for you.

32
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,330
Alright.

33
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,270
I'll head in.

34
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,190
I'll find you later.

35
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,150
See you soon.

36
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,590
Hello, sir.

37
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,130
A cup of coffee, please.

38
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,690
Alright.

39
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,570
Sir, your coffee is ready.

40
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,430
Thanks.

41
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,310
[Hello, sir. What would you like to drink?]

42
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,850
You sound like a friend of mine.

43
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,530
Sir,

44
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,010
your pick-up lines are too old-fashioned.

45
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,170
[Does my voice]

46
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,190
[sound familiar?]

47
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,270
It does sound familiar.

48
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:30,850
You...

49
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,970
It's you, the creep!

50
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,290
You really are persistent.

51
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,550
Didn't you get enough of a beating?

52
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,450
Jia, come help me for a moment.

53
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,390
Sir, how about I make you a Con Panna?

54
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,110
Sure, thank you.

55
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,790
Summer, stay away from this guy.

56
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,730
He's bad news.

57
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,490
This young lady seems sensible

58
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,770
and not one to believe rumors.

59
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,490
I think you're right.

60
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,050
Sir, here's your Con Panna with toffee.

61
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,270
[Enjoy.]

62
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,130
Toffee?

63
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,510
Is that

64
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,570
the rich and handsome guy you mentioned?

65
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,810
Is he flirting with that barista?

66
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,030
I need you to do something for me.

67
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,630
Get me an iced Americano.

68
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,130
Miss,

69
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,830
how about some Yunnan coffee?

70
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,790
This is considered the crown jewel

71
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,230
of Chinese coffee,

72
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,050
[grown at an altitude of 1,500 meters,]

73
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,530
giving it a unique flavor.

74
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,490
Alright, I'll have a cup.

75
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,930
Sure, one moment.

76
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,649
Your coffee is ready. Please enjoy.

77
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,110
How is it?

78
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,790
It's handpicked from fully ripe cherries,

79
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,930
[offering a unique taste]

80
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,990
[with hints of tropical fruit.]

81
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,790
Do you feel that tropical vibe?

82
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,170
Is there anything else?

83
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,890
My friend lost a diamond ring here.

84
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,570
If you see it, hand it over!

85
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,190
A diamond ring?

86
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,190
We haven't seen any diamond ring.

87
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,570
It was right here! I had a coffee,

88
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,750
[and then it was gone!]

89
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,510
[Are you accusing me of taking your ring?]

90
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,970
That's a baseless accusation!

91
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,370
You're being unreasonable!

92
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,510
Are you brave enough to let me search?

93
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,690
I have nothing to hide!

94
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,250
Here it is!

95
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,190
[You're a thief!]

96
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,410
I didn't take it!

97
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,670
She's not a thief.

98
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,570
Hello, how can I help you?

99
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,690
A servant wear such an expensive necklace?

100
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,050
You must have stolen it.

101
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,530
This was a gift from my mother.

102
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,290
Impossible!

103
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,350
[She's not lying.]

104
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,430
Zhu Jinhao?

105
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,490
What are you doing here playing the hero?

106
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,510
You left this in the dressing room.

107
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,530
[Apologize.]

108
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,110
Zhu Jinhao,

109
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,910
don't go too far.

110
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,070
You love categorizing people, right?

111
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,210
[The collaboration with your father,]

112
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,710
I think I need to reconsider it.

113
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,910
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,250
Let's go.

115
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,130
You say she took it,

116
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,590
but I can testify she didn't.

117
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,170
Since there are conflicting statements,

118
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,870
let's check the surveillance footage.

119
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,010
[Sorry, the surveillance cameras are broken]

120
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,990
[and haven't been fixed yet.]

121
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,210
[You knew the cameras were broken.]

122
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,710
[That's why you're so confident.]

123
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,450
Come on, don't be angry.

124
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,270
How about this:

125
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,090
You bow and apologize to her,

126
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,670
[promise you won't do it again,]

127
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,530
[and we'll let it go.]

128
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,650
I didn't do it. Why should I apologize?

129
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,330
Exactly.

130
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,690
I think there's a misunderstanding here.

131
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,770
Maybe this young lady

132
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,250
accidentally lost her ring.

133
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,850
What do you think?
