00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,430
Help!

[Zhu Jinhao]

00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:23,335
[A day ago]

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,520
[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP01]

5
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,610
Somebody help me!

6
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,250
I don't want to die!

7
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:51,990
Help!

8
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,350
Human traffickers!

9
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,810
Yell again, and I'll dock your pay.

10
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,010
Oh no.

11
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,790
Drinking this is like drinking poison.

12
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,810
Go ahead and dock my pay.

13
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,270
But if you do,

14
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,150
I'll take you to labor court.

15
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,250
[10,000 yuan

16
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,710
received.]

17
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,250
Bro,

18
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,570
you're my true brother.

19
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,730
I'll drink it.

20
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,450
It tastes awful.

21
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,750
Well?

22
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,530
It's so bitter.

23
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,310
Tastes burnt

24
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,870
and scratches my throat.

25
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,010
Not bad.

26
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,630
Cheap coffee beans

27
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,970
are junk.

28
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,850
Come on,

29
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,370
this batch

30
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:42,730
cost almost as much as our rent.

31
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,770
[If the beans could talk,]

32
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,950
[they'd be protesting,]

33
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,270
"It's not my fault!"

34
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,170
Still junk.

35
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,410
Boss,

36
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,090
if you don't need me,

37
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,270
I'll head out.

38
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,290
Okay?

39
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,130
Trash.

40
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,590
Ms. Zhu,

41
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,270
morning.

42
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,210
Sorry, Ms. Zhu.

43
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,190
[Great,]

44
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,350
[there goes this month's bonus!]

45
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,570
Good morning, Ms. Zhu!

46
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,070
[Ms. Zhu,]

47
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,670
[the Deputy GM has already started.]

48
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,270
The Aman Island development plan?

49
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,490
[It's been sent out.]

50
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,410
[Here,]

51
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,610
here,

52
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,450
[Zhu Anran]

53
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,610
and here.

54
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,430
[This is my proposal.]

55
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,950
[Shen Jinchuan]

56
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,930
Looks like

57
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,690
I'm just in time.

58
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,170
[Can I start?]

59
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,690
I started without you.

60
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:27,950
Sis,

61
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,950
you're not mad, are you?

62
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,630
Deputy GM Zhu,

63
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,870
take a seat after your presentation.

64
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:41,830
As you all know,

65
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,810
we've got the land development rights

66
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,070
for Aman Island.

67
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,310
Here's the development plan,

68
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,350
take a look.

69
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,870
Here

70
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,450
is our luxury hotel.

71
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,670
And here...

72
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,170
[Who's in charge here?]

73
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,470
Is it you?
