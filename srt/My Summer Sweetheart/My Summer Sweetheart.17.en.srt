[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP17]

2
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:17,534
[Sorry.]

3
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,030
Is it good?

4
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:35,730
It's good.

5
00:00:52,297 --> 00:00:55,563
I just found an old diary I wrote.

6
00:00:56,464 --> 00:00:59,230
It records my daily life back then.

7
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:02,097
I'm not interested in your trivial

8
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:03,097
elementary school diary.

9
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,097
You really recorded such trivial stuff?

10
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:25,297
What are you doing?

11
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:27,097
Why did you come in without knocking?

12
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,363
Our esteemed writer is so absorbed,

13
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:34,064
even if I knocked, you wouldn't hear.

14
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,063
You have the nerve to argue with me?

15
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:38,964
Who cares.

16
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,730
Hey, give it back!

17
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:42,697
That's my privacy, you can't read it!

18
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:44,297
Beg me.

19
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:44,930
Give it back!

20
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,330
Let me enjoy it first.

21
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:49,064
Give it back! You can't read it!

22
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:51,497
Will you give it back?

23
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:52,830
Beg me.

24
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,030
I'll bite you.

25
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,030
Go ahead. I'm not afraid.

26
00:02:05,464 --> 00:02:06,497
Get out!

27
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:08,430
Give it back!

28
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,830
Get out, out!

29
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:13,030
[Fine, I'm leaving.]

30
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:14,264
[I didn't want to read it anyway.]

31
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,530
What are you daydreaming about? Eat.

32
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,430
I wanted to ask,

33
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:49,830
why don't you agree to my terms?

34
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:52,730
Why should I tell someone irrelevant?

35
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,430
Is it because of your grandfather?

36
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:06,764
Zhu Jinhao,

37
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,297
aren't you tired of pretending?

38
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,430
Why so many questions?

39
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,963
We can arrange new homes for people.

40
00:03:13,964 --> 00:03:16,230
They'll just be living elsewhere.

41
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,263
Everything else will stay the same.

42
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:21,297
Would you give up being Zhu Jinhao

43
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:22,330
but live as Summer?

44
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,530
That's completely different.

45
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,863
It's the same!

46
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:31,297
You're asking those who lived here

47
00:03:31,297 --> 00:03:31,930
to leave

48
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,430
and start over somewhere else,

49
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:36,763
wiping out their previous lives.

50
00:03:36,764 --> 00:03:38,630
Have you considered what they want?

51
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,330
Maybe they need a large sum of money

52
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,330
or a better home.

53
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:48,930
You really aren't her.

54
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,897
She would only tell me

55
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:54,930
to hold on to this place.

56
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:10,530
It's raining. Get in the car.

57
00:04:17,697 --> 00:04:18,863
Who would've thought Ms. Zhu

58
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:20,730
would resort to using her charm?

59
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,230
Lin Qingyi has a thing for Summer,

60
00:04:26,364 --> 00:04:28,264
so it's a good move.

61
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,063
But this isn't really like you.

62
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:37,164
And what should I be like?

63
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:40,964
We're the same,

64
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:42,864
self-serving

65
00:04:43,764 --> 00:04:45,830
and only doing things that benefit us.

66
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,497
Anyone ever tell you

67
00:04:49,064 --> 00:04:51,230
that you don't look like a good person?

68
00:04:52,364 --> 00:04:54,030
I'm not like you.

69
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,763
Let's go, I'm going to sleep.

70
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,263
Alright.

71
00:05:09,364 --> 00:05:10,864
Head back, no need to send me.

72
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,730
Boss, why isn't Summer here yet?

73
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,263
I wore my best dress to surprise her.

74
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,030
She's busy and have no time.

75
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,330
Busy?

76
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:52,830
I smell jealousy.

77
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:04,064
[Zhu Jinhao is with me.]

78
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,297
[If you don't want her dead,]

79
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,697
- [come here.]
- Where is she?

80
00:06:07,697 --> 00:06:08,830
[I'll send the location.]

81
00:06:16,464 --> 00:06:17,930
Hello, Shen Jinchuan?

82
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,630
[Zhu Anran,]

83
00:06:22,364 --> 00:06:23,830
you know you're

84
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,963
breaking the law, right?

85
00:06:25,897 --> 00:06:27,030
Zhu Jinhao,

86
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,263
don't lecture me.

87
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:33,263
I'm sick of your hypocrisy!

88
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,063
I'm your only family.

89
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,330
If you stop now, I won't pursue this.

90
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,463
You won't?

91
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,697
Once Lin Qingyi signs the contract,

92
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,730
I'll be the new GM,

93
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,363
and you can leave in disgrace.

94
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,930
Lin Qingyi won't trade the Island for me.

95
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,663
[It's more important than his life!]

96
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:57,364
He's here.

97
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:13,064
I'm here.

98
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:14,064
Lin Qingyi!

99
00:07:14,297 --> 00:07:15,163
What do you want?

100
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:17,964
Sign it.

101
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,230
If I sign, you'll let her go?

102
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:22,730
Lin Qingyi, don't!

103
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,130
Of course not,

104
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:26,863
but you have no choice!

105
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,130
Lin Qingyi,

106
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,430
have you lost your mind?

107
00:07:31,964 --> 00:07:33,364
Stop stalling, sign it!

108
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:36,463
[Lin Qingyi, don't sign it!]

109
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,863
[Lin Qingyi!]

110
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:40,264
I've signed it.

111
00:07:50,497 --> 00:07:51,330
Are you okay?

112
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,530
Shen Jinchuan, let go of me!

113
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:56,297
Zhu Anran, you better behave!

114
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,897
I want you all dead!

115
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,663
Let go of me! Let's die together!

116
00:08:01,664 --> 00:08:03,564
If you want to die, do it yourself!

117
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:16,330
That was impressive.
