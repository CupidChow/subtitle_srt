00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,500
Hello, welcome...

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,200
Boss,

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,540
did you

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,520
finally

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,700
get into a fight?

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,320
Weren't you out buying coffee beans?

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,760
What happened to your shoes?

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,660
Come on, spill the beans,

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,880
I'm dying to know...

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,260
Quiet.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,300
Hello, welcome.

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,100
What can I get you?

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,820
An espresso.

14
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,640
Sure, one moment.

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,320
Went to save a damsel in distress, huh?

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,140
Boss,

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,480
your crush

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,480
just ordered an espresso.

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,520
[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP03]

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,540
Go serve her.

21
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,040
Get lost,

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,980
don't spread your stupidity to me.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,720
Hi,

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,160
here's your coffee.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,140
Do you have a phone I can use?

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,460
Sure,

27
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,680
go ahead.

28
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,120
I just lost my phone.

29
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,200
My assistant will transfer the money.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,040
If you don't believe me...

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,340
I believe you!

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,320
It's fine,

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,300
even if you don't pay,

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,460
it's on our boss.

35
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,740
[I mean,]

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,600
you're too good-looking to be a liar.

37
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,180
Can I see your barista?

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,120
He's over there.

39
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,640
Did you make this coffee?

40
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,680
It's you?

41
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,080
Yes,

42
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,960
your lifesaver.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,880
Can you actually make coffee?

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,860
What's wrong?

45
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,600
Is there a problem?

46
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,140
Outside.

47
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,580
Normally,

48
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,560
[saltiness accounts for 14%]

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,640
[of the soluble flavors in coffee.]

50
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,720
Although it's not much,

51
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,580
it shouldn't be noticeable because of

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
the acidity and sweetness.

53
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,420
[But this espresso tastes like]

54
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,000
a mix of water and salt.

55
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,940
[Either you used low-quality beans,]

56
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,820
[or your extraction was insufficient.]

57
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,200
If you chose to make coffee,

58
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,300
treat it seriously

59
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,880
[and don't waste it.]

60
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,680
Or

61
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,400
[maybe you tried your best]

62
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,540
but just

63
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,600
lack the skill.

64
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,000
Well said!

65
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,600
[Have a try.]

66
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,140
If you're so good at this,

67
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,860
how about I let you

68
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,360
run the shop?

69
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,240
It's alright.

70
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,620
Boss,

71
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,960
if you keep pushing her to be the boss,

72
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,420
she might take advantage of you.

73
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,520
You talk too much today.

74
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,640
Go wash the cups!

75
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,000
Help!

76
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,380
Scamming people even on a rainy day?

77
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,280
So dedicated, huh?

78
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,940
Get up.

79
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,340
There are no cameras or witnesses here.

80
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,160
If I run you over,

81
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,340
no one will know.

82
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,840
Get up, stop pretending.
