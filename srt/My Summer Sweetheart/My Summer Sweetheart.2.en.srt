1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:05,850
And here...

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,350
[Who's in charge here?]

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,750
Is it you?

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,410
- Let go of me!
- Quick!

5
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,930
[He refuses to leave Aman Island.]

6
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,150
If you want me to solve this,

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,170
be quiet!

8
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,230
Meeting adjourned.

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,330
[Everyone, you can go.]

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,970
I'll stay.

11
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,710
Now,

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,490
we can have a proper chat.

13
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,210
Tell me,

14
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,190
what do you want?

15
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,350
What do you mean?

16
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,750
My family has lived on Aman Island

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,930
since my grandpa's time.

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,390
[We have a deep connection to that place.]

19
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,330
Now you're telling us to move?

20
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,090
That's unfair!

21
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,230
Lin Fengnian,

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,210
27,

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,680
[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP02]

24
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,690
a chronic drunk and gambler.

25
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,610
Six months ago,

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,970
you lost everything to gambling,

27
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,370
[and your wife left with your son.]

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,970
Let me guess,

29
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,430
how much

30
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,910
is that connection worth?

31
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,070
What do you mean?

32
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,510
Two options:

33
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,830
one million yuan and a house,

34
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,550
or

35
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,150
two million yuan.

36
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,130
Your choice.

37
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,170
Two million.

38
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:53,890
Xu.

39
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,250
Thanks!

40
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,550
Thank you so much!

41
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,730
Two million!

42
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,030
Thank you!

43
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,650
I'll be going now.

44
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,630
[Big companies]

45
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,650
[are so generous!]

46
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,870
Some people

47
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,550
are just after money.

48
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,650
Thanks for today.

49
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,210
My pleasure.

50
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,410
Come in.

51
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,210
I think you should try a style

52
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,710
that really shows off your charm.

53
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,350
I hope you've got

54
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,730
something important to say.

55
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,590
Give me!

56
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,950
Aman Island.

57
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,810
There's a guy named Mr. Lin there

58
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,310
who's really difficult.

59
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,770
Go on.

60
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,250
He owns more than half the shops

61
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,630
and houses on the island.

62
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,950
The problem is,

63
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,410
he's totally stubborn

64
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,490
[and doesn't care about money at all.]

65
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,690
I'll go to Aman Island myself.

66
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,630
Move.

67
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,810
I'll go with you.

68
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,930
Mr. Shen,

69
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,550
we're not right for each other.

70
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,810
Don't waste your time on me.

71
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,950
Zhu Jinhao,

72
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,110
no one is better suited for you than I am.

73
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,530
[Oh,]

74
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,310
[that's weird.]

75
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,610
My glasses were just here,

76
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,870
now

77
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,569
they're gone.

78
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:33,890
Ah,

79
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,730
who are you?

80
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,830
Hi,

81
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,670
Zhu Jinhao, in charge of the Aman Island

82
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,570
development project.

83
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,270
Okay.

84
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,510
You can call me

85
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,590
Director Zhen.

86
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,890
Director Zhen,

87
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,350
I'd like to meet Mr. Lin,

88
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,310
the one who refuses to leave.

89
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,670
Oh, well...

90
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,650
I'd advise you to drop it.

91
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,590
He won't agree.

92
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,830
Please help me get in touch with him.

93
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,270
Alright.

94
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,690
[After all,]

95
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,390
[seeing is believing.]

96
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,370
Hello, Mr. Lin?

97
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,190
This is the Aman Island project manager...

98
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,090
Hello?

99
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,610
[See?]

100
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,130
I told you.

101
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,510
Now do you believe me?

102
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,390
Then please

103
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,630
give me Mr. Lin's address.

104
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,770
Miss,

105
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,610
that's private information.

106
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,970
I can't share it.

107
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,350
But honestly,

108
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,630
this place

109
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,930
means a lot to him.

110
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,750
He won't leave.

111
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,450
Don't miss out!

112
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,510
Fishing gear for sale!

113
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,050
Morning.

114
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,390
Morning, Mr. Lin.

115
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,290
Is your son still asleep?

116
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,630
Yes. Morning.

117
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,890
Keep up the good work.

118
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,930
[Don't miss out!]

119
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,850
[Cheap stuff!]

120
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,170
[Don't miss out!]

121
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,150
Miss,

122
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,510
want to buy something?

123
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,470
Excuse me,

124
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,370
can you tell me where Mr. Lin lives?

125
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,070
You mean Mr. Lin?

126
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:11,710
He...

127
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,110
I don't know any Mr. Lin.

128
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,950
You mean him?

129
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,330
Thanks.

130
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,750
Oh no,

131
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,890
Director Zhen told me this.

132
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,290
Wait,

133
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,710
why did I tell her?

134
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,910
Who are you! Put me down!

135
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:58,890
Who are you?

136
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,490
Commit suicide somewhere else,

137
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,190
not on Aman Island...

138
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:08,970
Are you crazy?

139
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,910
You're the one who's crazy!

140
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,730
Fine,

141
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,710
I'll stay out of it.

142
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,490
Wear them or don't.
