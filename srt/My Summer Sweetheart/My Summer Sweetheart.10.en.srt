[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP10]

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,370
I think there's a misunderstanding here.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,450
Maybe this young lady

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:14,930
accidentally lost her ring.

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,530
What do you think?

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,530
What do you mean?

7
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,610
No need to cause a scene to cast chill

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,890
[over people here,]

9
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:24,890
right?

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:25,970
Look,

11
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,470
[I'll cover]

12
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:29,630
today's expenses.

13
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,610
Trying to be a hero again?

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:32,870
That won't be necessary.

15
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,190
Call the police.

16
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,610
No need to escalate things.

17
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,830
No one really cares about the truth.

18
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,530
I care!

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,370
So do I!

20
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:43,930
Let's go, Jia.

21
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,790
You crazy woman!

22
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,730
Hey, calm down!

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,030
Let me go!

24
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,350
You can explain everything

25
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,050
to the police.

26
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,210
Lili, I did everything you told me to.

27
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,670
[You have to help me!]

28
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:07,150
What do you want?

29
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,270
Bow and apologize to us,

30
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,010
[and promise]

31
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,150
you won't do

32
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,170
such disgusting things again.

33
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,890
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,730
Now we're even.

35
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,810
That was scary.

36
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:33,930
You're walking so fast.

37
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,970
Weren't you just so fierce a moment ago?

38
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,710
Don't bring that up.

39
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,410
I was so scared they'd gang up on us.

40
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,230
Luckily, we ran fast

41
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,030
and

42
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,830
didn't suffer.

43
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,910
[Wait, Summer,]

44
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,450
were you pretending just now?

45
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,290
Do you know how cool you looked?

46
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,290
I was scared to death.

47
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,210
When did you take that?

48
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,350
After all this trouble,

49
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,110
they're definitely not paying the rest.

50
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,770
I had to take something to make up for it.

51
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,150
You're the best, Summer!

52
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,310
Boss, dressed so sharp today,

53
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,270
weren't you here to play the hero?

54
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,170
Hungry?

55
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,950
Yes, I'm starving...

56
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,350
I just remembered I have something to do.

57
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,470
I've got to go.

58
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,990
Where are you going? I'll come with you.

59
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,470
No need.

60
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,450
See you, bye.

61
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,910
Since you're dressed so nicely today,

62
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,970
let's go get something good to eat.

63
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,550
Sure.

64
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,350
What's with that expression?

65
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,250
You were just all excited a moment ago.

66
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,970
This tiny piece of something

67
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,730
costs several hundred yuan.

68
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,810
[It's really easy to fool a rich person.]

69
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,230
Too late to regret now.

70
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,570
You can't leave until you finish.

71
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,250
I told you we should've just gone back

72
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,550
and made a deluxe instant noodle

73
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,210
instead of wasting money here.

74
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,310
This is actually pretty good.

75
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:40,950
Look.

76
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,570
Smells great.

77
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,610
She really knows how to treat herself.

78
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,070
Delicious!

79
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,070
Boss,

80
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,230
thanks for arriving just in time.

81
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,650
I'll down this cup.

82
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,390
You can do as you please.

83
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,150
This second cup

84
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,410
is also for you, boss.

85
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,290
You're the first person...

86
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,390
let me pour some for you...

87
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,030
I met on the island.

88
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,430
You're a good person.

89
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,890
I'll down this cup,

90
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,349
and you can do as you please.

91
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,810
[And...]

92
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,010
this third cup is also for you.

93
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,050
Stop drinking.

94
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,030
Why?

95
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,250
You don't want to share?

96
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,310
I'm worried you'll get drunk.

97
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,530
Listen,

98
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,770
I secretly took this wine.

99
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,670
You can't drink it alone.

100
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,330
We have to drink it together.

101
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,510
Charge!

102
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,790
This way!

103
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,010
So tired,

104
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,690
but I'm so happy.

105
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,310
Go away.

106
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,770
Get up, you smell like alcohol.

107
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,010
Go wash up.

108
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,210
Where are you going?

109
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,110
Come here.

110
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,470
- Me?
- Yes.

111
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,730
Making luxurious instant noodles

112
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,270
for a drunkard.

113
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,170
Then I'll go

114
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,810
take a shower now

115
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,990
and come out to eat.

116
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,070
What happened?

117
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,490
What happened?

118
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,550
[Sorry,]

119
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,430
[I didn't mean to.]

120
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,590
I fell.

121
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,030
[Can you get up?]

122
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,190
Not really.

123
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,310
[Should I come in and help you?]

124
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:25,990
No!

125
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,190
[Let me find something.]

126
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,290
I've covered my eyes.

127
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,010
Wrap yourself in a towel,

128
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,550
[okay?]

129
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,650
You can come in now.

130
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,550
I'm coming in.

131
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,050
Why are you laughing?

132
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,230
One moment you're all prim and proper,

133
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,890
and now you look like a refined scoundrel.

134
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,170
Good thing I'm not really a scoundrel.

135
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,370
Move a bit to the right.

136
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,990
Where does it hurt?

137
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,010
My foot.

138
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:16,570
[Here?]

139
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,490
How did you get so careless?

140
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:22,990
I'm fine.

141
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,470
I'll carry you out.

142
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,170
Lin Qingyi.
