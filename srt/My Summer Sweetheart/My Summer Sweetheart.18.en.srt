[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP18]

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:02,989
Come in.

3
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:04,570
What's up?

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:11,529
I'm here to solve your problem.

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,009
What problem?

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,730
To keep a part of the Aman Island.

7
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:25,250
Spill it,

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,910
what's your solution?

9
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,410
Marry me.

10
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,090
Are you awake?

11
00:00:35,029 --> 00:00:36,169
Keeping that part

12
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,669
requires more funds.

13
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:40,449
The group can't afford it right now,

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,970
[but my family can.]

15
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:45,709
You want to keep Aman Island,

16
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,590
and I need a suitable wife.

17
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,610
Win-win.

18
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:52,269
Why me?

19
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:56,849
I think we'd make a great match.

20
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,790
Think about it?

21
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:05,029
Get out.

22
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:29,569
Mr. Lin, you're back.

23
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:40,930
You've got guts showing up here.

24
00:02:42,849 --> 00:02:43,650
Ungrateful brat.

25
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,309
I saved you,

26
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:46,990
and you're avoiding me?

27
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:03,450
Don't go.

28
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:08,469
Zhu Jinhao.

29
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:09,629
Hmm?

30
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,170
Do you know who I am?

31
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,569
Lin

32
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,749
Qing

33
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:15,729
Yi.

34
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:25,309
Do you know the consequences of this?

35
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,309
No.

36
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,110
The consequence is,

37
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,849
you're stuck with me.

38
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,549
Zhu Jinhao,

39
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,270
you've got some nerve.

40
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:35,549
How do I look?

41
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,130
Great,

42
00:04:41,929 --> 00:04:43,369
really great.

43
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,810
Then I'll take this one.

44
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,469
Don't you want to try another?

45
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,229
No, I have a meeting soon.

46
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:54,349
Boss, pick up the phone.

47
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,349
Your wife will be someone else's!

48
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,029
Hello, bridesmaid!

49
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,750
Why don't you ditch Lin Qingyi

50
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,830
and come with me?

51
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,750
In your dreams, pervert!

52
00:05:25,469 --> 00:05:26,469
Why are you back?

53
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,710
To bring you the shoebox.

54
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,229
My shoes are here.

55
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:33,049
You decide.

56
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,109
Wear these

57
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:36,909
or those.

58
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,210
Now,

59
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,710
we will see our beautiful bride slowly

60
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,369
walking from the other end of happiness.

61
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:02,469
Mr. Shen, please take your strong steps

62
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:05,270
and greet your lifelong love

63
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:07,109
with all your sincerity.

64
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,869
[You will marry Ms. Zhu Jinhao]

65
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,710
[as your wife.]

66
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,810
[In health or sickness,]

67
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,609
[in poverty or wealth,]

68
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,310
[will you love her]

69
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,609
until the end of your life?

70
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:22,250
Do you?

71
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:27,669
I do.

72
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:36,849
Ms. Zhu Jinhao,

73
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,869
you will marry Mr. Shen Jinchuan.

74
00:06:40,869 --> 00:06:43,409
In health or sickness,

75
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,330
[in poverty or wealth,]

76
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:48,190
[will you love him, accompany him?]

77
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,789
[Do you?]

78
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,929
[She doesn't!]

79
00:07:31,609 --> 00:07:32,710
Happy now?

80
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:36,630
Tough luck, buddy.

81
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:39,770
Come drink with me then.

82
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:51,090
[You should have]

83
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,669
used a fake marriage

84
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,929
to keep the Island for me.

85
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,010
If I knew you were rich,

86
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,409
would I have to sacrifice myself?

87
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,210
Who knew Ms. Zhu would act like

88
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:04,830
she had it all figured out,

89
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,650
only to end up sacrificing herself.

90
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,289
Can I kiss my bride now?

91
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,489
Who wants to be your bride?

92
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,609
Will you marry me?
