[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP16]

2
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:13,183
I heard Zhu Jinhao is back.

3
00:00:13,183 --> 00:00:14,216
[She's alive?]

4
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:21,049
Hello, board members.

5
00:00:21,783 --> 00:00:22,783
Long time no see.

6
00:00:24,516 --> 00:00:25,616
[Sorry for being late.]

7
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:29,349
I'm sure you're all curious about why

8
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:32,416
the Aman Island development plan failed.

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,583
[You recognize the person]

10
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:36,383
on the screen, don't you?

11
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:40,183
What's going on?

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,116
Ms. Zhu is helping outsiders against us?

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,350
I'm curious too.

14
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:47,783
Let's hear Ms. Zhu's explanation.

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,850
This happened after my memory loss.

16
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,150
[I take full responsibility.]

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,950
The Aman Island development project

18
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:06,916
will officially start in a week.

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,983
Boss, you're looking pretty sharp today.

20
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,583
Did you see Summer?

21
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:22,749
What did you say to her?

22
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,216
I'm waiting for her to come to me.

23
00:01:26,616 --> 00:01:27,516
Why?

24
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:41,583
Come in.

25
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,150
Director Zhen.

26
00:01:50,116 --> 00:01:53,016
So it's you, young lady. No wonder...

27
00:01:53,016 --> 00:01:55,016
I need your help to contact

28
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:55,816
Mr. Lin again.

29
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,516
Don't you have his contact info?

30
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:01,449
Call him yourself.

31
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:09,749
Alright,

32
00:02:09,816 --> 00:02:11,516
you young folks

33
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:13,049
are always so troublesome.

34
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,850
[Hello?]

35
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:25,383
Hello, Mr. Lin,

36
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,183
this is Zhu Jinhao.

37
00:02:27,716 --> 00:02:29,949
I'd like to discuss the relocation.

38
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:30,916
[Sure.]

39
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,150
Alright,

40
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,583
you can wait for him here.

41
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:40,616
- Okay.
- I gotta go.

42
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:41,649
Thank you.

43
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:12,016
Let's talk.

44
00:03:15,116 --> 00:03:16,416
Take a look at the contract.

45
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:20,716
[This is our best offer,]

46
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:21,983
guaranteed to satisfy you.

47
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:25,150
I don't want to see it.

48
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,583
What would make you want to look at it?

49
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:35,649
Why didn't you come to see me?

50
00:03:40,583 --> 00:03:41,749
Sorry, Mr. Lin,

51
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,149
I don't know what you're talking about.

52
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,149
[I had a car accident recently]

53
00:03:47,316 --> 00:03:48,449
[and lost my memory.]

54
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:50,183
I know.

55
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:55,383
It seems

56
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:58,183
we had quite a relationship, Mr. Lin.

57
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,416
Just the usual,

58
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:06,949
with you kissing me multiple times.

59
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,550
Why so quiet suddenly?

60
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,450
If you have nothing else to say,

61
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,183
I'll leave.

62
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,350
I do.

63
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,050
Go ahead.

64
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,783
[Mr. Lin!]

65
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,550
Mr. Lin,

66
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:04,649
I twisted my ankle.

67
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,850
How can I get to the hospital?

68
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,516
You don't have to trouble yourself,

69
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,549
just tell me the location.

70
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,816
Quiet.

71
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,916
Thank you then.

72
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,383
Mr. Lin,

73
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,116
why did you bring me to your house?

74
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:38,916
Sit down.

75
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,850
What was our relationship before?

76
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,650
Landlord and tenant,

77
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,250
employer and employee.

78
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:10,716
Just that?

79
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,116
What do you

80
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,950
think it was?

81
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:31,116
Where are you going?

82
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:32,583
Cooking. I'm hungry.

83
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:34,983
Then,

84
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,116
I won't bother you.

85
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:52,549
Stay put.

86
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,049
You can leave after dinner.

87
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:58,950
Well,

88
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:01,216
sorry for the trouble.

89
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,249
Can I look around?

90
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:09,783
Suit yourself.

91
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,716
Still hurts.

92
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,216
Does he clean every day?

93
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:52,949
That shouldn't be.

94
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,316
What about the cedar tree?

95
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:09,749
Could it have died?

96
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:45,249
Come out and eat.

97
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:47,616
Okay.
