[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP12]

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,400
Ma'am, it's about the Aman Island.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:15,880
That's

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,060
what Zhu Jinhao's been delaying for?

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,660
Find some competent people

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,020
to stir things up.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,600
You mean...

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,980
What's the worst thing

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,820
that can happen in the service industry?

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,940
Safety hazards.

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll send someone to handle it now.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,780
And contact the media partners,

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,400
invite them for a vacation.

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,380
Alright, I'll arrange it now.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,820
Zhu Jinhao,

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,260
I can make things happen

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,580
with your soft approach.

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,040
[Look!]

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,920
Isn't this the little coffee shop girl?

20
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,580
Running into me today, bad luck for you.

21
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,820
My boyfriend is waiting for me.

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,180
Your boyfriend?

23
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,080
That little coffee shop boss, right?

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,020
I was about to settle things with him.

25
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,440
Come on, you're coming with me today.

26
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,540
[Stop!]

27
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,780
That's my boyfriend!

28
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,900
I'm leaving!

29
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:53,900
Help me,

30
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,060
those two guys are thugs!

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,720
Your boyfriend?

32
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,660
Girl,

33
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,100
you sure change boyfriends fast.

34
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:02,840
Dude,

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,640
lend me your girlfriend.

36
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:05,860
How about it?

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,920
Sure.

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,920
Come on,

39
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,500
get up and continue!

40
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:14,480
No... no, we wouldn't dare.

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,440
Let's go.

42
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,840
Are you okay?

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,640
I'm fine.

44
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
If they had dared to really touch me,

45
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,440
I'd have taken them down with me.

46
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,120
Impressive.

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,100
You too,

48
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,640
I didn't know you could fight.

49
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,800
Well, now you can know more about me.

50
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,400
Hi, I'm Shen Jinchuan.

51
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,020
Hi, I'm Summer.

52
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,340
Let's go.

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,260
Lately, there's been a lot of incidents,

54
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,160
happening all of a sudden.

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,920
Why do you say that?

56
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,340
I haven't been here long,

57
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,180
but everyone here is warm and friendly.

58
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,780
Those two seemed like

59
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,960
they came just to cause trouble.

60
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,220
You like it here?

61
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,420
Yes.

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,800
Summer,

63
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,740
when I said I wanted to pursue you,

64
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,820
it wasn't just on a whim.

65
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,580
Remember the birthday party?

66
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,400
I said you reminded me of someone.

67
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,160
The first time I met her

68
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,100
was also at a party,

69
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,700
in a similar situation.

70
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Was it just as embarrassing?

71
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,880
She was the one

72
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,800
who stood up for justice.

73
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
You're not using me

74
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,900
as a stand-in because your confession

75
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,840
didn't work out, are you?

76
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,760
Anyway, to show my gratitude,

77
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,900
I'll treat you to coffee. Come.

78
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,620
If it's not made by you,

79
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,100
I won't drink it.

80
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,960
Don't worry, to show my sincerity,

81
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,940
I'll secretly make it for you.

82
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,080
Let's go.

83
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,020
Hey everyone,

84
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,680
I drank coffee from this shop

85
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,740
and look,

86
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,300
I'm showing signs of poisoning.

87
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,100
Let this video be proof

88
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,960
in case something happens to me.

89
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,340
Be my witness...

90
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,100
Jia?

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,700
Sir!

92
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,640
Boss!

93
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,220
Sir!

94
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,520
Help me out!

95
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,559
Wake up!

96
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,260
What did you give me?

97
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,620
I'm telling you,

98
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,140
I'm going to post this online!

99
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,420
You'll pay for this!

100
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,720
We'll take responsibility,

101
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,280
but let's get you to the hospital first.

102
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,840
Jia, what's going on?

103
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,720
I don't know! What should we do, Summer?

104
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,160
Smell this.

105
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,580
Let's go check it out.

106
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,740
Let's go. Hurry.

107
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,000
Selling baskets,

108
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,140
picking up coal cinders,

109
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,780
carrying water, chopping wood.

110
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,960
You're here.

111
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,360
Mixing liquor and coffee is dangerous.

112
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,880
This is common knowledge.

113
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,500
[But since it happened in our shop,]

114
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,560
we'll cover your hospital fees.

115
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,300
How about that?

116
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,700
What do you mean?

117
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,940
I drank your coffee and ended up here.

118
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,580
What now,

119
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,440
trying to shirk responsibility?

120
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,920
You've made a fake food poisoning.

121
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,040
Do you wanna discuss about

122
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,520
responsibility at the police?

123
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,980
Oh,

124
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,920
trying to threaten me?

125
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,900
[I'm just a tourist]

126
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,680
and you did this to me!

127
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,320
None of you

128
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
[are getting away]

129
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,420
with this!

130
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,500
I'll report all of you!

131
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,020
You drank white liquor

132
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,420
and then had coffee at our shop.

133
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,780
- The liquor...
- Bad news!

134
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,060
We have bad news about the coffee shop!

135
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,920
How could?

136
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,920
Let's talk outside.

137
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,340
Serves them right!
