[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP14]

2
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:14,126
[Lin Qingyi.]

3
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:41,193
With your drinking capacity,

4
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,260
better take it easy.

5
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:48,593
I'm afraid you'll get drunk.

6
00:00:56,393 --> 00:00:58,426
Then I'll have to trouble you,

7
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,793
our esteemed writer.

8
00:01:02,426 --> 00:01:03,326
You're welcome.

9
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:27,626
Do you know

10
00:01:29,193 --> 00:01:30,259
why I don't want

11
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:32,759
to leave here?

12
00:01:34,193 --> 00:01:35,159
Why?

13
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,026
When I was little,

14
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:48,259
I was

15
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:51,426
raised by my grandfather.

16
00:01:52,926 --> 00:01:56,159
[Qingyi, what's on your mind?]

17
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,393
[Grandpa, this year's typhoon is big,]

18
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,426
[and the harvest is bad.]

19
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,226
[People risk their lives going out to sea.]

20
00:02:07,226 --> 00:02:10,059
[Let's not charge rent this year.]

21
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,160
[Alright, I'll remember that.]

22
00:02:12,593 --> 00:02:13,859
[Grandpa,]

23
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:18,626
[I want to be]

24
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,026
[a strong man like you.]

25
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:23,426
[Good.]

26
00:02:23,426 --> 00:02:25,826
You'll definitely be.

27
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,393
What?

28
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,193
Feeling motherly?

29
00:02:54,393 --> 00:02:55,259
Lin Qingyi,

30
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:57,859
you've done a great job.

31
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:28,526
Hello, welcome.

32
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,960
It really is you.

33
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:36,426
- What can I get for you...
- Did I ask you to speak?

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,960
[I'm not asking you.]

35
00:03:38,993 --> 00:03:40,793
Stop giving orders around here.

36
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:43,459
The exit's to your left.

37
00:03:44,193 --> 00:03:45,226
You know her?

38
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,859
No.

39
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,026
[Mr. Lin,]

40
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:51,126
[I'm here to talk about the relocation.]

41
00:03:51,326 --> 00:03:52,126
Leave.

42
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,793
Could you step aside for a moment?

43
00:04:01,193 --> 00:04:03,326
[Mr. Li, name your price.]

44
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:05,393
How much to leave here?

45
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,526
Do I look like someone who needs money?

46
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:11,126
Name your terms.

47
00:04:15,726 --> 00:04:19,126
Why is she talking to our boss?

48
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:22,859
Isn't this place rented?

49
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:27,326
If I'm not wrong,

50
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,326
80% of the properties here

51
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,926
belong to our boss, the one sitting there

52
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:37,826
looking like everyone

53
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,526
owes him millions.

54
00:04:43,393 --> 00:04:44,726
You mean,

55
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,726
the coffee guy,

56
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:48,826
our boss?

57
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,926
That's why there's

58
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:54,659
only one coffee shop on the whole island.

59
00:04:58,326 --> 00:05:01,626
So it's a monopoly.

60
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,759
Fine,

61
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:04,993
my condition is,

62
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:07,726
stay as far away from me as possible.

63
00:05:07,993 --> 00:05:09,059
Don't bother me.

64
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,560
Jia,

65
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,960
see her out.

66
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,760
[Sure thing.]

67
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:15,559
We'll see about that.

68
00:05:46,826 --> 00:05:47,859
Nothing.

69
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,193
Yes, send it over.

70
00:06:15,393 --> 00:06:20,059
My sister's really lucky.
