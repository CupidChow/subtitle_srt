1
00:00:06,593 --> 00:00:08,659
[Qingyi, please, come in.]

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,993
What brings you here?

3
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:11,826
You're a Lin too?

4
00:00:11,826 --> 00:00:14,659
What, never seen a Lin before?

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,926
Here's the thing:

6
00:00:16,126 --> 00:00:19,726
here, eight out of ten people are Lins.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,026
But he isn't the one you're looking for.

8
00:00:23,026 --> 00:00:24,826
With that shabby look,

9
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:26,826
he definitely isn't.

10
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:30,926
I'll be back.

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,793
People from Zhu Group

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,326
sure are persistent.

13
00:00:36,326 --> 00:00:38,993
Persistence alone isn't enough.

14
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:44,193
[Oh, the girl you brought last time]

15
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:45,659
isn't from our island.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,660
Send her back to find her family.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,326
[You're not...]

18
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:54,426
Don't take the wrong path.

19
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,560
I know.

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,760
I'll need your help then.

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,193
No need to be so polite.

22
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:05,393
Just stay on the right path.

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,280
[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP06]

24
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:09,393
Look, it's already noon.

25
00:01:09,393 --> 00:01:11,959
Why not stay for lunch?

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,393
No, there's someone at home

27
00:01:14,993 --> 00:01:15,959
waiting to be fed.

28
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:21,959
Interesting.

29
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:24,393
Treating so nice to Jia?

30
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,426
I want to see what this madman is up to.

31
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:36,626
The store is in your hands.

32
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:38,026
Don't worry.

33
00:01:38,026 --> 00:01:38,759
You sure you can handle it?

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,626
Of course,

35
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:41,993
everyone in the area knows my reputation.

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,260
Since you don't have a cell phone,

37
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,993
there's a landline here.

38
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:45,759
Dial 1 to reach the boss.

39
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,926
Got it, don't worry.

40
00:01:47,026 --> 00:01:48,326
Wait for me.

41
00:01:48,326 --> 00:01:49,259
I'm coming.

42
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,560
Take it easy, Jia.

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,793
Waiter!

44
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,726
Hello, sir. How can I help you?

45
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,726
Is this even coffee?

46
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,226
Even a dog wouldn't drink it!

47
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:03,026
Uh...

48
00:02:03,026 --> 00:02:04,226
maybe our coffee

49
00:02:04,226 --> 00:02:05,726
doesn't suit your taste.

50
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:06,793
How about this,

51
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,526
these two cups are on the house?

52
00:02:08,926 --> 00:02:10,026
What do you mean?

53
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:14,959
You think I'm here for charity?

54
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,193
Then... what would you suggest?

55
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:23,226
I have a headache and feel nauseous!

56
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:26,393
[I want ten times the medical expenses!]

57
00:02:26,726 --> 00:02:28,926
- Ten times!
- Sir,

58
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:30,759
are you trying to extort us?

59
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:33,459
If you're not satisfied with my solution,

60
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,726
- I'll call the police.
- Hey, stop.

61
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:38,226
No need for the police.

62
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:42,059
If you don't want to pay,

63
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,593
then serve us properly.

64
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,326
Serve you, my ass!

65
00:02:45,326 --> 00:02:47,559
Stupid woman! Let me teach you a lesson!

66
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:50,393
Do it!

67
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,060
- We... we didn't...
- Get lost!

68
00:02:58,726 --> 00:02:59,793
I'm fine.

69
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:02,159
Are you okay?

70
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:04,393
I'm totally fine.

71
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:11,459
Tell me, what happened?

72
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:14,559
Some bored thugs

73
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,860
causing trouble.

74
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,226
An innocent girl almost got hurt.

75
00:03:22,726 --> 00:03:23,826
[Wow, so you were]

76
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:26,959
pretending to be a damsel in distress?

77
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,326
Who's pretending?

78
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,826
It's called natural talent.

79
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,226
Maybe I was a special forces soldier.

80
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,026
Don't disgrace the country.

81
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:39,626
Next time, think before you act.

82
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,160
Got it.

83
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:55,393
What are you doing?

84
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,993
You kept staring at me,

85
00:03:57,993 --> 00:04:00,026
so now I'm giving you a closer look.

86
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,460
Hmm?

87
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:02,926
Hmm?

88
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,526
Director Zhen said you're not from here.

89
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:16,059
He'll take you off the island tomorrow.

90
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:19,326
Oh.

91
00:04:23,826 --> 00:04:24,626
[Here.]

92
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:51,559
Wearing a suit and looking all flashy?

93
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,993
Yes, you, turn around.

94
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,460
Hi, nice to...

95
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,160
[Looking for someone,]

96
00:05:03,226 --> 00:05:05,226
[yet your call sounded like a scam.]

97
00:05:05,226 --> 00:05:07,259
As a weak woman, I had to be cautious.

98
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:10,526
Don't be ridiculous, a weak woman?

99
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:12,959
Ouch.

100
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,060
I don't remember the transfer.

101
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,059
I serve hundreds of customers daily.

102
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,560
Do you have a photo?

103
00:05:24,593 --> 00:05:25,393
No.

104
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:30,226
There was a news story

105
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:32,659
about a psycho who loved a girl,

106
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,326
then imprisoned her.

107
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,826
Do you think you're a psycho?

108
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,660
Just help me keep an eye out.

109
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,726
I'll be staying here for a while.

110
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:54,459
Look for someone who stands out,

111
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,226
elegant but with a dangerous edge.

112
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,593
What kind of description is that?

113
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,793
I'll hand her over to the police,

114
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:05,859
not some to-be pervert like you.

115
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:07,993
I can hear you.

116
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:11,393
Good, I'm talking to you.

117
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:15,593
Fine,

118
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,826
as long as you find her.

119
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,593
[What's up?]

120
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,060
I got you a new phone

121
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,393
and saved my number in it.

122
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,060
I also bought some...

123
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,026
[I don't need it. Take it back, thanks.]

124
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,526
Boss, why are you alone?

125
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,559
[Where's Summer?]

126
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:45,326
She went back.

127
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:47,193
What?

128
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:49,259
Back where?

129
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,760
Did you send her away?

130
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,193
Why?

131
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:56,259
You said you wouldn't do that.

132
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:04,059
- Hello?
- [Qingyi,]

133
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:05,659
[I couldn't find Summer!]
