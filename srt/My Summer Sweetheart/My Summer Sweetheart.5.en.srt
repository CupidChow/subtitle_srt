1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,640
Wait!

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,980
Wait up!

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,740
Are you mad at me?

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,520
Don't you have any shame?

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,240
You just cling to strangers?

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,980
I know I should find my family,

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,300
but they're strangers to me too.

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,360
You're the first person I saw,

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,220
the only one

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,800
I can hold onto.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
What about your family?

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,880
They must be worried sick.

13
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,200
Hungry?

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,540
Forget it.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,900
Yes,

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,520
I'm starving!

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,000
Follow me.

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,480
Boss, why are you here so late?

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,880
[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP05]

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,680
Hi.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,620
I'm...

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,660
I know,

23
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,960
the boss's wife, right?

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,980
Not yet.

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,180
She has amnesia,

26
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,180
basically clueless.

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,360
[She's staying with us for now.]

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,920
I just have amnesia,

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,980
I'm not dumb.

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,660
Amnesia?

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,800
Do you remember me?

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,080
We've met before.

33
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,580
No.

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,860
What should I call you?

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,260
Call me Jia.

36
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,380
Okay.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,140
This is too bland.

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,960
[Did you forget the seasoning?]

39
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,820
You're so picky.

40
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,000
Boss, you're such a hypocrite.

41
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,600
You said this place is all about elegance

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,960
and no hot food allowed.

43
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,720
I can

44
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,200
do what

45
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,260
I want.

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,540
[Any objections?]

47
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,200
[No,]

48
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,360
[I wouldn't dare.]

49
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,840
Where will you stay?

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,880
Our place is small

51
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,200
and cramped.

52
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,180
Oh,

53
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,480
the boss's place is spacious.

54
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,360
You've got it all figured out, huh?

55
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,660
See,

56
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,060
he didn't say no.

57
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,180
Be careful at night.

58
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,420
I hear men transform late at night.

59
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,400
You little kid, what do you know?

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,240
For someone so knowledgeable,

61
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,480
you don't seem to have much experience.

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,260
Just a show-off!

63
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,860
How about calling me Summer?

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,000
Why Summer?

65
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,380
Because it's summer now.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,520
I don't know when I'll regain my memory,

67
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,340
so let's say

68
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,820
I'm a summer special.

69
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,360
[How's that?]

70
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,300
You're full of ideas.

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,500
So cheesy.

72
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,760
Then give me a name.

73
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,720
Such a bother.

74
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,980
Mr. Lin,

75
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,700
with a house like this,

76
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,940
you still run a coffee shop?

77
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,660
Over here.

78
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:01,480
Oh,

79
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,260
coming.

80
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,920
You can stay here for now.

81
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,400
Buy whatever you need.

82
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,980
Thanks, Mr., Lin.

83
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,680
I don't have anything valuable,

84
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,120
but I'll give you this bracelet.

85
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,940
[I can help you out too.]

86
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,200
Whatever.

87
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,100
Let's eat.

88
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,620
I wanted to ask you,

89
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,800
why didn't I see a single coffee shop

90
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,500
on my way here this morning?

91
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,420
Ours is the only coffee shop here.

92
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,280
Is our boss

93
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,880
monopolizing the market?

94
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,280
[They just can't compete with me.]

95
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,040
For real?

96
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,520
I've developed a new coffee.

97
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,260
Want to try it?

98
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:41,940
Yes,

99
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,640
I'll try.

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,460
- I'll do it.
- No,

101
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,200
not me.

102
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,080
If Summer wants to,

103
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,640
she can.

104
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,780
Seeing your reactions,

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
I'm not stupid.

106
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,900
I refuse.

107
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,840
Refusal denied.

108
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,200
It's your job.

109
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,360
Thanks for your kindness.

110
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,820
I will remember it.

111
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,040
It's just a cup of coffee.

112
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,740
It won't kill me, right?

113
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,540
Hello, who is this?

114
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,020
[Where are you?]

115
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,420
Who are you?

116
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,740
Why do you care?

117
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,220
[Send me your address.]

118
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,680
Dude,

119
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,360
what's wrong with you?

120
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,420
If you're sick, go to the hospital

121
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,240
and leave me alone!

122
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,660
What's up?

123
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,060
No idea, some nutcase.

124
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,260
Try it.

125
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,080
Okay.

126
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,080
Smells good.

127
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,140
Wipe it off.

128
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,420
You really have to experience it

129
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,160
to understand.

130
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,700
Boss,

131
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,400
[let me]

132
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,640
[give you some advice.]

133
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,160
Consider a career change

134
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,220
[while you still can.]

135
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,920
I'm going out.

136
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,820
Take care, Boss.

137
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,040
Call me if you need anything.

138
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,580
Why are you so naggy today?

139
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,500
Just go.

140
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,660
Don't worry,

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,740
it can't be worse than your coffee.

142
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,500
Bye.

143
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,500
Jia,

144
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,560
you knew...

145
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,200
Eat up.

146
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,940
I'm going to wash the cups.

147
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,800
Miss,

148
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,120
[I told you]

149
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,840
[I won't disclose personal information.]

150
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,800
Asking a million times

151
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,780
won't change that.

152
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,340
Well,

153
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,600
name your price.

154
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,360
Why aren't you

155
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,340
as polite as the last person

156
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,360
who came?

157
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,760
You're just a gatekeeper.

158
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,640
Don't overstep.

159
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,540
Mr. Lin, you're here.

160
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:23,920
[Please,]

161
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,820
[come in.]

162
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,100
You're a Lin too?

163
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,680
What,

164
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,960
never seen a Lin before?
