1
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,760
It's been three days.

2
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,540
Haven't you ever slept before?

3
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,640
This is...

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,640
[Where am I?]

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,480
And

6
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,980
why am I here?

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,000
Quit your act.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,240
Still trying to scam me?

9
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,700
Sir,

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,480
your wife's hippocampus has suffered

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,680
a severe blow,

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,880
which might cause temporary amnesia.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,860
[She might recover tomorrow]

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,420
[or it could]

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,180
[take longer.]

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,160
Why do I care?

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,240
Where are you going?

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,980
Aren't I your wife?

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,760
[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP04]

20
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,520
You're just someone

21
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,840
I happened to save.

22
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,620
Let go!

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,960
No!

24
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,300
Get down!

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,920
I won't!

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,040
Get down now!

27
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,580
You're the only person I know.

28
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,820
You can't leave me.

29
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,040
Get down now!

30
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,640
Fine.

31
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,020
Ms. Zhu is missing.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,440
[To prevent panic in Zhu Group,]

33
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,360
we need

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,620
someone to temporarily step in as CEO.

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,800
I agree.

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,880
We still haven't found her,

37
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,420
so...

38
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,600
[I suggest]

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,760
[Deputy GM Zhu]

40
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,980
[temporarily take over the CEO position.]

41
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,820
If word gets out

42
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,900
about her disappearance,

43
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,160
[it'll be a golden opportunity for those]

44
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,320
[looking to cause trouble.]

45
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,000
Mr. Shen is right.

46
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,760
We'll

47
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,000
tell everyone

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,520
Ms. Zhu is on an overseas business trip.

49
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,700
We'll deal with

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,260
everything else once we have more info.

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,500
Alright,

52
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,160
let's leave it at that.

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,259
The Aman Island development can't wait.

54
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,620
I'll handle it for now.

55
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,880
[Well,]

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,480
[any objections?]

57
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,360
Alright, meeting adjourned.

58
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,160
Dismissed!

59
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,280
Jinchuan.

60
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,580
Jinchuan,

61
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,580
why were you targeting me today?

62
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,880
Did I do something wrong?

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,780
Shen Jinchuan,

64
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,120
what's your problem?

65
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,000
Zhu Anran, was it you?

66
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,020
You really think I'm that kind of person?

67
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,580
Do you know why I entertain everyone

68
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,140
but can never accept you?

69
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,320
Because I'm an illegitimate child,

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
you all look down on me.

71
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,740
If I had the same status as Zhu Jinhao,

72
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,800
would you still treat me like this?

73
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,460
[You're wrong.]

74
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,860
It's because of your scheming heart.

75
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,460
Shen Jinchuan!

76
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,700
Trying too hard isn't a good look.

77
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,380
Why so worked up?

78
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,060
Let me tell you,

79
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,340
without Zhu Jinhao,

80
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,300
you can't handle Zhu Group.

81
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,780
Shen Jinchuan!

82
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,200
I'm telling you,

83
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,640
you can't leave me.

84
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,280
Dressed like that,

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,200
if I dump you on the street,

86
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,880
people would avoid you.

87
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,200
So

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,600
you won't leave me, right?

89
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,420
Depends on my mood.

90
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,300
Go change your clothes first.

91
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,880
Okay.

92
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,860
How about this one?

93
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,820
Why,

94
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,720
do you want me to help you change?

95
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,720
Now you can't peek.

96
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,440
I trust you're a gentleman

97
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,780
who won't sneak a look.

98
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,360
Well?

99
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,320
How do I look?

100
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,640
Just a tiny bit

101
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,800
better than before.

102
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,560
This girl looks familiar.

103
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,520
Have I seen her before?

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,720
Can't remember.

105
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,600
Director,

106
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,960
I'm here to place a missing person ad,

107
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,420
not to show you a mule.

108
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,640
Right.

109
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,280
Director,

110
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,900
with a face like mine,

111
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,700
you wouldn't forget

112
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,820
if you'd seen it.

113
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,860
True.

114
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,200
Director,

115
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,140
I'm leaving her in your care.

116
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,260
I've got to go.

117
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,580
Where are you going? I'm coming with you.

118
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,080
I'm going home.

119
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,400
Right now,

120
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,580
I'm also trying to find you a home.

121
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,440
Have you lost your mind?

122
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,880
Director, look at him!

123
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,360
You've got to help me!

124
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,340
Actually, I'm his distant fiancée,

125
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,060
but he doesn't want me anymore...

126
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,680
Director,

127
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,120
said she's not right in the head.

128
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,920
You need to find someone to take her.

129
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,020
Director,

130
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,080
he's just shy.

131
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,640
We won't trouble you anymore.

132
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,720
Thank you, Director.

133
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,740
Darling,

134
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,460
wait for me!

135
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,020
You said she contacted you earlier?

136
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,100
At that time, Ms. Zhu

137
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,380
asked me to transfer money to this number.

138
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,700
Here, take a look.

139
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,980
Send me this number.

140
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,340
I'm going to Aman Island.

141
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,140
Yes, sir.
