[My Summer Sweetheart]
[EP11]

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,660
Last night, did you two...

3
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,560
um...?

4
00:00:22,993 --> 00:00:25,526
What do you mean? I don't understand.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,526
You two have been acting strange today.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,560
If you say you fought,

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,160
your eyes keep meeting.

8
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:36,226
[But when meet, you quickly look away.]

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,426
Come on, Summer,

10
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:43,926
just tell me. I'm so curious.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,226
Stop being so nosy.

12
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,959
Boss, why did you pay us already?

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,226
And did you give me extra?

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,593
How much did you get? Let me see.

15
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:12,459
Even though the business failed,

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,926
you guys were the victims.

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,526
[This is compensation.]

18
00:01:19,193 --> 00:01:23,793
Boss, you really know how

19
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,593
[to treat the ladies.]

20
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:29,659
Thanks to you,

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,460
from now on, you're like my sister.

22
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,060
That table left. Go clean up.

23
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:38,659
Alright, I won't bother you two anymore.

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,660
Come here.

25
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,526
What?

26
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:48,526
What?

27
00:01:58,393 --> 00:01:59,193
Wait...

28
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:04,259
I handled it last night,

29
00:02:04,826 --> 00:02:06,793
but you need to apply this ointment.

30
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:09,426
I can do it myself.

31
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:14,726
I'm afraid you'll fall asleep.

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,326
Is it done?

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,960
All done.

34
00:02:29,726 --> 00:02:30,626
Thanks.

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,060
Remember anything?

36
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:43,593
Not at all.

37
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:46,193
I'll get back to work.

38
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:52,793
Welcome...

39
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:57,959
How did you find this place?

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,793
This is the only coffee shop here.

41
00:03:01,226 --> 00:03:02,559
[It wasn't hard.]

42
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,626
What do you want?

43
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,760
What do you think?

44
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,660
I'm here to be your God.

45
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:11,259
We don't welcome just anyone.

46
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,560
Want to act like a God, go elsewhere.

47
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,260
- Watch your hands.
- Jia, what's wrong?

48
00:03:16,393 --> 00:03:18,359
That table is waiting for their latte.

49
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,860
I'll check.

50
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,760
What...

51
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:25,993
what are you doing?

52
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:26,826
Boss, help!

53
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:28,426
Summer is being harassed!

54
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:29,959
Who are you? Let go of me!

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,926
[Who are you?]

56
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,193
Jia, call the police!

57
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,726
- Okay.
- Wait a second.

58
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,226
You said you've been looking for me.

59
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:43,126
[Do you know me?]

60
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:46,026
I had an accident recently

61
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,360
and don't remember much.

62
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:51,926
Sorry.

63
00:03:51,926 --> 00:03:54,126
We just met briefly last night.

64
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:56,193
[You should]

65
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,026
remember me.

66
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:09,059
Oh, you're the one

67
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,793
who spoke up for us at the party.

68
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:11,826
That's right.

69
00:04:12,826 --> 00:04:15,559
Thank you for that.

70
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,226
Can't you see we're busy?

71
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:20,393
Get to work!

72
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:26,059
This God, do you...

73
00:04:27,793 --> 00:04:29,393
I'll have another Con Panna.

74
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,960
I really enjoyed

75
00:04:31,226 --> 00:04:34,393
- the one I had yesterday.
- Sure.

76
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:41,793
She only makes coffee for me.

77
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:42,859
Oh, really?

78
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:45,393
Then I'm lucky

79
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:49,526
to have had the Con Panna you made.

80
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:50,626
And

81
00:04:51,193 --> 00:04:53,026
the toffee was really sweet.

82
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,193
Our boss makes all the coffee here,

83
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,226
so it's always unique. Want to try?

84
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,160
Since you put it that way,

85
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,593
I'll give it a shot.

86
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,726
No seating at the bar.

87
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:16,526
It's off-limits.

88
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,460
Alright.

89
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:31,126
Boss,

90
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:32,726
is there anything I can help with?

91
00:05:33,926 --> 00:05:37,993
Make me a Con Panna right now.

92
00:05:40,393 --> 00:05:43,359
For that customer?

93
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:48,626
What's going on?

94
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:51,126
Boss, are you jealous?

95
00:05:56,393 --> 00:05:59,026
Alright, I'll make it for you, okay?

96
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,726
Boss,

97
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:07,126
one Con Panna, please.

98
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Boss.

99
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:15,226
Obviously,

100
00:06:15,226 --> 00:06:17,526
[that guy is trying to steal your girl.]

101
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,026
I wouldn't tolerate it.

102
00:06:25,793 --> 00:06:26,593
Take it over.

103
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,060
Alright.

104
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:35,726
[Here's your coffee.]

105
00:06:35,793 --> 00:06:37,459
Enjoy, God.

106
00:06:37,726 --> 00:06:38,526
You may leave.

107
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,126
A special Con Panna with extra love.

108
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:53,326
Seems like something's missing.

109
00:06:57,926 --> 00:06:58,726
Here.

110
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,460
Open your mouth.

111
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,060
How is it,

112
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:16,426
sweet?

113
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:17,826
Sweet.

114
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,426
Enjoy your drink. I have work to do.

115
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:37,526
What is this?

116
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:38,459
This coffee

117
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,926
tastes awful!

118
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,026
This is our boss's special blend.

119
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,793
The flavor is unique.

120
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,226
You might not be used to it.

121
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:51,959
Actually, I'm here

122
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:53,593
to see you.

123
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:56,059
Why?

124
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,460
Yesterday, I didn't

125
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,193
consider your perspective.

126
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,860
[To apologize,]

127
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,593
[I'd like to take you out for dinner.]

128
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:05,259
No need for dinner.

129
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,826
But if we don't have dinner,

130
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,560
how can I pursue you?

131
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:13,926
What's going on?

132
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,593
[Listen,]

133
00:08:17,626 --> 00:08:22,026
I want to pursue Summer.

134
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:38,126
This is getting interesting!
