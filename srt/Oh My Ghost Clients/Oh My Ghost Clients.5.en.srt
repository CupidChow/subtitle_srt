1
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,380
LOCAL SHUTTLE BUS

2
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,725
Why are you doing this to me?

3
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,435
Doing what?

4
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,856
The contract period isn't over yet,
and I've been helping all those ghosts.

5
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,150
So why do you keep trying to kill me?

6
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,276
Me?

7
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,612
I'm always saving you.

8
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:18,203
The one about to kill you
isn't me but the dozing bus driver.

9
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,081
And the bus driver is only dozing

10
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:25,210
because they're supposed to get
a 15-minute break every two hours,

11
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,921
but the tight bus schedule
doesn't allow for that,

12
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:31,633
nor is a 15-minute break
enough rest to begin with.

13
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:36,304
In other words,
what is killing you is how the system--

14
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,057
I get that the system needs to change,

15
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,393
but why not go
to an influential politician then?

16
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,937
Why a labor attorney like me?

17
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,148
Why me, of all people?

18
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,984
Why do you think?

19
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,488
I'm asking because I don't know!

20
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,740
Is this your idea of fun?

21
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,077
If I'm going to be punished,
I should at least know why!

22
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,038
Then,

23
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,457
give it some thought.

24
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:06,668
What?

25
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,882
- Big brother!
- Mu-jin!

26
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:13,925
Are you okay?

27
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,135
Are you hurt?

28
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,762
What in the world? That was too close.

29
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,932
Hey, mister, are you crazy?
You almost killed him!

30
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,268
I'm so sorry. I really am.

31
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,894
I nodded off for a second.

32
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,772
You're not hurt, sir, are you?

33
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,819
It's fine. You're not to blame.
It's the system that's broken.

34
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,696
Sorry?

35
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,365
Did you hurt your head?

36
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,491
I'm fine.

37
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,077
Let's go.

38
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,579
But…

39
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,124
Sir, please be careful!
Don't fall asleep at the wheel.

40
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,625
I'm sorry.

41
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,127
Mu-jin!

42
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,216
What? Assembly member?

43
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,428
Have you been possessed
by a failed politician this time?

44
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,347
To change the system,
I need to go into politics.

45
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,600
Otherwise, I'll keep
getting used like this.

46
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:07,270
I guess escaping death a few times
makes you lose all sense of reality.

47
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,397
You're saying the craziest things now.

48
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:14,444
That's not a bad concept.

49
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,572
"Assemblyman No Mu-jin,
former labor attorney." It works well.

50
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:20,450
Not you too. You think just anyone
can become a politician?

51
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,620
Just anyone? Why am I just anyone?
Am I just anyone to you?

52
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,954
Not your brother-in-law?

53
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,831
- No, that's not…
- Just anyone? Huh?

54
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,874
Big brother?

55
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,208
I have faith in you.

56
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,962
You're more than capable.
If you decide to run, I'll support--

57
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,297
God, seriously.

58
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,507
I only said it out of frustration.

59
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,134
I see.

60
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,388
Yes, just anyone speaking. I mean…

61
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,725
Yes, Dad. What is it?

62
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,439
What?

63
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,905
Jesus Christ, you scared me!

64
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,865
Why are you so startled?

65
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,494
Aren't you going to say hello
to your big brother?

66
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,790
Yeah, well. How are you?

67
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,667
Why are you being so awkward?

68
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,055
Hey, you look a little rough.

69
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,057
Is it because Mi-joo left?

70
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,726
Geez.

71
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,187
You should treat her better, dumbass.

72
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,612
Where's Mom?

73
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,780
Not home yet.

74
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,200
Hey, what is it?

75
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,288
Did Dad call you to say that
Mom might be having an affair?

76
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,664
Wait, you know too?

77
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,834
He said Mom's been
acting a little strange.

78
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,294
God, seriously.

79
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,298
Is he suddenly getting paranoid
about his wife at his age?

80
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,134
So what exactly are you planning to do?

81
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,595
Ask her, "Mom, are you having an affair?"

82
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,181
I don't know.

83
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,809
Well, honestly, I understand.

84
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,269
Understand what?

85
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,856
She's struggled her whole life
after marrying that unromantic man.

86
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,525
She should live a little now.

87
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,403
Like Mi-joo, don't you think?

88
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,655
Are you kidding me?

89
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,453
- Were you reading a comic?
- Yeah.

90
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,662
You know something?

91
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,333
Lounging around and reading comics
has always been my dream.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,293
So, are you happy?

93
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,335
I am.

94
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,549
All I did was work myself to death.
Can't I take it easy for once?

95
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,636
Of course you can. By all means, go ahead.

96
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,472
What's up with you?

97
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,558
You used to look down on me
for working construction.

98
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:55,396
Hey, you've changed
since becoming a labor attorney.

99
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,900
When did I ever look down on you?

100
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,946
What the…

101
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:04,947
What in the…

102
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,491
Whose dog is this?

103
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,576
No idea. Mom brought her from somewhere.

104
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,120
I didn't even know she was here.

105
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,456
You're a cutie. Yes, you are.

106
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,798
What's your name?

107
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,008
Going somewhere?

108
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,802
I have places to be.

109
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,181
Hey, you haven't come home in a while,

110
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:32,600
so hang out with Mom,
eat with her, then go.

111
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,270
Hey.

112
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,397
What?

113
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,400
See you next time.

114
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,195
You can be such a goof sometimes.

115
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,830
Hey, Mom.

116
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,374
Goodness, who do we have here?

117
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,585
What are you doing home,
Mr. Labor Attorney?

118
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,505
Can't a guy come home
to visit his parents?

119
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,799
Are you bored because Mi-joo's left you?

120
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,760
Geez, Mom.
Do you have to say it like that too?

121
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,730
Hello.

122
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,608
Who are you talking to?

123
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,449
No one.

124
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,748
Wow, Salt.

125
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,128
You stayed quiet all this time
when you knew how to bark like this?

126
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,010
You can't tell me your name?

127
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:56,684
If you won't tell me your name,
why you died, or what grudge you hold,

128
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,394
how am I supposed to help you?

129
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,232
Of course, if you don't need my help,
I don't have to.

130
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,652
But I have my reasons too.

131
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,409
By the way,
how did you know where to find me?

132
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,793
Is that dog yours?

133
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,634
Is there really nothing
you want to say to me?

134
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,477
Goodness me!

135
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,187
Mom!

136
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,815
Why are you in here talking to yourself?

137
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,859
Like you've lost it.

138
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,446
- Come outside and eat.
- Okay, I will.

139
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,700
Goodness.

140
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,954
Even she's being weird today.

141
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,122
Honestly!

142
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:07,505
<i>With the torch of radiant truth</i>

143
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:13,177
<i>Held high and shining bright</i>

144
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:19,725
<i>This hall of wisdom</i>

145
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,646
<i>Fills the world with light</i>

146
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,320
Someone who died?

147
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,366
Yeah. I was just wondering
if anyone you knew passed away recently.

148
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,786
Someone did.

149
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,414
Poor Yeong-suk.

150
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,752
So her name is Yeong-suk?

151
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,301
It's her, right?

152
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,555
She's short and petite,
with short hair and big eyes.

153
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:58,973
She has a mole by her nose.

154
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,143
How do you know that?
You've never met her before.

155
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,937
Oh, come on.

156
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,816
Ladies your age are all petite
with big eyes and short hair.

157
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,318
You have a mole too.

158
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,241
By the way, how do you know her?

159
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,577
She was my coworker.

160
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,539
Why are you asking that all of a sudden?

161
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,543
Well, a friend of mine said

162
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,047
his mom's friends
were passing away one by one,

163
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,798
so she's been feeling lonely.

164
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,343
He told me to check in on my mom more.

165
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:38,971
You don't have any friends.

166
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,890
I do!

167
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,266
Sure you do.

168
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,689
Were you two close?

169
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,233
Some kind of grudge between you…

170
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,903
is unlikely.

171
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,448
Did you go through something with her?

172
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,867
We went through a lot together.

173
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,703
We worked together for over ten years.

174
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,330
Really?

175
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,168
Why did she pass away?

176
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,462
Did she get in an accident
at the university?

177
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,130
No way.

178
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,174
She died of a heart attack.

179
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,135
- A heart attack?
- Yes.

180
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,888
She's never done
anything like that before,

181
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,475
but she didn't show up to work
or answer her phone.

182
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,229
So I went to her house
to check on her, and she was…

183
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,274
slumped over her desk, dead.

184
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:36,237
You were the one who found her?
That must've been such a shock.

185
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,196
Gosh.

186
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,699
My heart's still pounding even now.

187
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,745
So much for having a good night.

188
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,333
That puppy there…

189
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,378
Yeong-suk was raising her by herself.

190
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,712
But after she passed,

191
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,882
there was no one to look after her,
so I brought her here.

192
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:02,638
Your dad likes dogs too,
and she'll be less lonely.

193
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:10,020
She's a little weird, but she doesn't bark
and plays fine on her own.

194
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,023
I miss Ppokku.

195
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,111
They say death comes without warning,

196
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:22,199
but how could she be fine one minute
then suddenly gone the next?

197
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,495
So you should be good to me.

198
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,247
Where'd that come from?

199
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,791
Don't be sorry after I'm already gone!

200
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,501
Come on, geez.

201
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,879
And be good to Mi-joo as well.

202
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,005
God, please…

203
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:40,551
Then you'll be able to reunite with Ppokku
or Ppokko or whatever her name is.

204
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,720
How long are you going to keep this up?

205
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,597
Why are we suddenly on that subject?

206
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,766
- Seriously.
- Because you're frustrating me!

207
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:53,689
Goodness me, look at you,
picking out all the green onions again.

208
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:56,275
How old do you think you are?

209
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:58,986
Want more soup?

210
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,821
No, I'm done. God.

211
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,533
Fine, but just a little bit.
No green onions.

212
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,661
You should take better care of yourself.

213
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:12,666
You're looking skinnier
every time I see you.

214
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,128
You shouldn't eat just whatever
because you're alone.

215
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,302
Finish all of it.

216
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,970
It's a soup of doom.

217
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,857
<i>For the past three months or so,</i>
<i>every other Saturday,</i>

218
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,485
<i>your mom's been waking up early,</i>

219
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:44,532
<i>dolling up her face, dressing in clothes</i>
<i>she never wears, and going out.</i>

220
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,789
When I ask her where she's going,
she just mumbles excuses.

221
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:58,921
<i>I'm working day and night,</i>
<i>so I can't follow her myself.</i>

222
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,466
<i>I need you to find out for me, okay?</i>

223
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,053
<i>I want to know</i>
<i>what she's been getting up to.</i>

224
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:07,972
Eun-ja.

225
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:09,807
Jang-geun.

226
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,226
- Goodness, what is this?
- You look nice today.

227
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,143
Oh, please.

228
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,313
- Let's go.
- Dress like this more often.

229
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,273
Oh, honestly.

230
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,108
- Let's go.
- Okay.

231
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,654
Eun-ja!

232
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,114
- Eun-ja!
- Jang-geun!

233
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,856
Let me remind you again.

234
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,233
You must follow
the dress code we announced.

235
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,151
Yes, go on in.

236
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,612
- Button up, please.
- This way, ma'am.

237
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,241
I told you before not to wear sneakers.

238
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,453
Excuse me. Hold on a sec.

239
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,579
Come this way.

240
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,747
- Me?
- This way.

241
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,789
Okay.

242
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:21,170
I clearly said to wear formal attire
matching our school's prestige.

243
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,505
Yes, so I came in formal attire.

244
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,007
What is that?

245
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,342
You've got a stain.

246
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,677
And it's missing a button.
Just like last time.

247
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,887
How did this get on me?

248
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,806
I've reminded you countless times before,

249
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,726
but if this is the most effort
you're willing to make,

250
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,228
are you even serious about working here?

251
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,230
Of course I'm serious about…

252
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:44,026
This is exactly why people look down
on you for being a custodian, isn't it?

253
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,244
I apologize.

254
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,622
I'm going to be watching you.

255
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:58,958
Go inside.

256
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,798
JOB KNOWLEDGE TEST FOR CUSTODIAL STAFF

257
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,175
Please pass the test papers behind you.

258
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,268
Please pass them behind you right away.

259
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,564
Let's pick up the pace.
Pass them on quickly, please.

260
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,945
Anyone who comes in after this point
will be disqualified.

261
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,906
Quickly now, pass them on.

262
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,659
Okay, everyone ready?

263
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,329
In that case,
we'll begin the routine knowledge test.

264
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,497
- Screen on.
- Excuse me.

265
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,293
About Park Geon-yeong from Liberal Arts,
her husband was hospitalized yesterday,

266
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,130
and she was up all night
looking after him,

267
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,923
so she says she'll be a bit late.

268
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,216
NO RECORDINGS

269
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:55,139
We are…

270
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,976
We are employees
of the most prestigious university,

271
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:03,564
so we must carry ourselves
with the mindset, conduct,

272
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,151
lifestyle, and character
befitting our school's reputation.

273
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:12,948
That is what I've told you
time and again, if you recall.

274
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:19,997
This knowledge test has been conducted
for over three months now,

275
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,584
and anyone who fails to show up
or comes late, regardless of the reason,

276
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,003
has no right to work

277
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:30,215
at this ivory tower of knowledge,
this hall of wisdom.

278
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,510
That is what I think.

279
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:35,721
Do you agree?

280
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,312
I take it that you all agree,

281
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,106
so we will now begin
the routine knowledge test.

282
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,024
Ready the screen.

283
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:48,901
Now,

284
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,195
begin.

285
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,245
1. WRITE OUR UNIVERSITY'S NAME IN ENGLISH

286
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,625
This is an easy one.

287
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,252
It's basic stuff at this point.

288
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,887
No turning around, please.
What are you doing there?

289
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,016
All right, finish up now.

290
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,144
Okay, next question. Next slide.

291
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:29,108
"Write down what 'HUDL' stands for."

292
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,365
- H…
- You are all…

293
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,034
truly fortunate.

294
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,869
You work for a great employer.

295
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:46,291
You're basically receiving
lifelong education for free, aren't you?

296
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,169
Okay, time's running out.

297
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,551
Now, next question.

298
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,554
3. WRITE THIS IN KOREAN

299
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,266
Oh, what was it again?

300
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,496
Okay, time's up.
Put your pens down, please.

301
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,249
Put your pens down.

302
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,668
Pens down.

303
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,213
We'll start grading now.

304
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,217
Please grade it thoroughly.

305
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,302
Goodness me.

306
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,393
Oh my.

307
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,103
Please give it here.

308
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,607
Ms. Kim Yeong-suk,
please stand up for a moment.

309
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,983
Please stand up.

310
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,405
Goodness, you got everything wrong.

311
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,035
This basically says
you don't want to work here, right?

312
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,580
No, that's not true. I just…

313
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,664
I…

314
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,543
I don't know
any English or Chinese characters.

315
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,462
I don't know any of it.

316
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,671
Exactly.

317
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,715
That's why we're taking these tests.

318
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,218
So you can learn what you don't know.

319
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,304
We have many foreign students
and professors here

320
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,348
and English signs all around campus.

321
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:28,143
You should at least know how to read
some basic signs, don't you think?

322
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,102
No?

323
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,368
It means "where is the Central Library."

324
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,495
"Where is the Central Library."

325
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,457
You need to know
to at least point in the right direction.

326
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,336
You should try to keep up
in this age of globalization.

327
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,129
My God, you're hopeless.

328
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,258
Didn't you complete compulsory education?

329
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:03,679
Just… until citizen school.

330
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,348
Goodness, it's called
"elementary school" now.

331
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,309
Anyway, you failed, so that's a warning.

332
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,230
If you fail the next test, we can't work
with you anymore. Understood?

333
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,147
- Sit down.
- But…

334
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,817
Please just sit down.

335
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,029
Actually, stand up again.

336
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:28,161
I really didn't want to have to say this,

337
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,792
but I asked everyone to put on
something sophisticated for the tests.

338
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,878
What is this attire? It's so dreary.

339
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,549
You could use this opportunity to wear
something more elegant and classy.

340
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,591
Isn't that right?

341
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,052
Please sit down.

342
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,804
Sit down.

343
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:47,347
- But…
- Sit down!

344
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,602
- Eun-ja.
- It's okay.

345
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:37,606
Hey, do you know what "HUDL" stands for?

346
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:40,400
Huddle? Isn't that the thing
you jump over in a race?

347
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:44,237
Hey, it's
"Hankuk University Digital Library."

348
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,990
Who would know that?
I doubt even the students know.

349
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,410
If we give them
that many English questions,

350
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,120
would anyone even get them right?

351
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,039
It's meant to be hard for old folks.

352
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,875
I get so stressed out
coming up with all of them.

353
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,045
I get that we have to cut costs
and reduce staff,

354
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,339
but it just feels so underhanded.

355
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,926
Hey, you know
you can't just fire people nowadays.

356
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:09,096
I'm sure he doesn't want to spend
his Saturday like this either.

357
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,391
The manager's being pressured
from above too, so says la vie.

358
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,520
It's "c'est la vie," man.

359
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,022
I like that.
We should put that on the test.

360
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,316
- I bet they'll all get it wrong.
- Geez.

361
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,699
My goodness, are we in school?

362
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,659
Honestly.

363
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,327
I mean, I'm terrible at English.

364
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,620
Exactly.

365
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,622
- So if they do this…
- Mom.

366
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,421
What are you doing here?

367
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:51,429
How is this coffee so good?

368
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,557
What did you order?

369
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,351
Iced blonde vanilla double shot macchiato.

370
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,020
What kind of name is that complicated?

371
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,148
Tastes great though.

372
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,984
I ordered it,
thinking you've probably never had it.

373
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,652
I'm glad you like it.

374
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,320
Don't underestimate me.

375
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,240
- I've even had that before.
- Had what?

376
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:16,121
Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Chelelektu.

377
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:22,002
And I've also tried
Sumatra Mount Gadang, or whatever it was.

378
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,297
Wow, you're seriously classy, Mom.

379
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,091
But with whom?

380
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,885
Mi-joo.

381
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:31,928
Mi-joo?

382
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,305
Yes.

383
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,267
I've been to places like this
before with her.

384
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,605
She said you'd never bring me,
so I should go with her.

385
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:45,609
She's such a kind and thoughtful person.

386
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:52,157
But who would've thought
I'd come to a cafe like this with you?

387
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,581
Why didn't you tell me?

388
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,293
About what?

389
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,544
Those tests.

390
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,924
Why would I? It's embarrassing.

391
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,800
What's embarrassing?

392
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,469
All of it, of course.

393
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,262
At this age,

394
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,766
I'm dressing up and taking some
ridiculous test just to keep my job.

395
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:21,519
They're the ones
who should be embarrassed, not you!

396
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,146
You didn't do anything wrong.

397
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:30,445
And you should've said something,
or we'll get the wrong idea.

398
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,531
What wrong idea?

399
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,535
That's not important.

400
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,164
What is it?

401
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,875
Do you feel unwell?

402
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,878
No, I'm fine.

403
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,340
It's just that sometimes,

404
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,469
I feel this tightness in my chest,
and I can't breathe properly.

405
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,643
Your coworker, Yeong-suk,
must've been stressed about the tests too.

406
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,397
Of course she was.

407
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,694
Sir.

408
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,153
What? What is it?

409
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,655
Sir.

410
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:18,618
My only daughter passed away young,
and I lost touch with my son-in-law,

411
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,706
so it's just me and my granddaughter,
who's in middle school.

412
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:28,336
If I lose this cleaning job,
we have no way to survive.

413
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,796
Goodness, that's tough.

414
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:35,677
But even if you say this to me,
there's nothing I can do for you.

415
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,264
I've already given you
plenty of chances, haven't I?

416
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,850
Look, if you fail once, it's a warning.

417
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,852
Fail twice, you get reassigned.

418
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,854
And what did I say the third time was?

419
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,690
Not having the required job knowledge,
meaning dismissal.

420
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,192
I already explained this to you.

421
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:54,988
Ask everyone here
how many times I've explained this.

422
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:58,491
You all remember
what I've been saying repeatedly, right?

423
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,702
You all remember, don't you?

424
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,371
See? They all do. Look.

425
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,293
Or maybe you thought,
"Would he really dare fire me?"

426
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,670
- That's what you must've thought.
- No.

427
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,382
You should've tried harder
when I gave you the chance.

428
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,594
Even if you come to me like this,
there's nothing I can do.

429
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,596
Still, sir.

430
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,307
- I beg you. Please?
- Good grief.

431
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,641
Come on, just get up.

432
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,685
- Please, sir, please.
- Please get up.

433
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:29,105
- Let's get you up.
- Please, sir!

434
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,401
What's the point of having an elevator?

435
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,986
We can't even use it!

436
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,946
Be careful.

437
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,704
How many times
have you been back and forth?

438
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,207
Goodness.

439
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,544
Innovation Complex, Innovation…

440
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,965
Gosh, Yeong-suk.

441
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,675
What's wrong?

442
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,429
Are you feeling sick?

443
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,139
What's with me today?

444
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,356
I'm fine now.

445
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,484
Aren't you studying too hard?

446
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:20,031
Seeing Ms. Park get fired
has made me so anxious.

447
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:25,578
Remember? I got a warning last time
because I failed the last test.

448
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:33,128
But my brain's all rusty now,
so I forget things I've just studied.

449
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,337
Hold on.

450
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,133
Our university president's name is Myeong…

451
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,846
What was it again? I just saw it.

452
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,306
Myeong Seok-man.

453
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,311
"Myeongseok" means "smart,"
so he's a <i>myeongseok</i> man.

454
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,148
It's easier if you remember it like that.

455
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,443
I couldn't memorize it either,
so I tried it this way, and it stuck.

456
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,696
You're right. Goodness.
I should memorize it like that!

457
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:04,826
Wow, Eun-ja, you really are smart.

458
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,869
Of course I am.

459
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,912
I'll help you with these.

460
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,497
No, it's fine.

461
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,416
- Come on.
- It's heavy.

462
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,336
"Myeongseok" means "smart."
<i>Myeongseok</i> man.

463
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,882
Myeong Seok-man.
Our Chair of the Board is Kim…

464
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,217
Kim Chae-geun.

465
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,554
The Student Union Building
was built in 19…

466
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,098
Nineteen eighty-four.

467
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,310
Jang-geun sure is smart.

468
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,023
Some of the questions you predicted
really came up this time.

469
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,734
Yes, a round of applause!

470
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:38,651
You're the best!

471
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,488
So, about that…

472
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,826
What do you think
will be on the next test?

473
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,832
There is one thing that might come up.

474
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,626
- What is it?
- What?

475
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,377
So that would be

476
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,422
the song they sing at matriculation,

477
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,511
at graduation, and at the university
president's inauguration.

478
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,054
- A song?
- A song?

479
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,181
- The national anthem.
- The national anthem!

480
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,225
- The national anthem?
- The school anthem!

481
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,060
I bet that'll come up.

482
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,311
The school anthem!

483
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,104
- The school anthem?
- But I…

484
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,065
I don't know the school anthem.

485
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,274
I don't know it either.

486
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,234
Yeah.

487
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,402
What custodian would know
the school anthem?

488
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,197
That is why I prepared this.

489
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:30,036
Jang-geun can be so smart at times.
He's such an enema.

490
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,996
Mi-suk, you mean "enigma."

491
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,963
HANKUK UNIVERSITY ANTHEM

492
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:48,346

00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:53,268

<i>Fills the world with light</i>

496
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,656
I'll post this in the group chat,

497
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,534
so listen to it and memorize all of it.

498
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,035
Memorize?

499
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,829
That's so hard.

500
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,707
- Did you understand that?
- I'm getting a headache.

501
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:20,962
<i>- Held high and shining bright</i>
- The Student Union Building was built…

504
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:36,436
Yeong-suk.

505
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,646
You don't look too well today.

506
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,691
I didn't get much sleep.

507
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,110
Why? Something wrong?

508
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,281
The test is tomorrow.

509
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:52,452
But if you don't get any sleep,
how will you get through work?

510
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:58,374
If I'd studied this hard as a child,
I would've gone to a top university.

511
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,712
You're here now.

512
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,673
At a top university.

513
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,931
You're right. A top university, yes.

514
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,103
But…

515
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:25,443
why is being at a top university
making me feel so embarrassed?

516
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,661
CUSTODIAL STAFF LOUNGE

517
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:35,662
Coffee, anyone?

518
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,871
- Yes, me.
- Me too.

519
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,289
- Me three.
- Okay.

520
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,540
Let's have some coffee.

521
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,422
Hey, you're here.

522
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,091
- Eun-ja!
- Hi, Eun-ja.

523
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,175
- Welcome.
- Morning.

524
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,260
- What took you so long?
- You came late.

525
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,680
- Is Yeong-suk not here again?
- Want some coffee?

526
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:56,557
You're right.
She didn't come today either.

527
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,142
That's concerning.

528
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,727
It's the third day, isn't it?

529
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,104
No, the fourth.

530
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,523
I should go visit her after work.

531
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,112
Well, okay. I'll open the door for you.

532
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,573
But you really do work with her, right?

533
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,790
Yeong-suk.

534
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,882
Goodness, what's that smell?

535
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,221
Yeong-suk?

536
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,525
Yeong-suk.

537
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,322
Yeong-suk?

538
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,869
Yeong-suk.

539
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,455
Yeong-suk!

540
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:02,665
Yeong-suk!

541
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,543
Oh, what do I do?

542
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,878
Yeong-suk!

543
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:09,297
Oh no… Sir!

544
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,132
Yeong-suk…

545
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,593
- Yeong-suk…
- Hello?

546
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,678
- Yeong-suk…
- Is this 911?

547
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,639
- Yeong-suk…
- I think someone has died here!

548
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,892
- Oh, Yeong-suk…
- Please hurry!

549
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,477
HANKUK UNIVERSITY

550
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,437
<i>Poor Yeong-suk.</i>

551
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,526
How difficult must it have been for her?

552
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,195
It wasn't just a heart attack.

553
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:37,075
She had too much work
and the stress of unnecessary tests.

554
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,703
By the way,

555
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,165
why are you so interested
in what happened to her?

556
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:46,876
Oh, well…

557
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,462
A tip. A tip came in.

558
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,005
A tip?

559
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,715
From whom?

560
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,593
It was an anonymous tip.

561
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,350
But Yeong-suk's already gone.

562
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,936
What could we possibly do?

563
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:08,189
We've got to at least try.

564
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,566
Who?

565
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,320
You? Why?

566
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,780
If I don't, I'll…

567
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:22,036
Mom, I'm a labor attorney.

568
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,247
And that's what we do.

569
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,168
I got a call.

570
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:32,672
Yes, Hui-joo?

571
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,091
Employment contract consultation?

572
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:36,759
Right, okay.

573
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,303
I have to talk to you too.

574
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:40,805
Okay.

575
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:42,849
Mom, let's go.

576
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,433
Already?

577
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,229
Honestly.

578
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,443
Come on! What are you doing? Let's go.

579
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,279
It's a waste.

580
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,738
This is probably expensive.

581
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,282
Geez!

582
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,785
You can't even sleep
if you drink too much coffee.

583
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,255
Thank you.

584
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,966
I really don't get it.

585
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:19,635
Why is the university making
the custodians take tests?

586
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,180
To humiliate them.

587
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,599
So they'll quit on their own.

588
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,561
But seriously, why bother with all that?
Why don't they just fire them?

589
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,398
Is it because they're direct hires?

590
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:36,194
Direct employment doesn't necessarily mean
your job is guaranteed.

591
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:41,741
Direct hires on contracts can be dismissed
anytime after their contract expires.

592
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,577
After two years,
they have to keep you until retirement,

593
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,622
but that doesn't apply
to employees over the age of 55

594
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:51,083
due to an exemption under Article 4
of the Fixed-Term Workers Act.

595
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,585
Then your mother too?

596
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:58,466
Yes. My mom or her friend, Yeong-suk,
can be dismissed at any time.

597
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,509
Then, why?

598
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,470
Because people are watching.

599
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,555
What do you mean?

600
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,308
A few years ago,
a university tried to fire

601
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,894
all the custodial staff,
causing a huge scandal.

602
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,229
Right, yeah.

603
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:14,857
The person who represented them
became a member of the National Assembly,

604
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,359
so public interest has grown.

605
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,110
Geez…

606
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,737
So they found a way around it.

607
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,031
To avoid public sympathy
for the custodians,

608
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,325
they're using the tests
to make them leave.

609
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,327
If people talk, they have an excuse.

610
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,955
"The tests were meant
to educate the custodians."

611
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,707
"We worked hard
to improve their knowledge,

612
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:33,042
so how is this a problem?"

613
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,877
If so, they're total sickos.

614
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,588
Yes, the scariest kind. Learned sickos.

615
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,841
Unbelievable, seriously.

616
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,181
What is it?

617
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,935
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

618
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,437
Geez, you startled me.

619
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,022
What's with you?

620
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,151
Me too. Seeing Hui-joo angry
is making me angry too!

621
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:02,071
I know! If we're this angry, how…

622
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,572
how upset must Mu-jin be?

623
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:04,490
Exactly.

624
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,494
Just calm down
and let's figure out what to do.

625
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,137
Hey, mister.

626
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,181
Here, try this.

627
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,934
It's the hottest beer right now.

628
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,938
It's just you helped me before
with that drunk customer,

629
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,523
so, yeah…

630
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,441
Hey.

631
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,278
Aren't I a little too young
to be called "mister"?

632
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,947
I get told quite often that I look young.

633
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,452
I don't know
if I should let you pay for me like this.

634
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,079
It's fine. It's my treat
because I got a job.

635
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,666
- You got a job?
- Yes.

636
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,461
I passed the final interview
a few days ago

637
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,130
and had the health checkup yesterday.

638
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,175
Wow, this is my last day here!

639
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,428
Hey, that's great. Congratulations.

640
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,147
This is refreshing and tasty.

641
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,193
You're treating me,
so I should show some appreciation.

642
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,488
Wait, I should be buying you
a celebratory drink instead.

643
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:26,530
When do you get off?

644
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,742
Oh, I can't really do it today.

645
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,828
But I live nearby,
so please treat me next time, Mu-jin.

646
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:36,707
Mu-jin?

647
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,876
Right, sounds better than "mister."

648
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,961
I'll treat you to fried chicken and beer.

649
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:41,921
I'd like that.

650
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:44,799
There's a really old school joint
by the Hangang River.

651
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,301
- We'll have ice-cold beer and…
- The Hangang River?

652
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,595
What, the two of us?

653
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,597
What's with that look?

654
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,642
Don't you watch what's trending?
It's the go-to spot right now.

655
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,269
I've never been, so I wouldn't know.

656
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:58,521
You've never been?

657
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,314
What've you been doing?

658
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,566
I was busy making a living.

659
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,403
Working part-time and stuff.

660
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:11,826
Your first Hangang River fried chicken
outing will be with me, got it?

661
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,703
And come visit my office sometime.

662
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,914
Isn't it bad
having to see a labor attorney?

663
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,499
Hey, I didn't say as a client.

664
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:19,959
Oh, hello!

665
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,795
Don't bail on that fried chicken.

666
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,218
Ms. Kim Yeong-suk?

667
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,221
Yes, I remember.

668
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,433
She had ongoing health issues, didn't she?

669
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:36,600
- Sorry?
- Right?

670
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,061
And she was quite advanced in years.

671
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:45,151
I heard she died of a heart attack
at home while sleeping.

672
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,947
- While sleeping?
- Yes.

673
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:56,787
It is unfortunate, but it's not uncommon
for elderly people to pass away like that.

674
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,832
You said she had ongoing health issues.

675
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,042
What might those be?

676
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,045
About that…

677
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,422
Sorry? Oh, that…

678
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,177
Her joints.

679
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,428
Her…

680
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,013
Arthritis.

681
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:18,017
Oh, well, that's not really something we…

682
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:22,646
We couldn't get in touch
with any of her family,

683
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,858
so we don't know the full details,

684
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:28,569
but it's normal
for elderly people at that age

685
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,906
to have some kind of health issue
or another, isn't it?

686
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,325
But why do you ask?

687
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,286
She didn't just pass away in her sleep.

688
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,371
She died while studying for her test.

689
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,625
The test the university makes
the custodians take.

690
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,335
Test?

691
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:45,628
Did you know that

692
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:49,048
she was under a lot of stress
because of those tests?

693
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:54,803
You publicly humiliated her
because of her test results.

694
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,767
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

695
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,146
Oh, the tests?

696
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,775
Right, yes.

697
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,612
Those tests were given

698
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,991
as part of their job training.

699
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,620
Many of our custodians
are quite happy about this job training.

700
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,997
Given that they work at a top university,

701
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:26,252
they take pride in acquiring knowledge
and becoming more cultured.

702
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,087
You truly are a top university.

703
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,464
You even care
about your custodians' education.

704
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,675
Of course we do.

705
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:37,888
Our custodians are also
members of our university.

706
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,015
But it seems your university uses

707
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:44,019
tests unrelated to the job
to conduct your training.

708
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,647
Why must they take such tests?

709
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,568
Isn't it enough to have skills
required to do the job?

710
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:53,028
Did it not occur to you

711
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:56,240
those strange tests could be
deeply insulting to the custodians

712
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:59,034
and even considered to be
workplace harassment?

713
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,453
When you work
at such a prestigious university?

714
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,374
Have some coffee.

715
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:10,546
You also dismissed
a custodian who failed the test.

716
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,090
That's a clear case of unfair dismissal.

717
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:19,179
I really don't know
what kind of stories you've been hearing.

718
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,433
Bring me the list of our custodial staff.

719
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,687
Who told you such a thing? Who was it?

720
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,065
Let's have a face-to-face with them.

721
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,234
Bring me that list.

722
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,987
If you don't have it, go find it!

723
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,363
Yes, I'll get it at once.

724
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:37,948
Now, listen up.

725
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,825
If this is proven to be untrue,

726
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:43,621
the university will be taking
legal action, all right?

727
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,581
Who was it?

728
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:47,750
Well?

729
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,884
I knew they'd be like that.

730
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:59,261
This is really pissing me off!

731
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,347
That admin office manager…

732
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,975
He was totally intimidated by Hui-joo.
You're so cool.

733
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,687
You're so cheerful
even in a situation like this.

734
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,272
That's part of my charm.

735
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,483
Should I just hit him?

736
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:15,027
No, it's fine.

737
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,114
This won't be easy.

738
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:23,285
With no bereaved family to contest this,
they probably thought they got off easy,

739
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,371
but not when we're on their tail.

740
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:28,666
True. Once you're in Hui-joo's grasp,
there's no way out.

741
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,792
What's he saying?

742
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,293
What's with you?

743
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,379
What do we do now?

744
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,215
She doesn't have any family,

745
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,051
so we should start
by talking to her coworkers.

746
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,303
Always so smart, big brother.

747
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,888
Where should we start?

748
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,766
Let's split up
and find out what we're dealing with,

749
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,643
then we'll meet up to discuss.

750
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,943
God, who just throws out
broken glass like this?

751
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,486
Thanks.

752
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,154
Will you be okay?

753
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,698
This is nothing.

754
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:06,662
I got over 30 stitches.

755
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,206
It was a broken mirror
someone had thrown out.

756
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:13,001
They just put broken glass in the trash

757
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:16,296
and throw leftover coffee or food
into the recycling bin,

758
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,799
so my clothes get dirty all the time.

759
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,428
Take a break. You hurt your hand.

760
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,263
I can't. There's so much to do.

761
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,724
Are you always this busy?

762
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,352
Even more so during exam season.

763
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:34,857
The students order in food all the time,
so we get so much trash.

764
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:40,654
And this university
has a lot of buildings without elevators.

765
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:47,744
Then Ms. Kim must've carried the trash
all the way here by herself.

766
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,621
Well, what can you do?

767
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,124
We go up and down the stairs
multiple times a day,

768
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:53,959
lugging all that trash.

769
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:59,548
That's why
not many here have healthy joints.

770
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,009
That must've been hard.

771
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,845
That's what cleaning work is like.

772
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,681
If you can't handle it,
you can't do this job.

773
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,310
Let me help you.

774
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,646
You're helping by leaving. Go on, go.

775
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,690
- I'll just put the glass away.
- Hey, hey.

776
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:19,526
You're so stubborn. I told you to just go.

777
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,487
All right. I'll just hold--

778
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,280
- I said, go!
- Fine!

779
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:27,784
Ms. Kim wasn't sick or anything
before she passed, was she?

780
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,036
No.

781
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,037
I'm not sure.

782
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,749
But who isn't sick at our age?

783
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:36,251
I also have bad heart problems.

784
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:42,925
But her death may have been caused
by excessive workloads and extreme stress.

785
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:46,970
If that were true,
most people should be dead.

786
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,556
What job doesn't come without stress?

787
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,101
I've been cleaning for a good while now,

788
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:56,813
and it's not easy to find a place
that treats you this well, okay?

789
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,982
You're completely right.

790
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:03,820
At my old job, they made us renew
our contracts every 11 months.

791
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:07,658
If you got on the manager's bad side,
you were gone.

792
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,825
Now, hurry along!

793
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,869
We have to clean. Go on!

794
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,081
Honestly!

795
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,751
You're keeping us from working. Go!

796
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,421
- You're the sister-in-law of Eun-ja's son?
- Yes.

797
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,507
You're helping him so much.

798
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,133
Does he pay you a lot?

799
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:28,512
Well, there's a lot to look into
with workplace-accident cases.

800
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,722
It's hard to do alone, so I'm helping out.

801
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,850
Workplace accident? You mean
Yeong-suk's death was work-related?

802
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:38,522
Oh, it's not certain or anything,
but we think it might have been.

803
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:43,151
- Didn't Ms. Kim die of a heart attack?
- She did.

804
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,571
Do heart attacks count
as being work-related?

805
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,281
It's possible.

806
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,701
Because overwork and stress
are closely linked to heart attacks.

807
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,327
Really?

808
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,204
Goodness.

809
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,123
- Hey, Jang-geun!
- Hello.

810
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,082
Come sit.

811
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,918
You need to eat.

812
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:01,920
- Goodness.
- I'll get it.

813
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,715
Give him extra rice.

814
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,216
- Okay.
- Just a little is fine.

815
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,303
You two seem pretty close, right?

816
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,388
Yes, we're from the same hometown.

817
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,390
Right.

818
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:18,937
He's my grandfather's second wife's
third son's cousin once removed,

819
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,522
or something like that.

820
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,108
Anyway, he's a distant relative.

821
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:26,320
That sounds incredibly distant.

822
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,405
You're practically strangers.

823
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:34,786
Do you usually eat here?
There's a cafeteria on campus, right?

824
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:38,123
Our meal allowance is only 3,000 won.

825
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:42,085
With that amount, we can't even buy
instant noodles at the cafeteria.

826
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:46,340
That's part of it,
but people don't like it when we're there.

827
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:48,759
Why?

828
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,179
Because we're ghosts.

829
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,640
Ghosts?

830
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,186
- We're there, but we're not there.
- True.

831
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:04,900
We just need to do our jobs properly
and stay out of people's sight.

832
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,113
GHOST

833
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,700
They didn't seem unhappy
about their work environment.

834
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:17,704
I know. Is it because
other places are so much worse?

835
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:22,376
But they must think these tests
are unfair and have complaints.

836
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:28,048
But strictly speaking,
giving these tests isn't against the law.

837
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:29,925
That's true.

838
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,260
If it were me, I'd just flunk it.

839
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,055
It must be nice being so carefree.

840
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,140
Hey.

841
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,227
That sounds great.

842
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,356
Big brother, being carefree isn't what I…

843
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:46,149
No, not that. The test.

844
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,402
- They should refuse.
- Refuse?

845
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,569
- Can they?
- Yes.

846
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,407
If setting the test isn't illegal,
then not taking it…

847
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,242
Isn't illegal!

848
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,326
That's true.

849
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,788
Yes, hello? Is this Mr. Oh Jang-geun?

850
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,207
We met last time.

851
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,501
I'm the sister-in-law
of Ms. Yang Eun-ja's son.

852
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,503
Yes, right.

853
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:10,841
Remember how Ms. Yang's son
was here the other day?

854
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:16,304
He said he has something to say to us
and invited us for some <i>jajangmyeon.</i>

855
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,807
Just out of the blue?

856
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,894
Let's wrap up here
and have some <i>jajangmyeon.</i>

857
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,396
For what?

858
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,274
My son's buying today.

859
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:31,445
But why would your son buy us <i>jajangmyeon?</i>

860
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,029
It's not even your birthday.

861
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,742
No, he's just treating us
because we're all working hard.

862
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,202
Oh no! I brought a packed lunch today.

863
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,706
Gosh, you can eat that later.

864
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:43,957
I'm getting a large one.

865
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,210
Sure thing! Get <i>tangsuyuk</i> as well!

866
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:52,716
Please enjoy.

867
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:54,926
Please enjoy.

868
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,261
<i>Jajangmyeon</i> or <i>jjamppong?</i>

869
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,555
<i>Jajangmyeon?</i> Please enjoy.

870
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,606
More pickled radish, please.

871
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:08,940
Everyone!

872
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,320
Ms. Yang Eun-ja's son
has something to say to you,

873
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,989
so please listen up as you eat.

874
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,532
The one who's an attendant?

875
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,409
No, an attorney. A labor attorney.

876
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:22,120
Tourney? Does your son compete in sports?

877
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,164
No, a lawyer. An attorney.

878
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:28,502
Come on, everyone, settle down.
He has something to say.

879
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,253
Right, yes.

880
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,963
Hello, I am…

881
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:34,966
Ms. Yang Eun-ja's son,

882
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,511
labor attorney No Mu-jin.

883
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:46,520
I know you're all busy,
but I invited you here today

884
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,855
because, as you all know,

885
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:54,027
the late Ms. Kim Yeong-suk passed away
at her house from a heart attack.

886
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:59,241
You probably don't know
why she passed away,

887
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:04,412
but the cause was
something you all know about.

888
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,504
JOB KNOWLEDGE TEST FOR CUSTODIAL STAFF

889
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:13,964
This paper right here.

890
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,509
The test you took a few days ago.

891
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:22,264
The test that had
nothing to do with her actual work

892
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,307
and subjected her to humiliation

893
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,353
played a part in her death.

894
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,689
Now, wait a minute.

895
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:34,359
Yeong-suk's death
has nothing to do with that test.

896
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:37,028
That's what the university says.

897
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:41,324
But those words shouldn't come
from Ms. Kim's coworkers.

898
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:45,745
I quite like taking those tests.
Feels like it might keep dementia away.

899
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,790
Why is he poking a hornet's nest?

900
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,085
Doing this won't bring her back.

901
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,838
Of course we don't want to take tests.

902
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,966
But what choice do we have?

903
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,050
Good grief!

904
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,679
You buy us a measly bowl of noodles
and try to stir us up? Honestly!

905
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:06,850
Oh, come on. At least hear him out.

906
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,103
Yes,

907
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:13,773
we can't bring back someone who's dead.

908
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,026
However,

909
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:20,196
people who shouldn't have to die
won't have to die anymore.

910
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,951
I'm sure while working,

911
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,621
thoughts like
"If I'm unlucky, I might die"

912
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,372
must've crossed your mind.

913
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,291
You hurt yourself the other day.

914
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,002
I mean, I get what you're saying,

915
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,546
but check your facts.

916
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,215
No school does this much
for its custodians.

917
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:42,636
We may seem pathetic to you guys, but…

918
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,970
Not at all.

919
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,805
…we have to do this stuff to get by.

920
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,266
What do you mean "this stuff"?

921
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,936
I'm proud of the work we do.

922
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:54,814
I put my kids through college
doing this work!

923
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:56,358
Yes, she's right.

924
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,359
We did.

925
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,071
For heaven's sake!

926
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:08,995
I was going to stay quiet,
but I can't listen to this anymore.

927
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,083
Let's all be a little more honest.

928
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:17,253
Picking up trash all day and keeping
the school clean is all well and good.

929
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:21,299
But so what? Who even appreciates us?

930
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,594
Do any of the students
ever say hello to us?

931
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,765
Even though we tell them smoking's fine

932
00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:31,101
but at least don't litter
the cigarette butts,

933
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:34,521
they just throw them away wherever
and even spit on the ground!

934
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,358
How can anyone do that to a person?

935
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,402
Oh, come on.

936
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:43,238
Why bring that up here?

937
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:46,658
It may seem unrelated,
but it's the same thing.

938
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:52,998
When someone does something
no one should ever do to another person,

939
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,708
we should get mad.

940
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:58,753
But instead,
we walk on eggshells around them!

941
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,132
They give us a ridiculous test,
and we take it.

942
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,218
They tell us we're fired if we fail,
and we take it.

943
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:08,013
We're grateful
just because they give us a job!

944
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:10,932
On top of that,

945
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:16,229
someone who scrubbed crap
off toilets with me,

946
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:20,108
who ate with us
and struggled with us, is now dead,

947
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:24,320
so we have to at least find out
why that happened to her!

948
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,409
Yes, money and jobs are important,

949
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,287
but this isn't right!

950
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:36,458
She's right.

951
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:43,423
Just because we stay out of sight,
cleaning quietly in the background,

952
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,218
they treat us like
we're beneath even robot vacuums.

953
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:51,056
But that doesn't mean
we should think the same of ourselves.

954
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,224
That's right.

955
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,102
And the biggest problem here

956
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,814
is that these test scores are being used
to justify people's dismissals.

957
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,609
This is unjust.
It's a clear abuse of power.

958
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,444
You must refuse to take these tests.

959
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,695
The key point here

960
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:10,158
is that everyone has a right
to refuse what is unjust.

961
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:13,369
Does anyone here
actually like taking tests?

962
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:14,621
Of course not!

963
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,290
Gosh, I hate taking tests.

964
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:20,835
I hated them when I was in school.
Why should I take them at my age?

965
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,379
- Gosh, you're right.
- I agree.

966
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:26,716
It was also harsh of them
to fire Ms. Park.

967
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,717
But think about it.

968
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,136
Who's to say we won't be next?

969
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,890
Even if they pay you,

970
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,810
it's also wrong to make you
come sit a test on your day off.

971
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,354
Pay? I never received any pay.

972
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,563
What do you mean?

973
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,858
- We could get money for that?
- Of course!

974
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:50,782
If the employer is making you
sit these tests as part of your work,

975
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:51,950
they need to pay you!

976
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:58,957
And as it's on your day off, 1.5 times
the regular pay according to the law!

977
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,834
What, 1.5 times?

978
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,464
They made you take these tests
on your day off without even paying you!

979
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,590
It's unjust!

980
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,093
Then what do we have to do?

981
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,688
You need to speak up.

982
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:26,568
If you're struggling, say so.
If it's unjust, say so.

983
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:30,864
Tell them you're not robots or ghosts!
You're human beings too!

984
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:36,536
Hear, hear.

985
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,079
Hear, hear!

986
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,348
Who's gathered outside?

987
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,684
The custodians. A lot of them.

988
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:02,562
- What for?
- We're trying to figure that out.

989
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,480
God damn it.

990
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,565
Labor attorney Lee Seung-won
is on his way.

991
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,983
Okay, good job.

992
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:09,986
What is all this?

993
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:14,657
The inhumane knowledge test that drove
custodian Kim Yeong-suk to death!

994
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,784
Cease and apologize!

995
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,620
Cease and apologize!

996
00:58:18,703 --> 00:58:20,997
Knowledge tests for unjust dismissal!

997
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,457
Call off and cease!

998
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,584
Cease and apologize!

999
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:25,919
Apologize and cease!

1000
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,879
- Cease and apologize!
- No filming.

1001
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,839
- Apologize and apologize!
- No cameras.

1002
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,841
- Cease and apologize!
- Stop. Enough!

1003
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,552
Hey, what on earth is going on here?

1004
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,347
You didn't-- Oh, I'm sorry.

1005
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,473
Good grief.

1006
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:42,602
You didn't say you'd abolish these tests
at our last meeting,

1007
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,187
so we're merely exercising

1008
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:47,440
our constitutional right
to collective action.

1009
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,984
Oh, you're that labor attorney
from before.

1010
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:58,618
This is a respected university,
and our students are all watching.

1011
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,328
What disgraceful behavior is this?

1012
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:03,540
You're the ones behaving disgracefully
at a respected university.

1013
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,543
To fire them, you forced tests
on them and humiliated them!

1014
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:07,877
- She's right!
- She's right!

1015
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,254
Silence!

1016
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:14,092
You three. What are you trying to achieve
by manipulating our innocent custodians?

1017
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:19,305
Doing this won't help them in any way.
It will only work against them, you hear?

1018
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,057
Are you threatening us?

1019
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,893
Good grief. Out of my way.

1020
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,313
Now, everyone.

1021
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,190
Listen to me carefully.

1022
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:35,154
Protesting during work hours like this
constitutes obstruction of business.

1023
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,782
- Obstruction of business?
- Now, now.

1024
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,867
We've checked who's here.

1025
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:43,705
We'll handle this
in line with the university policy.

1026
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,790
Now, disperse!

1027
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,083
We could get fired.

1028
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,716
For crying out loud.

1029
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,761
Don't look down on custodians!

1030
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,849
We are people too!

1031
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,977
We are people too!

1032
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,479
We are people too!

1033
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:12,734
The inhumane knowledge test

1034
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:16,112
that drove our coworker to death!

1035
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,949
Abolish and apologize!

1036
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,869
Apologize! The inhumane tests!

1037
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,621
Cease and abolish!

1038
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:27,457
Let's go! Let's go!

1039
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:31,210
Are you all asking to be fired?
Leave at once!

1040
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,882
Fire them?
Do you have the authority to fire them?

1041
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:36,966
Bravo!

1042
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,802
You might think you're safe
because you're direct hires,

1043
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,304
but even if you are,

1044
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:44,766
half of you
are seniors over the age of 55,

1045
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:47,894
so you'll only have a job
if we renew your contracts.

1046
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:51,189
What? They'll only have a job
if you renew their contracts?

1047
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:52,899
Don't be ridiculous.

1048
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:57,111
If you're so upset, if I were you,
I'd just study hard and pass the tests.

1049
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:03,326
Let's be honest here.
The university has done more than enough!

1050
01:01:04,285 --> 01:01:06,496
We hire you directly
instead of outsourcing

1051
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,331
and give you a lounge to rest!

1052
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:12,418
We keep doing you a favor,
and now you think you're entitled.

1053
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,419
What, you jerk?

1054
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:19,092
Did you just call the rights
these people are entitled to a "favor"?

1055
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:20,760
What? "Jerk"?

1056
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,763
Who are you anyway?
Who are you to incite people here?

1057
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:24,681
Me?

1058
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,016
I'm a free citizen! So what?

1059
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:27,975
Tell him!

1060
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:31,145
Disperse!

1061
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,356
You people are unbelievable!

1062
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:36,984
Hey! Identify everyone here
and write their names down.

1063
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,903
You people! I've had enough of this!

1064
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:40,321
Don't take photos.

1065
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,657
Don't take our photos!

1066
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,075
- Mom.
- Hey, lady.

1067
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:45,201
- Mom.
- That's enough!

1068
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,285
Hey, lady, your name.

1069
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,370
How dare you…

1070
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:49,080
What's yours?

1071
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,126
You're really showing off
how ignorant you are!

1072
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,043
Ignorant?

1073
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:02,969
Please calm down.

1074
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,055
It's the police.

1075
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,766
Why are they here?

1076
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,811
There are so many cars coming!

1077
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,856
Why are they coming here?

1078
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:15,898
Yeah, why?

1079
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,192
Don't be nervous. We're within the law.

1080
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:21,028
We didn't do anything wrong.

1081
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,198
Everyone!

1082
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,451
Take back the unfair dismissal!

1083
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:29,662
Cease and abolish
the inhumane knowledge test!

1084
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,789
Cease and apologize!

1085
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:33,791
Cease!

1086
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,502
Cease! Cease all activity!

1087
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,339
Excuse me, sir.
You're the organizer, right?

1088
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,425
No, but…

1089
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:43,342
Me?

1090
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,844
We need you to come with us.

1091
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:48,389
Me? Why?

1092
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:52,518
You're under arrest for violating
the Assembly and Demonstration Act.

1093
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,020
Under arrest?

1094
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,149
No, wait!

1095
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:00,026
Why am I under arrest?

1096
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,154
I didn't violate any law.
On what grounds are you arresting me?

1097
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:04,071
That's right!

1098
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,364
Talk at the station.

1099
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,949
No.

1100
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,785
Everyone!

1101
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,912
Our gathering is not illegal.

1102
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:13,164
Article 21, Paragraph 1
of the Constitution!

1103
01:03:13,247 --> 01:03:17,043
"All citizens shall enjoy
freedom of speech and the press,

1104
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,253
and freedom of assembly and association."

1105
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,048
The police have joined us,

1106
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:25,092
so let us shout louder why we're here!

1107
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:30,223
The inhumane knowledge test that drove
custodian Kim Yeong-suk to death!

1108
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,308
Cease at once!

1109
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:33,768
Cease at once!

1110
01:03:33,851 --> 01:03:35,520
Cease and apologize!

1111
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,563
Cease and apologize!

1112
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:39,190
Arrest him for obstruction.

1113
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:41,234
- Got it.
- Apologize!

1114
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:44,946
- This is obstruction of business!
- Let go! What obstruction of business?

1115
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:48,950
Grab him.

1116
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:21,107
Here's the <i>jajangmyeon!</i>

1117
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,570
Here's the <i>jjamppong!</i>

1118
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:29,866
There's so much meat in here today.

1119
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:31,742
It's really delicious.

1120
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,494
The meat just melts in my mouth.

1121
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,704
So delicious.

1122
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,532
What are you doing?

1123
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,492
This is what you're resorting to?

1124
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:16,412
We'll take it
the first negotiation fell through.

1125
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:18,039
We'll go ahead and form a union.

1126
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:19,123
- Fight!
- Fight!

1127
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:23,210
We will begin the founding ceremony
of the Custodial Workers' Union.

1128
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:27,673
How much would he make going on strike?
He'll just end up getting sued.

1129
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,216
Please call off your strike.

1130
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,552
The guilty party isn't us.
It's the university.

1131
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,012
Left? Why?

1132
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,639
May I tell my story?

1133
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,433
You forced the custodians
to wear elegant clothes.

1134
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:39,810
- Don't you feel ashamed?
- Turn it off!

1135
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:43,606
The more we backed down,
you saw how they stared us down!

1136
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:46,108
Because of you!

1137
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,863
