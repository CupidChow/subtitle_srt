1
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,498
Where are you going at this hour?

2
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,333
And in this terrible weather?

3
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,879
We have to work through the night
to meet the completion deadline.

4
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,005
Goodness!

5
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,385
Well, look at you.
Living the easy life, huh?

6
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,099
Oh, right. How did it go?

7
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,350
How did what go?

8
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,813
You said your interview results
are coming out today.

9
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,398
I'm not going even if I get in.

10
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,108
Rejected again?

11
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,360
Sheesh.

12
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:13,907
Hey, just come work with me.
You think 100,000 won a day is easy money?

13
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,700
Grunt work? With a college degree?

14
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,788
Hey, who paid your tuition?

15
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,164
Nobody asked you to.

16
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:22,916
You're right.

17
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,293
I'm the idiot for paying
when no one asked me to.

18
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,546
So much for helping out.

19
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,506
By the way…

20
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,136
how long are you going to
keep doing that job?

21
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,679
If I don't, then what?

22
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,101
And what's wrong with this job anyway?

23
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,396
It's not that. It's just because
you're going to work at this hour.

24
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,065
You have to work round the clock.

25
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:50,985
Are you really going to continue doing
such dangerous and demanding work?

26
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:52,862
It's going to rain today.

27
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,615
God, you're so damn immature.
I ought to just…

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,201
Listen up.

29
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,620
This society functions

30
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:04,124
because of people like me
who work when others are asleep,

31
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,876
sweating in the heat
and freezing in the cold.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,794
Got it?

33
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,838
Fine, I get it.

34
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,800
Don't give me that half-assed answer.
Say, "Thank you."

35
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,094
For what?

36
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:22,142
"Thank you for keeping our society going."

37
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,393
Say it.

38
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,186
Oh, give me a break.

39
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,730
For God's sake. Grow up already, will you?

40
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,648
I'm going.

41
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,358
Come on, U-jin.

42
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,070
Okay, fine. U-jin!

43
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,409
U-jin?

44
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,498
U-jin!

45
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,667
U-jin…

46
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:50,962
U-jin…

47
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,016
- Mu-jin!
- Big brother!

48
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,225
Mu-jin, are you okay?

49
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,853
Hey, how did you guys know I was here?

50
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,856
We put a tracking app on your phone
after the kidnapping.

51
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,900
What? Without my permission?

52
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,818
Now's not the time for that.

53
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:18,239
I knew something was up when you said
you didn't care and wanted to stop.

54
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,075
You ditched us
just so you could end up like this?

55
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,577
We're a team, aren't we?

56
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,745
We are.

57
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,914
- No, I was…
- Stop. It doesn't matter.

58
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,582
What in the world happened here?

59
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,542
I don't know. I was just…

60
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,502
No, we were just trying to scare him.

61
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,546
This wasn't part of the plan.

62
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,839
"We"?

63
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,757
The ghosts?

64
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,675
What did you do with the ghosts?

65
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,180
We can talk later. Let's get out of here.
We'll all die if we stay here.

66
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,664
Aide Kim!

67
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,707
Aide Kim!

68
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,751
- Aide Kim!
- Damn it!

69
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,128
Where is that bastard going?

70
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,384
The elevator's not safe right now.

71
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,349
What in the world?

72
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,476
Why the hell is everything falling down?

73
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,894
Good thing we didn't get on.

74
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,688
- That was close.
- Mr. Kim!

75
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,815
Please help me! Help me!

76
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,651
What are you talking about?
It's every man for himself!

77
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,611
"Every man for himself"? Oh, my leg.

78
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,323
Sir. Shouldn't we help her?

79
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,576
If we don't, it could come back
to bite us. We should help her.

80
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,161
Come on, help me!

81
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,709
Okay, put some strength into your arms.

82
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,794
- Let's pull her out.
- One, two, three.

83
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,214
My leg! My leg's going to break!

84
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,508
This isn't working. What do we do?

85
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,302
Just do something already!

86
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,929
Lift that thing up.

87
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,514
One, two, three!

88
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,183
Oh no, my leg!

89
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,937
Sir, I really don't think
we can do this by ourselves!

90
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,440
- Use more strength.
- What the hell is he saying?

91
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,653
- God damn it!
- But sir…

92
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,739
I have a bad back, so I can't do it.

93
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,532
I had joint surgery last year.

94
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:28,578
- You're all absolutely useless.
- My leg!

95
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,372
Hey! You!

96
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,708
What the hell did you do to this building?

97
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,503
It was your doing. That's right.

98
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,883
Earlier, you were like, "Ahhh!"
then my building shook like this.

99
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,217
You little…

100
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,927
That's what you did!

101
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,012
What are you saying?

102
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,598
How does someone go "ahhh"
and a building comes down?

103
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,350
Just how badly was it made?

104
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,435
- Exactly!
- Exactly!

105
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,978
Hey, who are you punks?

106
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,773
- "You punks"?
- Why do you punks care?

107
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,067
You're all in this together.

108
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,276
So what if we are?

109
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:01,944
What the hell did you do?

110
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,279
Someone's crushed here…

111
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,655
You little brats!

112
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,324
Someone's life is at stake!

113
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,325
Shut up, you punks!

114
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,994
You goddamn bastards!

115
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,538
You should be saving me first!

116
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,832
Saving lives should come first!

117
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,751
What's wrong with you people?

118
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,628
Right. Let's at least try something.

119
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,797
I think we'll need something to lift this.

120
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,756
Oh, my leg!

121
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,965
Hold on a second.

122
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,552
Mu-jin, what are you doing?

123
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,180
"Mu-jin"?

124
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,765
Are you family or something?

125
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,643
And what are you? His brother?

126
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,353
No, I'm his brother-in-law.

127
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,395
- Big brother!
- What?

128
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,940
We need some kind of lever.

129
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,778
Move aside. Hold tight. One, two, three!

130
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,991
It's nothing to be shocked about. Hurry!

131
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,868
My leg!

132
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,831
Lift it on three.

133
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,499
One, two, three.

134
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,584
My leg!

135
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,211
Again.

136
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,379
One, two, three!

137
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,797
Put your back into it!

138
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,803
Why aren't you helping?

139
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,638
What's that bastard doing?

140
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:12,932
One, two, three!

141
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,100
What a son of a bitch!

142
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,772
- Again.
- My God…

143
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,898
One, two…

144
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,900
Don't just stand there, old man!

145
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,777
"Old man"? Oh, my back.

146
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,070
Forget him. Do it again!

147
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,238
I'll pull her out.

148
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,365
Pull me out.

149
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,200
One, two, three!

150
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,161
- Quickly.
- Pull her out!

151
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,871
Gyeon-u!

152
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,080
My leg!

153
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,833
- My leg's free!
- She's free.

154
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,626
Gosh, my leg. My leg!

155
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,963
My gosh.

156
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,049
Oh, my leg. I think it's been crushed.

157
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,677
Unfortunately,

158
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,139
it's just a scrape.

159
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,142
What? That can't be true.

160
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,393
What?

161
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,936
I can still move it.

162
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,854
Hey, lady.

163
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,564
Stop being dramatic and get up.

164
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,399
I'm not being dramatic.

165
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,194
Don't you see this blood?
It's gushing out.

166
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,528
What in the…

167
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,614
What the hell's going on here?

168
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,908
It must be an earthquake, sir.

169
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,994
- An earthquake? Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh gosh.

170
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:15,912
Is it?

171
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,081
I didn't get an emergency alert.

172
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,626
It's shoddy construction.

173
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:27,006
The concrete is crumbling,
and the internal framing is sparse.

174
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,551
It's collapsing
because of shoddy construction.

175
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,223
All you do is push workers
and skimp on costs.

176
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:36,682
Hey, you!

177
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,102
Don't talk about things you don't know!

178
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,062
You little…

179
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,147
This building has only
just been completed!

180
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,857
How can it be shoddy construction?

181
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:49,403
Then why the hell did this happen
when it's only just been completed?

182
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,364
What they're saying must be true!

183
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,657
Good grief.

184
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,701
- Can you pass me my shoe?
- Yes, ma'am.

185
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,744
For God's sake.

186
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,872
What is that?

187
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,415
What's happening?

188
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,209
Sir!

189
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:05,878
We should go up.

190
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,713
Up? Up where?

191
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,799
There's a helipad on the roof.

192
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,509
A helipad?

193
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,886
If we call for a rescue chopper
from there,

194
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,180
we can escape.

195
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,640
- Really?
- Right?

196
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,267
Well, we do have one, but…

197
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,436
Then let's go up quickly. Upstairs.

198
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,313
This way.

199
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,690
Mr. Kim!

200
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,608
You need to take me with you!

201
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,069
We gave you enough help.
You should do the rest.

202
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,530
- What's wrong with this woman?
- Sir, quickly.

203
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,990
Shouldn't we be going too?

204
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,200
- Quickly.
- Let's go.

205
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,118
Wait!

206
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,580
Give me a hand, will you?

207
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,416
You need to take me too.
Come on, please help me.

208
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,001
You're able to walk!

209
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,669
Geez, okay, fine.

210
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,045
One, two, three!

211
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,338
Be careful.

212
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,798
- This way.
- Which way?

213
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,008
This way!

214
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,634
What? What's going on?

215
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:55,136
Where is it, you idiot?

216
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,470
That way.

217
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,388
It's this way!

218
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,433
God, seriously!

219
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,436
It's this way.

220
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,568
- Hey, lady.
- Quickly.

221
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,404
What were you plotting with them
to wind up like this?

222
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,782
What did you just say? "Hey, lady"?

223
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,825
Get moving!

224
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,037
Don't you watch <i>100 Minute Debate?</i>

225
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,539
No current affairs programs?

226
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,334
I'm Moon Jeong-eun,
a four-term assemblywoman.

227
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,128
And for your information, I'm single!

228
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,130
Watch what you say, all right?

229
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:36,927
Right, so Kim Myeong-an met a politician
to get her to cover up the Bukuk incident.

230
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,972
I've never been involved
in anything illegal like that!

231
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,434
Sure, you got a donation
while you were here

232
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:47,104
and got asked to clean up Myeongum's crap!

233
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,773
Crap? What are you talking about?

234
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,610
If you'd spent that time checking whether
the safety regulations were followed,

235
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,820
none of this would've happened!

236
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,739
You did this to yourself!

237
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,616
That disrespectful little…

238
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,409
Ko Gyeon-u! Hurry up!

239
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,535
Coming. Now, slowly.

240
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,121
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay. One, two.

241
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,247
One, two…

242
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,125
Sir!

243
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,835
The rooftop is intact!

244
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,464
Assemblywoman Moon.

245
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,007
You don't need to worry.

246
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,759
We can get out of here.

247
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,885
Call a…

248
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,345
- Mu-jin.
- Call a helicopter.

249
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,180
We just need to wait here, right?

250
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,515
I guess so.

251
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,517
- Hey, hurry up and call them.
- Yes, sir.

252
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,148
Hello? 119?

253
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,234
Now, see here, Mr. Kim.

254
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,445
What kind of work
did you do to this place?

255
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,825
How badly did you build it
to make people suffer like this?

256
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,494
I didn't build it. The subcontractor did.

257
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,914
When you run a business,
all kinds of things can happen!

258
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:50,167
I'm pissed off as it is
without your nonsense.

259
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,752
Look at the way he's talking!

260
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,256
Mr. Kim, I won't let this slide.

261
00:11:55,339 --> 00:12:00,302
Once I get out of here, I'm calling for
an investigation into this shoddy mess.

262
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,512
You'd better be ready!

263
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:05,558
Sure, hold an investigation, an audit,
do what you want!

264
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,351
You've got some nerve!

265
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,729
I get it, but just send
the damn chopper first!

266
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,566
I just told you!

267
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,485
There are important people here. Got it?

268
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,363
What's going on?

269
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,157
Well,

270
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,536
they're saying
they can't send a helicopter.

271
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,037
What? Give me that.

272
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,374
I'm the CEO of Myeongum Construction.

273
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,334
<i>Sorry? Yes, okay.</i>

274
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,671
Get that chopper in the air now.
I'll pay whatever it costs.

275
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,716
<i>I'm afraid that won't be possible.</i>

276
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,758
What?

277
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,928
<i>There's no helipad registered</i>
<i>for that building.</i>

278
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,014
Are you kidding me?

279
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:48,601
What the hell are you saying?
I'm looking at the helipad right now!

280
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,685
Sir.

281
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,104
This helipad doesn't meet
the required specs,

282
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,273
so it hasn't been approved yet.

283
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,691
God damn it!

284
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:56,650
What?

285
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,195
What are they talking about?

286
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,573
Then send us
that chopper that doesn't land

287
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,575
and lowers a rope instead.

288
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,203
Send one that can lower a rope
to rescue us.

289
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,163
<i>You're not registered!</i>

290
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,582
Wait. Hold on!

291
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,922
Assemblywoman.

292
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,590
I'm sorry,

293
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,676
but can you put in a word
with the Fire Commissioner?

294
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,595
Unbelievable.

295
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,309
Put the Fire Commissioner on.

296
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,187
This is Moon Jeong-eun speaking.

297
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,730
Assemblywoman Moon Jeong…

298
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,649
Hello?

299
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,276
Can't you hear me? Hello?

300
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,444
Hello…

301
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,740
It got cut off.

302
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,618
What is this? For God's sake!

303
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,537
You idiot!

304
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,165
What the hell were you thinking?
You can't half-ass something like this!

305
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:58,087
You think just painting on an "H"
means a chopper can land here?

306
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:02,174
I was told if we just went ahead with it,
we could clean things up afterward,

307
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,260
and that there'd be a way around it.

308
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,303
I'm so sorry, sir!

309
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,932
Which lunatic gave you
that ridiculous order?

310
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,225
It was you, sir.

311
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,645
- Oh God.
- Oh, my head!

312
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,159
Everyone! This building will collapse.
We need to go downstairs!

313
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,536
Sir.

314
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,413
- Quickly.
- Get downstairs!

315
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,498
- Quickly!
- Get downstairs where?

316
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,584
My leg hurts!

317
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,004
Are you going to whine here and just die?
Hurry up and get moving!

318
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,672
- Get downstairs, now!
- Hurry up!

319
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,425
Young man.

320
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,386
Please take me with you.

321
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,345
Please?

322
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,974
- Goodness, thank you.
- Let's get you up.

323
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,022
Are you interested in being my aide?

324
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,107
As it so happens, that position is open.

325
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,192
I need someone just like you.

326
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,485
So polite and friendly.

327
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,863
Well, aiding is my specialty.

328
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,616
What are you doing? Hurry up!

329
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,369
But I'm already her aide. Let's go.

330
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,252
What is this? My eyes are stinging.

331
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,880
I think it's a fire.

332
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,090
What? A fire?

333
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,885
Go up! Up!

334
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,219
Move!

335
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,932
- Go back up.
- This is unbelievable!

336
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,601
Get in here, quickly! Gyeon-u, hurry!

337
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,905
Goodness, my leg!

338
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,908
Gosh, thank you.

339
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,042
Sir.

340
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,337
What do we do now?

341
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,922
Why are you asking me?

342
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,131
Huh?

343
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,385
You should be the one
figuring out what to do.

344
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,596
You think I pay you
to just sit around and do nothing?

345
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:18,644
Wait, more importantly, why didn't
the fire alarm and sprinklers go off?

346
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,479
I'm not sure. Why didn't they?

347
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:21,897
Because they're off.

348
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,067
The site supervisor turned them all off,

349
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,445
saying the alarms going off
would disrupt the construction schedule.

350
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,614
Who the hell are you?

351
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:32,533
A column ruptured.

352
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,743
Tomorrow's the completion ceremony,

353
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,037
so they told us
to cover it up the best we can.

354
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,831
We were working when this happened.

355
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,336
- Wait a minute. A column ruptured?
- Yes.

356
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,548
The concrete was poured
during the rainy season.

357
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,967
We said it'd be bad if water got in,

358
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,678
but they made us do it to meet deadlines.

359
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,182
They used watered-down concrete
that wasn't even cured properly,

360
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,309
so of course the building won't hold.

361
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,895
God, it's a wonder
this place held up at all.

362
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,400
This is what happens
when you rush the job to skimp on costs.

363
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,152
- Geez.
- Hey, you.

364
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,156
From the look of you,
you're clearly just grunt laborers.

365
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,784
So just stay in your damn place!
I ought to just…

366
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,662
From the look of you,
you're with the construction company.

367
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,665
You've got some nerve.
We're going to die here because of you!

368
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,833
The hell did you say?

369
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,170
You're gonna hit me?

370
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,672
Big brother! Smoke!

371
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,008
- Smoke!
- Smoke's leaking out!

372
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,426
- Seal it off!
- Block it!

373
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,473
- Big brother!
- Right!

374
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,725
One second. Please move aside.

375
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,067
- Take that jacket off!
- No, I can't!

376
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,526
Stop.

377
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,491
Hui-joo.

378
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:00,913
Use this.

379
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,583
Of all things to skimp on!

380
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,045
What were you thinking,
building something like this, Mr. Kim?

381
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,215
I can't know every detail.
That's for the people on the ground.

382
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,467
I only followed your orders, sir.

383
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,929
You're all the same!

384
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,264
Well, what do you know?

385
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,809
Your aides do everything for you,
don't they?

386
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,978
That bastard just keeps
talking out of line.

387
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,688
Oh, give it a rest already!

388
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:32,111
You higher-ups just set a completion date
and sit back and wait for reports,

389
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,072
so of course you don't know
if it's being built properly.

390
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,450
Does it feel good to fatten yourself
off the lives of workers?

391
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,576
Look here.

392
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,665
Do you know how many workers
make a living thanks to me?

393
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,542
You two as well.

394
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,002
You put food on the table
thanks to me, don't you?

395
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,505
Why does this smoke sting so much?

396
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,723
Mu-jin, we're going to end up dead
if we stay here like this!

397
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,767
So why on earth did you follow me here?

398
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,228
This is exactly why
I didn't want you here.

399
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,438
Isn't there some way we can escape?

400
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,899
If there were, we wouldn't still be here.

401
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,235
The only thing we can do
is jump from here.

402
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,076
God, seriously.

403
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,208
We're all going to die.

404
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,502
Why did I even bother coming here?

405
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,588
This is all because of that bastard!

406
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,673
Once I get out of here,

407
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,634
I'm going to strengthen
the Serious Accidents Punishment Act

408
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,136
and come after you!

409
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,263
Of all the assembly members I know,

410
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,850
I've never seen
a single one keep their word!

411
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,603
What the hell's that nutcase saying?
You damn lunatic!

412
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,855
I'm not donating any money to you anymore!

413
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,733
I don't want anything to do
with your filthy money either!

414
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,443
Everyone, be quiet!

415
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,113
This building is…

416
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,199
tilting.

417
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,124
Get up.

418
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,132
- Mu-jin!
- Big brother!

419
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,407
Hey, hey!

420
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,623
Let go! Let go of me!

421
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,917
Let go, you bastard!

422
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,543
Let go!

423
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,590
Let go, you bastard!

424
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,971
- Byeong-cheol!
- Oh my God!

425
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,348
- Byeong-cheol!
- Hui-joo!

426
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,936
Gyeon-u! Hui-joo!

427
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,146
No, Hui-joo!

428
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,899
No, you can't! It's dangerous.

429
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,821
Hui-joo.

430
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,073
You can't. It's too dangerous.

431
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,203
Whoa, I almost died.

432
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,416
Sir, are you all right?

433
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,335
You bastard!
Why didn't you help me earlier?

434
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,255
You! What kind of person does that?

435
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,881
I didn't do it on purpose.

436
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,925
You pushed him!

437
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,595
You're a labor attorney.

438
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,139
This was an accident.

439
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,935
I'll pay his family compensation. I will.

440
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,812
I'll pay them 300 million won.

441
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,230
What did you say?

442
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,567
I'll pay them 500 million won. Okay?

443
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,528
Look, it's more than he'll make
in a lifetime.

444
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,614
Hey! You think money can solve anything?

445
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:09,369
I mean, not all lives have the same value.

446
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:13,915
Besides, if I die
in a ridiculous accident like this,

447
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,210
that would be a huge loss, wouldn't it?

448
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,546
Both to society and our economy.

449
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,256
You son of a bitch. How dare you!

450
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,052
Hey, you!

451
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,388
What the hell did I even do wrong? Huh?

452
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,640
I didn't do that on purpose!

453
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,100
I said I'd pay up!

454
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,145
These nutjobs have all
lost their damn minds.

455
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,565
Damn you, you evil bastard!

456
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,318
Who are you calling a nutjob right now?

457
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,111
You're the craziest one here!

458
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,863
God, that crazy bastard!

459
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,783
Byeong-cheol's gone
because of that bastard.

460
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:48,700
No, you can't!

461
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,786
Gyeon-u, be careful!

462
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,664
Killing him won't solve anything.

463
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,166
Then what else can I do?

464
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,667
Make him stand trial.

465
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,921
We'll hold him accountable
for construction failures and the fire!

466
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,466
I don't care about any of that.
This building's going down anyway.

467
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,844
If I beat him to death and toss him out,
there won't be any evidence.

468
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,596
- Move!
- Please calm down.

469
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,764
- Move aside!
- If you…

470
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,933
- Just calm down.
- If you hurt me with that,

471
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,434
that's a crime.

472
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,311
Crime?

473
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,814
It's not a crime.

474
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,191
It's crime prevention, you bastard.

475
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,192
You need to die

476
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,947
so no one else will lose their lives
because of you!

477
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,031
Hey, come on!

478
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,200
Please calm down!

479
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:34,371
Go to hell, you piece of shit!

480
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,997
Hell, my ass!

481
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,251
Why would I go to hell, you bastard?

482
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,169
Why would I?

483
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,672
You're talking crazy, you son a of bitch!

484
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,225
Mu-jin!

485
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,896
Don't let go of my hand! Hold it tight!

486
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,399
Hold it tight!

487
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,656
- Mu-jin!
- Big brother!

488
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,615
Hold it tight!

489
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,702
- No, Mu-jin!
- Hui-joo!

490
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:21,877
No!

491
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,885
What is this?

492
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,511
Where am I?

493
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,472
What is this?

494
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:16,765
You okay?

495
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,516
Are you feeling awake?

496
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,768
What in the…

497
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,565
- Hey, you!
- Geez.

498
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,151
This is all your doing, isn't it?

499
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,695
You're using some kind of hypnosis
to trick me!

500
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,447
Let go!

501
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,242
What hypnosis?
What do you think I am, a wizard?

502
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,952
Then what is this?

503
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,579
What the hell are you trying to pull here?

504
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:43,416
What am I trying to pull here?

505
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,588
<i>Do you want to live?</i>

506
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:52,217
Who are you?

507
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,469
<i>I'm asking if you want to live.</i>

508
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:55,428
You little…

509
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,390
That startled me.

510
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,067
Please spare me. Please…

511
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,236
Spare me. I want to live!

512
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,613
<i>- If I let you live, what'll you do for me?</i>
- What?

513
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,868
<i>If I spare your life,</i>
<i>what are you going to do for me?</i>

514
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,912
Well, I…

515
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,874
Answer him. Say you'll do anything.

516
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,627
I can't say that.
I don't even know who that is.

517
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,171
Then just die here and go to hell.

518
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,340
Why would I go to hell?

519
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,134
Fine.

520
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,052
I'll do anything. Anything.

521
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,887
Lies!

522
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,806
He's not to be believed!

523
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,016
Don't let him off!

524
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,271
Okay, okay! I'll do anything! Anything!

525
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,398
Stop popping out like that!

526
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,025
<i>Really?</i>

527
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:51,943
<i>Anything?</i>

528
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,198
Who are you?

529
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,118
Who are we?

530
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,912
Don't you see this?

531
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:07,000
We're the Bukuk Logistics employees
who died because of you!

532
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,336
He said he'd do anything.

533
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,795
You believe that?

534
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,630
Everything he says is a lie!

535
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,885
Money, life, reputation,

536
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,679
he said he'd offer everything he has.

537
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,306
No, I didn't.

538
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,018
- What the hell?
- Really?

539
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,896
It's nothing difficult.

540
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,606
Just…

541
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,650
clean up the mess you made.

542
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,986
And deal with the consequences.

543
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,947
Now then,

544
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,910
let's sign a contract
before you change your mind.

545
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,580
LIFE AND DEATH AGREEMENT CONTRACT

546
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,585
A contract? What contract?

547
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:54,589
A contract that says
you'll do anything if I spare your life.

548
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:00,845
This is…

549
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,807
INVESTIGATION AND COMPENSATION
FOR ALL INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS

550
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,518
"Investigation and compensation
for all accidents…"

551
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,353
"Site supervision…"

552
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:09,896
Come on.

553
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,607
Who follows all these rules
while running a business?

554
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,942
Then just die.

555
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,113
This whole thing
is way too big to undo anyway.

556
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,656
Hey, wait.

557
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,826
Hey, stop. Hold on.

558
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,786
Do it while he lets you.

559
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:26,996
You know him?

560
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,083
Well, I wouldn't say
we're close or anything.

561
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:34,170
But speaking as a labor attorney
and from experience…

562
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,217
it's not a bad deal.

563
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,597
What will it be?

564
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:46,766
Will you live or die?

565
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,685
Let's just leave him to die.

566
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,312
A bastard like him
deserves to be punished.

567
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,983
People don't change.
He's not one to keep his promise.

568
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:03,199
If I really do everything written here,
will he let me live?

569
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,495
He'll definitely let you live.
That much I'm sure of.

570
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,916
But in return, you'll have to fulfill
every single condition in this contract.

571
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:16,379
There's no time. Make a decision.
Aren't you going to sign?

572
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,176
But I don't have a pen.

573
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,654
RESOLVE THE FOLLOWING IN 108 DAYS

574
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,324
FAIL TO COMPLY
AND YOU'LL BE CURSED AND DRAGGED TO HELL

575
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,117
What's this?

576
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,536
Special terms.

577
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,914
Wow, you're good.

578
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,333
I mean, this is…

579
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,710
You should've shown me this
from the start.

580
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,463
You can't just reveal it after I sign.

581
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,798
Also,

582
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,801
why would I go to hell?

583
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:07,138
What did I do to deserve going to hell?

584
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,184
Oh my.

585
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,062
You're about to die
in the shoddy building you built,

586
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,314
but you still don't know
what you did wrong.

587
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,150
For you, even 108 days is too long.

588
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,402
You have 49 days.

589
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:25,615
If you can't resolve everything
in that time, you'll be dragged to hell.

590
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:28,368
- Hear, hear!
- Even 49 days is too long!

591
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,745
- He won't do a proper job.
- Even better.

592
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,747
He can go straight to hell.

593
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,667
No way. This is an unfair contract!

594
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,878
How can I do all this in 49 days?

595
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,339
How can I resolve everything?

596
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,466
The deal's off.

597
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,884
No way.

598
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,596
Really?

599
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,433
Okay, fine!

600
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,270
I'm sorry for everything.
I'll take care of it!

601
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,948
What is this?

602
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,951
Was I seeing things just now?

603
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,036
What just happened?

604
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,383
Oh, don't bother.

605
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,010
It was uploaded…

606
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,261
To the cloud.

607
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,430
…to the cloud as it was being filmed.

608
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,307
Anyway, everyone.

609
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,268
This building is dangerous.
We need to leave right now.

610
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,103
Right this second!

611
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,902
It wasn't built properly.
It might collapse.

612
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,990
Sir!

613
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,744
- It wasn't built properly?
- Are you being serious?

614
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:54,996
Really?

615
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,876
Tell everyone inside this building
to vacate immediately!

616
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,835
Right this second!

617
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,003
- Yes, sir!
- Quickly!

618
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,339
Wait, Aide Kim!

619
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,136
Wait for me, Aide Kim!

620
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,721
What on earth?

621
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,432
Let's just go first.

622
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,475
What? Why?

623
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,809
Get on.

624
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,270
Let's get on.

625
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,188
Going in!

626
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,106
Wait, hold on.

627
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,399
Why?

628
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,111
Move back a little.

629
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,829
Sir.

630
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:41,793
Are you really calling off the completion
ceremony and going to repair everything?

631
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,295
Yes, proceed with the repairs.

632
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:49,801
But inspecting and repairing
even the apartments people have moved into

633
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,260
will cost us a fortune.

634
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,429
Not to mention the Bukuk fire.

635
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,265
Perhaps you should reconsider.

636
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,725
CEO KIM MYEONG-AN

637
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,768
That is true.

638
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,275
He won't actually kill me, will he?

639
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,944
Sorry?

640
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:24,252
There's no time. Make a decision.
Aren't you going to sign?

641
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,881
Okay, fine.

642
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,383
I'll do it.

643
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,265
REPAIR WORK AUTHORIZATION REQUEST

644
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,017
Yes!

645
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,894
You made the right choice.

646
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:46,566
Of course.
I'll do everything I can to help.

647
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:52,405
Yes, all right, Mr. Kim.

648
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,366
That Kim Myeong-an.

649
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,869
He's finally feeling the heat, isn't he?

650
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,747
He clearly doesn't want to go to hell.

651
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,251
He says he'll set things right,
one by one, so we'll have to wait and see.

652
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:08,463
Right. We're counting on you.

653
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,006
Of course.

654
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:21,559
As you saw from Myeongum Construction's
Bukuk warehouse fire tragedy,

655
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,562
our innocent workers

656
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:29,317
continue to be injured or even die
day after day,

657
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,569
but the Serious Accidents Punishment Act

658
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:36,824
fails to achieve its intended effect.

659
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,951
That is the reality we face today.

660
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,661
I, Moon Jeong-eun, believe

661
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:46,334
that saving people's lives
must never be neglected by policymakers.

662
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,129
That desperate belief is why, today,

663
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:55,718
I have asked fellow assembly members
and experts from the labor sector

664
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,137
to join me here.

665
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:03,559
I will listen carefully
to your valuable input today

666
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:08,564
and use them to propose
a truly effective amendment

667
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,943
to the Serious Accidents Punishment Act.

668
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,904
I appreciate your cooperation.

669
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,781
The car's here!

670
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,712
- Do you take responsibility for the fire?
- What do you think caused it?

671
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,714
How will Myeongum take responsibility?

672
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,801
We take full responsibility

673
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:41,639
for the fire at Bukuk Logistics, an entity
effectively owned by our company,

674
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,599
and we extend our sincerest apologies.

675
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,561
As a company, we will make every effort

676
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,063
to ensure that
such a tragedy is never repeated.

677
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,317
How does Myeongum propose
to resolve this matter?

678
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,279
What has been agreed
with the bereaved families?

679
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,822
As requested by the families,

680
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:02,201
Myeongum Construction has promised
an investigation, a sincere apology,

681
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,704
and measures to prevent similar incidents.

682
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,665
Instead of shifting responsibility
as before,

683
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,251
we hope they will mobilize
all available resources

684
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,879
to provide compensation,
implement follow-up measures,

685
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,882
and fully comply
with all legal obligations

686
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:18,593
to set an example for the industry.

687
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,678
Please.

688
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,472
<i>Meanwhile, CEO Kim Myeong-an</i>
<i>of Myeongum Construction</i>

689
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,893
<i>has donated money to the Korea</i>
<i>Occupational Safety and Health Agency</i>

690
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,061
<i>to support industrial accident prevention</i>

691
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,523
<i>and assist workers</i>
<i>affected by such incidents.</i>

692
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,695
He even donated money?
Is he dying or something?

693
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,363
What's gotten into him?

694
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,741
Something we don't know about
must've happened.

695
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,538
- You're pretty good, Mr. Labor Attorney.
- Gosh.

696
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,998
He is.

697
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,626
Wow, this actually worked.

698
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:56,505
He can't have turned over a new leaf
all of a sudden.

699
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,674
Was that in the contract too?

700
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:03,304
This is the power of an unfair contract.

701
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,474
I guess sometimes
an unfair contract is necessary.

702
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,478
Of course. Even if he's only doing it
so he doesn't die,

703
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:15,983
if it keeps people from dying needlessly,
like us, that counts for something.

704
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:17,777
Right.

705
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,073
It's unfair that we had to die,
but I do feel better now.

706
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:26,869
We hope you'll stay with this
until the compensation is all settled.

707
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,329
Of course.

708
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:32,291
Kim Myeong-an
won't be able to mess around again.

709
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:35,002
We'll be watching him until the end.

710
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,504
You don't have to worry.

711
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,465
You worked so hard for us.

712
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,467
Not at all.

713
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,551
Thank you.

714
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,054
Oh, come on.

715
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,849
Thanks. You'll be blessed for this.

716
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,851
It's really fine.

717
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,230
We achieved this together.

718
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,982
Thank you for your hard work.

719
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:00,319
Please thank these two for us as well.

720
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,532
Hey, they're saying thanks to you guys.

721
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,783
Gosh, well…

722
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,535
Where are they?

723
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,954
Not at all. We didn't even do anything.

724
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,999
What do you mean? We worked hard too.

725
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,167
- You think so?
- Right? Get up.

726
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,670
- Thank you for noticing.
- Thank you.

727
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,796
Hui-joo, Gyeon-u…

728
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:19,797
- Behind?
- Oh, right.

729
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,882
Thank you for noticing.

730
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,346
Then what happens now? Will they move on?

731
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:30,850
So…

732
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:33,102
actually…

733
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,773
Hey, so…

734
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,567
We're sorry, but…

735
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,447
can we ask you one last favor?

736
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,615
Of course.

737
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:51,495
How do you all feel?

738
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,043
It feels kinda bittersweet, I guess.

739
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,588
It will feel bittersweet, won't it?

740
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,595
We're almost at her salon.

741
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,973
- I think we're almost there.
- Yeah.

742
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,018
When you see your wife,
don't start bawling, okay?

743
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:20,066
What about you, Yong-su?
What are you going to do?

744
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:25,321
Seriously, I told myself
I'd never see her again,

745
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,365
but I should go see my mom.

746
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,744
Yes, you made the right choice.

747
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,916
It must feel a little sad
to say goodbye to each other.

748
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,504
Well, even when we're up there,
we can still meet up.

749
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,713
- Yes.
- Right.

750
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,215
You better all show up.

751
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:47,635
If it were me up there,
I'd host reunions and stuff.

752
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,803
- Right?
- Right.

753
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:50,721
How nice.

754
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,601
Wow.

755
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,813
- Hui-joo.
- Yeah?

756
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:00,648
Never mind.

757
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,615
I'm off. Hey, no need to come out.

758
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,574
- Still.
- It's fine.

759
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,118
- Please.
- I'll see you off.

760
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,285
Honestly.

761
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,497
Thank you for everything.

762
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,382
Hey, why not use the door…

763
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,135
What? Is he gone?

764
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,928
Did he go through the wall?

765
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,305
- Just now.
- Wow.

766
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,265
So cool.

767
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,684
Let's go.

768
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,779
Will I be able to do it?

769
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,115
Of course.

770
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,034
You're a father.

771
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,511
Thank you.

772
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,514
You did great.

773
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,566
You need to sleep so I can do other work.

774
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,867
Look at this, Tae-seop.

775
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,785
Tae-seop.

776
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,496
Your daddy's here.

777
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,084
You've grown so much.

778
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,055
Is my little Tae-seop feeling better?

779
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,682
You feel good?

780
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,851
There, there.

781
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:08,234
You're so precious, my little Tae-seop.

782
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,159
That's my happy baby.

783
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,161
So happy.

784
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,579
Yes, you're excited.

785
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,082
You're so cute.

786
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,709
Good boy.

787
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,643
Honey.

788
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,647
You worked so hard in life,

789
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,483
so rest in peace now.

790
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:54,154
Our kids are all grown up,
so don't worry about us.

791
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,410
Thanks, honey.

792
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,328
As for me,

793
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:06,083
I'll carry on a bit longer,
for the both of us.

794
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,753
And someday…

795
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,550
we'll meet again.

796
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,264
Yes.

797
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,435
You live a long, full life…

798
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,272
and come much later.

799
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,864
I'm sorry for leaving you behind.

800
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,198
Now then, has everyone moved on?

801
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,533
Yeah.

802
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,369
I'm glad everything worked out.

803
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,788
Did it?

804
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,831
Yes, in the grand scheme of things.

805
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,752
Anyway, ever since you were on the news,
your phone's been ringing nonstop.

806
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:32,836
How's it been lately?

807
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,589
Even my elementary school classmates
are calling me.

808
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,467
People even recognize me
on the streets now.

809
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:41,178
The power of the media is scary.

810
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,682
I hope this brings in tons of business
so we can make lots of money.

811
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,974
- Right?
- Totally.

812
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,226
Hey, oh God!

813
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,186
Why? Who is it? Why are you startled?

814
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,398
- Your sister. You take it.
- No way. You should. Hurry up.

815
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,149
I should.

816
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,861
- She called him first.
- I know. What's going on?

817
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,571
Are they getting back together?

818
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,536
- Hello?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

819
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,163
I'm outside. Why?

820
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,542
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>Everyone's here waiting for you.</i>

821
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,086
Everyone? Waiting where?

822
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,005
<i>Where else? Your parents' house.</i>

823
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:20,384
<i>Everyone's waiting for you,</i>
<i>so hurry up and get over here.</i>

824
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,471
Wow, aren't you
the labor attorney I saw on TV?

825
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:26,849
Yes, I'm labor attorney No…

826
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,767
What the heck, U-jin?

827
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,561
Look at you, all smug.

828
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,815
They say
the boughs that bear most hang lowest,

829
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:39,486
but you're an empty husk full of hot air,
fluttering around like you're something.

830
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,612
What are you talking…

831
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:42,948
Oh, it's today.

832
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,159
- You forgot again?
- No, I was…

833
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,744
I've been really busy lately.

834
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,955
You really need to be taught a lesson.

835
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,415
How could you forget that?

836
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,916
- I ought to just…
- Come on…

837
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,336
That's why Mi-joo's here.

838
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,422
She's so much better than you.

839
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:01,049
Let's go in. They're all waiting.

840
00:46:04,887 --> 00:46:05,721
Okay.

841
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:12,644
I'm coming.

842
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,775
Dad, I'm here.

843
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,986
- Is that you, Mu-jin?
- Yes, Mom.

844
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,156
Why are you so late? Even Mi-joo is here.

845
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,158
You're here.

846
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,242
Yeah.

847
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,330
I can do it by myself. You should go rest.

848
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,541
You're in a good mood, Mom.

849
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,043
I am.

850
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:40,297
Thanks to U-jin, I got to see Mi-joo again
after so long, so I'm happy.

851
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,549
Why? You have a problem with that?

852
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,760
When did I say I had a problem with that?

853
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,845
You're happy to see her too, aren't you?

854
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:50,224
Look at his happy face.

855
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:51,683
That face?

856
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:56,730
Yes, that face.
Trying to pretend he's not happy.

857
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,524
I can tell.

858
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:02,486
Go help your father,
and say hello to your brother.

859
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,364
Yeah.

860
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,081
I'll do it, Dad.

861
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:41,733
He was on the concrete frame,
working on the ceiling slab,

862
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,902
but it hadn't set properly yet,

863
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,320
so that's how it happened.

864
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:49,408
I told the foreman countless times
that the frame would collapse.

865
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,867
Stop drinking.

866
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,995
Let go.

867
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,998
You think the foreman wanted to do that?

868
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,960
The higher-ups were breathing down
his neck, so he had no choice!

869
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,628
Stop drinking!

870
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,880
You'll end up dead too!

871
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,216
- Let go.
- This is so frustrating.

872
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,219
What's the use in saying this now?

873
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,974
Who do they think they are,
sending this here?

874
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,269
How dare they send this?

875
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,315
- Mu-jin!
- After killing him!

876
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,441
Mu-jin!

877
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,818
- What are you doing?
- How dare they!

878
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:29,364
How dare they after killing him…

879
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:32,284
Bring him back.

880
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:36,997
Bring him back! Bring my brother back!

881
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,083
Bring my brother back!

882
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,214
Bring him back…

883
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,342
Don't do this.

884
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,396
After what happened to U-jin,

885
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,858
I thought time was moving so slowly,

886
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,236
but it's already been ten years.

887
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,199
I know what you mean.

888
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:16,620
He doesn't even visit me
in my dreams anymore.

889
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,374
That heartless child.

890
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,586
Why are you crying again?

891
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,090
Hey, tell her I'm doing well
and she doesn't need to worry.

892
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:29,716
Quickly.

893
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:37,557
I'm sure U-jin is doing well.

894
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,310
I can always count on Mi-joo.

895
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,978
Be good to her, for God's sake.

896
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,439
Don't you worry about that!

897
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,735
I mean, him.

898
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,488
I'm sure U-jin is doing well

899
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,699
and enjoyed the meal we prepared for him.

900
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,370
Mom, Dad.

901
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:03,750
I'm doing well in a good place,
so don't worry about me.

902
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,545
They said when I was alive,

903
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,506
I led a good, kind life,

904
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,802
so they give me breaks
to come down like this.

905
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,931
You're right.

906
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:21,309
U-jin lived a good life,

907
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,937
so I'm sure he's in a good place.

908
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,647
Exactly.

909
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:30,152
So stop worrying about me
and live a long, healthy life.

910
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,870
My God, when did you two get so old?

911
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:45,542
It's because I broke their hearts.
I'm such a bad son.

912
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,051
Are you crying right now?

913
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,220
No, I'm not.

914
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:01,224
He is. I saw it.

915
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:02,851
Right?

916
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,020
Yes.

917
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,564
That face he makes to hide his tears,

918
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,443
I saw it a lot after U-jin died.

919
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:24,873
Why are you all staring at me?
I'm not crying. I'm fine.

920
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,841
No, you're not fine.

921
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,219
You can cry if you want to.

922
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,864
I'm sorry I forgot, U-jin.

923
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,632
Before we had our wedding,

924
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:18,552
remember we had that huge fight
and almost broke it off?

925
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,387
I remember.

926
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,556
It was when you wanted
to buy a dishwasher.

927
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,059
Yes, when you went crazy
and wanted to buy a game console instead.

928
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:30,272
Hey, for our generation, game consoles
are how we heal our childhood trauma…

929
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:35,068
At that time, U-jin came to see me
and begged me to forgive you.

930
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:36,611
He did?

931
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,613
What did he say?

932
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:42,033
He said you're an idiot
who's too proud to say sorry

933
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,537
and he doesn't want to see you
moping like a constipated dog anymore,

934
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,540
so he apologized in your place
and asked me to forgive you.

935
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:54,880
Does he think he can just say
whatever the hell he wants?

936
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:01,386
People really don't change.
You've always been like that.

937
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:05,348
You never opened up to your family or me
and always suffered alone.

938
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,685
You decide everything on your own,
making people feel lonely,

939
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,397
but you can't even hide it well
and make it so obvious.

940
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,484
After U-jin died,

941
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:21,239
though you never showed it,
I knew you were hurting inside.

942
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,617
You never say it,

943
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,870
but I know
how much you loved your brother.

944
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:30,874
Thanks for coming today.

945
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,834
I didn't come because of you.

946
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,419
It's his tenth memorial,

947
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:39,299
and U-jin meant a lot to me too.

948
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:40,967
I know.

949
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,638
You suddenly wanted to be
a labor attorney,

950
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,849
and I couldn't understand
what you were thinking.

951
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,059
But?

952
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,646
But…

953
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:56,149
if U-jin knew,
I think he would've been proud.

954
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:09,496
Hey, Mi-joo…

955
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,165
There's my cab.

956
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,375
Yeah, your cab.

957
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,085
I'm gonna go. Bye.

958
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,002
Bye.

959
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,683
You hopeless idiot.

960
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,896
If you keep dragging your feet,
you'll run out of time.

961
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,315
Life's too short. Just look at me.

962
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,610
Dear God.

963
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,570
You're even older than me now.

964
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,448
Lucky you. You don't age anymore.

965
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,910
If you're done here, go back up.

966
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:52,372
If you don't say
what you're thinking or what you want,

967
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:54,916
no one will know.

968
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,253
Do you know what I regret the most?

969
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,213
What?

970
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:05,885
Not telling the people I love
that I love them.

971
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,682
I thought I'd never get another chance,

972
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,687
so I'm really glad you're able to see me.

973
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,984
I love you, little brother.

974
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,281
Where did that come from?

975
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:30,243
You didn't know, right? That I loved you.

976
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,079
See?

977
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,248
You need to say it out loud.

978
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:41,337
And thanks for filling in for me
as the eldest son.

979
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,509
Anyway,

980
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,554
I'm leaving now.

981
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:55,018
I was happy to see you.

982
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,615
U-jin, I also…

983
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,207
was happy to see you.

984
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:37,727
Hey, Mu-jin.

985
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,529
Hui-joo!

986
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:50,532
For God's sake.
Why are you yelling in my ear?

987
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,699
Oh my God…

988
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,077
What? Did you make 1,000 won
on your app again?

989
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,665
- Good morning, big brother.
- It's a really good morning, Gyeon-u!

990
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,041
Why? What happened?

991
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,918
Did something good happen?

992
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:05,713
My crypto was down negative 90%,
but it just mooned.

993
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:09,050
Up 729%? That's insane!

994
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,553
Seven hundred and twenty-nine?

995
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:15,306
Maybe I'm getting rewarded
for all those good deeds I did!

996
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,351
Congratulations, big brother!

997
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:19,352
This is great news!

998
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:22,814
What? Why'd you stop?

999
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,483
No, this isn't the time for that.

1000
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,985
Sell it right now.

1001
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,279
- Sell it now?
- Yes.

1002
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,614
- Right now?
- You must sell it now.

1003
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:33,032
It might go up more.

1004
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,909
Crypto crashes out of nowhere.

1005
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,203
Are you never getting back with Mi-joo?

1006
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:42,625
I think it'll go up.

1007
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,294
Oh my, you still don't get it.

1008
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:46,880
Sell.

1009
00:57:50,383 --> 00:57:51,801
SELL ORDER COMPLETED

1010
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,474
Gyeon-u.

1011
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,353
- Is it good?
- Amazingly good.

1012
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,939
You're so cute when you eat.
You're adorable.

1013
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,692
Who are you calling cute?
You're even cuter.

1014
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:11,946
You're driving me crazy.
How can someone be this cute?

1015
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,198
- I'm cute, right?
- Yeah.

1016
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,451
Aren't you going home?

1017
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,872
But it's only early evening.

1018
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:23,166
Who are you to tell him to leave?

1019
00:58:23,249 --> 00:58:25,502
Dial it down. It's painful to watch.

1020
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,463
If it's painful, you can leave, okay?

1021
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,965
We've already dialed it down
because of you.

1022
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,259
- Right, Gyeon-u?
- Yeah.

1023
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,262
Hui-joo, here too.

1024
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,181
I can't. Mi-joo's here.

1025
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,307
Hey,

1026
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,727
when are you taking Ppokku to get groomed?

1027
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,270
Just look at the state of her.

1028
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,272
I've been busy.

1029
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,566
And she looks all natural and pretty.

1030
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,027
I seriously can't live with you.

1031
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,695
I can't live with you either.

1032
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,406
Mi-joo!

1033
00:58:56,741 --> 00:59:00,203
You look like you have time.
Why don't you take Ppokku on a walk?

1034
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,038
Get some air while you're at it.

1035
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,167
Fine, I'll leave.

1036
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:09,295
Come here, Ppokku.

1037
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,797
Let's get out of here.

1038
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:13,800
ASAP, please.

1039
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,093
Have fun, big sister.

1040
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,017
Great, it worked. Nice job.

1041
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,442
You owe me one, No Mu-jin.

1042
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:38,199
You wanted to go on a walk?

1043
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,416
Ppokku!

1044
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:47,917
How've you been?

1045
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:51,004
My baby, you've been good?

1046
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,755
What are you doing here?

1047
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,759
What else? I came to get you and Ppokku.

1048
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,219
So we can go home.

1049
00:59:58,845 --> 00:59:59,971
Who says I'm going?

1050
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,766
I think Ppokku wants to go. Right?

1051
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:14,277
Here.

1052
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:16,988
What's that?

1053
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,823
The severance pay I blew.

1054
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:23,620
It's not all of it,
but I recovered most of it.

1055
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,121
Why are you giving it to me?

1056
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:28,541
I might do something stupid again
if I have it, so you keep it.

1057
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:33,504
You think I'll come running
just because you give this to me?

1058
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:36,633
Mi-joo.

1059
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,218
From now on,

1060
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:41,721
I won't think alone

1061
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:43,640
or decide alone

1062
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,184
and make you lonely.

1063
01:00:48,561 --> 01:00:49,395
And?

1064
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,147
And…

1065
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:57,111
I'll talk things over with you first,
and I won't ever screw up again.

1066
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:58,571
And?

1067
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:02,533
And I love you.

1068
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,707
I'm grateful, and I'm sorry,

1069
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,002
and I love you.

1070
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,883
So let's go home.

1071
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,020
Okay.

1072
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:34,774
You just said okay.

1073
01:01:36,234 --> 01:01:37,151
Okay!

1074
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,616
Ppokku!

1075
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,827
Let's go and pack your things.

1076
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,620
Let's go pack.

1077
01:01:58,339 --> 01:01:59,340
You may.

1078
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:01,050
Yes, Your Majesty.

1079
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:03,636
Let's go.

1080
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,595
Okay.

1081
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:10,727
By the way,
Gyeon-u and Hui-joo are driving me crazy.

1082
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,061
What's wrong with them?

1083
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:14,230
They're really pissing me off!

1084
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,653
Big brother, you must be tired.

1085
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,740
The Labor Relations Commission,
your lecture, client consulting,

1086
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,032
you were so busy today.

1087
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:26,409
Thanks.

1088
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:29,787
We worked really hard today.
Why don't we grab something to eat?

1089
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:32,874
No, I can't. Ppokku's home alone.
I have to go walk her.

1090
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:36,210
Don't use Ppokku as an excuse.
I know it's because of Mi-joo.

1091
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:39,505
You know we played a huge part
in her going back home, right?

1092
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:42,717
I know. She said she couldn't stand
the two of you anymore.

1093
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,386
- I'm grateful.
- You should be.

1094
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,891
Please call me Director from now on.

1095
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,434
What are you talking about?

1096
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,520
Read it out loud, slowly and clearly.

1097
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:56,647
What's this? Director of External Affairs?

1098
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:58,858
You gave yourself a promotion?

1099
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:02,737
Yeah. I decide my own title.
I almost made myself Executive Director.

1100
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,031
Big brother, this is mine.

1101
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,574
What are you?

1102
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:11,245
Director of PR and Content?
Don't I get a say?

1103
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,248
That's right, big brother.
You must be so happy to have me.

1104
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,584
I got my Silver Play Button,
and it's Gold next.

1105
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:18,252
You hit the jackpot, big brother.

1106
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:22,256
We've planned everything out,
so you just need to follow our lead.

1107
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,425
What are you cooking up now?

1108
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:27,762
We need to grow quickly
and become a labor law firm.

1109
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:31,265
Oh, right. Yun-jae is studying hard
for the labor attorney exam,

1110
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,767
so we can recruit him later.

1111
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,936
You're jumping ahead again, Hui-joo.

1112
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:38,356
We have to jump ahead.
Will you just trail behind everyone else?

1113
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:40,441
You seriously can't do anything
without us.

1114
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,903
Gyeon-u and I got plenty of offers,

1115
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:47,740
but we're sticking with you,
and you don't even appreciate it.

1116
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,284
This is that place.

1117
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:51,911
Gyeon-u, can you stop the car?

1118
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,663
Wow.

1119
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:45,089
WE ARE NOT MACHINES
GUARANTEE BASIC LABOR RIGHTS

1120
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:06,402
"When you love, you come to know,

1121
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,529
when you know, you come to see,

1122
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:12,617
and once you see,
it will not be as before."

1123
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,286
You startled me.

1124
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:17,038
Why? It's only been a few days.

1125
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:20,666
So? Do you understand now?

1126
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:22,710
Understand what?

1127
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,462
Why…

1128
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,840
I chose you.

1129
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,012
Because I'm the son of ordinary workers,

1130
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:38,684
a bereaved family member who lost
a loved one to an industrial accident,

1131
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:43,481
and a labor attorney
who stands up for working people.

1132
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:45,816
You're not clueless.

1133
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:50,529
So? How was it doing that work?

1134
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,282
Do you think the world will change?

1135
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,786
It was harder than I thought.

1136
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,667
- Back in my day…
- Christ.

1137
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,044
…people were fed stimulants

1138
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:08,297
to work until they went blind
or coughed up blood and died,

1139
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,966
but it wasn't even newsworthy.

1140
01:06:10,549 --> 01:06:12,885
Well, back then,

1141
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:15,680
labor attorneys
who defended workers' rights

1142
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:18,474
didn't exist either.

1143
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:25,272
The world may not seem like it's changing,
but it is.

1144
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,484
Sure, it's ridiculously slow,

1145
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,861
but if that change

1146
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:34,991
is brought forward because of what you do,

1147
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,033
isn't it worthwhile?

1148
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:39,620
Really? Did I bring it forward
by maybe a second?

1149
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:41,872
A second is a bit harsh.

1150
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,417
Maybe about a minute?

1151
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:49,255
But minutes come together to become
an hour, and hours become a day.

1152
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:52,049
Anyway, thank you.

1153
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,093
For what?

1154
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,554
For letting me see my brother.

1155
01:06:58,222 --> 01:06:59,849
Thanks to you,

1156
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,144
I was finally able to
let him go in my heart.

1157
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:10,985
You need to face your wound head-on

1158
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:14,196
to know how to heal it.

1159
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,117
Well, I'm glad I was of help.

1160
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:22,747
Thank you

1161
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:26,333
for everything you've done.

1162
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,678
Stop it. It doesn't suit you.

1163
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:45,019
I appreciate all the work you've done.

1164
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,149
- What are you doing here?
- Geez.

1165
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,485
What's going on?

1166
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,614
Wait, is this statue
the burning jeans guy?

1167
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,283
I think so.

1168
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,953
We heard so much about you.

1169
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,916
Thanks to you, I got involved
in a lot of things and learned so much.

1170
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:09,376
Though it was tough at times.

1171
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:14,340
Thank you for saving my brother-in-law
and turning him into a decent human being.

1172
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,550
Hey, decent human being?

1173
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:22,431
And until the day all workers
can sleep soundly and wake up happy,

1174
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:23,933
please continue your efforts.

1175
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:30,523
Also, can we please see you too?

1176
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,525
Just once, please. Just once will do.

1177
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,444
Just once.

1178
01:08:36,362 --> 01:08:37,863
He probably won't.

1179
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,448
Is he here? Please.

1180
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:40,616
- God.
- Please.

1181
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,035
Just once, please?

1182
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:45,830
Not even a glimpse.

1183
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,834
Hey, stop. People are staring.

1184
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,378
- Yeah, he won't come out. Let's go.
- Let's go.

1185
01:08:52,461 --> 01:08:54,004
So stingy.

1186
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:02,179
What did you talk about?
Is your contract over?

1187
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:05,766
Then are you free now?
You can't see ghosts anymore?

1188
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:09,019
Oh, come on. What does it matter
if I can see them or not?

1189
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:11,021
Excuse me.

1190
01:09:13,023 --> 01:09:14,608
Labor attorney No Mu-jin?

1191
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,572
Seriously, why?

1192
01:10:35,147 --> 01:10:37,149
