1
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,581
Yes, well…

2
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:45,503
Please tell me. What should I do?

3
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,340
All right. You want to know?

4
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,760
Yes, I want to know.

5
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,471
Come closer.

6
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,601
I said, come here.

7
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,485
Essentially…

8
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,405
It's…

9
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:48,817
EMERGENCY ALERT
MAGNITUDE 5.1 EARTHQUAKE DETECTED

10
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,584
<i>Guys, look at this.</i>

11
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,337
<i>No new posts</i>
<i>after she started working at the hospital.</i>

12
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,588
<i>I feel sad.</i>

13
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,557
I'M A NURSE NOW!

14
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,851
NURSE LIFE, HERE WE COME
WE'VE GOT THIS

15
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,227
SO PRETTY! CONGRATS!

16
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,604
YOUR DREAM CAME TRUE! YOU'RE AMAZING

17
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,775
FINALLY GRADUATED
THANK YOU, EVERYONE

18
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,481
INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT
COMPENSATION INSURANCE ACT

19
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,958
WORKPLACE BULLYING

20
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:33,212
MEDICAL ACCIDENT

21
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,714
LABOR ATTORNEY NO MU-JIN

22
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,384
Wait, so she was bullied
<i>and</i> got blamed for a medical accident?

23
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,013
But the police and the union
just covered it up without investigating?

24
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:42,931
Right.

25
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,184
However, that's simply what I saw
through Eun-yeong's memories

26
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,061
while I was possessed.

27
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,898
So we need to find evidence
to prove what happened.

28
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,233
That won't be easy.

29
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:56,277
And I heard it's hard to get suicides
accepted as work-related.

30
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,195
Yes, but…

31
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,615
according to Article 36
of the Enforcement Decree,

32
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:04,118
the criteria for recognizing self-harm
as an accident on duty stipulate

33
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:07,705
that there must be a clear causal link
indicating the act was carried out

34
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,751
while the person was in a mentally
disturbed state from work-related reasons…

35
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,337
What's he saying? Did you understand that?

36
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,631
- No.
- Excuse me, Labor Attorney No.

37
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:20,260
Think of us as the client
and explain it in layman's terms.

38
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,887
Okay, so to put it simply,

39
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,640
for suicide to be recognized
as work-related, first,

40
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,184
it must have been caused
by work-related reasons,

41
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,813
and second, they must have been
mentally unstable at the time.

42
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,897
These two conditions.

43
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,860
By mentally unstable,
you mean like depression or anxiety?

44
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,614
Having medical records of that
would definitely help.

45
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,616
What if you don't have those records?

46
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,953
Well, lately, the focus has shifted
from individual vulnerabilities

47
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,204
to workplace conditions…

48
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,706
Again, can't understand.

49
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,462
Being sensitive, like you,
or emotionally vulnerable

50
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,048
are personal matters
and given less weight,

51
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,468
while more attention is placed
on workplace conditions.

52
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,014
Okay, I get it now. So?

53
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,641
First, we'll have to meet her family,

54
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,728
then as their legal representative,
we'll contact the police or…

55
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,983
- What are you doing?
- Hold on.

56
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,864
- Come on, what are you doing?
- Just wait a sec.

57
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,198
That's what I'm doing.

58
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,534
I'M FROM THE OFFICE
OF LABOR ATTORNEY NO MU-JIN

59
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:28,745
- I'm working.
- I'm working too.

60
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,246
What work are you doing?

61
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,915
You said you need to meet her family.

62
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,294
I searched Eun-yeong's account
and messaged her brother.

63
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,712
He replied right away.

64
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,088
That's my Hui-joo.

65
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,508
They're in Busan.
He'll send us his parents' details.

66
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,178
And Eun-yeong's nurse friend,
Si-yeon, was it?

67
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,637
I'll contact her too.

68
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:55,772
Going somewhere?

69
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,566
- Home.
- Home?

70
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,110
- It's six o'clock.
- It's six o'clock?

71
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,071
But…

72
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,115
This is when clients come, after work,
but you're leaving?

73
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,328
When did we ever have clients come?
We only ever get ghosts.

74
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,289
Besides, you don't pay us for overtime.

75
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,125
- No reason to stick together all the time.
- That's true.

76
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,754
You're so heartless.
Aren't you worried I might die?

77
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,839
That bodhisattva always saves you.

78
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,009
Plus, you got electrocuted last time,
but you're fine.

79
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,261
- So why worry?
- That's true.

80
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:31,891
And that bodhisattva or general guy said
he'd keep Eun-yeong's soul with him.

81
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,602
If I'm here alone,

82
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,814
I get scared!

83
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,274
No one told you to stay here.

84
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,194
Why are you crashing here
when you've got your own home?

85
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:47,198
Isn't it a waste paying that huge mortgage
monthly just to leave the place empty?

86
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,199
That's enough.

87
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,287
His wife isn't home.
He must be lonely there!

88
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:55,957
Hui-joo.

89
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,838
I'll go home!

90
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,714
I'm going!

91
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,717
- Go! Please, go!
- I am!

92
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:43,880
<i>Mu-jin! I've set up a meeting</i>
<i>with Eun-yeong's parents.</i>

93
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:48,134
<i>We're meeting them on Sunday at 1:00 p.m.</i>
<i>at their restaurant.</i>

94
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,219
<i>I'll send you the address</i>
<i>and number later.</i>

95
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,137
<i>Okay.</i>

96
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,778
That's hilarious.

97
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,990
- Hey, what time is it right now?
- I don't know. Maybe after 11?

98
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,118
Hey, come home early
so you can take Ppokku on a walk.

99
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,829
Pay up what you owe me
for walking her first.

100
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,915
Before I report you for unpaid wages.

101
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,292
Here.

102
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,212
I don't like this one.

103
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,552
Hey, stop hanging out with Gyeon-u
if you're not serious.

104
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,428
Make it clear where you stand.

105
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,764
Stop giving him false hope.

106
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,474
What false hope?

107
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,768
He seems to think you two are dating.

108
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,271
What about you?

109
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:27,984
We're not. I have quite high standards
when it comes to whom I date.

110
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,695
But Gyeon-u didn't meet those standards.

111
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,490
Ppokku, snack time.

112
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,536
Standards? What are they? Let's hear them.

113
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,708
It's none of your business, okay?

114
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,919
Come on, the ones who met
those high standards,

115
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,839
Ki-hyeon, Sang-cheol, Jun-su,
where are they now?

116
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,757
Come on, tell me.

117
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,926
Excuse me,
but this is rich coming from you

118
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,262
when you acted like
you'd die without Mu-jin.

119
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:00,474
Since we're on the subject,
I have a question for you.

120
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,768
What do you think of Mu-jin?

121
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,103
What do you mean?

122
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,772
You won't go home,
but you won't divorce him either.

123
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,399
What exactly is this?

124
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:14,697
How should I put this?

125
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,325
<i>Bul-gyeon-sang-gyeon-jeol-chi.</i>

126
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,327
What?

127
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,038
<i>Bul-gyeon-sang-gyeon-jeol-chi.</i>

128
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,374
What's she saying? Ppokku, come here.

129
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,918
What would you know?

130
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,339
And don't buy this again, okay?

131
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,258
I prefer the body, not the legs. Got it?

132
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,844
Don't eat it then.

133
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,806
Hey, I was eating that! That's just mean.

134
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,227
<i>Bul-gyeon-sang-gyeon… jeol-chi,</i> was it?

135
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,983
"You miss them when you don't see them
but can't stand them when you do."

136
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,111
So she does miss him.

137
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,697
Seriously, what are they doing?

138
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,345
EUN-YEONG'S SASHIMI HOUSE

139
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,388
<i>To us,</i>

140
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,516
even though she had a lot of work,

141
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,684
she said it was doable,

142
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,894
that she was okay,

143
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,730
that she was doing well,

144
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,274
so we thought that was the case.

145
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,028
She said that so you two wouldn't worry.

146
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,571
She clearly wasn't okay.

147
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,156
Exactly.

148
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,618
That kind and sweet girl,

149
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,454
she had no one to talk to.

150
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:50,126
She must've been so lonely.
When I think about that…

151
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:53,587
Yes.

152
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,215
It would've been hard for her.

153
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,385
She died like that at the hospital.

154
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:03,514
I wanted to know what happened to her
and why she made that choice.

155
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,142
I was so upset and frustrated,

156
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,643
so I visited the hospital

157
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,855
and even the biggest
labor law firm in Seoul.

158
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,107
You did? And then?

159
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,734
They suddenly dropped the case.

160
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,155
They said it'd be the same
wherever we went.

161
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,783
We don't know what else we can do.

162
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,707
That must've been hard.

163
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,673
Thank you

164
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,010
for taking an interest
in our daughter's case

165
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,263
and coming all this way

166
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,432
from Seoul.

167
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,100
No, it's all right.

168
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,185
Please look at this.

169
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,023
That's the firm we visited.

170
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,816
Will that help?

171
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,153
Right, yes. I'll look into it.

172
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,991
We'd appreciate that.

173
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,758
- Hey, that's her, right?
- Yeah.

174
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,178
She's basically set up camp there.

175
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,265
Hey, she won't come up
to our department, will she?

176
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,394
<i>Everything go okay in Busan?</i>

177
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,565
<i>Yeah, I'm on my way back.</i>
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

178
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,525
<i>It's a secret.</i>

179
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,610
<i>Where are you? Don't mess around.</i>

180
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,905
<i>Hui-joo's at the hospital.</i>

181
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,658
<i>Why?</i>

182
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,620
<i>Talk later when we meet. I'm busy.</i>

183
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:03,259
How many times has it been already?
Can't you give the shot right?

184
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,887
You've been poking me nonstop!
Are you trying to torture me?

185
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,598
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it. Just get the doctor.

186
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,310
Earlier, Ms. Kim Ok-ja got delirious,

187
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:17,273
pulled out her drainage tube,
and trashed the room.

188
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,941
What is with today, seriously?

189
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,569
- Why can't any of you give a shot right?
- I'll go.

190
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:25,030
Look here.
I'm bruised from all that poking!

191
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,867
I'm very sorry, sir.
I'll try better this time.

192
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,285
I'm sorry.

193
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,580
Where have you been?

194
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,917
Sorry. Someone came to see us.

195
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,794
Who?

196
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,381
Speak up.

197
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,594
It's the labor attorney's office
that took on Eun-yeong's case.

198
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,929
They wanted to meet me

199
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,099
and said they'd wait in the lobby
until I came.

200
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,560
And?

201
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,439
I just went to see if they really came.
I didn't meet them.

202
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,028
But I'm worried they might
come up to our department.

203
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,864
You've got to be kidding me.

204
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,158
Why are they digging that up again?

205
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,412
Okay, fine. Just watch what you say.

206
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:28,093
She was clearly set on waiting
until you came.

207
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,011
What will you do?

208
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,555
I don't know.

209
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,183
It'll look weird if I keep avoiding her.

210
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,894
But won't things blow up
if you do meet her?

211
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,687
We signed an NDA.

212
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,356
Still.

213
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,525
When I think about Eun-yeong,
I feel like maybe I should…

214
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,280
step in and do something.

215
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,409
Considering she's living just fine.

216
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,537
Hey, she'll hear you.

217
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,049
Why, seriously, why?

218
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,637
Why are they digging into that again?

219
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,556
In any case,

220
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,311
you take charge of this situation
and keep the other nurses in check.

221
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,689
We're in trouble if this gets to the top.
Got it?

222
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,862
Why aren't you answering?

223
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:36,328
Cho Eun-yeong ended up like that
because you burned her out completely.

224
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,081
You should've known when to stop.

225
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,334
Your order was what did it!

226
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,502
Don't be absurd!

227
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,256
In any case,

228
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,591
if this escalates,

229
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,511
it won't be easy for the hospital
to cover for what you did.

230
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,097
Doctor…

231
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,599
Anyway, this situation is on you,

232
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,020
so do whatever it takes
to keep this from escalating.

233
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,582
<i>Hui-joo, she left your messages on read.</i>
<i>It's no use just sitting there.</i>

234
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,542
I'm sure word got around though.

235
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,754
I spent the whole day here,
so a lot of people were curious.

236
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,508
The things I do for you. Just so you know.

237
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,844
<i>Sure, I'll just know.</i>

238
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,013
<i>I'm almost back in Seoul now.</i>

239
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,391
<i>We have places to go tomorrow,</i>
<i>so get some rest.</i>

240
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,809
More places tomorrow?

241
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,228
Okay, good job today. See you tomorrow.

242
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,064
Okay.

243
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,400
I'm exhausted.

244
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,238
LAW FIRM GEOSEONG
LEE SEUNG-WON

245
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,949
We did take on that case,

246
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,287
but there was no evidence and no angle,
so we stepped away.

247
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,751
So you opened your practice recently?

248
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,212
Yes.

249
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,424
I get that you're eager
since you're just starting out,

250
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,094
but you'll know from meeting the family

251
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,680
that there's no evidence,
like messages or recordings.

252
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:20,099
Even if there is,

253
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,143
they'll say her stress doesn't seem
above the societal average

254
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,436
and reject the case.

255
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,690
Plus, I heard the staff of that hospital
come from a mix of schools,

256
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,485
so the hierarchy is not as rigid,

257
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,988
and the hazing isn't as bad.

258
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,660
Why would someone die if it wasn't bad?

259
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,663
Well, the deceased may have been
the sensitive type.

260
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,541
Some people
can't handle pressure, you know.

261
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,168
This is a difficult case.

262
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,212
That's why we stepped away.

263
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,717
Well, give it your best shot.

264
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,393
What's with his tone?
"Well, give it your best shot"?

265
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,479
The deceased was sensitive?
Can't handle pressure? Geez.

266
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,773
It's like he works for the hospital.

267
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,697
Their office sure was nice though.

268
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,324
It was.

269
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,619
I wonder how much his salary is.
Probably a lot, right?

270
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,621
That would explain the watch.

271
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,040
You saw his watch too!

272
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,417
It was super flashy.

273
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,879
Is that why you were hiding yours?

274
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,339
You saw that?

275
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,343
She saw that?

276
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,262
Darn it.

277
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,431
There's nothing special.

278
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,101
"A nurse working at the hospital took
her own life by jumping off the roof."

279
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,102
That's all.

280
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,064
There's no sign of foul play,
so we can't investigate further.

281
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,526
She took her own life
while on duty at the hospital,

282
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,028
so is it not related?

283
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,322
That's how it usually happens.

284
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,032
What?

285
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,911
Suicides don't always
happen quietly at home.

286
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,872
Nor do they travel
to a mountain or the sea.

287
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:10,125
Many act on impulse
and do it where they happen to be.

288
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,961
Office workers do it at work,
students at schools.

289
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,423
Recently, a prosecutor jumped
from the prosecution building.

290
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:20,427
Nurses spend long hours
at their hospital, so, you know…

291
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,224
Did you notice anything unusual
during the investigation?

292
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,520
Well, I heard she used to be cheerful,

293
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,107
but she had a hard time
after she broke up with her boyfriend

294
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,859
and said she didn't want to live.

295
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,361
Her boyfriend?

296
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,031
- Is that what her coworkers said?
- Yes.

297
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,742
People who choose to end their lives

298
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,787
are usually driven by impulse
or emotional pain

299
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,873
more often than you'd think.

300
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,212
Did you not look into workplace bullying?

301
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,339
There was nothing in particular.

302
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,425
You must know as a labor attorney,

303
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,136
but suicides don't usually
get approved as work-related.

304
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,889
Unless there's a key witness
or solid evidence.

305
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,226
So you couldn't find anything
that could be a lead.

306
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,310
Exactly.

307
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,563
If I did, I would've handed the case
over to the Labor Office.

308
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,067
Right.

309
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,528
Thank you.

310
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:31,373
I mean, seriously, an ex-boyfriend?
This is really pissing me off.

311
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,709
The hospital hides it.
Her coworkers are silent.

312
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,461
We should look
for that ex-boyfriend, right?

313
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,089
But how do we find him?

314
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,883
He won't be following his ex
on social media.

315
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,178
God, nothing is ever easy, is it?

316
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,139
Let's drink this and calm down.

317
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,808
Mu-jin, I'll pay.

318
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,892
Excuse me.

319
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,186
Hey, Yun-jae.

320
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,733
How come you're always here?
Don't you get days off?

321
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,234
I don't.

322
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,444
Why not?

323
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,531
Why do you ask? Are you going to
fight with my boss for me?

324
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,161
If you're being wronged, tell me.
I'll handle it for you.

325
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,871
Are you really a labor attorney?

326
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,042
God, are you kidding me?

327
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,003
Of course I am. Don't you see this?

328
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:21,548
This is my badge from the Certified
Public Labor Attorney Association.

329
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,300
I paid 1.2 million won for this.

330
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:26,094
Really? Why's it so expensive? Is it gold?

331
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,263
It's 14-karat gold.

332
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:30,474
Hey, then it's not even pure gold.

333
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,309
That'll be 2,000 won.

334
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:35,228
This weighs differently from regular gold.

335
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,271
Why?

336
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,483
It carries the weight of duty
and professional integrity

337
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,609
as a labor attorney.

338
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:44,613
So that's why
your shoulder leans heavier on this side.

339
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,865
Because of that weight.

340
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:47,866
You're mocking me.

341
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,119
What? No, I'm not.
It looks shinier now after hearing that.

342
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,704
- Thank you.
- I feel annoyed.

343
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:55,457
Hey, come talk to me, okay?

344
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,590
Attention!

345
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:07,886
Nowadays, reporting is all about the gear,
so I prepared something.

346
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,179
The latest tech.

347
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,307
What did you buy this time?

348
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,684
These glasses.

349
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,563
Full HD, 62GB storage, a built-in mic,
can record and even make Bluetooth calls.

350
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,690
Here, look.

351
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,526
It connects to an app.

352
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:32,077
Wow, see this? That's the camera.
Wanna test it out? What should we film?

353
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,287
We're not filming anything, Gyeon-u.

354
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,165
Get it out of my face!

355
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,843
What's with the mood?

356
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,137
Why? Did nothing come up?

357
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,307
It looks like the hospital blamed
personal issues for her suicide.

358
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:58,603
Something about having a hard time
because of her boyfriend or whatever.

359
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,273
- A boyfriend? That's their story?
- I know.

360
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:05,068
What a bunch of crooks.
No wonder Eun-yeong's holding a grudge.

361
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,445
We've got nothing to go on.

362
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:12,075
If this blew up in the media,
we could get the Labor Office involved.

363
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,161
Even the police said nothing was wrong,

364
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,705
so the hospital
must've kept everyone quiet

365
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,874
and swept it all under the rug.

366
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,543
If we need media attention,
we can create that.

367
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,962
If the hospital covered it up,
we can uncover it.

368
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,426
Hey, we should do that. You're so smart!

369
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,512
You really believe that? Huh, Gyeon-u?

370
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,724
As if it's that easy.
I came back with nothing last time.

371
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,642
It's really tough.

372
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:38,727
- Hui-joo.
- Yes?

373
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,812
Please make a copy of these.

374
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:45,150
How about we go back to the hospital
and test the new gear while we're at it?

375
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,653
If we want to draw media attention,
we should dig around there first.

376
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,863
You think they'll go,

377
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,199
"Yes, we covered it up
and falsified everything"

378
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,992
if you dig around there?

379
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,202
And don't you remember?

380
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,621
Mu-jin was possessed
by Eun-yeong last time

381
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,748
and went all crazy like this.

382
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,125
He's been blacklisted,
so he can't go near there.

383
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,212
Oh, man.

384
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,297
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'll get them.

385
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,345
That paper slid in there.

386
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,554
Yeah, you're right.

387
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,389
- Is that important?
- Yes, it is.

388
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,891
It could be the key evidence.

389
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,436
The clog warning?

390
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,649
No, not that. The report in the hospital.

391
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,692
- Report?
- Report?

392
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,655
Yes, the workplace bullying report
Eun-yeong submitted.

393
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,450
Am I verbally abusing you?
Is this abuse of authority?

394
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,997
If we find that,
we can prove she was bullied at work

395
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,959
and that the hospital covered it up.

396
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,337
Where is it?

397
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:52,842
It was some…

398
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,303
storage room.

399
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,639
Underneath the cabinet.

400
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,432
Oh my God.

401
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,644
You picked the right person for the job.

402
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:07,399
But seriously, will people fall for this
just because you're wearing a white coat?

403
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,151
- Shall I go?
- No!

404
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:14,364
No way. You're high risk.
Not after that scene you caused.

405
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,533
Don't worry. Have faith in me.

406
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,036
Switch on.

407
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,746
Wait.

408
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,085
Okay, screen check complete.

409
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,255
Okay, go to the department
where Eun-yeong worked

410
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:31,631
and look for any cabinets.

411
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,301
I'll watch from here
and radio you if I remember.

412
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,511
Yes, big brother.
I'll do a thorough search.

413
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,889
Then I'm off to do my rounds.

414
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,771
It's like he was made for this.

415
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,897
I know, right?

416
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,612
Hello.

417
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,955
What are they smiling for?

418
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,374
Stay healthy.

419
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,751
<i>Hey, Ko Gyeon-u.</i>

420
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,712
Stop fooling around
and do your job properly.

421
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,796
<i>Got it?</i>

422
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,933
Na Hui-joo, don't worry.

423
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,687
It's the women who'll get tempted, not me.

424
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,900
Whatever.

425
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:35,070
This hospital is huge,
so the nurses won't know every doctor.

426
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,363
So no need to be nervous.

427
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,031
Okay.

428
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,409
As if he'd get nervous.

429
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,286
It's really strange,

430
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,956
but he has this unique charm that makes
you feel both uneasy and reassured.

431
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,249
Damn it.

432
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,378
Was it something I said?

433
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,463
No, it's not that.

434
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,758
I'm sorry, but I need the bathroom.

435
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,594
Must you pick up
your boyfriend's habits too?

436
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,554
He's not my boyfriend.

437
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,474
And that's a gross habit. Here.

438
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,481
Hello.

439
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,857
Hello.

440
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,693
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

441
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,572
Which floor are you going to?

442
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,034
Internal Medicine.

443
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,755
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

444
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,013
<i>Right.</i>

445
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,098
<i>Open that door.</i>

446
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,979
<i>It's not here.</i>

447
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,777
This isn't it.

448
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,199
You think you deserve to work here?

449
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,285
You need to get your act together.

450
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,204
You're the reason
the juniors are so incompetent.

451
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,625
Wait. Gyeon-u, hold on.

452
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,004
Circle back to that nurse again.

453
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,922
That nurse? Who?

454
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,049
- Don't say anything.
- Right.

455
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,843
<i>- I said, keep quiet.</i>
- Right.

456
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,432
I'm sorry.

457
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,601
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

458
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,604
That's Seo-jeong.

459
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,483
Who? Shall I try talking to her?

460
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:42,989
No, I'll meet with her.
You look for that report.

461
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,867
And people will think it's weird,
so stop replying.

462
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,910
Okay.

463
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:51,790
Excuse me.

464
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,417
Where might the storage room be?

465
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,544
You mean the supply room?

466
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,629
Yes, supply room.

467
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,298
Turn the corner and it's at the end.

468
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,175
Thank you.

469
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,600
Where did he go? Did he need the bathroom?

470
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,405
Really? We had a doctor
that good-looking here?

471
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,658
He was unbelievable.

472
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:30,620
His face was so small
I thought he was a model.

473
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,372
No one looks like that here.

474
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,375
Maybe it's the new medical intern
starting today.

475
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:40,547
He said, "Excuse me.
Where might the storage room be?"

476
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,634
His voice is amazing too.

477
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,177
Who could it be?

478
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,641
What's got you all excited?
Got nothing better to do?

479
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:53,560
Ji-seon, we were just…

480
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,437
A new intern's coming today.
Has no one turned up?

481
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:01,943
Someone I didn't know did ask me
where the supply room was.

482
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,236
Was that the intern?

483
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,617
When I was doing the rounds,
the patient had a bad headache…

484
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,504
- Elevator, guy in beige.
- What?

485
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,756
That nutjob is back again.

486
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,805
Excuse me!

487
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,601
Wait! Hold up!

488
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,983
The emergency room
blacklist patient is back.

489
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,192
We're checking now!

490
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,870
- Damn it.
- Damn it.

491
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,288
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir!

492
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,005
Are you the new medical intern?

493
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,384
Yes, I'm the intern.

494
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,844
<i>I was looking for something.</i>

495
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,096
That's weird.

496
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,391
I was told the new intern
was a female doctor.

497
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:17,727
Female?

498
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,564
Gyeon-u, I think she's on to you.

499
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,284
There he is!

500
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:34,285
Stop right there!

501
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,372
Out of the way!

502
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:39,290
What's your name?

503
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,001
What department are you in?

504
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,544
Internal Medicine.

505
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,421
I'm with Urology.

506
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,589
- Well then.
- Wait.

507
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,842
We don't have a urology department here.

508
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,263
Act as natural as you can and run!

509
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,599
Have a good day.

510
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,559
Hey!

511
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,686
Hey!

512
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,117
Security? This is Unit 81.

513
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:21,791
Good thinking getting rid of that coat.

514
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,169
- I didn't know my Gyeon-u was this smart.
- "My Gyeon-u"?

515
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,421
So are we official now?

516
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,048
<i>I wonder if Mu-jin's okay.</i>

517
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,883
Mu-jin? What about him?

518
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,427
<i>Didn't he go to the bathroom?</i>

519
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,013
He said he was going to meet
Eun-yeong's coworker.

520
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,305
Seo-jeong, was it?

521
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,141
What? Seo-jeong?

522
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,435
The one who bullied Eun-yeong?

523
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,229
- What? Bullied?
<i>- We need to find Mu-jin fast.</i>

524
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:46,399
If Eun-yeong possesses him again
and she tries to take revenge,

525
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,817
we're in big trouble! Hurry!

526
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,986
Right, okay. I'll look for him.

527
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,448
<i>A report came in from IM.</i>

528
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,700
<i>A suspicious individual</i>
<i>is posing as a doctor.</i>

529
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,785
<i>- He's wearing a white coat…</i>
- Anything else?

530
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,955
<i>He's tall and good-looking.</i>

531
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,795
What do you want?

532
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,880
It's not him.

533
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,506
Sorry.

534
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:14,260
I'll find the nutjob.
You find the good-looking one.

535
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,344
Yes, sir!

536
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,896
Excuse me, do you know
where Nurse Lee Seo-jeong is?

537
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,607
She's doing her rounds.
What is this about?

538
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,950
Sorry.

539
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:44,624
Stop!

540
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,877
The blacklisted visitor
passed the Unit 82 nurse station

541
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,420
and disappeared to the right.

542
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,809
- It's the handsome guy!
- Thank you.

543
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,815
Seriously!

544
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,700
Hey, Gyeon-u!

545
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,244
Big brother!

546
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,747
Are you all right?

547
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,251
- Are you yourself?
- What are you doing?

548
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,920
Not here for revenge?
I heard Seo-jeong bullied her.

549
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:31,838
I'm myself.

550
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,590
- Why did you come here?
- Just to hear her out.

551
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,635
- By the way…
- Yeah?

552
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,595
I'm being chased.

553
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,931
Hey, me too.

554
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,143
They're coming.

555
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,436
- Where do we go now?
- Up. Go up.

556
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,980
But I just came down.

557
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,977
Make sure to read through it, then sign.

558
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,814
She should've known when to stop.

559
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,947
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

560
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,192
You really hated Eun-yeong.

561
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,280
Do you feel better now?

562
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:44,303
<i>This happened</i>
<i>because you didn't train her properly.</i>

563
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,223
Do you call that doing your job?

564
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,934
It really wasn't me!

565
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,113
<i>No issues on the eighth floor.</i>

566
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:06,075
Okay. We'll check the ninth
and tenth floors and let you know.

567
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,455
<i>And there's a woman standing on the roof.</i>
<i>I think it's one of our nurses.</i>

568
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,915
Okay, I'll go up there.

569
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:34,520
Hello?

570
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,315
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- On the roof. Did the video cut out?

571
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,941
<i>- And Mu-jin?</i>
- He's with me.

572
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,861
<i>- Stay right there. I'm coming up.</i>
- Okay.

573
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,572
- Is it Hui-joo?
- She's coming.

574
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:55,750
Hey!

575
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,002
No!

576
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,086
You can't!

577
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,255
Don't, Nurse Lee.

578
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,720
Who are you?

579
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,139
I'm…

580
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,226
I'm the labor attorney
handling Ms. Cho Eun-yeong's case.

581
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,356
Cho Eun-yeong?

582
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,983
Yes. Please come down from there.

583
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,534
I really didn't have a choice back then.

584
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,759
Hold tight!

585
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,805
Don't let go!

586
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:06,862
You can't let go.

587
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,047
Cho Eun-yeong?

588
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,757
Cho Eun-yeong?

589
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,884
Oh no, this is bad.

590
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,680
Eun-yeong?

591
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,690
I'm sorry.

592
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,236
If you're sorry…

593
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,698
please tell everyone the truth.

594
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,454
You know what really happened.

595
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:02,793
I'm sorry.

596
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,847
Don't die like this.

597
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,606
Live and make amends!

598
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,633
Are you okay?

599
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,487
I'm sorry.

600
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:17,910
Mu-jin!

601
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,413
Mu-jin, are you okay? You're not hurt?

602
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:22,915
He's okay.

603
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,059
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

604
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,702
<i>A colleague who worked</i>
<i>with the late Cho Eun-yeong…</i>

605
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,328
We're getting crazy views.

606
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,290
It might hit a million views
in record time.

607
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,709
<i>She handed in a report</i>
<i>to the grievance committee?</i>

608
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,336
- We got 5,000 won in donations.
- That's amazing.

609
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,964
Come on, settle down.

610
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:15,718
<i>She put a lot of thought into it</i>
<i>before filing the report.</i>

611
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:18,762
<i>When the workplace bullying report</i>

612
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,765
<i>she submitted to the grievance committee</i>

613
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:26,020
<i>ended up in the hands</i>
<i>of the preceptor who had bullied her,</i>

614
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,605
<i>Eun-yeong was crushed.</i>

615
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,715
Yes!

616
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,719
She must've felt
that the hospital wasn't on her side.

617
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,473
Because of that,
her preceptor disliked her even more.

618
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,516
What happened to that preceptor?

619
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,852
Things weren't good
after Eun-yeong's incident.

620
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,981
She was labeled as the bully
and was isolated.

621
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,444
What did the hospital say
regarding Ms. Cho's death?

622
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:21,575
They said to tell the police
that she struggled after her breakup,

623
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,621
that she couldn't adjust
to working at a hospital.

624
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,832
They told us to decline
all interview requests.

625
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,419
If workplace bullying was brought up,

626
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,256
they said
we'd all be seen as perpetrators,

627
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,718
and it would ruin
the hospital's reputation.

628
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,721
Besides the bullying,

629
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,724
I heard there was another incident
that led to her death.

630
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,644
There was a medical accident,

631
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,940
and the doctor blamed it on Eun-yeong.

632
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,611
<i>It wasn't her mistake,</i>
<i>but there was talk of a lawsuit.</i>

633
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,406
<i>And her career was on the line.</i>

634
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,202
<i>But everyone just looked</i>
<i>the other way, so…</i>

635
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,079
I USED TO BE EUN-YEONG'S BOYFRIEND

636
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,122
CAN WE MEET?

637
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:09,665
<i>It hit her hard.</i>

638
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:14,002
I got a message saying that they have
information to share about Eun-yeong.

639
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:16,130
Who is it?

640
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,715
I thought this might be of help.

641
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,598
<i>Working late again?</i>

642
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,768
<i>Have to work overtime again. Sorry.</i>

643
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,646
<i>My poor baby's having such a hard time.</i>

644
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,983
<i>Should I come to you?</i>

645
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,734
<i>I can't leave my station.</i>

646
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:39,528
<i>Not even for a bit?</i>

647
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,574
<i>Maybe I should just get hospitalized</i>
<i>so I can see you.</i>

648
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,368
<i>Eun-yeong.</i>

649
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,163
<i>Where did you go?</i>

650
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:51,832
<i>Leaving me on read?</i>

651
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,126
I heard the hospital said

652
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:57,629
Eun-yeong made that choice
because we broke up.

653
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,174
I didn't know.

654
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:03,343
I found out after watching your video.

655
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,220
I see.

656
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,263
Yes.

657
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,141
As you can see,

658
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:11,518
Eun-yeong was…

659
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,396
<i>struggling long before we broke up.</i>

660
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,148
You finally found some time for me,

661
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:18,442
Miss Busy Nurse.

662
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,278
Please don't say it like that.

663
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,448
- You said you'd quit.
- You think I didn't try?

664
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,576
They won't let me
because they're short-staffed.

665
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,286
Your hospital's ridiculous.

666
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:34,208
They framed you and cut your pay
but won't let you quit?

667
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,503
Should I just post about this online?

668
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,796
They'll know it's me from what it says.

669
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:44,092
Please, just don't make this
into a big deal.

670
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,553
You're so frustrating.

671
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,477
The Cho Eun-yeong I knew
was bright and energetic.

672
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,233
Every time you're like this,
I honestly don't know what to do anymore.

673
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,197
So I'm planning to take some time off.

674
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,910
I can take sick leave
if I'm diagnosed with depression.

675
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,209
She mentioned
getting diagnosed with depression?

676
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:18,919
Yes.

677
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,839
She went to a hospital
and took medication.

678
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,468
That's great!

679
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,264
That's not what I meant.

680
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,517
Medical records for depression
can help with her case.

681
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,605
I know it may seem meaningless
at this point,

682
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,024
but we still owe it to her

683
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:45,445
to clear her name
and uncover the truth behind her death.

684
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,406
You're right.

685
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,992
She really struggled,

686
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,620
so it must've been hard
when everyone looked away.

687
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,545
I looked away as well.

688
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,966
I was new to my job too,
so I was busy and tired,

689
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,261
and Eun-yeong kept saying
how hard things were.

690
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,015
It got a bit overwhelming.

691
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,310
There was nothing I could do for her.

692
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,354
But…

693
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,778
But I still should've helped her somehow.

694
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,325
I should've been there for her.

695
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,788
But I wasn't able to.

696
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,709
I feel terrible about it…

697
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,964
and I regret it so much.

698
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,031
- By the way, Mu-jin.
- Yeah?

699
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,700
Who were you when you hugged him?

700
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,159
What do you mean?

701
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,996
When you hugged Eun-yeong's boyfriend,
were you yourself or Eun-yeong?

702
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:01,998
Of course it was Eun-yeong.

703
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,420
Of course it was Eun-yeong!

704
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,383
- Why are you getting angry?
- I'm not angry.

705
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:24,229
<i>Find the order sheet and get rid of it</i>

706
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,357
<i>if you don't want this to escalate.</i>

707
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,275
<i>Are we clear?</i>

708
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,534
What are you doing this early?

709
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,287
Good morning.

710
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:24,915
- Where's Gyeon-u?
- He was up all night editing.

711
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,875
I asked what you were doing.

712
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,924
I'll buy you fried chicken.

713
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,551
Feel good?

714
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,345
Feel good about that, do you?

715
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,972
Shouldn't I be?

716
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,809
Have it all to yourself.
I can't take anything from you.

717
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,143
You're so sad and pitiful.

718
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,603
Fine, I'll have it alone!

719
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,732
TO LABOR ATTORNEY NO MU-JIN

720
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,667
Hi, guys. We're starting today's live.

721
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,794
Our hero, labor attorney No Mu-jin,

722
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:14,172
is on his way today to file a petition
at the Labor Office

723
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,550
to seek justice
for the late nurse Cho Eun-yeong,

724
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:20,637
who took her own life six months ago
at a major hospital in Seoul.

725
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,684
He submitted as evidence
Nurse Cho's depression diagnosis

726
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,937
and the workplace bullying report
previously buried by the hospital

727
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,064
and he is requesting a special inspection

728
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:34,025
to investigate
the hospital's suspected manipulation

729
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,444
of the malpractice
attributed to Nurse Cho.

730
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:41,908
Let's hear a few words
from the bereaved mother.

731
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,620
Our labor attorney
has worked incredibly hard.

732
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,415
I sincerely hope

733
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:53,044
that this brings justice for my daughter.

734
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,090
For taking this much interest
in what happened to my daughter,

735
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:58,717
I am truly grateful.

736
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:02,053
A word, please, Labor Attorney No.

737
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:06,182
I only did my part as a labor attorney.

738
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,437
Ma'am. Let's go.

739
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,564
Good luck.

740
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:14,608
- Gyeon-u, a 20,000-won donation.
- Twenty?

741
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,445
Thank you, Taming Gondre Rice,
for donating 20,000 won.

742
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,571
Five thousand won!

743
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:23,283
Thank you, Taejo to Beyoncé,
for donating 5,000 won.

744
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,201
Then, so long.

745
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,705
- We'll start with the admin office.
- Yes, it's this way.

746
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,582
Excuse me, sir,

747
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,792
we hope this goes well.

748
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,087
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Lead the way.

749
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,133
Please move aside.

750
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,151
- Clear out this desk.
- Yes, sir.

751
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:09,913
- Is this your desk, Dr. Park Hyeon-u?
- Yes.

752
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,586
What's this?

753
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,005
What's going on?

754
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:36,982
So, basically,

755
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,986
I keep seeing things,

756
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,696
and I can't seem to sleep.

757
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:46,574
It feels like something's stuck here,
so I can't really breathe.

758
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,202
But the MRI came back normal.

759
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:52,580
Psychological problems
don't show up on scans.

760
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:56,793
I feel like everyone's looking at me
and talking badly about me.

761
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,045
Those looks are just too…

762
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,090
So…

763
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,553
Is this social anxiety? Or panic disorder?

764
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,638
Let's get you on medication first.

765
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,474
If that doesn't help, you'll have to rest.

766
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:14,978
There's no other way.
Something more serious could happen.

767
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,983
<i>It has been revealed that the death</i>
<i>by suicide of Nurse Cho Eun-yeong</i>

768
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,193
<i>was caused by workplace bullying</i>

769
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,988
<i>and an attempt by an attending physician</i>

770
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,866
<i>to shift responsibility</i>
<i>of his medical error onto her.</i>

771
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,785
<i>It has also emerged that the hospital</i>

772
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:34,664
<i>attempted to manipulate and conceal</i>
<i>these facts, causing widespread shock.</i>

773
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:40,587
<i>The prosecution plans to indict</i>
<i>the senior nurse and attending physician.</i>

774
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:45,592
The order sheet Nurse Lee sent us
played a big part, right?

775
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,969
<i>…unfair treatment</i>
<i>is once again under scrutiny.</i>

776
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,388
<i>To root out toxic workplace bullying,</i>

777
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:53,016
<i>experts agree that</i>
<i>structural reforms must come first,</i>

778
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:56,853
<i>addressing hierarchical organizational</i>
<i>culture, excessive workloads,</i>

779
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:59,147
<i>and narrow advancement opportunities.</i>

780
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,274
<i>Meanwhile, the case</i>
<i>of Nurse Cho Eun-yeong,</i>

781
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:03,943
<i>once at risk of being overlooked,</i>
<i>was brought to light</i>

782
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,697
<i>thanks to the persistent efforts of</i>
<i>a channel covering industrial accidents.</i>

783
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,575
<i>This case is drawing close attention</i>
<i>from the labor sector</i>

784
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:13,578
<i>whether suicide will be recognized</i>
<i>as a work-related accident</i>

785
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:17,332
<i>under Article 37, Paragraph 2 of</i>
<i>the Industrial Accident Compensation Act.</i>

786
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,459
That's my channel!

787
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,086
I'm Gyeonjjang!

788
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,588
Everyone, please subscribe to
and like my channel.

789
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,633
Sit down. You're embarrassing me.

790
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,051
Big brother.

791
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,595
- Do I embarrass you?
- Of course.

792
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:31,930
What?

793
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,807
Mu-jin.

794
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,563
- Thanks for grilling the meat.
- Yes, thank you.

795
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:44,526
Not uploading nationalism videos anymore?

796
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,779
I deleted all his previous content.

797
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:50,490
Gyeonjjang TV flows with the times.

798
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,325
Excuse me, it's broken over here.

799
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:55,703
- Sorry? What is?
- Our flow. Please bring us more meat.

800
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,623
- Yes, coming right up.
- Thank you.

801
00:56:58,706 --> 00:56:59,958
Yes, flow.

802
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,417
Flow is important.

803
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,419
God, you startled me.

804
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,671
- Oh my God.
- What?

805
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,799
Our video's trending right now.

806
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,219
Look, first, second,

807
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,429
third!

808
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,891
- Silver Play Button, here we come.
- Go, go, go!

809
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:21,187
Let's take our new Gyeonjjang TV channel
to the top. Cheers!

810
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,605
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

811
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,401
Let me see.

812
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:27,610
This is a huge deal.

813
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,447
It means we're the third
most viewed video in real-time.

814
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,364
Look at this.

815
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,782
Then what is the trend?

816
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,119
We're the video that's trending.

817
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:37,829
Our video is…

818
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,998
Our video is trending.

819
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:41,291
Ever hit trending before?

820
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:43,209
- It's my first.
- Congrats!

821
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,919
REST IN PEACE

822
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,171
FOREVER IN OUR MEMORIES

823
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,731
IN MEMORY OF NURSE CHO EUN-YEONG

824
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:16,534
Gyeon-u.

825
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,414
What?

826
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,249
What's he glaring at?

827
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,215
He should seriously
think about what he did.

828
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:13,967
Don't come any closer.

829
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,721
I did my part.

830
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,068
What's wrong with him?

831
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,571
- Maybe she's here.
- Eun-yeong?

832
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,323
- We should say hello.
- Is she over there?

833
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,044
Good job, guys.

834
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,338
- You too, big brother.
- Good job.

835
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,506
Wanna eat? I'm hungry.

836
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,091
- Yes, what should we get?
- Yeah.

837
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,384
I'm going to choose.

838
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,302
Okay.

839
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:46,684
<i>Sundae-guk!</i>

840
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,353
I said I'm choosing.

841
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:49,646
<i>Jjolmyeon.</i>

842
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:53,274
- No, I want something warm.
- I'm fine with anything.

843
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,631
Hold tight!

844
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:24,722
You can't let go.

845
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,654
- Hello.
- Who are you talking to?

846
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,782
<i>- Did you go through something with her?</i>
<i>- She was my coworker.</i>

847
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,117
<i>Why did she pass away?</i>

848
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,536
We'll begin the routine knowledge test.

849
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:32,874
<i>This is exactly why people look down</i>
<i>on you for being a custodian, isn't it?</i>

850
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:36,377
Oh my God. If you fail the next test,
we can't work with you anymore.

851
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,088
<i>Yes, the scariest kind. Learned sickos.</i>

852
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,298
What are you planning?

853
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:43,509
It's a clear abuse of power.
You must refuse to take these tests.

854
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:44,677
What do we have to do?

855
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,179
Call off and cease!

856
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,889
Cease and apologize!

857
01:02:47,972 --> 01:02:49,140
<i>Disperse!</i>
