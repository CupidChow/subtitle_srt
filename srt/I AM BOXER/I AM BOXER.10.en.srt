[Seungheon] Though he
narrowly missed the finals,

00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,759
he's a fighter who's inspired many others.

354
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:29,628
I'm curious to see
what kind of fight he puts on tonight.

355
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,196
That was Kwon Ohgon.

356
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,299
All right.

357
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,169
You stood up earlier,
and it put pressure on him.

[chuckles]

359
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,007

I've looked up to Kim Minuk
since high school.

He's always been someone I admired.
A role model of mine.

A lot of time has passed, sir.

Tonight, I'll demonstrate exactly why

393
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,206
an East Asian Champion
is a step above a Korean Champion.

412
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,130
But I hope he gives it everything.

413
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,866
<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>he won't be able to keep up with me.</i>

414
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:58,270

<i>So I thought, "Don't force it.</i>
<i>Just slowly close the distance."</i>

Use the lead hand!

[Minseok] You've gotta work the jab!

00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,274
[Jongkook] He's not holding back.

439
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,777
Since there aren't many rounds,
Kwon Ohgon's just going for it.

440
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,278
Yes, it's only three rounds.

[Gyuwon] Kim Minuk has started
to get a read on Kwon Ohgon's rhythm.

-Kwon pressed forward at times.

But as for Kim Minuk,
he spent the round calmly,

00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,445
easing his way into the fight.

476
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:56,315
Round 1 was about
getting a read on each other's rhythm.

477
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,949
Plus, there was some tactical probing.

-Yep.

479

[team member] Relax a bit.
There's too much tension on every shot.

480
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,492
One of the body shots landed,
so now he'll start guarding the body.

481
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,428
When you throw your right combos,

482
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,829
you lift your chin sometimes.

483
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,531
Watch out for the uppercut there.

484
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,868
[Minuk] <i>I plan to close the distance</i>
<i>and press harder moving forward.</i>

00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,947
[Gyuwon] We're seeing
a test of durability here.

504
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,982
Neither fighter is retreating at all!

505
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,384
-That's it!
-There you go!

506
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,285
Once again, excellent left jab.

507
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:08,687
[spectator] Okay, just go for it!

508
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,955
[Minseok] All right!

509
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,791
[Jongkook] Man, he got caught there.

510
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,829
[Seungheon] That was
a clean land from Kim Minuk!

511
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,299
Kim is piling up the clean shots.

512
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:22,667
[in English] All right, I rate that.

[Seungheon] Fire with him on the exit!

516
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,043
Kim goes in for another uppercut.

517
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,247
He went for a big one there.

518
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,285
Kwon lets it glance off
and slips away cleanly.

519
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,587
See that slip while turning his head?

520
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,791
[Ohgon] <i>My gas tank was still full,</i>

521
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,726

Here comes sharp combo!

532
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,582
Left, then right uppercut!

Hey, the momentum's shifting.

538
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:26,298
[Seungheon] Kwon throws a counter
to the side. He's pressing forward again.

539
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,233

That was tonight's first slip and rip!

551
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,165
[Seungheon] They're trading!
And there's that left jab from Kim!

-Man, I just stood there and took it.

00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,292
-Hey!
-[audience gasps]

840
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,095
-[Seungheon] And he strikes as he turns!
-[audience gasps]

841
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,530
[person 1] That's gotta hurt so bad.

842
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:28,466
[person 2] You got this, Sungmin!

843
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:33,037
[Gyuwon] Hong Sungmin
hasn't found a clear angle of attack yet.

844
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,540
He needs to get inside.

845
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:38,976
[person 1] Let's go, Hyunman!

846
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,111
[person 2] Let's go!

847
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:42,780
[Seungheon] Hong Sungmin steps inside.

848
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:44,115
[person 3] Stay calm!

849
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,151
[referee] That's not good.

850
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,787
-[person 4] Wow.
-[audience gasps]

851
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,523
Stop! Stop!

852
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,059
-[referee] No holding.
-[person 1] You got this!

853
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,427
[person 2] Stay calm, Sungmin!

854
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,296
-[referee] Box!
-[person 3] You got this!

855
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,765
[♪ intense music playing]

856
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,836
[Seungheon] Hong Sungmin continues
to press forward on the inside.

857
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,642
Stop! Stop! Stop!

858
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:17,114
It looks like he's clinching on purpose.

859
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,150
Yeah, that's what it seems like.

860
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,351
[referee] Two or three together!

861
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,586
[Seungheon] Hong keeps his guard high
and stays on Myung.

862
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:23,854
And he closes in.

863
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:24,955
[audience gasps] All right!

864
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,023
Ah…

865
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:28,826
-[referee] Stop!
-[audience gasps]

866
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:32,396
[Gyuwon] Myung Hyunman is clinching
whenever his opponent comes in.

867
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,700
[Sungmin] <i>It was pretty frustrating.</i>

868
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,403
[person 1] Come on, Hyunman!

869
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,112
[Dex] Well, another clinch.

870
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,147
-[bell rings]
-[person 2] All right.

871
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,816
[audience applauding]

872
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,223
[Dex]
He's a lot more cautious than I expected.

873
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,658
-You can tell.
-[Lee] Yeah.

874
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,327
He's not just flat-out brawling.

875
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,529
-He respects the skill level.
-[Jongkook] Right, right.

876
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:09,300
When you step out and he comes back in,

877
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,635
-I told you to read his moves.
-Right.

878
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,637
[Chongpal]
Does he throw a jab or straight first?

879
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:14,972
You strike when he does.

880
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,208
[Hyunman]
<i>I need to put my stamp on this fight.</i>

881
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,710
If you wrestle him,
you'll gas yourself out.

882
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,245
Just pivot out and punch.

883
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,581
He keeps grabbing me,
putting his arm around.

884
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:24,648
But I'll try.

885
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,985
[Sungmin] <i>The plan was to slip as much</i>
<i>as I can and just let my hands go.</i>

886
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:33,290
[Seungheon] Myung Hyunman has made
his game plan clear early on.

887
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,358
[whistle blows]

888
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:37,595
[Seungheon] We'll see
how Hong Sungmin responds to that

889
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,797
going into the second round.

890
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,031
[bell rings]

891
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,099
[referee] Box!

892
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:46,337
MYUNG HYUNMAN X HONG SUNGMIN

893
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:49,573
[person] Myung Hyunman, let's go!

894
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,878
[referee] No clinching.

895
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,780
[Lee] He's got that head locked in tight.

896
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,116
If you keep getting clinched up like that,

897
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,718
your stamina drains fast.

898
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,554
[Jongkook] Hey.

899
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,858
[Hyunman] <i>The idea is to sap his energy</i>
<i>in the clinch,</i>

900
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,493
<i>then start dealing damage.</i>

901
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,664
-Stop!
-[person 1] Man, he's strong.

902
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:18,168
[person 2] When someone much bigger
presses you down, your hands are tied.

903
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:19,570
[person 3] He's being forced to squat.

904
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,306
[sighs]

905
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,874
[Dex] Sungmin needs to step it up now.

906
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:27,144
-[person 1] Let's go, Sungmin!
-[audience gasps]

907
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,617
[person 2] Don't go in straight!
Wait for it, then strike!

908
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:34,985
[Seungheon] Another clinch.

909
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,487
[Jihyun] Sungmin, get out of it!

910
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,893
[Seungheon] Even in a clinch,
Hong is trying to work his own shots.

911
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,763
[Sungmin]
<i>I figured I'd just take the fight inside.</i>

912
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:50,000
-[Seungheon] And he's pushed off.
-[Lee] That's it.

913
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,337
[Seungheon]
Hong Sungmin gets right to work.

914
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,739
Once again,
Myung Hyunman goes for the clinch.

915
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,279
-[Dex] Oh.
-[audience gasps]

916
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,481
-[person 1] All right!

917
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,483
[Jihyun] Hey, get out of there! Yes!

918
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,619
-[person 2] Wow.
-[audience gasps]

919
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:10,955
[Sungmin] <i>When he tried to clinch,</i>
<i>I lowered my level and slipped.</i>

920
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:14,491
[Seungheon] Hong Sungmin is coming at him
with those combos!

921
00:43:21,365 --> 00:43:22,733
[Jongkook] Look at him using his knees.

922
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,470
-[person 3] Let's go, Hyunman!
-[person 4] You got this!

923
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,872
[person 5] Sungmin, work the combos!
Throw two at a time!

924
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,108
That's it! Two!

925
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:32,309
[gasping]

926
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,150
[Seungheon] Ah! Look at Hong Sungmin go!

927
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:45,789
[Gyuwon] Hong Sungmin is showing
Tyson-like combinations here.

928
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,359
[Lee] Sungmin's too fast for him.

929
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:50,628
[person] Hey!

930
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:51,895
[Seungheon] And an overhand.

931
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:55,599
-[bell rings]
-[referee] Stop!

932
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,768
[Seungheon]
And that brings the round to a close.

933
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,036
[audience cheering, applauding]

934
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,604
[Lee] So he really is Tyson.

935
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:05,909
[Jihyun] Breathe.

936
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,812
[Sungmin]
<i>From here on out, I'll just keep pressing.</i>

937
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,081
[♪ tense music playing]

938
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,885
[Hyunman]
<i>My strategy didn't seem to be working.</i>

939
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,355
If Hyunman doesn't do more,
it's not going to cut it.

940
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:22,292
[Hyunman]
<i>If I miss my chance here, I lose.</i>

941
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,229
<i>So I'll do everything I can in my power</i>

942
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:26,530
<i>to dominate the last round.</i>

943
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,500
What now? No game plan.

944
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:31,301
Just do your thing.

945
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,605
Do it your way this round.

946
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,441
[people] Let's go!

947
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,044
[Seungheon]
The final third round is coming up.

948
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:45,115
Hong Sungmin landed more effective punches
in that last round.

949
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:47,885
Now the question is
whether Myung Hyunman's strategy

950
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,553
will land in the last round.

951
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,589

-[referee] Round 3. All right, box!

00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,330
[Lee] Extend your arm!

955
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:03,167
[Hyunman] <i>Now it's really do or die.</i>

956
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,702
<i>I'm gonna go on instinct.</i>

959

[Lee] That's it. Hyunman's coming in.

960
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,514
He's throwing the big shots now.

961
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,018
[Seungheon] What a great right jab!

962
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,222
[audience gasps]

963
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,957
[Gyuwon]
There's serious weight behind that shot.

964
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:29,493
Sungmin can't get careless here.

965
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,829
One clean shot of that could end it.

00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,633
welterweight gold medalist!

1169
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:19,135
A member of the KAFAC,

1170
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,306
<i>I Am Boxer's</i> top technician!

1171
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:25,708
A boxing machine, cool under pressure!

1172
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:28,144
And the crown prince of the ring!

1173
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:32,449
Please give it up for Prince!

1174
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:36,219
-Lee Chaehyun!
-[audience cheering, applauding]

1175
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,320
Salute!

1176
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:42,725
[Gyuwon] Lee Chaehyun never loses
his balance, no matter the moment.

1177
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,862
He is a fighter
with unshakable conviction!

1178
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:50,633
[Dex] Let's hear from the fighters
before the bout.

1179
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:55,438
Out of 90 fighters, only two remain.

1180
00:57:56,139 --> 00:58:00,276
I'll show you exactly
why I deserve to be in the finals

1181
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:04,047
right here in this ring.

1182
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:07,517
[person] Let's go!

1183
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:11,120
Let me just say one thing to Lee Chaehyun.

1184
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:15,525
Your punches looked a little light.

1185
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,027
[audience gasps]

1186
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:19,662
[person] Ouch!

1187
00:58:19,729 --> 00:58:21,664
That must've struck a nerve.

1188
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:24,934
You're not putting me down with that.

1189
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:28,771
I'll win by KO and take the belt.

1190
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,406
[audience gasps]

1191
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:35,712
You said my punching power's weak?

1192
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:39,916
-Every time you blink, I land one.
-[chuckles]

1193
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,885
[audience laughing]

1194
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,921
So keep your eyes wide open.

1195
00:58:44,988 --> 00:58:46,055
[exclaiming]

1196
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:49,092
-Burn!
-That is bold!

1197
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:53,229
I'm going to light this arena up tonight.

1198
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:56,432
So watch me go all in till the end!

1199
00:58:56,499 --> 00:58:57,800
[audience cheering, applauding]

1200
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:06,175
I believe this fantastic matchup

1201
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:08,378
will do the <i>I Am Boxer</i> finals justice.

1202
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:10,246
This is it

1203
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,916
for both fighters.

1204
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:17,520
Leave everything you've got in the ring.

1205
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,556
-[person 1] Let's go!
-[person 2] Let's go, Chaehyun!

1206
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:21,791
[person 3] Let's go, Seungjun!

1207
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,127
[Lee, Jongkook] Good luck, you two.

1208
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:26,763
[person 1] You got this, Seungjun!

1209
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:27,964
[person 2] Let's go, Chaehyun!

1210
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:29,532
They look so young.

1211
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,767
They must be really good.

1212
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:35,672
Fight like everyone here is on your side,

1213
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,206
because they are, okay?

1214

SHIN JONGHUN
2014 ASIAN GAMES GOLD MEDALIST

1215
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:42,745
Chaehyun,
keep it chill in the first round.

1216
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:44,881
Remember, tap-tap, pick your shots.

1217
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:46,449
Slip it and go, got it?

1218
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:51,354
Since it's the finals,
let's fight with no regrets, you two.

1219
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,956
-Yes, sir.
-All right, glove touch.

1220
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,023
Back to your corners.

1221
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:01,631
Sixty years ago,
Korea's first world champion,

1222
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:05,969
Kim Kisoo, was crowned right here.

1223
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:09,839
A new champion will be crowned here today!

1224
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:12,342
-Let's hear it for both of them.
-[audience chanting]

1225
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:15,144
-Lee Chaehyun! Lee Chaehyun!
-Kuk Seungjun! Kuk Seungjun!

1226
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:20,183
[Seungheon] Which of these two fighters
will become the last survivor standing?

1227
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:24,087
-Box!
-[bell rings]

1228
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,188
LEE CHAEHYUN X KUK SEUNGJUN

1229
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:27,256
[Seungheon] The first round
of this 10-rounder's underway!

1230
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,659
Kuk Seungjun and Lee Chaehyun
collide in the center!

1231
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:33,229
[gasps]

1232
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,831
Oh. He's coming out with an early rush.

1233
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,036
[Gyuwon]
Ah, Kuk Seungjun is coming in wild!

1234
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,307
[Seungheon] Kuk Seungjun
opens with the body, his specialty.

1235
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,343
[Seungjun] <i>I knew Lee Chaehyun well.</i>

1236
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:51,314
<i>So I knew he'd try</i>
<i>to read the situation first.</i>

1237
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:54,183
<i>That's why I decided to apply pressure</i>
<i>and step right in.</i>

1238
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,487
[Seungheon] Nice body shot!
And in with the combos!

1239
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,188
-That's it!
-Oh!

1240
01:01:04,427 --> 01:01:06,029
-[coach] Chaehyun, stay calm!
-[referee] Stop!

1241
01:01:06,095 --> 01:01:08,698
[Jongkook] He's good.
No need to match his pace.

1242
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:09,766
Box!

1243
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:16,005
[Seungheon] It's a blistering first round
between Kuk Seungjun and Lee Chaehyun.

1244
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:18,641
[audience gasps]

1245

01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:22,445
-It's fine!
-Slip!

1247
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,980
Chaehyun, breathe!

1248
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,481
[referee] No pushing.

1249
01:01:25,548 --> 01:01:26,983
Chaehyun, stay calm!

1250
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,285
[referee] Box!

1251
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:36,826
[Chaehyun]
<i>Seungjun was coming in really wild.</i>

1252
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:39,696
[person] Nice going!

1253
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:44,400
[Chaehyun] <i>So I figured I'd hold my ground</i>
<i>and counter him instead.</i>

[audience gasps]

1255
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:49,405
Hey!

1256
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:50,907
He fired right back immediately.

1257
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,944
[Gyuwon]
Kuk Seungjun is coming in wide and low.

1258
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:58,915
And Lee Chaehyun is staying
on the defensive, looking to counter.

1259
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:00,616
[Jonghun] It's just the first round!

1260
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,118
Keep your lead hand forward!

1261
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:04,220
[person 1] Throw with him!

1262
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,555
[person 2] All right!

1263
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,292
[♪ exciting music playing]

[audience exclaiming]

1265
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,331
He's pressing hard.

1266
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:16,866
-[person] Pushing for an early finish.
-Yeah.

1267
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,438
[Gyuwon] It's a fierce battle
of tactics and physicality.

1268
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:26,008
Both fighters are engaging in
an energy-draining close-range fight.

1269
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,945
[Seungheon] This is unlike anything
we've seen from them before.

1270
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,881
Both fighters are coming out hot
from the opening bell!

1271
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,486
[Dex] Oh, that body shot landed clean! Oh.

1272
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,955
-They keep this up, 10 round's a stretch.
-Right?

1273
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:41,424
[coach] Chaehyun, he's coming in!
He's coming in!

1274
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,593
[person 1] Fire from where you are!
That's it!

1275
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:48,164
[audience gasps]

1276
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:52,635
[Seungheon] There's that body shot!
Kuk pushes him back against the ropes!

1277
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:53,870
And he comes in!

1278
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,640
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

1279
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:06,682
-You have to go now!
-[bell rings]

1280
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,117
Stop!

1281
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:10,853
[Seungheon]
That brings the first round to a close.

1282
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,655
Hey, deep breaths.

1283
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:15,892
[Gyuwon] Wow.
What a nail-biter of a first round.

1284
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:19,395
You can feel their hunger for that belt!

1285
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,864
-Let's go, Chaehyun!
-Let's go, Chaehyun!

1286
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,200
Man, they're going wild in there.

1287
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,469
Chaehyun's probably a little rattled.

1288
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,771
He probably didn't expect Seungjun
to come out so strong.

1289
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,541
Because they've fought before.

1290
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,276
-They know each other's styles.
-Right.

1291
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:35,645
He probably didn't think
he'd come out this aggressively.

1292
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,013
[Jongkook] That's what it feels like.

1293
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,481
You're doing so well.

1294
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,683
But let's just stay a bit calmer.

1295
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,785
This is just the first round, okay?

1296
01:03:43,352 --> 01:03:44,520
Feeling-out's done, yeah?

1297
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:48,591
[Seungjun] <i>I think I gained confidence</i>
<i>by winning the early momentum battle.</i>

1298
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,527
<i>I used a lot of unconventional punches.</i>

1299
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:54,363
<i>Lee Chaehyun looked really shaken by that.</i>

1300
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:57,266
<i>So I thought, "My strategy's working."</i>

1301
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,901
<i>"Let's keep it going like this."</i>

1302
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:01,971
[coach] No need to rush.

1303
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:04,607
Don't hesitate like this.
If he comes in, just throw.

1304
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,676
Tap-tap-tap! Just like that, okay?

1305
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:08,311
Stick to this rhythm, okay?

1306
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:09,979
Don't get dragged into
Seungjun's rhythm, okay?

1307
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,047
-Yes.
-[whistle blows]

01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:15,751
<i>Seungjun's wild attacks</i>
<i>and physical battles.</i>

1310
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:17,153
<i>"Just do what I need to do."</i>

01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,622

1317

[Seungheon] The second round's begun.

LEE CHAEHYUN X KUK SEUNGJUN

1319
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,410
[Seungheon] Lee Chaehyun jabs,
not missing that open guard.

1320
01:04:41,477 --> 01:04:42,478
Oh, boy.

1321
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:47,383
[Seungheon] Kuk's really moving
his upper body. And he lands one upstairs!

1322
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:48,784
-Oh!
-Oh!

1323
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:51,554
You get caught by those shots
you don't see coming.

[audience gasping]

1325
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:58,861
[Gyuwon] Kuk Seungjun is definitely
making use of his reach advantage

1326
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:01,264
to dominate the opponent,

1327
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:04,467
making him even more dangerous
and harder to find the range on.

1328
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:05,835
[Jongkook] Nice double combo.

1329
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,237
Seungjun's not giving him
any distance at all.

1330
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:10,439
[Chaehyun] <i>Distance-wise,</i>

1331
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:13,309
<i>it was hard to find my range.</i>

-[spectator 1] Go lower!
-[spectator 2] Lower your aim!

1333
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,117
[Chaehyun] <i>He kept his arms fully extended</i>
<i>to maintain as much distance as possible.</i>

1334
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,485
[spectator] Don't fall back!

1335
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,156
<i>So I timed the body when he came in.</i>

1336
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:29,892
[Seungheon] Lee Chaehyun strikes the body
and quickly gets out.

1337
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:31,260
[spectator] Just keep going!

1338
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:36,599
Hey, that body shot connected!

1339
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,501
-That's it!
-There you go!

1340
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:41,003
[coach] Just fight your fight, Chaehyun!

1341
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:43,272
[Gyuwon] Lee Chaehyun's jab
isn't just a jab.

1342
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:45,741
It sets up his counter,

1343
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:47,677
which is his most dangerous weapon.

1344
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:49,979
[spectator] That's it!

1345
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,347
[exclaiming]

1346
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:52,682
Work the body!

1347
01:05:54,884 --> 01:05:56,719
[Seungheon] Kuk comes in
with upper-body movement.

1348
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:07,563
And right on cue,

1349
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,699
Lee plants a counter with a sharp left.

1350
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:11,467
[Lee] See that?
He waits for it, then throws.

1351
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:13,302
That means
Seungjun shouldn't swing too big.

1352
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:16,138
-Slow down.
-[Seungjun's father] Take your time, son!

1353
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:18,774
[coach] This is it! Work the body!

1354
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:22,678
[Seungheon] Lee Chaehyun seems to
have gotten a read

1355
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:26,315
on Kuk Seungjun's entry timing this round.

1356
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,019
[spectator] That's it!

1357
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:34,123
Man, that's great.

1358
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:35,825
That counter was really good.

1359
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:39,095
[spectator] All right!

1360
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,264
-Break! Break!
-[bell dings]

1361
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,699
-Stop!
-Okay.

1362
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,603
[Gyuwon] Since the opening round,

1363
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,640
Kuk Seungjun has been trying to dominate

1364
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:54,176
with his wild infighting style.

1365
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:56,178
But Lee Chaehyun is extremely composed.

1366
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:57,980
He's not letting that happen.

1367
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:00,149
You're doing well, Chaehyun.

1368
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,151
Bam, bam. They're all landing.

1369
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:05,087
Don't look too high.
Look toward the chest and drive it in.

1370
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:06,589
Chaehyun is staying calm,

1371
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:08,491
picking his shots here and there.

1372
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:11,660
The thing is,
Seungjun's short punches aren't landing.

1373
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:14,563
They keep sailing past Chaehyun's head.

1374
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:18,501
Shorten your punches just a bit.
The big ones aren't landing.

1375
01:07:18,567 --> 01:07:20,770
He's watching you, and he's not tired yet.

1376
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:21,904
So nothing's landing.

1377
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:24,407
That's why you gotta keep it short, okay?

Keep it short!

1383
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:44,060
[Seungheon] Kuk lands on the body,
and Lee pushes forward.

1384
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,197
Kuk stays on him, targeting the body.

1385
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:49,265
[spectator] All right!

1386
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:53,135
[Gyuwon] This is an intense battle
of rhythm and tactics.

1387
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:57,706
[Seungheon] Look at Chaehyun running.

1388
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,609
[spectator 1] That's it! Go for it!

1389
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:01,710
[spectator 2] There you go!

1390
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:07,316
[Seungheon] Kuk comes in,
goes to the body, then exits.

1391
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:12,521
Lee is inviting Kuk to come closer.

1392
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,791
And Kuk Seungjun responds
without backing away.

1393
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:17,927
They're locked in close.

1394
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,930
[referee] Okay, break, break, break!

1395
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:23,999
We're seeing
a lot of passionate exchanges here.

1396
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,336
Save your energy! Save it!

1397
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:32,708
Chaehyun probably planned
to pace himself for a typical 10-rounder.

1398
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:38,781
But Seungjun keeps pressing,
so he has to match his pace.

1399
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:40,816
He's coming, Chaehyun! He's coming in!

1400
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:50,593
[Seungheon] Lee charges in,
looking to make a statement.

1401
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:52,461
And that's it!

That's timing at its finest!

1405
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,073
That's it! There you go!

-Stop!

1407

Everything was good,

It's okay. Deep breaths.

1417

Just keep going.

[Seungjun] <i>This won't do.</i>

1419
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,508
Remember? He always jabs and slips out.

1420
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,377
That's when you need to drive it in.

1421
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:42,845
Stick to what we practiced.

[Seungheon] They're in a clinch.

1496
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:22,931
[Lee] Hey…

1497
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:24,400
Careful.

1498
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,835
He keeps ramming his head in.

1499
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:29,872
-Heads are getting dangerously close.
-Right.

1500
01:13:29,938 --> 01:13:32,007
That's not Chaehyun's normal style.

1501
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,281
[Gyuwon] Kuk was setting up
this body shot!

1502
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:41,683
[Dex] Nice body shot!

1503
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,218
[Jongkook] He's starting
to work the body now.

1504
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:45,721
[Lee] All right, careful now.

1505
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:51,593
Huh?

1506
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:52,928
Wait, hold on!

1507
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:55,164
Hold on!

1508
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,231
[exclaims]

1509
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:00,869
Okay, stop, stop!

1510
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:02,404
[Jongkook] Is there a cut? A loose tooth?

1511
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,072
Is there a cut?

1512
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:05,774
[Seungheon] There's a bit of a cut.

1513
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:06,842
[referee] Time.

1514
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:08,477
[Seungheon] This could change the game.

1515
01:14:09,411 --> 01:14:10,979
Boy, they headbutted.

1516
01:14:13,048 --> 01:14:15,384
That looks so painful. Oh, dear.

1517
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,152
[coach] Ugh, damn it.

1518
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:21,123
[Seungheon]
The doctor's examining the cut.

1519
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,358
[Gyuwon] I hope it's not a serious injury.

1520
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,662
We need to see how deep that cut is.

1521
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,430
Their heads were just too close.

1522
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,699
They kept ramming
their heads in like this.

1523
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,167
[spectator] Stay strong, Chaehyun!

1524
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:34,636
[Gyuwon] They've been fighting so roughly.

1525
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:38,841
This kind of injury was bound to happen.

1526
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:41,276
-I think the bleeding's stopping.
-Ah!

1527
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:46,148
<i>I took a shot, then as Seungjun rushed in,</i>

1528
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:49,885
<i>I tried to answer back the same way.</i>

1529
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,654
<i>I got heated,</i>
<i>and that's when the headbutt happened.</i>

1530
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:57,059
<i>And when I got cut, I felt it immediately.</i>

1531
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,328
I was shocked.

1532
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:05,901
<i>It didn't sit well with me.</i>

1533
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:10,472
Seungjun had a cut recently too.

1534
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:13,642
It breaks every mother's heart.

1535
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,445
-Chaehyun's mom must be heartbroken.
-Right.

1536
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,548
The bleeding seems to have stopped.

1537
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:21,984
-How are you feeling, Chaehyun?
-I can go on.

1538
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,452
You think so? All right.

1539
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,889
[Chaehyun] <i>Cut or not,</i>
<i>I just hoped they don't stop the fight.</i>

1540
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:29,191
[applause, cheering]

1541
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:32,361
[Lee] He seems okay for now,

1542
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:35,130
but we need to see if that cut opens up.

1543
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:40,135
-Lee Chaehyun! Lee Chaehyun!
-Lee Chaehyun! Lee Chaehyun!

1544
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:43,071
Can the fight continue
even if there's a bleeding?

1545
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:45,574
[Jongkook] Yes, but if it's too much,
it gets stopped.

1546
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,243
[Seungheon] Looks like we're resuming.

1547
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:53,181
[Gyuwon] Lee Chaehyun has
incredible grit and will.

1548
01:15:58,086 --> 01:15:59,087
Box!

1549
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:00,789
[Seungheon] The fight resumes.

1550
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:02,758
Lee Chaehyun proceeds carefully.

1551
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:07,863
If the cut worsens,
the fight could be stopped.

1552
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:09,731
[Lee] Yes, that's it.

1553
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:11,733
You've gotta rip, then get out.

1554
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:18,740
Careful now. Let's keep going.

1555
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,348
LEE CHAEHYUN X KUK SEUNGJUN

1556
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:31,453
[Seungheon] As Kuk steps in,
Lee lands a big shot to the face!

1557
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,691
[audience exclaims]

1558
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:40,796
-[bell dings]
-Stop!

1559
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:44,800
And just like that!
The fifth round has ended.

1560
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:48,770
[Gyuwon] This could be a major factor

1561
01:16:48,837 --> 01:16:51,106
that might shift the entire flow.

1562
01:16:57,212 --> 01:16:58,213
You okay?

1563
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:02,050
[Seungheon] The cut is in a tricky spot,

1564
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:05,053
so there's a good chance
it could interfere with his vision.

1565
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:08,190
[panting]

1566
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,266
BOXING SCORE CARD
LEE: 48, KUK: 47

1567
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:21,837
-Lee Chaehyun! Lee Chaehyun!
-Lee Chaehyun! Lee Chaehyun!

1568
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:26,775
-Lee Chaehyun! Lee Chaehyun!
-Lee Chaehyun! Lee Chaehyun!

1569
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:29,177
-Lee Chaehyun! Lee Chaehyun!
-Lee Chaehyun! Lee Chaehyun!

1570
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:30,746
Breathe. It's fine.

1571
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,382
Don't let it get to you.

1572
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:37,986
[Seungjun] <i>I thought it was admirable</i>

1573
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:39,154
that he decided to go on.

1574
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:42,791
<i>I respected him for that.</i>

1575
01:17:42,858 --> 01:17:44,459
<i>From a sportsmanship standpoint,</i>

1576
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:49,264
<i>I felt it was only right</i>
<i>to meet him head-on.</i>

1577
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,733
Protect your head.
You can't afford to bleed now.

1578
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:54,069
[Chaehyun] <i>Just because I'm cut</i>

1579
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:57,172
<i>doesn't mean Seungjun's going</i>
<i>to go easy on me.</i>

1580
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,675
<i>I had to win the next rounds,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

1581
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:01,710
<i>So I kept praying it wouldn't be stopped.</i>

1582
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:03,578
-[bell dings]
-All right, box!

1583
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:06,748
[Seungheon] And now, it's the sixth round.

1584
01:18:06,815 --> 01:18:09,851
LEE CHAEHYUN X KUK SEUNGJUN

1585
01:18:09,918 --> 01:18:11,420
[cheering]

1586
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:14,356
Beautiful combinations from both fighters!

1587
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:16,491
[♪ intense music playing]

1588
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:18,660
Let's go, Chaehyun!

1589
01:18:21,663 --> 01:18:24,032
[coach] Chaehyun, protect your head!

1590
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,137
Man, this is tough.

1591
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:39,848
[Seungheon] It's the left hand this time!

1592
01:18:39,915 --> 01:18:41,083
Lee Chaehyun steps in!

1593
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:42,451
And keeps charging forward!

1594
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:44,486
[Jongkook] This is tough.

1595
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,121
When you come in wild like that,

1596
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:47,923
-you have to answer him.
-Right.

1597
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:49,191
Break it up!

1598
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:52,627
[Seungheon] There's still
a bit of bleeding there.

1599
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:55,831
[coach] Stay sharp!

1600
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,101
[Seungheon] He can't help
but be conscious of his left eye.

1601
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,805
[Lee] With the blood,
his vision looks a bit compromised.

1602
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:09,578
[Chaehyun] <i>Because of the cut,</i>
<i>I was bleeding quite a bit.</i>

1603
01:19:10,078 --> 01:19:11,813
<i>And it kept getting in my left eye.</i>

1604
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:16,551
Oh, no.

1605
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:20,188
[Seungheon]
With the blood impairing his left eye,

1606
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,257
the distance game gets tricky.

1607
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:30,065
[Chaehyun] <i>My mind was racing.</i>

1608
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:31,433
<i>I needed to win,</i>

1609
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:35,403
<i>but the cut was impossible to ignore</i>
<i>with all the bleeding.</i>

1610
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:38,440
<i>I was completely overwhelmed.</i>

1611
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:47,616
Okay, slip!

1612
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:52,821
<i>But even though the cut kept bleeding,</i>

1613
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:56,491
I really just wanted to win.

1614
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:58,627
Box!

1615
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:03,031
<i>So I told myself, "If I want to win,</i>
<i>I can't be worrying about this."</i>

1616
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:05,100
<i>"Just focus on what I need to do."</i>

1617
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:07,235
<i>So I charged forward with all I had.</i>

1618
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:10,505
[Gyuwon] This has got to be
taking a toll on him mentally,

1619
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:13,875
but Lee Chaehyun isn't showing it one bit.

1620
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,710
Hang in there, Chaehyun!

1621
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,985
[exclaiming]

1622
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:25,220
Hey!

1623
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:27,622
[Seungheon] They're trading now!

1624
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:31,026
Kuk is coming forward
like there's nothing to think about.

1625
01:20:35,096 --> 01:20:36,264
-[bell dings]
-Stop!

1626
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:39,167
And with that,
the sixth round comes to an end.

1627
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:41,236
[audience cheering, applauding]

1628
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,708
[Gyuwon] What these two fighters
are demonstrating

1629
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:49,578
isn't just the art of boxing.

1630
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:52,113
It's the art of sheer willpower.

1631
01:20:53,715 --> 01:20:57,152
-Chaehyun. Get me some ice!
-It's now Round 7,

1632
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:58,920
so recovery is absolutely crucial.

1633
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:02,924
-Lee Chaehyun! Lee Chaehyun!
-Lee Chaehyun! Lee Chaehyun!

1634
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:04,292
Let's call over the doctor.

1635
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:08,063
The headbutt is the problem.

1636
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:10,498
[Dex] It looks pretty serious.

1637
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:12,400
[spectator 1] You got this, Chaehyun!

1638
01:21:15,237 --> 01:21:17,873
-We can't let this go on much longer.
-[spectator 2] Let's go, Chaehyun!

1639
01:21:19,808 --> 01:21:23,345
[Lee] This was originally scheduled
as a 10-round fight,

1640
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:27,682
but due to the significant cut
on Lee Chaehyun's eye,

1641
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:32,354
we'll go to the scorecards
after the seventh round.

1642
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:34,389
This round will be the last one.

1643
01:21:35,023 --> 01:21:37,893
[Chaehyun] <i>If I win this match,</i>
<i>I become the champion.</i>

1644
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,428
<i>So I'm going to give it my all.</i>

1645
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:43,231
Oh, Chaehyun…

1646
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,270
[Chaehyun]
<i>I really want to become champion.</i>

1647
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:52,874
[Seungjun] <i>This is the final round.</i>

1648
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:56,077
<i>I won't let this fight</i>
<i>leave me with any regrets.</i>

1649
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:02,817
Father, I'll bring back the win!

1650
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:05,353
Sounds good!

1651
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:07,489
[Seungjun] <i>I have to win.</i>

1652
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:08,823
<i>I have to win no matter what.</i>

1653
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:12,794
<i>I want to win</i>
<i>that champion belt for my parents.</i>

1654
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:17,399
[Seungheon] Who will become the winner
of the 300-million-won prize money?

1655
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:19,334
Who will walk away with the belt?

1656
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:30,812
[bell dings]

1657
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:31,880
LEE CHAEHYUN X KUK SEUNGJUN

1658
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,481
The final round has begun!

1659
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:34,549
Box!

1803

Honestly, we were once at a point
where we were talking about

<i>giving up on everything.</i>

1805

that kind of talk just disappeared.

Of course,
it's disappointing that I didn't win.

1813
01:33:02,143 --> 01:33:07,181
But I believe the biggest reason
I'm standing here today is

1814
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:11,018
because I stayed consistent
and kept working hard.

01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:23,491
[Seungjun] <i>Boxing was my salvation.</i>

1832
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:26,527
[Chaehyun] <i>Boxing means everything to me.</i>

1833
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:27,828
<i>It's my life.</i>

1834
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:30,598
[Hyeongbin] <i>It feels like</i>
<i>two lives colliding.</i>

1835
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:33,467
<i>That's the feeling I get with boxing.</i>

1836
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:38,673
Through boxing,
I learned patience and perseverance,

1837
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:41,042
<i>and I grew a lot as a person.</i>

1838
01:34:41,108 --> 01:34:43,611
<i>Boxing is like my lifelong companion.</i>

1839
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:48,416
In times when I felt lost,
boxing was what saved me.

1840
01:34:48,482 --> 01:34:50,918
To me, boxing is

1841
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:53,054
almost like a god.

1842
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:56,323
Boxing is my life.

1843
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:58,059
[in English] "No boxing, no life."

1844
01:34:58,125 --> 01:35:00,327
[in Korean] <i>That one phrase says it all.</i>

1845
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:04,031
I realized just how much I love boxing,

1846
01:35:05,566 --> 01:35:08,235
<i>and how much I enjoy it.</i>

1847
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:11,472
I realized how serious I am about boxing,

1848
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,841
and just how much I love it.

1849
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,344
I'm really glad I became a boxer.

1850
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:55,216
Well done. You can sit.

1851
01:35:56,217 --> 01:35:58,119
-That cage was way too small for you.
-[chuckles]

1852
01:36:20,241 --> 01:36:21,342
Good.

1853
01:36:21,408 --> 01:36:22,977
[laughing]

1854
01:36:41,996 --> 01:36:43,364
Last one! Last one!
