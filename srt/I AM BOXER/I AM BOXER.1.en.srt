Hi, I'm Don Lee,

and the Master of <i>I Am Boxer</i>.

7
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,993
For years, I've envisioned this stage.

8
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:56,866
For boxers brimming with incredible talent
but who never got their chance to shine.

9
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,735
[boxer 1]
I'll put my heart and soul into this.

10
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:02,071
[boxer 2]
Either I go down or my opponent does.

11
00:01:02,138 --> 00:01:03,973
[boxer 3]
It all comes down to who wants it more.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,211
I wanted to give them
the biggest stage of their lives.

This is where you must pour
your mind, body, and soul.

35
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,496
I've been thinking hard about
whether I should quit.

36

Hello, I'm Kuk Seungjun
from the Hwasun County boxing team.

44
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,712
I've been boxing for 13 years.

45
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:52,949
I was a gold medalist at the 100th

46

and 105th Korean National Sports Festival.

47
00:03:00,623 --> 00:03:04,460
Seeing those boxing trunks
with my name on them

48
00:03:04,527 --> 00:03:06,429
really got me pumped.

49
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:10,533
There's no turning back now.
I have to win this.

50
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,674
There's plenty competition.

Can I be honest here?

61
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:02,952
It's time to clean house.

62
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:06,389
Every group calls itself a federation,
and everyone claims they're a champion.

63
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:08,824
I've sparred with these
so-called pro boxers,

64
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:11,394
and a lot of them were
worse than MMA amateurs.

65
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:14,530
Wow, that belt looks killer.

66
00:04:27,777 --> 00:04:28,811
[Kwon] I really didn't like him.

67
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:30,880
Ever wear a belt
when you were still in the game?

68
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:32,548
Of course I did.

69
00:04:32,615 --> 00:04:34,917
-I have yet to wear one.
-This one looks nicer.

71
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,921
Ooh. Any familiar names?

72
00:04:40,423 --> 00:04:43,592
[Seol] Oh! We've got soldiers here too?

73
00:04:44,226 --> 00:04:46,162
-You guys from KAFAC?
-Yes, that's right.

74
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:47,663
So you guys are all boxers?

75
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,898
-Yes.
-Yes, that's right.

76
00:04:48,964 --> 00:04:50,299

-[soldiers laughing]

78

[Seol]
I thought they all looked pretty soft.

80
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,775
-Hey, look. A camera.
-Wait, is it rolling now?

81
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:04,013
Oh!

82
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,082
Isn't that Yoon Hyeongbin?

83
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:09,785
Wow, this place is massive. Wow.

84
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,321
And the guy next to him
used to be an MMA fighter.

85
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:13,522
[soldier 2] Wait, seriously?

86
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:16,292
[soldier 3] Well, we've got
some ROAD FC fighters too.

87
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,127
Hey, look at that.

Huh? What the hell?

91
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:27,503
Oh!

92
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,071
This is nuts, for real.

93
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:30,740

-Thank you.

-Go easy on us.
-Well, I'll do my best to win.

99
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:42,118
Could I get a handshake?

100
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:43,619
-Of course.
-Thank you.

101
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:45,087
Man…

102
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:48,657
He didn't even look human,
more like a walking fridge.

What are you doing here? I mean…

104
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:53,529
This isn't fair to the rest of us.

105
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:57,800
Hello, I've been in combat sports
for about 20 years now.

106
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:01,404
I've won championship titles
in seven different competitions.

107
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:06,175
I'm on the heavier side
of the heavyweight division.

108
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:10,212
I've got the kind of power
you don't usually see around here.

-Knee kick!

111
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:18,888
I want to prove
that I'm the best in this country.

112
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,123
I should've gotten life insurance.

Wow.

116
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:32,067
You'd never guess they're fighters
just by looking at their faces.

117
00:06:32,134 --> 00:06:33,836
Everyone is so good-looking.

118
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:36,906

Whoa.

121
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,210
He looks like a celebrity.

122
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:42,445
Wow.

123
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:44,046
Oh, it's Yuk Junseo.

I'm an artist

Currently, I do weight training, running,
and boxing, all in one day.

127

Confidence has never been an issue for me.

131
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:08,704
If anything, I've got an excess of it.

This is intense.

140
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,193
He's just squinting
because his eyesight is bad, right?

141

-Wow.
-Nice to meet you all.

-Even Master Dduk is here.
-Karate, right?

144
00:07:41,937 --> 00:07:43,439
Oh, they're Muay Thai fighters?

145
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,407
-What sport do you do?
-Kickboxing.

146
00:07:45,474 --> 00:07:47,576
I was a volleyball player.

147
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:48,844

He's got a crazy physique.

157
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:17,273
Seriously, man.

158
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,876
He's number one fighter among celebrities.

159
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:24,179
Julien Kang, the guy's built like a tank.

160

He's famous for his fighting background.

161

00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:55,411
I might as well go home now.

171
00:08:55,978 --> 00:08:58,547
-Game over.
-Game over.

172
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:00,482
Well, if it isn't
the Korean national champion.

173
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:02,585
Here comes another beast.

174
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,821
Oh, come on. This is downright unfair.

175
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,325
Is that Jung Dawoon?

176
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:10,926
[cheering, applause continues]

177
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:12,628
Time to go home. [laughs]

178
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:15,598
Hello there. Oh, hey! [chuckles]

179
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:19,969
I didn't expect
a fighter like him to show up.

180
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:23,339
He's from
the world's top MMA organization.

181
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:26,809
That instantly raises the bar
for this show.

182
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,847
I'm a middleweight
who's fought on the world stage.

183
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:36,518
When you step into my ring,
you'd better be ready to give it your all.

184
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:38,487
[applause continues]

185
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:43,225
-He started out as a boxer, though.
-That's why he's good at close combat.

186
00:09:43,892 --> 00:09:46,328
Jung Dawoon without a weight cut
sounds like a nightmare.

187
00:09:46,395 --> 00:09:48,731
Should've just stuck to selling
soy-marinated crabs.

188
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,232
-[contestant laughing]
-Fucking hell.

189
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,301
-[applause continues]
-Oh!

190
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:54,103
[contestants exclaiming]

191
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:55,871
We have two champions?

192
00:09:56,538 --> 00:09:58,540
Are they boxing champions?

193
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:00,643
That's Kim Taesun.

194
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,845
-Super featherweight.
-Oh, super featherweight?

195
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:04,913
Wait, isn't he real famous?

196
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,149
Yes, that's Minuk. He's formidable.

197
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:09,551
Snyper Kim. He's the world-ranked.

198
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:11,020
He's the real deal in boxing.

199
00:10:11,887 --> 00:10:14,456
Hello, I'm Kim Minuk,

200
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:17,726
a former national team athlete
and OPBF champion.

201
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:21,430
Most pro and amateur boxers
have probably heard of me.

202
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:25,367
I'll show you what Kim Minuk is made of.
Just wait and see.

203
00:10:26,435 --> 00:10:28,671
There are already so many big names here.

204
00:10:28,737 --> 00:10:30,839
This is amazing. Everyone here is no joke.

205
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,010
We have top-level fighters
from all over the country.

206
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:37,446
This won't be easy at all.

207
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:41,483
See? The main contenders are already set.

208
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:43,452
-The latecomers?
-Yeah.

209
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,188
Wait a sec.

210
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:48,757
Wait, "Kim Donghoe"?
Looks like everyone's here.

211
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,893
-Kim Donghoe's coming.
-Wow.

212
00:10:52,628 --> 00:10:53,896
Hear that? "Kim Donghoe."

213
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:56,532
-He's won 13 straight national titles.
-Yeah, I know.

214
00:10:56,598 --> 00:10:58,033
-He's coming?
-Yeah.

215
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,538
Wow.

216
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:04,606
I got chills just now.

217
00:11:04,673 --> 00:11:06,341
I think we're fucked.

218
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:08,277
[contestants exclaiming, applauding]

219
00:11:08,343 --> 00:11:10,846
Wow.

220
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:13,215
Kim Donghoe and Kim Taekmin? For real?

221
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:15,517
-Hello there.
-Hello.

222
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:16,585
Oh, man.

223
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:20,189
There's our legend. The Ghost.

224
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:23,225
No one in this room can match him.

225
00:11:24,026 --> 00:11:25,127
There's our champion.

226
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,397
-The current top two in boxing, right?
-Yeah.

227
00:11:28,864 --> 00:11:29,898
Is that you, Sungmin?

228
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,667
Why are you both here? [laughs]

229
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,435
Just one of you would've been plenty.

230
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:36,371
-This is wild.
-Kim Taekmin is a bit much, man.

231
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:40,242
I've been keeping an eye on Kim Taekmin
for a while now.

232
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:41,844
He's my role model.

233
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,913
I've never even thought about losing
no matter who I face.

234
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:47,382
Kim Donghoe.

235
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,618
He's won the National Sports Festival…

236
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:51,353
He's won it 13 years in a row.

237
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,255
He's going for his 14th win now.

238
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:57,059
Can anyone in Korea beat him?
I highly doubt it.

239
00:11:57,126 --> 00:11:58,494
They think they've landed a hit,

240
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,029
but I've already slipped away
like a ghost, they say.

241
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:05,367
If we're talking pure boxing,
I think I'm practically untouchable.

242
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,469
I'm confident I'll win this thing.

243
00:12:07,536 --> 00:12:10,606
But what if some amateur beats him?
Then that's it for him, right?

244
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:12,307
-But that's not happening.
-Exactly.

245
00:12:12,374 --> 00:12:13,375
That's never happening.

246
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,617
How many are we, a hundred?

247
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:22,851
Everyone's here, right?

248
00:12:24,486 --> 00:12:25,821
One person's still missing.

249
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,992
-The actor?
-I think so.

250
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm a fan.

251
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:33,962
-He's not here yet?
-Guess he's coming last.

252
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:39,735
-[contestants exclaiming, applauding]
-There he is.

253
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,737
The perfect finisher for this lineup.

254
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,438
Seriously, Jang Hyuk is here?

255
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:45,507
-No way.
-It's Jang Hyuk.

256
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:48,310
I wasn't sure it was him,
but it really is.

257
00:12:48,377 --> 00:12:49,444
It's Jang Hyuk.

258
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:51,280
Oh!

259
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:53,749
Hello, I'm Jang Hyuk, an actor.

260
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:54,950
Thank you for having me.

261
00:12:56,118 --> 00:13:00,422
[Jang] Working on a film project
always took a toll on me.

262
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,457
Then one day,
I happened to walk into a boxing gym.

263
00:13:02,524 --> 00:13:06,228
I felt recharged after a boxing session.

264
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:08,263
That's what kept me going.

265
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,400
[announcer] Jang Hyuk,
you've passed the pro boxing test!

266
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:14,102
[Jang] I wanted to see for myself

267
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,905
how far I could go in this thing.

268
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:21,076
[announcer] <i>All contestants have arrived.</i>

269
00:13:21,743 --> 00:13:24,713
<i>The blockbuster boxing survival show,</i>

270
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,415
I Am Boxer…

271
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:33,689
<i>starts right now.</i>

272
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,126
I thought, "So this is it. It's begun."

273
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:42,264
There's no turning back now.
From here on out, I have to go all in.

274
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:45,100
[Kim Donghoe]
It doesn't matter who I'm up against.

275
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,469
Either I go down or my opponent does.

276
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:49,805
I'm taking first place.

277
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:50,806
The victory is mine.

278
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:54,910
I'll fight with everything I've got
till my opponent's on the canvas.

279
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,258
This is intense. I'm nervous.

280
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:11,927
-[contestants chattering]
-It's opening.

281
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,063
[contestants exclaiming]

282
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,131
What the heck?

283
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:18,433
-No way.
-[in English] Oh, my God.

284
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,369
[in Korean] Wow, this is enormous.

285
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:22,170
God, this is freaking insane.

286
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:24,139
Wow, this is sick.

287
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:26,475
[in English] What the hell is this?

288
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:28,577
[in Korean]
This is blockbuster-level, all right.

289
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:30,279
This is massive.

290
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:33,582
That's a killer concept.

291
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:36,885
I didn't think a set could be this big.

292
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:38,954
This is no joke. It's insane.

293
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:41,189
Looks like it'd be fun to fight in here.

294
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,892
My blood was pumping,
and I wanted to get fighting.

295
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,994
What now?

296
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:47,562
What are we doing here?

297
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,198
I was super curious.

298
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,467
It's even scarier
because there's nothing here.

299
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,837
Why isn't there anything here?

300
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:57,539
Are we supposed to fight without a ring?

301
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,841
-Just like <i>Fight Club</i>, right?
-Yeah.

302
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:02,144
What now? What's happening now?

303
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:05,981
Feels like something might be
behind this thing.

304
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:08,550
Do we fight the moment that door opens?

305
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,719
-Kind of feels like it.
-Oh.

306
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:13,055
No, there must be something in there.

307
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,457
-A ring, maybe?
-Yeah, look over there.

308
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:18,460
-That's where the cameras are set up.
-Oh, right.

309
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:21,129
"Open sesame." You know what that means?

310
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:22,597
When you say, "Open sesame,"

311
00:15:23,165 --> 00:15:25,500
-the door opens.
-Oh, right. [chuckles]

312
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:29,371
Whoa, it's opening up.

313
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:31,139
-[contestants exclaiming]
-Oh, what's that?

314
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:32,607
-I was right.
-For real?

315
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:35,344
-Wow, no way.
-This is insane.

316
00:15:37,012 --> 00:15:38,046
Wait, for real?

317
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:40,549
-They actually put rings in there.
-[laughing]

318
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:41,750
Nine rings? Really?

319
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,852
Wow, they really put rings in there!

320
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,488
Wait, what? We were right about that?

321
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:49,124
-Are you serious?
-There's a ring in each space.

322
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:50,892
Holy crap.

323
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,094
Couldn't have imagined this.

324
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,428
It's like a fight factory.

325
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:55,163
A boxing factory.

326
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,732
We're already going one-on-one?

327
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:58,567
Wow, this is insane.

328
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:00,402
There were nine rings.

329
00:16:00,469 --> 00:16:02,804
Wow, I never saw that coming.

330
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:06,575
-So we're all having a match.
-Guess we're sparring today.

331
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:08,677
Why is the middle one still closed?

332
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:10,645
What's up with that one? Is it jammed?

333
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:12,848
Feels like there's something big in there.

334
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:14,616
Could it be…

335
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,119
-Is Don Lee in there? No way.
-Could it be…

336
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,489
Could it be… No way!

337
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:22,958
-Oh! Oh!
-[contestants exclaiming]

338
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,659
Whoa!

339
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:26,962
The moment of truth!

340
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,398
The moment of truth is here!

341
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:32,401
[contestants exclaiming, cheering]

342
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,540
Man, no way. I've got goose bumps.

343
00:16:49,684 --> 00:16:53,055
[cheering, exclaiming, applauding]

344
00:17:00,462 --> 00:17:03,031
-He looks awesome!
-He's huge.

345
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:04,599
It felt like I was watching a movie.

346
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:05,667
He was massive

347
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:07,836
and really charismatic.

348
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,237
I couldn't believe my eyes.

349
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:12,707
He's like the Hulk
when he's about to burst out of his suit.

350
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:14,876
That's the exact impression I got.

351
00:17:14,943 --> 00:17:17,212
He totally looked like
the boss of a fighting promotion.

352
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,548
Like the chairman.

353
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:20,782
Mavely!

354
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,984
[cheering]

355
00:17:23,051 --> 00:17:25,087
Do I fight him if I make it to the finals?

356
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:27,322
Is he going to fight us up there?

357
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,926
[contestants exclaiming]

358
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:38,200
This is insane.

359
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:44,072
Hello.

360
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:46,208
-Hello!
-Hello!

361
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:52,380
I'm Don Lee, your local boxing gym owner,
and the Master of <i>I Am Boxer</i>.

362
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,616
[contestants cheering]

363
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,453
Thank you.

364
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,789
I'm not standing here

365
00:18:01,356 --> 00:18:04,559
because I'm the best boxer in the room.

366
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,829
I'm standing here
as a gym owner, a promoter,

367
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,332
and the creator of this show.

368
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:14,669
I prepared this stage in the hope of
reviving the spirit of boxing once again.

369
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,773
Let the world see how exciting

370
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:21,409
and thrilling boxing can be.

371
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,611
That's all I ask.

372
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:24,412
Are you all ready?

373
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,815
-Yes!
-All right. Best of luck.

374
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:30,552
It's incredible
what he is doing for boxing.

375
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:34,022
I have mad respect for him.

376
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:36,691
He's genuinely passionate about the sport.

377
00:18:36,758 --> 00:18:40,128
Everyone seemed to respect him
for his passion for boxing.

378
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:44,399
The future of Korean boxing
rests on his shoulders.

379
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:49,204
I would say Don Lee might love boxing
even more than I do.

380
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:54,342
When you see him in movies,
his punches are nearly flawless.

381
00:18:55,877 --> 00:19:00,949
He always incorporates boxing techniques
into his action sequences.

382
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:04,386
It's clear that his understanding
of boxing runs deep.

383
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:09,224
Thank goodness Don Lee didn't pursue
a professional career in boxing.

384
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,060
If he had, we would've been rivals.

385
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:15,597
I'm so grateful to him.
I'll be cheering for the show all the way.

386
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:18,900
I have no doubt
it's going to be a huge success.

387
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:22,003
[Lee] All right then, let's bring out

388
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,206
the two hosts who'll be joining us

389
00:19:24,673 --> 00:19:26,675
on <i>I Am Boxer.</i>

390
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:30,545
-[contestants exclaiming]
-Come on up.

391
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:36,985
Hello, I'm Kim Jongkook,
one of the hosts of <i>I Am Boxer</i>.

392
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:40,121
-Nice to meet you all.
-Oh, come on.

393
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:43,058
Hello, I'm Dex,
the other host of <i>I Am Boxer</i>.

394
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:45,193
Looking good!

395
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,162
Looks like this show's gonna be a hit.

396
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,530
The host lineup's amazing.

397
00:19:48,597 --> 00:19:53,668
<i>I Am Boxer </i>features a series of fights
that push every boxer to their limits.

398
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:56,371
All contestants must fight for survival,

399
00:19:56,438 --> 00:19:59,207
regardless of weight class, age,

400
00:19:59,774 --> 00:20:01,343
or profession.

401
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:05,046
Just a straight-up fight.
That's badass, just how it should be.

402
00:20:05,113 --> 00:20:07,048
It was thrilling.

403
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:09,384
I could be up against
someone like Myung Hyunman

404
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:11,920
or even Kim Donghoe.

405
00:20:11,987 --> 00:20:13,521
Well, I'm here.

406
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,825
[in English]
There's no backing out now. Let's do it.

407
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:21,029
[in Korean] Now, this is a big one.

408
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:25,333
The winner of <i>I Am Boxer </i>will receive

409
00:20:25,967 --> 00:20:27,035
a champion belt…

410
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,043
and a top-of-the-line flagship SUV.

411
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,612
[contestants exclaiming]

412
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,883
And finally,

413
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,451
a grand prize of…

414
00:20:43,918 --> 00:20:45,220
[imitates drumroll]

415
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:47,889
-A hundred million won?
-Two hundred million?

416
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:50,392
…three hundred million won!

417
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,327
…three hundred million won!

418
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:54,696
-Three hundred million?
-[laughing]

419
00:20:54,763 --> 00:20:56,131
Yay!

420
00:20:56,197 --> 00:20:59,434
I literally gasped.
I was honestly shocked.

421
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:02,304
There isn't
a single professional boxer in Korea

422
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,140
who can make a living solely from boxing.

423
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:09,678
Typically, pros make
about 100,000 won per round.

424
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,313
Pretty low, huh?

425
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:13,748
If I win this,
I could actually quit boxing.

426
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,317
I could pay off my loans.

427
00:21:16,384 --> 00:21:19,921
I thought, "I really want to win.
I want to win and open my own gym."

428
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:22,590
All right, everyone.

429
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,927
It's time to reveal the first round.

430
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:29,998
Round 1 of <i>I Am Boxer</i> is…

431
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:33,001
the One-on-One Showdown.

432
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:35,270
…the One-on-One Showdown.

433
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:38,206
[contestants gasping, murmuring]

434
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:40,208
Right from the start, huh?

435
00:21:43,411 --> 00:21:45,313
[Lee] The One-on-One Showdown

436
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:48,383
will take place across nine rings.

437
00:21:50,085 --> 00:21:52,287
It is a head-to-head fight.

438
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:55,957
Half of us will get cut, then.

439
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:59,961
I thought,
"It's time to throw down for real."

440
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:04,165
This is exactly what I wanted.
To fight to the end.

441
00:22:04,733 --> 00:22:06,067
It'll be a hell of a fight.

442
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:08,136
My adrenaline was kicking in.

443
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:13,608
The ring I'd like to choose is…
Ring No. 2. Ring No. 4. Ring No. 8.

444
00:22:13,675 --> 00:22:16,311
[Lee] Once the Master selects
one of the nine rings,

445
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,581
-the fight begins immediately.
-[bell rings]

446
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:23,885
The One-on-One showdown

447
00:22:23,952 --> 00:22:27,088
is a single match with no rounds.

448
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:30,425
-That sounds tough.
-Yeah.

449
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,695
[Lee] And the time limit is…

450
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:38,466
-[contestant] Two minutes?
-[contestant] Three minutes?

451
00:22:39,934 --> 00:22:41,536
-[Lee] There isn't one.
-What?

452
00:22:41,603 --> 00:22:42,637
[Lee] There isn't one.

453
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:46,274
-We just keep fighting then?
-Are they crazy?

454
00:22:46,341 --> 00:22:48,076
You're kidding, right?

455
00:22:48,143 --> 00:22:51,513
We'll need, like,
ten ambulances standing by for this.

456
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:55,083
-No way. Is this for real?
-They want us to fight till we drop.

457
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:58,420
So, it only ends when someone drops?

458
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,688
No time limit?

459
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:02,690
Honestly, that got me excited.

460
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,927
Unlimited time? I love it.

461
00:23:05,994 --> 00:23:07,162
I absolutely love it.

462
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:10,365
-[bell rings]
-[Lee] The fight continues…

463
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,934
All right, let's stop here.

464
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,537
[Lee] …until the Master calls it.

465
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:22,477
When the fight ends,
Master Don Lee will choose the winner.

466
00:23:22,544 --> 00:23:25,313
-So the Master's like a god?
-This is just like <i>Squid Game</i>.

467
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:28,850
[Lee] The contestant not chosen
by the Master

468
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:33,555
is immediately eliminated from <i>I Am Boxer.</i>

469
00:23:34,322 --> 00:23:35,657
That's harsh.

470
00:23:36,524 --> 00:23:37,692
That's just harsh.

471
00:23:39,928 --> 00:23:42,464
[Lee] Round 1 of <i>I Am Boxer</i>,

472
00:23:42,997 --> 00:23:44,365
the One-on-One Showdown,

473
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,601
starts now.

474
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,212
We actually get to see this, huh?

475
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:58,646
-I know.
-I know, right?

476
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:00,215
-It's amazing.
-It's a festival.

477
00:24:00,281 --> 00:24:01,583
-Yeah, it really is.
-[laughing]

478
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,285
-Boxing fans are gonna lose their minds.
-Definitely.

479
00:24:04,786 --> 00:24:07,655
[Lee] Before we begin
the One-on-One Showdown,

480
00:24:07,722 --> 00:24:10,959
please welcome the referees.

481
00:24:11,025 --> 00:24:13,895
[contestants exclaiming, applauding]

482
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:19,000
[Dex] How cool.

483
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:20,602
How many are there?

484
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:26,541
I actually have a referee license myself.

485
00:24:26,608 --> 00:24:28,676
You have to box
for over 20 years to get one.

486
00:24:29,244 --> 00:24:32,647
-So referees can fight too?
-That's right. [laughing]

487
00:24:33,815 --> 00:24:35,950
Wow, that's what you took from that?

488
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:37,819
No, I was just curious.

489
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:40,822
[Lee] Round 1 of <i>I Am Boxer</i>,

490
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:43,157
the One-on-One Showdown.

491
00:24:43,224 --> 00:24:45,727
Now, let's reveal the first matchup.

492
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:48,763
I'm nervous.

493
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,965
-[grunts]
-[contestants exclaiming, cheering]

494
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,935
Let's do this! Whoo!

495
00:24:54,002 --> 00:24:56,738
Man, this does it for me every time.

496
00:24:56,804 --> 00:24:59,107
Wow, are they in there already?

497
00:24:59,574 --> 00:25:00,675
They must be nervous.

498
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:05,413
[contestants exclaiming, cheering]

499
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:07,282
All right!

500
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:12,153
Who's it gonna be?

501
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:17,225
-Isn't that Kim Minuk?
-Oh, it's Kim Minuk.

502
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:19,594
Kim Minuk versus Kim Taesun?

503
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:23,631
-An active boxer versus a boxing legend.
-That's a legendary match.

504
00:25:23,698 --> 00:25:25,033
Oh, wow.

505
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:27,201
-Wow, it's Donghoe.
-What?

506
00:25:27,268 --> 00:25:30,538
-It's Donghoe up there.
-[laughs]

507
00:25:32,774 --> 00:25:34,442
The Ghost.

508
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:35,944
I didn't know Sangsoo was here.

509
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,946
[in English]
He used to be a World Sambo Champion.

510
00:25:38,012 --> 00:25:40,248
-[contestants chattering, laughing]
-[in Korean] Dude, this is nuts.

511
00:25:40,315 --> 00:25:41,983
That's gonna be fun to watch.

512
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,851
There's Yuk Junseo.

513
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,888
-Yuk Junseo's here too?
-[contestant exclaiming]

514
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:49,057
Oh, there's Julien Kang.

515
00:25:49,123 --> 00:25:52,060
-[contestant exclaiming]
-Look at those shoulders.

516
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:54,429
-They look unreal.
-Goodness.

517
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:56,097
[in English] Oh, my God.

518
00:25:56,164 --> 00:25:59,667
[Lee, in Korean] Before we begin,
let's start with the warm-up.

519
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:01,603
-Oh, a warm-up?
-[contestants exclaiming]

520
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:03,004
-Whoa, look at that.
-Let's go!

521
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:04,205
Wow, awesome.

522
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:06,741
What's he doing over there, fencing?

523
00:26:06,808 --> 00:26:09,177
[contestants laughing]

524
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,882
[Jongkook] Oh,
everyone has their own concept.

525
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,452
Oh, he's fencing over there.

526
00:26:17,518 --> 00:26:19,420
-What's up with that?
-[Jongkook] He's fencing.

527
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:22,423
[boxer] They're having a staring contest.

528
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,259
[Sungmin] Yeah, looks like they'll go on
until their minute is up.

529
00:26:25,326 --> 00:26:26,894
That’s freaking hilarious.

530
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,997
[contestant] You see them do that
all the time

531
00:26:29,063 --> 00:26:30,999
on <i>High School Emperor</i>.

532
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:33,101
What's up with…

533
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:34,736
What's up with those two?

534
00:26:35,436 --> 00:26:37,271
[contestant 2] Sparks fly at that age.

535
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:38,506
They're something else.

536
00:26:39,173 --> 00:26:42,510
They're young and full of character.

537
00:26:42,577 --> 00:26:44,579
[contestant 3] They're all so unique.

538
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:45,880
What an unusual sight.

539
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:48,816
It's freaking hilarious.

540
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:51,419
But this helps them
size each other up, right?

541
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,554
Absolutely. It's actually quite helpful.

542
00:26:53,621 --> 00:26:55,156
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

543
00:26:55,223 --> 00:26:57,625
Man, I can't wait to see this.

544
00:26:57,692 --> 00:26:58,860
Seriously.

545
00:26:59,427 --> 00:27:01,896
[announcer] <i>Round 1 of </i>I Am Boxer,

550
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:15,443
-[contestant 4] Here we go.
-[contestant 5] I wonder who he'll pick.

551
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,478
[contestant 6, in English]
Who's the first match?

552
00:27:18,613 --> 00:27:20,348
-[in Korean] Ring No. 1.
-[contestants gasping]

553
00:27:20,415 --> 00:27:21,949
[Lee] Ring No. 1.

00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,451
-[gasping]
-[contestant] I knew it.

555
00:27:24,318 --> 00:27:25,787

-Let's go!
-[contestant 3] Come on!

557
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:31,125
Those two really went all out
during their staring contest.

558
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,227
We asked them to warm up,

559
00:27:33,294 --> 00:27:36,030
-but they gave us a face-off. It was fun.
-[Jongkook laughs]

560
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:37,165
[Dex] Those kids.

LEE SEUNGBIN
18-YEAR-OLD HIGH SCHOOL BEAST

570
00:27:59,887 --> 00:28:01,122
He's a high schooler?

571
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:02,323
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

572
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,259
-Kids these days… Yeah.
-They're built differently.

573
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:08,129
You can't tell their age
when you see them out and about.

574
00:28:08,196 --> 00:28:10,965
I'm Lee Seungbin,
a senior at Jinju Jungang High School.

575
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:14,235
I've been training in MMA
for two years now.

576
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:17,238
Height, 195 cm. Weight, 101 kg,

577
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:19,707
with a reach of 210 cm.

578
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:21,676
You never see fighters
of my build in Korea.

579
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,144
I'm way above the Asian average.

580
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:26,714
One solid hit from me,
and they all go down.

581
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:29,350
That's why I'd say my reach
is my most lethal weapon.

582
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,618
He's taking a serious hit.

583
00:28:30,685 --> 00:28:32,520
[producer] Who would you like
to go up against?

584
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:35,456
That guy, Park Sungwoon,
from <i>High School Emperor</i>.

585
00:28:35,523 --> 00:28:38,025
He's always running his mouth,

586
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:39,393
and it's seriously annoying.

587
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,395
That guy's a total clown.

588
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:43,664
I'm training in MMA now.

589
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:44,799
[contestant] Really?

590
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,301
-[Sungwoon] One, two.
-Ah, I see it.

591
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:49,771
I may be big, but I'm fast on my feet.

592
00:28:49,837 --> 00:28:51,672
Hit and move. See?

593
00:28:52,573 --> 00:28:55,176
I'll show you
how we young ones really fight!

594
00:28:55,243 --> 00:28:57,245
[contestants, cheering] All right, kid!

595
00:28:57,311 --> 00:28:59,547
Let's go, young ones!

596
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:01,015
He's got great energy.

597
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:04,152
-Careful not to hit the head, okay?
-Yes, sir.

598
00:29:04,218 --> 00:29:06,587
No clinching, no low blows.
Let's bow and get started.

599
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:08,456
To your corners.

600
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,424
[Sungwoon] There's no avoiding this fight,

601
00:29:10,491 --> 00:29:13,361
so I might as well beat you to a pulp
and move on. Sorry.

602
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:15,129
[Seungbin] I'll knock you out

603
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:17,064
and send you home early tonight.

604
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:18,933
PARK SUNGWOON
VERSUS LEE SEUNGBIN

605
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,969
-Please show us a fiery match.
-[contestants applauding]

606
00:29:22,036 --> 00:29:23,704
-Box.
-Let's go!

607
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:25,039
[contestants] Go! You got this!

608
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:27,608
[contestant] Let's go, young ones!

609
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:29,577
[contestants laugh]

610
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,512
[contestant 2] He's got the basics down.

611
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,881
[Seungbin] So he used to do tae kwon do.

612
00:29:33,948 --> 00:29:36,017
He keeps a distance,
then suddenly dives in.

613
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:39,220
I planned on waiting for that moment
to catch him and drive him back.

614
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:41,789
I already knew a bit about Rindaman.

615
00:29:41,856 --> 00:29:44,525
He's a big guy with a long reach,

616
00:29:44,592 --> 00:29:47,962
so I figured I had to land a hit first
and take control of the pace.

617
00:29:50,298 --> 00:29:51,799
[contestants groan]

618
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,507
-[Jongkook] Oh, he's trapped!
-He's trapped.

619
00:29:59,574 --> 00:30:01,342
-[Jongkook] He's getting hammered.
-Whoa!

620
00:30:10,218 --> 00:30:11,219
[Jongkook] All right!

621
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:17,325
Oh, man.

622
00:30:17,391 --> 00:30:19,460
He's not walking out of that ring.

623
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:22,096
That's it. He's getting groggy.

624
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:23,164
He's groggy!

625
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:26,300
[whistle blows]

626
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,269
LEE SEUNGBIN
STANDING EIGHT COUNT

627
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:30,338
The count's on. One…

628
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:32,073
Is he getting counted?

629
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:33,875
He's getting counted.

630
00:30:36,811 --> 00:30:38,112
-Oh, God!
-Stop!

631
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:39,647
To your corner. Two,

632
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:41,782
three, four,

633
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,985
-five, six…
-[Dex] A standing eight count.

634
00:30:44,585 --> 00:30:45,586
…seven…

635
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:47,588
[contestant] He's counting.

636
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:50,424
-[contestant 2] Wow, the kid's got vigor.
-[contestant 3] Yeah.

637
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:53,227
[referee] Four, five, six…

638
00:30:54,028 --> 00:30:55,963
seven, eight.

639
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,031
[contestant] Wow, it's over.

640
00:30:57,098 --> 00:30:58,099
TKO, FIGHT OVER

641
00:30:58,165 --> 00:30:59,667
[contestants gasp, cheer]

642
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:02,436
Everyone, fucking come at me!

643
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:04,338
[announcer] <i>The fight is over.</i>

644
00:31:05,439 --> 00:31:06,607
[Dex] That's a highlight moment.

645
00:31:07,174 --> 00:31:08,209
[Lee] That was impressive.

646
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,945
I'm honestly speechless.

647
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:12,947
-I mean--
-[Jongkook] I just hope Seungbin's okay.

648
00:31:13,014 --> 00:31:14,148
Let's give him a big hand.

649
00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:15,716
[contestants applauding]

650
00:31:17,385 --> 00:31:19,453
[Jongkook] Oh, boy. He must be upset.

651
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,656
We've got a TKO.

652
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:24,325
The survivor of this match is

653
00:31:24,392 --> 00:31:25,927
Park Sungwoon, from the red corner.

654
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,528
[contestants applaud]

655
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,598
[Lee] He's quick on his feet,
and he's got impressive footwork.

656
00:31:31,565 --> 00:31:33,167
You're known for your taunts, right?

657
00:31:33,234 --> 00:31:35,503
Let's see how good you are.

658
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:37,939
Well, if Kim Donghoe wins today…

659
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:42,810
Kim Donghoe just dropped his head.

660
00:31:42,877 --> 00:31:45,046
[Lee] You probably shouldn't go that far.

661
00:31:45,713 --> 00:31:47,782
[contestant] He's gonna kill you, kid.

662
00:31:48,716 --> 00:31:50,484
He's gone past the point of saving.

663
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:54,088
How about you show some love
for Kim Donghoe now?

664
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:55,489
He's watching right now.

665
00:31:59,193 --> 00:32:00,561
-What the heck?
-[contestants laugh]

666
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:01,729
[Jongkook] He's got moves!

667
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,297
[Lee] All right, well done.

668
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:09,203
-That's adorable.
-Do you think he practices those moves?

669
00:32:09,837 --> 00:32:12,273
-They're all so funny.
-I know.

670
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,409
He's checking on him. That's sweet.

671
00:32:18,012 --> 00:32:19,547
[contestant] Who do you think is up next?

672
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:21,182
-[contestant 2] Well…
-I say top left or…

673
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,850
I think it's top left.

674
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:24,085
[contestant 1] Top left?

675
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,320
Or Ring No. 2? Julien Kang?

676
00:32:27,688 --> 00:32:29,490
My next pick is…

677
00:32:29,557 --> 00:32:30,558
Let's see now.

678
00:32:30,624 --> 00:32:32,727
[boxer] I can't wait for my match.

679
00:32:32,793 --> 00:32:34,795
[boxer 2] Now's the perfect time to go.

680
00:32:36,764 --> 00:32:37,798
Ring No. 8.

681
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:41,435
[announcer] <i>Ring No. 8, it is.</i>

682
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:45,106
<i>From the blue corner, we have</i>
<i>Vietnamese pro boxer, Lee Juyeong.</i>

683
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:47,608
Lee Juyeong is super good.

684
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,810
I'm Lee Juyeong, a professional boxer.

685
00:32:49,877 --> 00:32:52,446
I just turned 18 this year.

686
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:56,484
I made my pro debut at 16,
as the youngest in the league.

687
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,887
I come from a multicultural family.

688
00:32:59,954 --> 00:33:02,556
And I used to be really skinny and shy.

689
00:33:02,623 --> 00:33:05,526
Kids would pick on me a lot back then.

690
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:08,662
That's why I started boxing, to survive.

691
00:33:08,729 --> 00:33:11,132
I have a two-year-old younger brother,

692
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:14,835
and we don't live in
the safest neighborhood.

693
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:20,007
If I win the prize money,
I want to move my family out of there.

694
00:33:20,074 --> 00:33:22,576
I've seen Lee Juyeong fight before.

695
00:33:22,643 --> 00:33:24,111
-He's really good.
-He is?

696
00:33:24,178 --> 00:33:26,247
-I see.
-What about his opponent?

697
00:33:26,747 --> 00:33:28,816
He's a Black C*mbat flyweight fighter.

698
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,753
Hello, I'm Kim Minwoo,
a professional MMA fighter,

699
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,023
known as "Mad Dog"
in the flyweight division.

700
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:42,563
Once I latch on to a target,
I never let go.

701
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,697
Hence, the nickname.

702
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,973
MMA fighters possess
a unique kind of toughness.

703
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,076
If I can channel that energy into boxing,

704
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:57,511
I believe I have a shot at winning.

705
00:33:58,112 --> 00:34:01,082
[contestant] If this were MMA,
he could end it with one low kick.

706
00:34:01,148 --> 00:34:03,217
-But this is boxing.
-Yeah.

707
00:34:03,284 --> 00:34:04,351
He's got the upper hand.

708
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,288
[Sungmin] MMA strikes

709
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:10,024
and boxing techniques are very different.

710
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:12,626
Boxers definitely have the upper hand.

711
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:15,896
MMA fighters are stronger, of course.

712
00:34:15,963 --> 00:34:19,433
I don't think boxers here in Korea
are that intimidating.

713
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,403
-MMA fighters these days are pretty tough.
-[Jongkook] Yeah?

714
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,071
[Lee] They've leveled up a lot.

715
00:34:24,138 --> 00:34:25,606
[Minwoo] Boxing isn't my discipline,

716
00:34:25,673 --> 00:34:29,009
but I'm ready to show my grit
as an MMA fighter

717
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:31,378
and as Mad Dog.

718
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,616
[Juyeong] He'd better bring his A-game.

719
00:34:35,683 --> 00:34:37,384
I'm not an easy fight.

720
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,955
KIM MINWOO VERSUS LEE JUYEONG

721
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:43,891
-Ring No. 8, box.
-[bell dings]

722
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,293
-Start!
-[contestants] All right, let's go!

723
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,795
[Lee] This one's going to be fun.

724
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,101
[contestant] Whoa, he's good.

725
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:55,970
He's got solid technique.

726
00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:57,037
He's good.

727
00:34:57,104 --> 00:34:58,706
You can tell just from his jab.

728
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:04,845
-Whoa.
-Dang.

729
00:35:06,013 --> 00:35:07,381
Dang, he's good.

730
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,287
Yes, nice.

731
00:35:14,622 --> 00:35:16,557
That's the first time you've said "nice."

732
00:35:16,624 --> 00:35:19,026
Yeah, his timing is spot-on.

733
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:21,262
[Juyeong] I threw quick, short jabs,

734
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,197
and they still landed sharp.

735
00:35:24,698 --> 00:35:26,167
I thought, "Yeah, I've got this."

736
00:35:29,703 --> 00:35:31,071
-[contestant] He's good.
-[contestant 2] He is.

737
00:35:31,939 --> 00:35:32,973
He knows when to wait.

738
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:35,743
Great guard control.

739
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:38,679
[contestants cheer]

740
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,149
Wow. That's how you do it.

741
00:35:45,486 --> 00:35:47,121
-That one landed solid.
-Great.

742
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:50,958
See how he reads his moves and counters?

743
00:35:53,394 --> 00:35:54,595
[contestant 3] Now this is worth watching.

744
00:35:55,396 --> 00:35:56,931
This is real boxing.

745
00:35:57,565 --> 00:35:58,599
This is pro boxing.

746
00:36:01,902 --> 00:36:03,537
[contestant 4] Wow. Nice one.

747
00:36:05,472 --> 00:36:07,508
[contestant 5] But that MMA guy's
no slouch either.

748
00:36:07,575 --> 00:36:10,044
-His punches are sturdy.
-[contestant 6] He's no easy fight.

749
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,145
[contestant 5] No.

750
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,280
He's got a striking base after all.

751
00:36:13,347 --> 00:36:14,548
[contestant 5] Right, he's a striker.

752
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,451
[contestant 6] That MMA guy's super good,
though.

753
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,255
[contestant 5] Kim Minwoo's sharp.

754
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:24,825
His timing is good.

755
00:36:29,863 --> 00:36:30,864
That was great.

756
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:32,433
Whoa, amazing.

757
00:36:34,034 --> 00:36:35,302
They're going back and forth.

758
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:36,704
They're both good.

759
00:36:37,338 --> 00:36:39,773
-They're both trading. Yeah.
-They're both good.

760
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:43,277
Very nice. They're both good.

761
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:48,916
He's countering pretty well.

762
00:36:48,983 --> 00:36:51,452
[contestant 7] That MMA guy's
got serious boxing skills.

763
00:36:59,126 --> 00:37:00,127
[bell dinging]

764
00:37:01,128 --> 00:37:02,129
Stop!

765
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:04,732
[announcer] <i>The fight is over.</i>

766
00:37:04,798 --> 00:37:06,667
[contestant] The red corner guy's good.

767
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:08,736
-[contestant 2] For an MMA fighter.
-[contestant 3] Yeah, he's good.

768
00:37:08,802 --> 00:37:11,205
-Who's your bet?
-Blue corner, of course.

769
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,439
He'll win for sure.

770
00:37:13,173 --> 00:37:16,410
[announcer] <i>Master,</i>
<i>please announce the survivor.</i>

771
00:37:16,477 --> 00:37:17,611
[contestant] Oh, boy…

772
00:37:18,545 --> 00:37:20,814
-Hold on, give me a moment.
-[Dex chuckles]

773
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:22,249
This one's pretty tough.

774
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,485
[contestant] Red corner might've taken it.

775
00:37:25,586 --> 00:37:27,488
[contestant 2] Blue corner's won,
don't you think?

776
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:31,091
His punches were heavier,
but he threw more attacks overall.

777
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:32,660
[contestant 3] They both did well.

778
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:37,298
For the first time today,
Don Lee kept saying

779
00:37:37,364 --> 00:37:39,767
that they're good.

780
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:41,568
That's how great the fight was.

781
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:42,770
-Well done.
-Thank you.

782
00:37:42,836 --> 00:37:44,538
[contestants applaud]

783
00:37:44,605 --> 00:37:46,607
The survivor of this match is…

784
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,346
[Minwoo] Honestly, it was half and half.

785
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:54,148
I couldn't tell who was going to win.

786
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:58,786
[Juyeong] I thought I was going to win,
to be honest.

787
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:01,322
[contestant] Whoever wins,
I wouldn't be surprised.

788
00:38:02,823 --> 00:38:04,825
Lee Juyeong from the blue corner.

789
00:38:05,693 --> 00:38:06,794
LEE JUYEONG SURVIVES

790
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,028
Thank you, sir!

791
00:38:08,095 --> 00:38:09,797
[contestants applaud]

792
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:11,198
[Lee] Wait, hold on.

793
00:38:11,265 --> 00:38:12,866
Wait, hold on.

794
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:14,501
Wait, I'm not done.

795
00:38:16,904 --> 00:38:20,507
Kim Minwoo from the red corner
also survives.

796
00:38:20,574 --> 00:38:21,575
[contestants gasp]

797
00:38:21,642 --> 00:38:23,344
RED CORNER KIM MINWOO SURVIVES

798
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,546
-Thank you, sir!
-Was that like the Golden Buzzer?

799
00:38:25,612 --> 00:38:27,748
-He can do that?
-Yeah, fair enough.

800
00:38:27,815 --> 00:38:30,818
[Lee] It was neck and neck
between you two.

801
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:32,820
I want to see you both again,

802
00:38:33,821 --> 00:38:36,990
so I decided to advance you both.
I'm not sure if that's okay, though.

803
00:38:37,057 --> 00:38:39,026
-Is that allowed?
-I don't know.

804
00:38:39,093 --> 00:38:40,327
I'm not sure.

805
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:43,597
Actually, you can't see them from here,

806
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:47,368
but there are professional judges
watching this with us.

807
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:50,604
The final result
includes their evaluations as well.

808
00:38:50,671 --> 00:38:53,607
So I hope the rest of you
continue to bring that same energy.

809
00:38:53,674 --> 00:38:54,808
Great work.

810
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,310
-Thank you, sir!
-Appreciate it!

811
00:38:57,277 --> 00:38:59,046
I think they both deserved it too.

812
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,181
-They were both so good.
-[Jongkook] Yeah.

813
00:39:01,815 --> 00:39:04,385
[Lee] My next pick is

814
00:39:04,451 --> 00:39:06,453
Ring No. 4.

815
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,255
Ring No. 4.

816
00:39:10,257 --> 00:39:12,159
-[contestant] It's Yuk Junseo's ring.
-[contestant 2] Let's go!

817
00:39:12,226 --> 00:39:13,660
Damn, look at his body.

818
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:14,828
That's awesome.

819
00:39:14,895 --> 00:39:16,263
It's the UDT charm.

820
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,366
-Junseo is my senior from the military.
-[Lee] That's right.

821
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:20,434
-[Jongkook] Oh, really?
-Yes.

822
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:21,869
We know each other.

823
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,239
[Jongkook] This looks like a tough match.

824
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,711
-As for YunB, he's trained for years.
-Oh, I see.

825
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:36,016
Hey, everyone. I'm a rapper
and the best fighter among Korean rappers.

826
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,084
The name's YunB.

827
00:39:37,985 --> 00:39:41,288
Having experienced both music
and combat, I know how to fight.

828
00:39:41,955 --> 00:39:45,959
As the guy known as
the best fighter among Korean rappers,

829
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:47,027
I'm confident.

830
00:39:50,764 --> 00:39:52,566
If my punch lands,

831
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:53,767
even pros might go down.

832
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:56,937
World champions?
Believe me, this could knock them out.

833
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,707
That's him acting it up for the show.

834
00:40:01,408 --> 00:40:03,477
I'll show him the difference

835
00:40:04,178 --> 00:40:05,512
between show and a real fight.

836
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:09,216
I'll prove it with the results.

837
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:13,320
YUNB VERSUS YUK JUNSEO

838
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:15,222
Junseo's punches…

839
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:18,692
-They're insanely strong for his size.
-Really?

840
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:23,096
[contestant] I hear
YunB has a fiery personality.

841
00:40:23,163 --> 00:40:25,566
I think he'll throw quick jabs,
like pow, pow, pow.

842
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,469
-Let's begin right away. Box!
-[bell dings]

843
00:40:28,535 --> 00:40:31,305
[contestants] Let's go! You got this!

844
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:35,142
[contestant] He's fast.

845
00:40:36,176 --> 00:40:37,611
[contestants gasp]

846
00:40:41,615 --> 00:40:42,916
[contestant] Oh, Yuk Junseo's good.

847
00:40:47,054 --> 00:40:48,322
[contestant 2] He took one on the chin.

848
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:50,624
[contestant 3] Stay calm!

849
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:55,429
-[contestant 4] He's getting worked up.
-[contestant 5] Don't let him clinch!

850
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,030
[contestant 6] They're both forcing it.

851
00:40:58,465 --> 00:41:00,734
Junseo needs to tuck his chin in.

852
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:02,603
-He might…
-If one of those lands…

853
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:03,804
He'd better watch out.

854
00:41:09,776 --> 00:41:11,178
[contestant] He's got
great distance control.

855
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:14,114
[contestant 2] His jabs hit hard.

856
00:41:16,149 --> 00:41:17,417
[contestants gasping]

857
00:41:19,253 --> 00:41:20,254
[contestant] He's good.

858
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:21,855
Whoa.

859
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:26,827
Oh, nice jab!

860
00:41:26,894 --> 00:41:28,695
-Nice!
-He's good!

861
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,742
-[contestant 2] Nice.
-[contestants gasp] Whoa!

862
00:41:41,808 --> 00:41:43,176
Stop! Time!

863
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:52,119
-[contestant 3] That was clean.
-[contestant 4] That landed beautifully.

864
00:41:52,185 --> 00:41:53,654
[referee] Stop! Time!

865
00:41:55,355 --> 00:41:56,623
[contestant 5] That was amazing.

866
00:42:03,096 --> 00:42:04,498
RED CORNER YUNB IS DOWN

867
00:42:04,565 --> 00:42:06,033
[contestant 6] That's a clean knockdown.

868
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:08,802
-Two, three…
-[contestant 7] That was a solid hit.

869
00:42:08,869 --> 00:42:11,872
-…four, five, six…
-He's gonna lose his best fighter title.

870
00:42:11,939 --> 00:42:14,708
-Wow, Junseo's on another level.
-…seven, eight.

871
00:42:14,775 --> 00:42:16,276
-[referee] Look at me. You okay?
-Okay.

872
00:42:16,343 --> 00:42:18,078
-Yes, sir.
-All right, come on.

873
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:19,880
-You think you can keep going?
-Yes.

874
00:42:19,947 --> 00:42:21,548
-He wants to keep going.
-Really?

875
00:42:22,382 --> 00:42:23,383
That's cool.

876
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:25,719
-Let's go!
-You got this, man!

877
00:42:25,786 --> 00:42:28,455
[contestant] He wants to push
through to the end.

878
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,059
[contestant 2] Guard up!

879
00:42:33,627 --> 00:42:35,095
-[contestants cheer]
-Oh, no.

880
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,901
Stop!

881
00:42:43,637 --> 00:42:45,672
Stop!

882
00:42:45,739 --> 00:42:47,774
TKO, FIGHT OVER

883
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:49,242
[announcer] <i>The fight is over.</i>

884
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:51,278
[contestant] A standing KO!

885
00:42:51,345 --> 00:42:53,013
That was more fun than I expected.

886
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,616
-Lots of KOs today, huh?
-Totally.

887
00:42:55,682 --> 00:42:58,485
He's way better than I thought.

888
00:42:59,052 --> 00:43:00,487
-I'm surprised.
-Same here.

889
00:43:01,021 --> 00:43:04,157
YunB, that was impressive,
fighting till the end.

890
00:43:05,826 --> 00:43:11,098
That was our second KO on <i>I Am Boxer.</i>

891
00:43:11,164 --> 00:43:15,402
My punches hit harder
than you'd expect for my weight class.

892
00:43:15,902 --> 00:43:17,437
I knew that was my strength,

893
00:43:18,238 --> 00:43:20,173
and luckily, it worked well today.

894
00:43:20,907 --> 00:43:23,276
Even his voice is handsome.

895
00:43:23,343 --> 00:43:24,411
How annoying.

896
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:27,347
That's just unfair.

897
00:43:27,414 --> 00:43:29,416
-He's too perfect.
-I know.

898
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:31,952
[Junseo] Just like today's match,

899
00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:34,254
I'll pour out everything I've got

900
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:37,758
for the upcoming missions.

901
00:43:39,426 --> 00:43:42,362
My next pick is…

902
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,965
Oh… Are we doing this?

903
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:47,300
Ring No. 2.

904
00:43:48,301 --> 00:43:49,770
He's just built differently.

905
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,438
Man, that build. It's insane.

906
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:53,774
Do we finally get to see this?

907
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,308
-Julien Kang, you mean?
-Julien Kang?

908
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,344
[contestants cheering]

909
00:43:58,578 --> 00:44:00,180
-This is gonna be a big match.
-Yeah.

910
00:44:00,247 --> 00:44:01,248
[announcer] <i>Ring No. 2.</i>

911
00:44:01,314 --> 00:44:04,051
<i>From the red corner,</i>
<i>the toughest fighter in entertainment.</i>

912
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:05,252
<i>Julien Kang!</i>

913
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:08,889
[contestant] His arms seem longer
than his legs.

914
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:11,224
His reach is like a spear.

915
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:12,626
-It's two meters…
-[Jongkook] I know.

916
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:14,394
It's basically the length of a spear.

917
00:44:14,961 --> 00:44:17,931
He's in a different league.

918
00:44:17,998 --> 00:44:20,233
-He's got long limbs.
-Good-looking guy.

919
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,236
Hello, I'm Julien Kang.

920
00:44:23,303 --> 00:44:24,304
TOP CELEB FIGHTER

921
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:26,540
Compared to other entertainers,

922
00:44:26,606 --> 00:44:29,109
I've got a bigger frame

923
00:44:29,176 --> 00:44:33,046
and more martial arts training experience,

924
00:44:33,113 --> 00:44:36,483
so I might be a top contender here.

925
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:41,054
My reach is long for my height too.

926
00:44:41,121 --> 00:44:44,758
So that gives me a bit of an edge.

927
00:44:45,325 --> 00:44:48,462
I really love boxing.

928
00:44:48,528 --> 00:44:50,897
I want to show that I'm a fearless boxer,

929
00:44:50,964 --> 00:44:53,934
one who never gives up.

930
00:44:54,868 --> 00:44:58,872
[Jongkook] Song Hyunmin weighs 130 kg,
though.

931
00:44:58,939 --> 00:45:00,040
Right, that's rare.

932
00:45:00,107 --> 00:45:01,141
SONG HYUNMIN

933
00:45:01,208 --> 00:45:02,843
Gosh, he's tall too!

934
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:04,845
-They're heavyweights.
-This will be fun.

935
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,614
-[contestant] Finally, it's Julien Kang.
-[contestant 2] We might see another KO.

936
00:45:07,681 --> 00:45:10,050
-But you never know.
-Right.

937
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,753
[contestants] Let's go! You got this!

938
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:14,721
Let's go! Come on!

939
00:45:14,788 --> 00:45:16,957
Ring No. 2, box!

941
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:20,060
-Box!
-[contestant] Let's do this!

942
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,295
[Lee] Man, that reach!

943
00:45:24,464 --> 00:45:25,665
Look at that reach.

944
00:45:25,732 --> 00:45:27,501
A few hits like that could put you out.

945
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:30,604
[contestants] Let's go! You got this!

946
00:45:32,072 --> 00:45:33,340
That's it.

947
00:45:33,406 --> 00:45:34,574
[metal clangs]

948
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:39,346
-Break!
-Did I hear a rope snap?

949
00:45:39,412 --> 00:45:40,614
That sounds heavy.

950
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,815
I heard something break.

951
00:45:42,983 --> 00:45:44,417
His reach is insane.

952
00:45:45,452 --> 00:45:47,587
How do you close the distance? Oh, look.

953
00:45:53,994 --> 00:45:55,228
[contestant] Oh, that's a heavy shot.

954
00:45:56,296 --> 00:45:58,298
God, his punches are so heavy.

955
00:46:09,176 --> 00:46:10,343
Come on, you got this!

956
00:46:11,111 --> 00:46:12,212
[contestant 2] He's good.

957
00:46:12,279 --> 00:46:13,313
Julien's good.

958
00:46:15,081 --> 00:46:16,383
[contestant 3] Oh, he's going in.

959
00:46:18,752 --> 00:46:20,020
-[referee] Stop!
-Oh, goodness.

960
00:46:20,086 --> 00:46:22,622
-Damn.
-[contestant 4] That's got to hurt bad.

961
00:46:22,689 --> 00:46:24,157
Three…

962
00:46:24,224 --> 00:46:27,260
[Hyunmin] When I took that heavy punch
in the face,

963
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,361
I was completely dazed.

964
00:46:28,428 --> 00:46:31,998
I've never been hit that hard in my life.

965
00:46:32,532 --> 00:46:34,968
I thought I was getting smashed
with a baseball bat.

966
00:46:35,035 --> 00:46:36,102
Seriously.

967
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:37,904
You put your guard up, right?

968
00:46:37,971 --> 00:46:40,140
But when you realize
how powerful the punches are,

969
00:46:40,207 --> 00:46:41,908
-you stop attacking.
-[Dex] Ah…

970
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:43,777
-You just keep your guard up.
-You freeze.

971
00:46:43,844 --> 00:46:44,911
Yeah, you can't help it.

972
00:46:44,978 --> 00:46:46,479
[contestant] Man, that looks brutal.

973
00:46:46,546 --> 00:46:48,014
[contestant 2] He's living up
to his reputation.

974
00:46:48,648 --> 00:46:50,016
Step forward. Can you continue?

975
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,151
-Yes.
-Okay.

976
00:46:51,218 --> 00:46:52,519
[contestant] Yes, push through.

977
00:46:52,586 --> 00:46:54,054
Just land one shot. Just one.

978
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,789
Fighting till the end is what matters.

979
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:57,624
[contestant 2] Press in
and land one clean hit.

980
00:46:57,691 --> 00:47:00,026
-[contestant 3] He's got to go in! Go in!
-[contestant 4] Go!

981
00:47:00,093 --> 00:47:01,094
Shoot, too short.

982
00:47:01,161 --> 00:47:02,429
[contestant 5] Man, that reach!

983
00:47:03,163 --> 00:47:04,364
It's his physique.

984
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:07,567
[referee] Break!

985
00:47:11,071 --> 00:47:12,672
-Come on, you got this.
-[Lee] Come on.

986
00:47:13,473 --> 00:47:15,175
[contestant] Come on, let's go!

987
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:18,378
Break!

988
00:47:21,848 --> 00:47:23,617
-[bell dings]
-Stop!

989
00:47:23,683 --> 00:47:25,552
[announcer] <i>The fight is over.</i>

990
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,587
[contestant] So this is what Julien Kang
is made of.

991
00:47:27,654 --> 00:47:28,655
He's strong.

992
00:47:29,155 --> 00:47:31,391
You can really feel the weight
behind his punches.

993
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:35,028
For the first time in the ring,
I actually heard something tear.

994
00:47:35,095 --> 00:47:36,563
Sounded like the ring collapsing.

995
00:47:37,864 --> 00:47:39,199
[metal clangs]

996
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,902
-[contestant] Oh, my goodness.
-Break!

997
00:47:41,968 --> 00:47:46,239
I think "intimidating" is the best word
to describe this match.

998
00:47:46,306 --> 00:47:48,041
It really was intimidating.

999
00:47:48,975 --> 00:47:51,177
Julien is definitely a tough one to beat.

1000
00:47:51,945 --> 00:47:53,013
[contestants applauding]

1001
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:56,583
RED CORNER JULIEN KANG SURVIVES

1002
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:57,851
[contestant] He really is a top fighter.

1003
00:47:57,918 --> 00:47:59,386
He proved himself.

1004
00:48:00,287 --> 00:48:01,688
He's just as good as they say.

1005
00:48:01,755 --> 00:48:03,957
[contestant 2] Man,
these matchups are fire.

1006
00:48:04,457 --> 00:48:06,760
But the more I watch and see the winners,

1007
00:48:06,826 --> 00:48:08,828
the more I start to freak out. [chuckles]

1008
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:13,366
Feels like we're left
with the real heavy-hitters now.

1009
00:48:13,433 --> 00:48:15,735
What's left are wars to be fought.

1010
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:17,804
They're all outstanding.

1011
00:48:18,805 --> 00:48:20,373
[Jongkook] Oh, are we gonna go there?

1012
00:48:23,376 --> 00:48:24,544
My next pick is…

1013
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:26,913
[contestant] Oh, I'm nervous.
This is nerve-racking!

1014
00:48:28,748 --> 00:48:30,083
Oh, man…

1015
00:48:31,551 --> 00:48:34,220
[producer] Do you have a top contender
in mind?

1016
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:35,288
Kim Donghoe.

1017
00:48:35,355 --> 00:48:38,124
He's hit the peak as an amateur boxer.

1018
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:39,392
Probably the best in Korea.

1019
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:40,961
He's definitely a top contender.

1020
00:48:41,027 --> 00:48:42,829
-Donghoe.
-[producer chuckles]

1021
00:48:45,332 --> 00:48:48,268
I swear, I'm only good at boxing.

1022
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:52,439
[contestant] He's going for his 14th win
at the National Sports Festival.

1023
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,978
Whether I'm up against a friend
or a junior, I fight to win.

1024
00:48:58,645 --> 00:49:01,281
[Dawoon] This is my first time seeing
Kim Donghoe fight.

1025
00:49:01,348 --> 00:49:04,384
I've heard his name a thousand times.

1026
00:49:04,451 --> 00:49:07,020
People call him
"Son Goku from Dragon Ball".

1027
00:49:07,087 --> 00:49:08,755
-Is that so?
-Among the amateur boxers.

1028
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:11,491
[announcer] <i>The 14-time consecutive</i>

<i>Kim Donghoe!</i>

1030
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:16,963
[Sangsoo] I mean, seriously…

1031
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,565
I couldn't help but laugh.

1032
00:49:19,099 --> 00:49:21,534
I mean, come on…

1033
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:24,738
You matched me up with the final boss.

1034
00:49:24,804 --> 00:49:26,072
It's just cruel.

1035
00:49:26,606 --> 00:49:29,776
But still, I am an MMA fighter.

1036
00:49:29,843 --> 00:49:33,079
I wanted to face him properly once.
For pride's sake, you know?

1037
00:49:33,146 --> 00:49:35,849
[announcer] <i>From the blue corner,</i>
<i>the former World Sambo Champion,</i>

1038
00:49:35,915 --> 00:49:38,952
-<i>King of Endurance, Lee Sangsoo!</i>
-[contestant] King of Endurance.

1039
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:40,253
FORMER WORLD SAMBO CHAMPION

1040
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,155
Is he someone famous too?

1041
00:49:42,222 --> 00:49:43,289
Sangsoo?

1042
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:46,393
-He's a veteran in combat sports.
-Really?

1043
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:48,128
He started with judo, then sambo,

1044
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:49,562
then MMA.

1045
00:49:49,629 --> 00:49:51,664
I participated in
the "World Sambo Championship"

1046
00:49:52,232 --> 00:49:54,234
and won it three years in a row.

1047
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,504
I came here to prove I've still got it.

1048
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:00,507
-Sangsoo is known as King of Endurance.
-That's right.

1049
00:50:00,573 --> 00:50:03,676
I should know.
I've tested his tolerance myself.

1054
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:13,453
Wow, that's rough!

1055
00:50:14,187 --> 00:50:16,589
[Sangsoo] My abs can withstand anything.

1056
00:50:16,656 --> 00:50:18,258
Go ahead, take your shot.

1057
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,127
[Jongkook] Offense versus defense.

1058
00:50:21,194 --> 00:50:23,263
[Lee] A matchup
between the living legends.

1059
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:27,767
People would want to see
if he can still hold up in the ring.

1060
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:28,835
Right.

1061
00:50:28,902 --> 00:50:31,204
-Against one of the best boxers too.
-Exactly.

1062
00:50:31,271 --> 00:50:33,306
[Donghoe] I bet
every fighter here knows me.

1063
00:50:33,373 --> 00:50:35,375
I've got to live up to their expectations.

1064
00:50:35,975 --> 00:50:39,412
I know he can take hits,
so how do I crack him?

1065
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,750
[Sangsoo] Korean boxing isn't yet
on the same level as the global scene.

1066
00:50:43,817 --> 00:50:47,754
I'll show you what world-class looks like.

1067
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:48,855
Ring No. 5.

1068
00:50:50,623 --> 00:50:52,225
-Box.
-[bell dings]

1069

00:50:55,662 --> 00:50:57,931
[contestants] Let's go! Go, go!

1071
00:51:05,405 --> 00:51:06,406
Damn, he's fast.

1072
00:51:11,911 --> 00:51:13,046
[contestants gasping]

1073
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,586
Wow, great rhythm and timing.

1074
00:51:21,588 --> 00:51:24,090
Okay!

1075
00:51:24,891 --> 00:51:27,093
-His punches land so smoothly.
-Yes, they're heavy.

1076
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,428
[contestant] That's beautiful.

1077
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,398
[contestant 2] Go in.
You have to go for it.

1078
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,303
-Whoa.
-Nice!

1079
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:44,144
Nice.

1080
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,979
Wow, Sangsoo's doing well.

1081
00:51:46,045 --> 00:51:47,080
-Not bad at all.
-Yeah.

1082
00:51:51,184 --> 00:51:52,418
[Lee] He's leaving his body open.

1083
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:53,686
Whoa, he's…

1084
00:51:57,123 --> 00:51:58,725
[contestant] Because body shots
don't affect him.

1085
00:51:59,392 --> 00:52:02,328
[Donghoe] I've always been confident
in my punches, so I went for his body,

1086
00:52:02,896 --> 00:52:04,531
but he didn't even flinch.

1087
00:52:05,365 --> 00:52:07,567
[Lee] He's taking those body shots
like it's nothing.

1088
00:52:07,634 --> 00:52:09,769
-He should stop going for the body.
-[chuckles]

1089
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:10,970
It's a waste of energy.

1090
00:52:13,973 --> 00:52:15,975
[contestants exclaiming]

1091
00:52:16,042 --> 00:52:18,545
[Kim Donghoe]
I realized body shots wouldn't work,

1092
00:52:18,611 --> 00:52:22,015
so I switched it up
and went for the head instead.

1093
00:52:30,256 --> 00:52:31,591
[contestant] Oh, boy.

1094
00:52:31,658 --> 00:52:32,725
That's good.

1095
00:52:34,794 --> 00:52:36,930
How does he move like that?

1096
00:52:37,997 --> 00:52:39,132
Let's go, Lee Sangsoo!

1097
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,600
-You got this!
-You got this!

1098
00:52:41,834 --> 00:52:43,836
He's not missing a single punch.

1099
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,705
[contestant] Damn, he's good.

1100
00:52:51,511 --> 00:52:53,379
There it is. His signature move.

1101
00:52:54,113 --> 00:52:55,615
[contestants exclaiming]

1102
00:52:55,682 --> 00:52:57,483
He keeps firing from every stance.

1103
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,953
He's super skillful.

1104
00:53:07,594 --> 00:53:08,628
Stop!

1105
00:53:08,695 --> 00:53:10,597
-[announcer] <i>The fight is over.</i>
-[contestants exclaiming]

1106
00:53:10,663 --> 00:53:12,232
That's pure art.

1107
00:53:12,999 --> 00:53:15,301
He makes it look so effortless.

1108
00:53:15,368 --> 00:53:17,737
We were supposed to be talking,

1109
00:53:17,804 --> 00:53:19,372
but my jaw just dropped.

1110
00:53:19,439 --> 00:53:21,274
I just sat there speechless.

1111
00:53:21,341 --> 00:53:23,910
-He wouldn't go for my body.
-[judges laughing]

1112
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:26,045
[Sangsoo] He faked it,

1113
00:53:26,112 --> 00:53:27,380
then went straight for my face.

1114
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,249
He was amazing.

1115
00:53:29,315 --> 00:53:31,150
I did throw a few body shots.

1116
00:53:31,217 --> 00:53:33,519
Most people flinch, but not him.

1117
00:53:33,586 --> 00:53:35,755
He kept coming like it was nothing,
so I was shocked.

1118
00:53:35,822 --> 00:53:37,457
Nothing gets through Sangsoo's body.

1119
00:53:37,523 --> 00:53:38,925
[laughing]

1120
00:53:38,992 --> 00:53:40,827
He's a legend for a reason, though.

1121
00:53:40,893 --> 00:53:43,363
His punches look light,
but they're insanely powerful.

1122
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:45,031
[contestant] Oh, really?

1123
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:47,400
They did look light.
I guess they're heavy.

1124
00:53:47,467 --> 00:53:50,503
He puts even more weight
behind his punches by relaxing his body.

1125
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:54,307
All right, so the survivor of this match
is Kim Donghoe from the red corner.

1126
00:53:54,374 --> 00:53:56,809
[contestants exclaiming, applauding]

1127
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,081
The Boxing Ghost.

1128
00:54:04,083 --> 00:54:05,084
[Lee] And finally…

1129
00:54:06,386 --> 00:54:07,920
Okay, here we go.

1130
00:54:07,987 --> 00:54:09,389
It's time.

1131
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:10,823
The main event of the day.

1132
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:12,892
This one's going to be intense.

1133
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,528
You're telling me these fighters are here?

1134
00:54:15,595 --> 00:54:17,063
They are top-tier fighters.

1135
00:54:17,664 --> 00:54:18,798
[contestant] The current champion.

1136
00:54:18,865 --> 00:54:21,167
-He's the East Asia champion, right?
-Yeah.

1137
00:54:21,234 --> 00:54:22,735
The former versus the current.

1138
00:54:22,802 --> 00:54:24,337
This feels like the finals already.

1139
00:54:24,404 --> 00:54:26,339
-This one's got to be the most fun.
-Definitely.

1140
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,342
I'll choose Ring No. 6.

1141
00:54:29,409 --> 00:54:31,144
-The legends.
-This is gonna be fun.

1142
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:32,945
This could be a historic match.

1143
00:54:33,012 --> 00:54:35,181
[announcer] <i>From the blue corner,</i>
<i>Korea's reigning featherweight</i>

1144
00:54:35,248 --> 00:54:38,451

<i>Kim Taesun.</i>

1145
00:54:38,518 --> 00:54:39,619
[contestants exclaiming]

1146
00:54:39,686 --> 00:54:41,587
He's a rising star.

1147
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:43,456
His stamina is insane, and he's fierce.

1148
00:54:43,523 --> 00:54:45,625
He just keeps pressing hard.

1149

[announcer] <i>From the red corner,</i>
<i>former national team member</i>

-[contestant] It's Snyper!
-[contestants exclaiming]

1152
00:54:54,467 --> 00:54:57,970
Honestly, Kim Minuk was
one of my all-time favorites.

1153
00:54:58,037 --> 00:54:59,038
Snyper, huh?

1154
00:54:59,105 --> 00:55:02,241
I don't follow boxing closely,
but I know who Kim Minuk is.

1155
00:55:02,308 --> 00:55:04,010
You could say he's a star boxer.

1156
00:55:04,077 --> 00:55:05,945
Who will win, the old or the new champion?

1157
00:55:08,548 --> 00:55:12,118
I'm the current WBA Asia East champion
and the Korean super featherweight champ,

1158
00:55:12,185 --> 00:55:14,954
defending my title for the fourth time.

1159
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:16,556
Go in, go in!

1160
00:55:17,323 --> 00:55:19,258
[commentator 1] Okay!
This is a battle of pride!

1161
00:55:19,759 --> 00:55:22,962
-[commentator 2] Oh, he stopped the match!
-The referee put a stop to it!

1162
00:55:23,029 --> 00:55:24,931
[Taesun] My record so far is 13 wins,

1163
00:55:24,997 --> 00:55:28,868
9 by KO, 3 losses,
and 2 draws in 18 fights.

1164
00:55:28,935 --> 00:55:32,905
I'm a former national team player
and a previous East Asian champion.

1165
00:55:32,972 --> 00:55:34,874
[commentator 1] He's got him in a bind!

1166
00:55:34,941 --> 00:55:36,642
-He is down!
-[commentator 2] Congratulations!

1167
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:38,878
That was Kim Minuk
of the Republic of Korea!

1168
00:55:38,945 --> 00:55:41,080
And he is now
the super featherweight champion!

1169
00:55:41,914 --> 00:55:45,651
[Minuk] My record is 16 wins,
12 by KO, and 1 loss.

1170
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:49,422
I got the nickname "Snyper"

1171
00:55:49,489 --> 00:55:51,824
because I score knockouts
with straight punches.

1172
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:55,161
That's why people started calling me that.

1173
00:55:55,228 --> 00:55:57,096
I'll show you
how I made a name for myself.

1174
00:55:57,163 --> 00:55:59,766
Come on then, bring it on.
I'll finish you off, sir.

1175
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:03,169
KIM MINUK VERSUS KIM TAESUN

1176
00:56:03,803 --> 00:56:04,971
This is going to be good.

1177
00:56:05,037 --> 00:56:07,273
I'm going to get a closer look.

1178
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,608
You don't see this every day.

1179
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:11,744
[chuckles]

1180
00:56:13,846 --> 00:56:16,816
-There's an age gap, so who knows?
-Right.

1181
00:56:16,883 --> 00:56:18,918
Kim Minuk has his moves,
so you never know.

1182
00:56:18,985 --> 00:56:20,620
One of them is gonna take a serious hit.

1183
00:56:20,686 --> 00:56:23,122
I feel like Taesun might take a hit.

1184
00:56:24,056 --> 00:56:25,725
I don't know. We'll have to see.

1185
00:56:25,792 --> 00:56:27,627
[contestant sighs] This is intense.

1186
00:56:28,995 --> 00:56:30,062
[sighs]

1187
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:33,566
All right, Ring No. 6.

1188
00:56:34,133 --> 00:56:35,268
Why am I feeling nervous?

1189
00:56:36,803 --> 00:56:37,870
[Minuk clears throat]

1190
00:56:40,473 --> 00:56:41,641
-Box.
-[bell rings]

Even the air feels heavier.

1193
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:59,859
[contestants exclaiming]

1194
00:57:02,862 --> 00:57:04,130
It's fine. He rolled with it.

1195
00:57:07,834 --> 00:57:10,736
-[grunting]
-His defense is solid.

1196
00:57:10,803 --> 00:57:12,505
He's not missing anything.

1197
00:57:13,172 --> 00:57:15,208
-Watch out for body shots.
-[contestants exclaim]

1198
00:57:15,274 --> 00:57:17,009
-Watch out for body shots.
-[contestants exclaim]

1199
00:57:17,076 --> 00:57:19,111
-That was a clean hit.
-That's Snyper for you.

1200
00:57:20,413 --> 00:57:21,647
He's totally composed.

1201
00:57:22,415 --> 00:57:23,816
He's like, "Come at me."

1202
00:57:23,883 --> 00:57:25,318
[contestants exclaiming]

1203
00:57:27,753 --> 00:57:29,255
He's making it fun.

1204
00:57:29,322 --> 00:57:30,389
[contestant laughs]

1205
00:57:35,094 --> 00:57:36,262
Man, that's a good punch.

1206
00:57:37,864 --> 00:57:38,931
That's insane.

1207
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,533
He's still got it.

1208
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,401
-Those punches sound like gunshots.
-Yeah.

1209
00:57:42,468 --> 00:57:44,871
I think Minuk's punches are more powerful.

1210
00:57:51,477 --> 00:57:52,945
-He just plants it in.
-He's fast.

1211
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:55,314
Man, Kim Taesun's good.

1212
00:57:55,815 --> 00:57:58,618
I took a hit to the body. It hurt.

1213
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:01,254
I let my guard down
for a split second and got hit

1214
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,023
just as I was inhaling.

1215
00:58:06,626 --> 00:58:07,727
[grunting]

1216
00:58:10,563 --> 00:58:11,964
That'll knock you out for real.

1217
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:13,699
I told you, it'll knock you out.

1218
00:58:13,766 --> 00:58:15,801
If Taesun keeps going like that,
he'll win.

1219
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:19,805
I already knew his style,
so I knew he'd stay guarded.

1220
00:58:20,373 --> 00:58:22,742
I came in strong from the start,

1221
00:58:22,808 --> 00:58:25,511
aiming to break through his guard.

1222
00:58:27,813 --> 00:58:30,516
-[contestants exclaiming]
-Good shot.

1223
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:32,351
He cut him off with a single punch.

1224
00:58:32,418 --> 00:58:33,452
[grunting]

1225
00:58:33,953 --> 00:58:35,688
[contestants exclaiming]

1226
00:58:36,622 --> 00:58:39,992
[Minuk] That's actually my best position,
when I'm up against the ropes.

1227
00:58:40,059 --> 00:58:42,361
I studied his punches. The angles,

1228
00:58:42,428 --> 00:58:45,665
what he was good at, and so on.

1229
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,333
I sized him up right then and there.

1230
00:58:50,836 --> 00:58:52,471
[contestant] He's reading him like a book.

1231
00:58:52,538 --> 00:58:53,573
That's insane.

1232
00:58:55,841 --> 00:58:56,976
That's a good punch.

1233
00:58:57,777 --> 00:59:00,179
His shots are as sharp as a razor.

1234
00:59:00,246 --> 00:59:01,647
He puts weight behind each one.

1235
00:59:01,714 --> 00:59:03,215
[contestants exclaiming]

1236
00:59:03,783 --> 00:59:05,451
No way. Just like that?

1237
00:59:06,185 --> 00:59:07,753
[exclaims, chuckles]

1238
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,589
God, Kim Minuk is good.

1239
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:14,193
Once you're cornered, you're in trouble.

1240
00:59:16,395 --> 00:59:17,863
He's reading all his moves.

1241
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,032
He's copying his moves.

1242
00:59:22,702 --> 00:59:24,136
His punches are really crisp.

1243
00:59:24,203 --> 00:59:25,671
They're landing perfectly.

1244
00:59:25,738 --> 00:59:27,306
You can see the precision.

1245
00:59:27,373 --> 00:59:28,641
His class really shows.

1246
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:30,343
He's going toe-to-toe
with the current champ.

1247
00:59:33,245 --> 00:59:34,714
Look at him dodge to the side.

1248
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:36,549
-[grunts]
-[exclaims]

1249

-[contestants exclaiming]
-[gasps]

1250
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:42,388
That's high-class boxing.

1251
00:59:46,892 --> 00:59:48,427
That body shot was awesome.

1252
00:59:49,328 --> 00:59:50,630
This is fun!

1253
00:59:50,696 --> 00:59:52,164
How cool.

1254
00:59:52,231 --> 00:59:53,799
Wow, boxing is really cool.

1255
00:59:55,201 --> 00:59:57,103
-[bell rings]
-[contestants exclaiming, applauding]

1256
00:59:57,169 --> 00:59:59,005
[announcer] <i>The fight is over.</i>

1257
01:00:02,041 --> 01:00:03,342
[chuckling] This was super fun.

1258
01:00:03,409 --> 01:00:06,145
It feels like we should be paying
to watch this.

1259
01:00:06,912 --> 01:00:09,815
There's no way we're watching
something this good for free.

1260
01:00:09,882 --> 01:00:11,250
That's true.

1261
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:13,352
All right, I'll pay. Who do I pay?

1262
01:00:13,419 --> 01:00:14,453
[contestants laughing]

1263
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,955
[Dex] I dare say,

1264
01:00:16,022 --> 01:00:19,158
this might've been the best boxing match
I've ever seen in my life.

1265
01:00:19,225 --> 01:00:21,060
[contestants exclaiming, applauding]

1266
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,830
[Dex] That was a top-class fight.

1267
01:00:24,897 --> 01:00:27,767
[chuckling] I think we should give him
some time to think.

1268
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,835
-This must be a tough call.
-This is tough.

1269
01:00:29,902 --> 01:00:31,737
-I can't tell who'll win.
-[contestant laughs]

1270
01:00:31,804 --> 01:00:33,506
Both of them were incredible.

1271
01:00:33,572 --> 01:00:34,640
I honestly can't tell.

1272
01:00:34,707 --> 01:00:35,708
Okay.

1273
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:38,044
The winner of this match is…

1274
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,178
Kim Minuk.

1275
01:00:39,245 --> 01:00:40,646
Kim Taesun, right?

1276
01:00:40,713 --> 01:00:41,714
Let's see.

1277
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:43,115
[♪ tense music plays]

1278
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:49,121
-Kim Minuk from the red corner.
-[contestant exclaims]

1279
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:51,957
-[Lee] Kim Minuk from the red corner.
-[contestant exclaims]

1280
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:54,393
RED CORNER KIM MINUK SURVIVES

1281
01:00:57,697 --> 01:00:59,065
He took out an active fighter.

1282
01:00:59,732 --> 01:01:00,933
[Minuk] I've still got it.

1283
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,402
My punches still pack a serious punch.

1284
01:01:03,469 --> 01:01:05,538
I'll take the win for Round 2 as well.

1285
01:01:05,604 --> 01:01:07,640
And the championship, for that matter.

1286
01:01:08,607 --> 01:01:10,109
Wow, here's Group 2.

1287
01:01:10,176 --> 01:01:11,243
Looking forward to this.

1288
01:01:12,678 --> 01:01:14,480
[contestants exclaiming]

1289
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:15,781
Who's that?

1290
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,352
-That's so cool.
-They look awesome.

1291
01:01:22,988 --> 01:01:25,391
-It's Hong Junyoung.
-[contestants exclaim]

1292
01:01:26,025 --> 01:01:27,359
Oh, this looks like fun.

1293
01:01:28,027 --> 01:01:29,095
What? Seriously?

1294
01:01:29,161 --> 01:01:31,097
Look at that. This is gonna be fire.

1295
01:01:32,498 --> 01:01:34,467
MYUNG HYUNMAN VERSUS JUNG DAWOON

1296
01:01:34,533 --> 01:01:35,935
Is that Yoon Hyeongbin?

1297
01:01:36,001 --> 01:01:37,803
Wow, he's something else.

1298
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,905
I'm super curious about O3ohn.

1299
01:01:39,972 --> 01:01:42,541
These matchups look like real pro matches.

1300
01:01:43,109 --> 01:01:44,543
Ring No. 8's going to be wild.

1301
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:46,746
Those two are gonna go at it.

1302
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,881
He's a Black C*mbat fighter?

1303
01:01:48,948 --> 01:01:49,982
PARK SEONGJUN
"UNDERDOG"

1304
01:01:51,517 --> 01:01:52,551
He never loses.

1305
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,453
That's what makes him so cool.

1306
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,621
JAEIL
LA BOXER

1307
01:01:57,623 --> 01:01:59,091
[Dex] What's with the push-ups?

1308
01:01:59,158 --> 01:02:00,993
-Look at them.
-What's up with that?

1309
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:02,228
Hey, stop that.

1310
01:02:02,795 --> 01:02:04,930
-You'll tire yourselves out.
-[Lee] Save your energy.

1311
01:02:04,997 --> 01:02:07,032
-Those power punchers.
-They're bodybuilders.

1312
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,303
The fight I'd like to see first is…

1313
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:12,438
Ring No. 4.

1314
01:02:12,505 --> 01:02:14,707

01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:16,675
LEE CHAEHYUN VERSUS JAEIL

1316
01:02:16,742 --> 01:02:18,511
-Let's go!
-Go, Lee Chaehyun!

1317
01:02:18,577 --> 01:02:20,513
Let's do this, Chaehyun!

1318
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:21,981
-Salute!
-All right!

1319
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:26,685
Hello, I'm Lee Chaehyun,

1320
01:02:26,752 --> 01:02:30,456
an amateur boxer with the KAFAC,
24 years old.

1321
01:02:30,523 --> 01:02:32,825
In 2024, I ranked first
in the under-67kg division

1322
01:02:32,892 --> 01:02:35,094
at the Korean Boxing
Association Championship.

1323
01:02:35,594 --> 01:02:39,331
My style's the complete opposite
of most professional fighters.

1324
01:02:39,398 --> 01:02:42,902
They struggle to land clean shots,
but it's easier for me to connect.

1325
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:45,571
That's why they call me the "Pro Killer."

1326
01:02:45,638 --> 01:02:48,440
-Chaehyun's good.
-He's almost national-team level.

1327
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:51,377
He's with KAFAC.
He could join the national team.

1328
01:02:51,443 --> 01:02:52,444
Yeah.

1329
01:02:53,078 --> 01:02:54,713
Jaeil will do better.

1330
01:02:55,214 --> 01:02:56,515
-Jaeil?
-Yeah, he's good.

1331
01:02:56,582 --> 01:02:57,583
He's amazing.

1332
01:02:58,117 --> 01:03:00,486
[Jaeil] My name is Jalen
and I'm from the US.

1333
01:03:01,053 --> 01:03:02,988
My Korean name is "Jaeil."

1334
01:03:03,055 --> 01:03:05,825
I'm currently preparing
for my pro debut in Korea.

1335
01:03:05,891 --> 01:03:08,794
[in English] A counterpuncher is
like Floyd Mayweather.

1336
01:03:08,861 --> 01:03:09,862
[exclaims]

1337
01:03:09,929 --> 01:03:14,700
Korean professional boxers
disregard the boxing fundamentals.

1338
01:03:14,767 --> 01:03:17,870
I think I can beat
all of the pro boxers in Korea.

1339
01:03:18,437 --> 01:03:20,372
[in Korean] I am the best of the best.

1340
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:23,142
I bet he has a secret weapon.

1341
01:03:23,642 --> 01:03:26,712
It'll all come down
to timing and explosiveness.

1342
01:03:27,313 --> 01:03:29,048
Why am I shaking here?

1343
01:03:29,114 --> 01:03:30,115
[contestants exclaiming]

1344
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:32,384
-Let's go!
-Let's do this thing!

1345
01:03:32,451 --> 01:03:34,620
Let's begin the match. Box!

1346
01:03:34,687 --> 01:03:36,222
-[bell rings]
-Box!

1347
01:03:36,288 --> 01:03:37,456
[contestants exclaim]

1348
01:03:40,192 --> 01:03:41,293
He's quick.

1349
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,528
He's coming in hot.

1350
01:03:44,063 --> 01:03:45,664
-He's freaking fast!
-[exclaims]

1351
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,669
His punches are insane.

1352
01:03:56,442 --> 01:03:58,377
Dang, it's not landing.

1353
01:03:59,845 --> 01:04:01,747
Jaeil's throwing more punches,

1354
01:04:01,814 --> 01:04:04,049
but it doesn't look like
they're connecting much.

1355
01:04:04,817 --> 01:04:07,219
[Chaehyun] My opponent
had powerful punches.

1356
01:04:07,286 --> 01:04:12,358
But boxing's all about
landing more punches than you take.

1357
01:04:12,424 --> 01:04:13,792
He kept coming at me,

1358
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:16,262
so I figured I'd just counter every time.

1359
01:04:16,328 --> 01:04:18,063
[exclaiming]

1360
01:04:19,999 --> 01:04:21,200
[contestant] Awesome.

1361
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:24,203
[exclaims] He's precise.

1362
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:27,406
[contestants exclaiming]

1363
01:04:27,473 --> 01:04:28,941
His punches are clean.

1364
01:04:29,008 --> 01:04:30,509
He's super fast.

1365
01:04:30,576 --> 01:04:32,344
Great, he's fast.

1366
01:04:34,446 --> 01:04:36,081
-[bell rings]
-[referee] Stop!

1367
01:04:36,148 --> 01:04:37,917
-[contestants exclaiming]
-Yeah!

1368
01:04:37,983 --> 01:04:39,952
RED CORNER LEE CHAEHYUN SURVIVES

1369
01:04:40,019 --> 01:04:41,487
-Wow, he's good.
-[Jaeil] Yeah.

1370
01:04:41,553 --> 01:04:43,989
-What a shame. He's good, you know.
-Such a shame.

1371
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:47,092
The matches just keep getting better.

1372
01:04:48,227 --> 01:04:51,196
We're in for a thrilling,
action-packed match this time.

1373
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:55,100
He's one of the hottest fighters
from MMA’s Black C*mbat right now.

1374
01:04:55,167 --> 01:04:57,269
Park Seongjun. [exclaims]

1375
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:58,971
-Underdog.
-Underdog.

1376
01:04:59,038 --> 01:05:00,306
-From Black C*mbat.
-Yeah.

1377
01:05:00,372 --> 01:05:01,540
Let's go, Underdog!

1378
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:02,741
He's pretty famous.

1379
01:05:03,976 --> 01:05:05,544
I hear he's really good.

1380
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:08,147
[Dex] Park Seongjun is a star player
at Black C*mbat.

1381
01:05:08,213 --> 01:05:11,617
I think his grit might be
the reason he's so popular.

1382
01:05:11,684 --> 01:05:14,520
Facing him is a gold medalist
at the National Sports Festival.

1383
01:05:15,187 --> 01:05:16,255
Whoa.

1384
01:05:16,322 --> 01:05:18,757
[Lee] An elite boxer, Kuk Seungjun.

1385
01:05:19,591 --> 01:05:21,727
He's a National Sports Festival medalist?

1386
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:23,462
Whoa, that means he's good.

1387
01:05:23,529 --> 01:05:24,863
[Lee] Let's see Ring No. 8.

1388
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:26,265
[exclaims]

1389
01:05:26,332 --> 01:05:27,967
[contestant]
Whoa, they look great up there.

1390
01:05:28,534 --> 01:05:31,236
Kuk Seungjun is really tall, I see.

1391
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:33,605
[Sungwoon] Oh, the good-looking guy?

1392
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:37,609
Kuk Seungjun?

1393
01:05:40,446 --> 01:05:42,247
At first, I thought he was a K-pop idol.

1394
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:43,782
He's got a handsome face,

1395
01:05:43,849 --> 01:05:45,818
and it felt like I'd seen him on TV.

1396
01:05:45,884 --> 01:05:47,987
He's got a chiseled face.

1397
01:05:48,053 --> 01:05:49,822
I bet he got cast for his looks.

1398
01:05:49,888 --> 01:05:51,757
He's just so handsome.

1399
01:05:53,058 --> 01:05:54,393
[Seongjun]
First of all, he's so good-looking.

1400
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:57,129
His face is just…
It left me speechless for a second.

1401
01:05:57,196 --> 01:05:58,530
I thought he was an actor.

1402
01:05:59,098 --> 01:06:00,899
Part of me thought I got lucky

1403
01:06:00,966 --> 01:06:03,736
because he seemed like an easy opponent.

1404
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:10,342
I'm Park Seongjun, an MMA fighter

1405
01:06:10,409 --> 01:06:13,078
also known as "Underdog."

1406
01:06:13,145 --> 01:06:18,017
It's the same with pro boxers.
The stronger one wins in the end.

1407
01:06:18,584 --> 01:06:20,185
If we're talking pure boxing,

1408
01:06:20,252 --> 01:06:22,721
I think he'll be easy prey.

1409
01:06:23,222 --> 01:06:24,857
I'll show everything I've got

1410
01:06:24,923 --> 01:06:27,926
in this match, without fail.

1411
01:06:27,993 --> 01:06:30,596
KUK SEUNGJUN VERSUS PARK SEONGJUN

1412
01:06:30,662 --> 01:06:33,866
-An MMA fighter versus a boxer, huh?
-Right.

1413
01:06:33,932 --> 01:06:37,069
The thing is,
Seungjun doesn't take hits well.

1414
01:06:37,136 --> 01:06:38,670
MMA fighters are at a disadvantage.

1415
01:06:38,737 --> 01:06:40,205
I'm curious to see how he fights.

1416
01:06:41,807 --> 01:06:44,877
[contestant]
Wow, I have a feeling this will be fire.

1417
01:06:45,778 --> 01:06:47,446
Ring No. 8, box!

1418
01:06:47,513 --> 01:06:48,514
[bell rings]

1419
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,581
Box!

1420
01:06:49,648 --> 01:06:51,517
-[bell rings]
-[shouts]

1421
01:06:52,985 --> 01:06:53,986
[contestants chattering]

1422
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:56,155
He's going straight in.

1423
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,222
[contestants groan]

1424
01:06:57,289 --> 01:06:59,124
He can attack, all right.

1425
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:01,360
I knew it, he's fiery.

1426
01:07:01,927 --> 01:07:03,595
-Whoa.
-That's it.

1427
01:07:03,662 --> 01:07:04,897
That's how he cuts in.

1428
01:07:05,597 --> 01:07:07,232
See? He's coming in strong.

1429
01:07:07,299 --> 01:07:08,667
That's the only way.

1430
01:07:08,734 --> 01:07:10,169
This could be over in no time.

1431
01:07:11,603 --> 01:07:12,604
Man, he's fast.

1432
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:14,073
Oh, nice.

1433
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:15,808
Wow, he's not backing off.

1434
01:07:17,342 --> 01:07:18,710
[contestant] That's insane.

1435
01:07:22,281 --> 01:07:23,582
Whoa, he's stumbling.

1436
01:07:29,188 --> 01:07:30,222
He's strong.

1437
01:07:30,289 --> 01:07:31,857
Looks like he wants to knock him out.

1438
01:07:33,725 --> 01:07:35,160
[exclaims] How is he so good?

1439
01:07:35,227 --> 01:07:37,062
He's showing what real boxing is.

1440
01:07:38,697 --> 01:07:39,932
It's heating up, all right.

1441
01:07:39,998 --> 01:07:41,133
-Ooh.
-This is it.

1442
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:45,037
I love how Seungjun
didn't back down one bit, like a pro.

1443
01:07:45,104 --> 01:07:46,305
Oh, that body shot.

1444
01:07:47,339 --> 01:07:48,407
[exclaims]

1445
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:50,309
He's got more to show.

1446
01:07:51,243 --> 01:07:54,513
[Seungjun]
MMA fighters usually keep a wider guard.

1447
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:57,282
I first aimed for the left body shot,

1448
01:07:57,349 --> 01:08:00,819
which landed perfectly
and opened up the other side.

1449
01:08:01,987 --> 01:08:03,722
Medalists sure are different.

1450
01:08:07,693 --> 01:08:08,861
[contestants exclaim, chatter]

1451
01:08:08,927 --> 01:08:10,028
He's crushing him.

1452
01:08:10,095 --> 01:08:11,530
His body shots are sharp.

1453
01:08:13,699 --> 01:08:14,900
[contestants exclaim]

1454
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:18,003
-He keeps going for his body.
-Like he's a punching bag.

1455
01:08:18,737 --> 01:08:20,139
He's taking too many body shots.

1456
01:08:20,205 --> 01:08:21,940
He's taken quite a few blows.

1457
01:08:22,007 --> 01:08:25,444
If I'd taken hits like that,
I'd be down already.

1458
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:29,815
Wow, another one.

1459
01:08:33,485 --> 01:08:35,487
Wow, that one must've stung.

1460
01:08:36,522 --> 01:08:38,157
-[bell rings]
-[referee] Stop!

1461
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:42,294
-To your corners.
-[announcer] <i>The fight is over.</i>

1462
01:08:42,361 --> 01:08:43,662
He's got great body shots.

1463
01:08:44,062 --> 01:08:46,532
He's got the reach to hit from a distance.

1464
01:08:46,598 --> 01:08:47,599
He's so cool.

1465
01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:54,339
I think these two just gave us
the most explosive match yet.

1466
01:08:54,406 --> 01:08:55,807
Yeah, as expected.

1467
01:08:55,874 --> 01:08:57,309
[Seongjun] I got pounded good.

1468
01:08:57,376 --> 01:09:00,679
Made me wonder if this was the difference
between boxing and MMA.

1469
01:09:02,514 --> 01:09:04,983
The survivor of this match is…

1470
01:09:05,551 --> 01:09:07,786
Kuk Seungjun from the red corner.

1471
01:09:09,421 --> 01:09:10,556
Congratulations.

1472
01:09:13,392 --> 01:09:17,129
[Seongjun] I thought he was just an actor
who boxed for fun.

1473
01:09:17,696 --> 01:09:19,364
But turns out he's the real deal.

1474
01:09:19,431 --> 01:09:20,566
I got pummeled out there.

1475
01:09:25,904 --> 01:09:28,840
[Lee] The ring I'm choosing next is…

1476
01:09:29,408 --> 01:09:31,009
[contestant 1] Yoon Hyeongbin, perhaps?

1477
01:09:31,743 --> 01:09:33,312
[contestant 2] Come on, Ring No. 6.

1478
01:09:33,378 --> 01:09:37,015
Comedian-turned-MMA-fighter Yoon Hyeongbin

1479
01:09:37,983 --> 01:09:41,720
and rising pro boxer Kim Jaewon.

1480
01:09:41,787 --> 01:09:44,122
Let's watch their match next.

1481
01:09:44,189 --> 01:09:45,724
YOON HYEONGBIN VERSUS KIM JAEWON

1482
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:46,825
This is gonna be fun.

1483
01:09:47,292 --> 01:09:49,127
-Hyeongbin's amazing.
-Awesome.

1484
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:52,130
Let's do this!

1485
01:09:52,197 --> 01:09:53,832
[cheering]

1486
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:54,900
Go, man!

1487
01:09:56,268 --> 01:09:58,237
Officially speaking,

1488
01:09:58,303 --> 01:10:01,340
I've got a 100% win rate
and a 100% KO rate.

1489
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,775
I'm the real <i>One-Punch Man</i>.

1490
01:10:03,842 --> 01:10:05,510
Brush my fist and you hit the deck.

1491
01:10:06,745 --> 01:10:09,514
I always win with my punches.

1492
01:10:09,581 --> 01:10:12,551
As a fighter, I believe I can beat anyone.

1493
01:10:12,618 --> 01:10:13,785
I'm confident.

1494
01:10:15,487 --> 01:10:16,822
[Jaewon] My punch hits different.

1495
01:10:16,888 --> 01:10:18,890
No one else can compare.

1496
01:10:20,492 --> 01:10:22,561
I've got one-hit power.

1497
01:10:22,628 --> 01:10:25,397
My fists may be smaller,
but I can take someone out in one shot.

1498
01:10:25,864 --> 01:10:27,432
He's quite strong, actually.

1499
01:10:27,899 --> 01:10:29,468
It's a one-punch kind of match, huh?

1500
01:10:29,534 --> 01:10:30,535
You're right.

1501
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:32,271
[Lee] Ring No. 2.

1502
01:10:33,639 --> 01:10:34,906
Box.

1503
01:10:34,973 --> 01:10:35,974
Box.

1504
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:37,042
[bell rings]

1505
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:38,277
-Yeah!
-Box!

1506
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:40,545
They're going at it right away.

1507
01:10:47,552 --> 01:10:48,553
Break!

1508
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,688
He's clinching.

1509
01:10:50,589 --> 01:10:51,590
Box!

1510
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:55,093
That looks like holding and hitting.

1511
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,896
-The clinch?
-That's a dirty boxing move.

1512
01:11:00,232 --> 01:11:01,800
Holding and hitting.

1513
01:11:02,267 --> 01:11:04,069
It's giving MMA vibes.

1514
01:11:04,136 --> 01:11:06,305
Fighting like that
will tire out your opponent fast.

1515
01:11:06,872 --> 01:11:09,574
[Hyeongbin]
That was just a part of the plan.

1516
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:11,443
Start from mid-range,

1517
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,878
go straight into a clinch,

1518
01:11:12,944 --> 01:11:14,579
wear him down, then break away.

1519
01:11:15,414 --> 01:11:16,915
Clinches really wear you out.

1520
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:18,116
-They do.
-Yes.

1521
01:11:18,984 --> 01:11:20,352
He isn't giving him an opening.

1522
01:11:22,187 --> 01:11:25,457
[Jaewon] I wanted to keep my distance
and control the exchanges,

1523
01:11:25,524 --> 01:11:28,493
but he kept clinching and hammering me.

1524
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,862
It felt like I couldn't show my skills.

1525
01:11:30,929 --> 01:11:31,930
Break.

1526
01:11:32,397 --> 01:11:33,598
He needs to move first.

1527
01:11:36,368 --> 01:11:37,402
[contestants exclaim]

1528
01:11:38,236 --> 01:11:39,905
Whoa, he's as strong as expected.

1529
01:11:39,971 --> 01:11:41,540
Dang, his punches.

1530
01:11:41,606 --> 01:11:43,275
He's going for it.

1531
01:11:43,842 --> 01:11:44,843
He took a hit.

1532
01:11:46,044 --> 01:11:48,447
Whoa, his power's no joke.

1533
01:11:52,384 --> 01:11:53,585
Keep going!

1534
01:11:57,622 --> 01:11:59,124
[contestants exclaim]

1535
01:11:59,191 --> 01:12:00,392
He keeps grabbing him.

1536
01:12:02,394 --> 01:12:03,762
Hyeongbin, let's go!

1537
01:12:03,829 --> 01:12:04,996
-Come on!
-That body shot!

1538
01:12:05,464 --> 01:12:07,599
That one landed.

1539
01:12:11,837 --> 01:12:14,272
Looks like Hyeongbin is getting tired.

1540
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,043
[bell rings]

1541
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:19,111
Stop!

1542
01:12:19,177 --> 01:12:20,479
[contestants applauding]

1543
01:12:20,545 --> 01:12:22,047
Who do you think will win?

1544
01:12:22,114 --> 01:12:23,982
[Lee sighs]

1545
01:12:24,449 --> 01:12:26,017
Who's he going to pick?

1546
01:12:26,818 --> 01:12:29,521
His clinch was solid, though.

1547
01:12:30,188 --> 01:12:33,125
It definitely threw the other off a bit.

1548
01:12:33,191 --> 01:12:35,394
How was the match, Jaewon?

1549
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,397
Honestly, I could've done more.

1550
01:12:38,463 --> 01:12:40,565
-[chuckling]
-I really think I could've won.

1551
01:12:40,632 --> 01:12:43,201
I just got caught up in too many clinches.
I could've won.

1552
01:12:43,268 --> 01:12:45,203
-[laughing]
-That's honest of him.

1553
01:12:46,304 --> 01:12:49,408
I think clinching is
a skill in its own right.

1554
01:12:49,474 --> 01:12:51,543
-Yes, you're right.
-Right, right.

1555
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:54,379
[Lee] The winner of this match is…

1556
01:13:00,786 --> 01:13:02,521

It's like a bodybuilding contest.

1566
01:13:24,342 --> 01:13:26,912
What are they? Sports models?

1567
01:13:26,978 --> 01:13:28,146
Wow, amazing.

1568
01:13:28,213 --> 01:13:29,915
Which coconut shoulders will win?

1569
01:13:29,981 --> 01:13:31,917
-Box.
-Box!

-[exclaims]
-Whoa, they're good.

1572
01:13:38,523 --> 01:13:40,926
He's taking multiple uppercuts!

1573
01:13:40,992 --> 01:13:42,360
Are those abs made of iron?

1574
01:13:42,427 --> 01:13:43,595
He's done.

1575
01:13:43,662 --> 01:13:45,297
Park Youngho is really feisty.

1576
01:13:45,363 --> 01:13:47,466
[Lee]
Park Youngho from the red corner wins.

1577
01:13:47,933 --> 01:13:49,534

O3OHN VERSUS KIM JONGOH

1580
01:13:53,939 --> 01:13:55,273
He looks like Jung Haein.

1581
01:13:56,074 --> 01:13:57,509
-He's good-looking.
-That's cute.

1582
01:13:58,276 --> 01:13:59,478
O3ohn!

1583
01:14:00,345 --> 01:14:01,847
Ah, a fellow singer.

1584
01:14:01,913 --> 01:14:03,081
[laughs]

1585
01:14:03,148 --> 01:14:05,617
I'll prove why I deserve to be here.

1586
01:14:05,684 --> 01:14:08,520
I'll show you my passion
and drive for boxing.

[bell rings]

1588
01:14:10,555 --> 01:14:11,690
Oh, he's strong.

1589
01:14:12,824 --> 01:14:16,828
That hairstyle and his moves
scream boxer from the '70s!

1590
01:14:20,932 --> 01:14:22,400
Wait, he's good.

1591
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:24,503
Why is he good?

1592
01:14:27,939 --> 01:14:32,544
[Lee] The winner of this match is
O3ohn from the red corner.

1593

1594
01:14:36,515 --> 01:14:37,782
KWON ASOL VERSUS HONG JUNYOUNG

[contestants exclaiming]

1597
01:14:42,153 --> 01:14:43,188
Nice cross.

1598

Nice!

1599
01:14:48,994 --> 01:14:51,530
-Hong Junyoung's got great footwork.
-[exclaiming]

1600
01:14:51,596 --> 01:14:53,431
He's also throwing a lot of punches.

1601
01:14:53,498 --> 01:14:55,433
Kwon Asol's going to tire out soon.

1602
01:14:59,571 --> 01:15:03,108
[Lee]
The winner of this match is Hong Junyoung.

1603
01:15:04,809 --> 01:15:07,145
All right, folks.

1604
01:15:07,212 --> 01:15:10,382

-[exclaims]
-That's a scary sight.

1609
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:19,991
Here we go.

1610
01:15:20,992 --> 01:15:22,193
Better watch this up close.

1611
01:15:23,695 --> 01:15:25,530
Let's watch from up here.

1612
01:15:25,597 --> 01:15:26,998
We can't miss this.

1613
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:28,733
It's the main event!

1614
01:15:29,467 --> 01:15:31,403
Wow, this is incredible.

1615
01:15:32,404 --> 01:15:33,872
You can't see this anywhere else.

1616
01:15:34,339 --> 01:15:36,608
[Lee] Asia's top kickboxer…

1617
01:15:38,543 --> 01:15:40,879
versus one of the U*C’s strongest.

1618
01:15:43,148 --> 01:15:45,750
They're finally facing off.

1619
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:48,587
Incredible. I can't wait to see this.

1620
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:50,455
It's a battle of the monsters.

1621
01:15:50,522 --> 01:15:53,058
-Wish this had a full three rounds.
-[laughing]

1622
01:15:53,124 --> 01:15:55,727
A battle of the two strongest in Korea.

1623
01:15:56,294 --> 01:15:57,295
Who's your pick?

1624
01:15:57,362 --> 01:15:59,831
-I still say Jung Dawoon.
-I honestly can't pick.

1625
01:16:02,233 --> 01:16:04,035
[Dawoon]
Fans debate about it all the time.

1626
01:16:04,102 --> 01:16:07,706
Who'd win between Myung Hyunman
and Jung Dawoon?

1627
01:16:08,273 --> 01:16:10,308
Honestly, I never gave it much thought.

1628
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:12,444
I have the same answer for anyone.

1629
01:16:13,178 --> 01:16:14,913
I'm just on another level.

1630
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:17,649
The difference is astronomical.

1631
01:16:17,716 --> 01:16:20,452
You'd better be ready to give it your all.

1632
01:16:20,518 --> 01:16:24,122
People call me "the old, retired fighter."

1633
01:16:24,189 --> 01:16:27,392
They say I just sell
soy-marinated crabs now.

1634
01:16:27,459 --> 01:16:29,394
But Myung Hyunman is back.

1635
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:31,763
Dawoon, I'm not the kickboxer
you once knew.

1636
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:33,865
Now, I'm just a boxer. So brace yourself.

1637
01:16:34,432 --> 01:16:36,334
[Lee] It's the ultimate showdown.

1638
01:16:38,336 --> 01:16:40,138
-Box!

1641
01:16:49,614 --> 01:16:51,116
It's like watching bears fight.

1642
01:16:57,155 --> 01:16:58,423
They're breaking each other.

1643
01:17:00,025 --> 01:17:01,292
That was slick.

1644
01:17:05,096 --> 01:17:06,598
One of them might actually die.

1645
01:17:06,665 --> 01:17:08,133
Those shots look lethal.

1646
01:17:08,199 --> 01:17:09,801
Right there. That can knock you out.

1647
01:17:09,868 --> 01:17:11,002
That hook knocks you out.

1648
01:17:11,069 --> 01:17:12,070
-Right?
-Yeah.

1649
01:17:13,038 --> 01:17:14,172

1653

He's down!

1654
01:17:28,887 --> 01:17:29,888
He's down.

1655
01:17:31,423 --> 01:17:33,124
-Whoa, I actually flinched.
-Whoa.

1656
01:17:34,426 --> 01:17:36,628
Whoa! No way!

1657
01:17:40,465 --> 01:17:41,866
[Dawoon] I thought I heard a bomb go off.

1658
01:17:44,169 --> 01:17:45,203
He's terrifying.

1659
01:17:47,405 --> 01:17:50,108
He landed that punch right behind the ear.

1660
01:17:50,608 --> 01:17:52,110
-The temporal region.
-Yeah.

1661
01:17:52,177 --> 01:17:53,178
[contestants exclaiming]

1662
01:17:53,244 --> 01:17:54,312
-[referee] Stop!
-[Lee] He's down!

1663
01:17:54,379 --> 01:17:55,480
That was a heavy hit.

1664
01:17:55,547 --> 01:17:56,715
This could end in a KO.

1665
01:17:58,349 --> 01:18:00,752
-Four, five, six…
-[Dawoon] My vision flashed.

1666
01:18:00,819 --> 01:18:01,820
I was stunned.

1667
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,555
I thought, "This is bad."

1668
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:04,823
[contestant] Go, Dawoon!

1669
01:18:07,358 --> 01:18:09,194
The look in Dawoon's eyes has changed.

1670
01:18:10,829 --> 01:18:12,530
One of them is going down for sure.

1671
01:18:13,965 --> 01:18:15,900
-Insane!
-Who do you think will win?

1672
01:18:15,967 --> 01:18:17,635
Oh, it's Jang Hyuk!

1673
01:18:18,136 --> 01:18:21,172
[Hyuk]
How far can I make it on my own two feet?

1674
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:22,741
[contestants exclaim]

1675
01:18:22,807 --> 01:18:24,175
Get in there. Get in there.

1676
01:18:24,642 --> 01:18:26,611
His rhythm's hard to read.

1677
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,013
Do we have bleeding?

1678
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,248
The bleeding won't stop.

1679
01:18:31,149 --> 01:18:32,517
Damn, this place is massive.

1680
01:18:32,584 --> 01:18:34,519
Just how many punching bags are there?

1681
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:35,854
Round 2 is…

1682
01:18:36,654 --> 01:18:38,089
-a team round.
-Keep going!

1683
01:18:38,156 --> 01:18:40,825
[Lee]
The losing team is immediately eliminated.

1684
01:18:40,892 --> 01:18:42,160
-Let's go, guys!
-Run!

1685
01:18:42,227 --> 01:18:43,428
Last one! Come on!

1686
01:18:43,495 --> 01:18:44,562
-Push through!
-[screams]
