At this stage on <i>I Am Boxer</i>,

11
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,934
only four fighters remain in contention.

12
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:36,272
You're basically looking at
the four best boxers

13
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:38,708
in the country.

14
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:41,511
The semifinals will be contested
under boxing rules,

15
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:43,513
eight rounds, three minutes per round.

16
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:46,849
It's eight three-minute rounds, everyone.

That's not something you get through

00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:52,188

19
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:54,090
Well, there was a time I could go

20
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,658
four rounds myself.

-You were too honest.
-[Lee] Unimpressive, huh?

24
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:05,067
These four boxers have fought through
extremely intense competition to get here.

[Jongkook] Hey, you two. [laughing]

42
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:50,646
-[Youngho] Hello, sir.
-Good to see you again.

00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:53,516
-Good to see you, Youngho, Underdog.
-Long time no see.

It's been a while, hasn't it?

45
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:58,821
Personally, I was really sorry
to see you both go.

46
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:02,558
So we've decided to bring you in
for a two-on-two tag team match

-at the semifinals.
-Ah…

-So we're a team?
-That's right.

49
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,631
But before we start the workout,

50
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:09,699
I brought a drink

51
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:11,434
-to boost your energy levels.
-[Youngho, Seongjun cheer]

-[Youngho, Seongjun] Ah…
-Here you go.

54
00:03:15,605 --> 00:03:17,206
-Looks familiar, huh?
-[Youngho, Seongjun] Oh…

55
00:03:17,873 --> 00:03:19,475
-A quick toast?
-[Seongjun] Shall we?

56
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:21,544
-We Koreans never skip a toast, huh?
-[laughing]

57
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:22,812

-[Sungwoon] Yes!

00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:51,641
But before we start,
you haven't eaten yet, right?

71
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:53,042
[Sungwoon] Right, I'm starving.

72
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:56,379
[Dex] You've got to load up on
your protein and carbs before a workout.

73
00:03:56,912 --> 00:03:57,913
[Sungwoon] Hmm.

74
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:00,850
[Sungwoon, Gijun] Mmm.

75
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,019
-Mmm.
-Mmm!

76
00:04:03,085 --> 00:04:04,620
Tastes amazing! Mmm.

77
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:06,522
You're not skipping meals

78
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:08,224
-or anything, are you? [chuckles]
-[exclaims]

79
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,793
If you eat chicken breast all the time,

80
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,662
-you get sick of it pretty fast.
-Hmm.

81
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:14,964
-But this is in noodle form…
-[Sungwoon, Gijun grunt]

82
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:18,601
…so it's great for people
who's sick of eating chicken breast.

83
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,303
Chicken breast can be a bit dry…

84
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:23,005
-[Dex] Right.
-…but not this, since it's in noodle form.

85
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:24,073
It's really good.

86
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:26,175
I kind of want one more,

87
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:28,611
-but I shouldn't overdo it.
-[Dex] Right, one's just right.

88
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:30,613
-Let's do well today.
-[Sungwoon] Hmm.

How are you feeling going into this?

95
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,065
First off, I can see that
Park Youngho has an incredible body.

96
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:50,766
But those muscles are just for show.

97
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,702
I'll deflate them a bit today.

98
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:57,473
People say bodybuilding muscles
are vanity muscles and such,

99
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,943
but I'll show how powerful they really are

100
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,378

Oh, well said.

Ah, things are already heating up
before the bell.

Let's get ready for the special
two-on-two tag team match.

107
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,927
There's a subtle mind game going on.

108
00:05:17,993 --> 00:05:19,762
Neither side knows who's fighting first.

00:05:19,829 --> 00:05:22,365

-[audience exclaims]

110
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:26,402
[Dex] I see. It's those two.

111
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:30,306
[Seungheon] I was wondering
who would be the first to enter the ring.

112
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:33,042
So these two are the opening matchup.

113
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:35,911
[Gyuwon] This is power versus power.

114
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:38,180
It's going to be an explosive fight
from the start.

118
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:48,891
<i>but my punches definitely won't be.</i>

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,056
[Seungheon]
Park Youngho hasn't made the tag yet.

173
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:05,160
PARK YOUNGHO X LEE GIJUN

174
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:09,698
Lee Gijun has good footwork, though.

175
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:12,868
[Gyuwon] Park Youngho won't have much room

176
00:08:12,935 --> 00:08:14,637
-to work against Lee Gijun.
-[audience gasps]

177
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:18,507
[Seungheon] Lee taps the guard up top.

178
00:08:18,574 --> 00:08:20,976
Lands on the body and slides out!

179
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:23,379
-[person 1 gasps]
-[person 2 exclaims]

180
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:25,848
[Gyuwon] Ah.
That was a great hook from Lee Gijun!

181
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:27,650
[exclaims]

182
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,818
[Gyuwon] If he doesn't change his rhythm
with confidence,

183
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,587
he's just going to sink deeper.

184
00:08:31,654 --> 00:08:33,355
[Dex, person exclaim]

185
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:34,423
[Jongkook] Clipped him on the chin.

186
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,625
Youngho can't seem to read Gijun's rhythm.

187
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,995
He's a bit slow, that's the problem.

188
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:44,433
-[person] Hey!
-[Seungheon] Excellent roll right there.

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,435
Now that's a pro boxer!

190
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,571
[clapping]

191
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:50,506
-[Seongjun] Ten seconds!
-[Dex] Ten seconds!

192
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,675
Gijun, circle out of there!

193
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,410
Circle out, circle out!

194
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:56,245
-That's it!
-[audience gasps]

195
00:08:56,845 --> 00:08:58,347
-[Lee] Hey!
-[bell rings]

196
00:08:58,414 --> 00:08:59,415
Stop!

197
00:08:59,481 --> 00:09:01,050
[Seungheon] And the first round has ended!

198
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:04,753
-Youngho went one whole round.
-He did.

199
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,422
Youngho's got solid stamina.

200
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:09,224
Looks like he decided
to go the full round.

201
00:09:09,291 --> 00:09:11,026
I never thought
I'd see a match like this in Korea.

202
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,094
Huh?

203
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:13,629
-This is pretty fun.
-Yeah.

204
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,332
[Gyuwon] Just looking at the first round,

205
00:09:16,398 --> 00:09:20,636
you can tell both corners came in
with very different strategies.

206
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:24,139
I'm curious to see
which approach will pay off.

207
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:27,843
Sungwoon, you go out first,
empty the tank, then tag out!

208
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,012
[Jongkook] I think he's done for the day.

209
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:31,814
-Can I tag out in 30 seconds?
-[Jongkook laughs]

210
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,148
Make that one minute!

211
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:34,650
Just one minute, man!

212
00:09:34,717 --> 00:09:36,118
-That's a bit much, sir!
-[laughs]

213
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:38,787
[whistle sounds]

214
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,823
-[exclaims, grunts]
-[audience] Oh!

215
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:41,957
[audience laughs]

216
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:43,559
-[exclaims, grunts]
-[audience] Oh!

217
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:44,927
[audience laughs]

218
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:48,063
PARK SEONGJUN'S WIFE

219
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:53,235
Nice, nice! That was entertaining!

220
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,537
-[exclaims, grunts]
-[audience] Oh!

221
00:09:55,604 --> 00:09:56,672
[audience laughs]

222
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,742
-[laughs]
-[audience cheering, applauding]

223
00:10:10,686 --> 00:10:12,755
-He wanted to have his own moment.
-[Jongkook] Good.

224
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,823
Nice one, Sungwoon! Now show them! Fight!

225
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:19,161
[Gyuwon] Showing that kind of confidence
in the ring like that…

226
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:21,630
-It's a real gift!
-[bell rings]

227
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:22,998
-[referee] Box!
-[Youngho] Let's go!

228
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:25,567
PARK SEONGJUN X PARK SUNGWOON

229
00:10:25,634 --> 00:10:28,537
[Seungheon] Now, it's Park Sungwoon
versus Park Seongjun!

230
00:10:28,604 --> 00:10:29,672
[Jongkook] All right!

231
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:30,973
[Seungheon] It's speed versus power.

232
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,243
Locked in right now,
he's probing with his punches.

233
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:35,744
-[referee] Break!
-[Seungheon] Park Sungwoon.

234
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,884
-[Dex] Whoa.
-Wow. Nice shot.

235
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,252
[♪ intense music playing]

236
00:10:44,553 --> 00:10:46,255
[Gyuwon]
Park Sungwoon may be a heavyweight,

237
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:49,658
but as you saw just now,
his sense of timing and speed is great.

238
00:10:49,725 --> 00:10:50,726
[Seungheon exclaims]

239
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:52,628
-[Dex] Ooh.
-[Lee] Boy, he keeps getting caught.

240
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,296
[Jongkook] Cover up!

241
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,232
Cover up tight. No, cover up.

242
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,469
[Lee] That's dangerous.
Given his weight, if that lands…

243
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,037
-[audience gasps]
-Hey!

244
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:03,439
Man, this is bad.

245
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,675
Sungwoon, pour everything out! This is it!

246
00:11:06,742 --> 00:11:08,510
There you go! [exclaims]

247
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:10,746
-[Lee] Hey.
-[Dex] Hey, hey.

248
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:14,516
-[Seungheon] That looks dangerous.
-[Dex] That's it, Sungwoon! Doing well!

249
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:16,185
[Lee] He's burning through his energy.

250
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:18,854
-[Dex] Here he goes.
-[Jongkook exclaims]

251
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:20,422
[audience gasps]

252
00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:22,925
[Gyuwon] Those glancing punches
are dangerous if they land!

253
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:24,660
[Dex] Let's go, Park Sungwoon!

254
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,363
[Youngho] Last one, last one!

255
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:30,566
[Dex] Sungwoon, your minute's up!

256
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:32,735
Hey, your minute's up!

257
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:35,137
-[Youngho] Keep it up!
-[audience gasps]

258
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:36,972
-Nice, that's it!
-[audience gasps]

259
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,540
He's coming in blind!

260
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:42,611
[Seungheon] Both fighters are exchanging
punches here while clearly fatigued.

261
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:44,413
[Youngho] No big deal!
Just pillow punches!

262
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,315
He's gassed, man!

263
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:48,250
-[referee] Break, break.
-[audience] Go, Sungwoon!

264
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:49,651
He's totally spent.

265
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:52,988
[Seungheon] Park Sungwoon
doesn't even have the energy

266
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:54,790
to keep his guard up at this point.

267
00:11:56,058 --> 00:11:57,292
Down, down!

268
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:04,233
-[referee] Down! Three, four!
-What? I was just playing it up!

269
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:07,069
-[referee] Five, six!
-[audience laughs]

270
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:09,805
Seven, eight! Come on.

271
00:12:09,872 --> 00:12:11,306
[Jongkook] A knockdown from exhaustion.

272
00:12:11,373 --> 00:12:13,509
-He fell down because he's out of gas.
-[laughing]

273
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:14,910
-That's a down.
-[audience applauding]

274
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:18,413
[Gyuwon] And now,
he's made the smart decision to tag out.

275
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:20,783
Hey, go ahead and tag out!

276
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:22,117
-Tag out.
-[referee] Box!

277
00:12:22,184 --> 00:12:24,987
[Gyuwon] Against a fast fighter
like Park Seongjun, he must've burned

278
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:26,889
a tremendous amount of energy.

279
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,124
[audience exclaiming]

280
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:33,796
Oh, no!

281
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:35,197
-Here he comes.
-[Dex] Great!

282
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:36,665
Here comes the real Park Youngho.

283
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:38,867
-There he is.
-[Jongkook] Right.

284
00:12:38,934 --> 00:12:40,435
-He's revving it up.
-[Lee] Yeah.

285
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,006
[Dex] It's like two bulls are colliding.

286
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,843
Come on! Bring it on!

287
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,878
[Jongkook] Nice, nice. That's it.

288
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:51,413
Pressure him! Don't let him tag out!

289
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:54,416
-[Dex] Hey…
-[audience laughing]

290
00:12:56,885 --> 00:12:58,086
[cheering]

291
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:01,790
-[person] Nice! That's it!
-[Jongkook laughing]

292
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:02,858
[referee] Stop!

293
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,761
[Lee] He tagged out.

294
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:07,996
No!

295
00:13:08,597 --> 00:13:10,632
No, that's it for him!

296
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:13,468
[Jongkook] Now this is entertainment,
all right!

297
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:17,206
[Lee] But Gijun carried the whole round
earlier. He can't just tag out like that.

298
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,175
-[Seungheon] And now Lee Gijun is in!
-[referee] Box!

299
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:21,677
Lee Gijun versus Park Youngho!

300
00:13:21,743 --> 00:13:25,480
[Gyuwon] He's the opponent
Park Youngho struggles with the most.

301
00:13:26,548 --> 00:13:28,283
-[Seungheon] Nice body shot!
-[♪ intense music playing]

302
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,885
[Dex] Gijun, work the body! That's it!

303
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,789
[Lee] Which will it be?
Rhythm or one-shot power?

304
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:38,126
[Seungheon] Lee Gijun is increasing
his punch output to rack up more points.

305
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:40,062
-Now this… Whoa!
-[Gyuwon] Ah!

306
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:43,832
[audience gasps]

307
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:46,568
[Lee]
Gijun has a really unconventional rhythm.

308
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:48,337
[Seungheon]
Lee Gijun is using his footwork

309
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:49,771
to slip away from the punches.

310
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:51,173
[Dex] That's it! Nice body shot!

311
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,708
That landed!

312
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,544
[Gyuwon] Lee Gijun boxes with rhythm.

313
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:59,147
He reads his opponent's rhythm
and doesn't miss a single opening.

314
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:02,017
[Lee] Nice, he's staying right on him.

315
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:07,155
[person] Nice! That's it!

316
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,726
[Dex] Doing well, Gijun! That's it!

317
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:12,761
Gijun's not eating the big shots.

318
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,231
-[Lee] Yes, that's it.
-[tapping]

319
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:18,200
[person] Ten seconds! Ten seconds!

320
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:21,336
[Gyuwon] Last ten seconds!
This is where you score the highest!

321
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,938
They've got to go all out!

322
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:24,206
[Seungheon] Time's almost up!

323
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:25,841
Lee Gijun strikes!

324
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,843

-Park Youngho dips!

325
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,479
-And the match is over!
-[audience applauding]

326
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,416
[Dex] Well fought.

327
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:40,856
I can't even tell which team won.
[chuckles]

328
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:43,058
[Lee] Great job, everyone.

329
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:45,861
Let me announce the result.

330
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:50,032
The winners
of the two-on-two tag team match,

331
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:53,101
by a score of two to one…

332
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,742
-Blue corner, Park Sungwoon and Lee Gijun.
-[audience cheering]

333
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:03,211
BLUE CORNER PARK SUNGWOON, LEE GIJUN WIN

334
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,950
[Jongkook] Thank you, all.
Please give all four fighters a big hand!

335
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:16,325
If the special match was this fun,

336
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:18,360
imagine how good the main bout will be.

337
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:19,795

[Seungjun's sister] I was so nervous
watching him last time.

365
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,801
Isn't he impressive?

366
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:07,636
He's really impressive.

367
00:17:07,702 --> 00:17:09,438

It is Kuk Seungjun!

372
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:29,658
[Gyuwon] He's a fighter
with relentless determination

373
00:17:29,724 --> 00:17:32,194
-and incredible mental toughness.
-[Seungheon] That's right.

374
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:36,364
[Gyuwon] He's got outstanding technique.

375
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:40,435
In mid-range exchanges,
he never gives up an opening,

376
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:42,237
and in his previous six-round bout,

377
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:46,341
he overwhelmed his opponent
with nonstop combos to the very end.

378
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:51,746
So far, he's been inside fighting
the majority of the time.

379
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:55,050
Against opponents with a clear skill gap,

380
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:58,320
he's shown great confidence
working on the inside.

go up against each other.

386

It's tough knowing only one can win.

387
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:25,714

509
00:24:08,022 --> 00:24:09,491
It was really tough.

510
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:12,994
[sighs]

511
00:24:13,595 --> 00:24:15,096
It was really tough back then.

512
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:19,667
That's what you say, that it was tough.

513
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:23,671
But I was grateful
just to be able to keep boxing.

514
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:27,842
If I managed to endure such hardships,

515
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:31,246
I know I should keep moving forward.

516
00:24:31,312 --> 00:24:33,681
Those memories are what keep me going,
so thank you.

517
00:24:35,717 --> 00:24:36,818
[mother] Thank you, son.

518
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:41,089
[sister] Oh, I just had a great idea.

519
00:24:41,155 --> 00:24:44,659
These are the gloves
he's going to wear in the semifinals.

520
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:48,196
Let's write messages on this.

521
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:50,098
Then he'll wear this in the semifinals

522
00:24:50,164 --> 00:24:52,667
and draw strength from us.

523
00:24:52,734 --> 00:24:54,569
[father] I like that. Let's do it.

524
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,608
JJUN, SHINE IN THAT RING!
WE'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU!

525
00:25:05,346 --> 00:25:07,649
[Seungjun] <i>My dad's message said,</i>

526
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:12,220
<i>"You'll forever be</i>
<i>my one and only champion."</i>

527
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,024
<i>I felt bad,</i>
<i>but so grateful at the same time.</i>

528
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:18,092
<i>I think all the emotions</i>
<i>just came flooding in.</i>

529
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:21,729
[sister] Why are you crying?
You're making me sad.

530
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,799
-Comfort him, will you?
-[sniffles]

531
00:25:24,866 --> 00:25:26,100
Go and comfort him.

532
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:31,506
[Seungjun]
<i>These gloves are like a lucky charm.</i>

533
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,678
With them on, I feel like
I could face anything without fear.

534
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,346
JJUN, SHINE IN THAT RING!
WE'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU!

535
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:39,814
MY ONE AND ONLY CHAMP
I LOVE YOU, SON

536
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:40,982
[Seungjun] Mom and Dad,

537
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,619
let's win again
and head to the finals together.

538
00:25:44,686 --> 00:25:45,753
[audience cheering]

539
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:49,924
[Jongkook]
Fighters, prepare for the match.

540
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,895
[Dex] Our blue corner fighter,
Cho Hyunjae,

541
00:25:53,962 --> 00:25:57,231
is clearly on another level
when it comes to tempo.

542
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:00,868
His hard-to-read movement
is his biggest strength.

543
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:03,371
[Jongkook] With Kuk Seungjun
in the red corner,

544
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:05,540
the way he times his body shots
is pure art.

545
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:09,010
[Gyuwon] Both fighters specialize
in three-minute three-round fights.

546
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:10,078
[Seungheon] Exactly.

547
00:26:10,144 --> 00:26:12,780
With this being a three-minute,
eight-round fight,

548
00:26:12,847 --> 00:26:16,150
strategy is going to matter
more than anything today.

549
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:19,020
Throw a lot of feints.
Work the body with a jab.

550
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:22,357
Just try everything at first.
Let's see how he reacts.

551
00:26:22,423 --> 00:26:23,958
-[Jonghoon] He's a lightweight, right?
-Yeah.

552
00:26:24,025 --> 00:26:25,226
[Jonghoon] So he's smaller.

553
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,929
Even so, loading up for a one-shot KO
will only make you swing big

554
00:26:27,996 --> 00:26:29,030
and burn more energy.

555
00:26:29,097 --> 00:26:30,798
-Fight him at his pace.
-Okay.

556
00:26:30,865 --> 00:26:33,034
-[Jonghoon] He's pretty quick, okay?
-Got it.

557
00:26:33,101 --> 00:26:34,168
Who's your bet?

558
00:26:35,336 --> 00:26:38,039
Early on, I can see this guy winning.

559
00:26:38,106 --> 00:26:39,807
-In the later rounds…
-Since he's fast?

560
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:42,543
Yeah, if his stamina holds.

561
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:45,780
[Hyunjae] <i>There's no turning back now.</i>

562
00:26:45,847 --> 00:26:48,816
I'll fight with everything I have

563
00:26:48,883 --> 00:26:50,985
until my white gloves are soaked red.

564
00:26:51,052 --> 00:26:53,021
[Seungjun]
<i>No matter what, I will win today</i>

565
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:56,190
<i>and move a step closer</i>
<i>to that championship belt.</i>

566
00:26:56,257 --> 00:26:57,725
I want my family at the finals,

567
00:26:57,792 --> 00:26:59,160
and I'll make it happen.

568
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:02,430
[Gyuwon] Which fighter
will take control of the flow?

569
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,032
I can't wait to find out.

570
00:27:04,098 --> 00:27:06,834
[Jongkook] The semifinals of<i> I Am Boxer</i>.

571
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:09,937
Let the bout begin!

572
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,873
-[♪ tense music playing]
-[audience cheering]

573
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:18,179
-Box!
-[bell rings]

574
00:27:18,246 --> 00:27:20,381
[Seungheon]
Okay, the first round has begun.

575
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,417
Cho Hyunjae versus Kuk Seungjun.

576
00:27:22,984 --> 00:27:25,420
KUK SEUNGJUN X CHO HYUNJAE

577
00:27:25,486 --> 00:27:26,688
[Seungheon] Kuk's got that long reach.

578
00:27:26,754 --> 00:27:29,023
Even among fighters
in the same weight class,

579
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,426
he's known for his long reach.

580
00:27:33,628 --> 00:27:34,829
[Jihyun] That's it!

581
00:27:34,896 --> 00:27:36,264
Yes, keep going like that!

582
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,066
[Seungheon]
Cho Hyunjae slides out on his footwork.

583
00:27:38,132 --> 00:27:40,201
He's backing out, staying mobile.

584
00:27:40,268 --> 00:27:41,636
Meanwhile, Kuk's pressing inward.

585
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:43,571
-[Jongkook] He's pressing hard.
-[Lee] That's right.

586
00:27:44,072 --> 00:27:45,239
[audience cheering]

587
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:46,874
-[Jonghoon] All right!
-[audience gasps]

588
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:48,076
[Jonghoon] Nice shot!

589
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,877
[audience cheering]

590
00:27:53,781 --> 00:27:55,650
They've traded shots.

591
00:27:56,284 --> 00:27:58,219
[Seungjun]
<i>Cho Hyunjae is exceptionally fast</i>

592
00:27:58,286 --> 00:27:59,987
<i>and excels as an out-boxer,</i>

593
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:02,557
<i>so my strategy was</i>
<i>to add constant forward pressure.</i>

594
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:05,326
-[Seungheon] There it is. He strikes.
-[Jongkook] Ow. Ow.

595
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,161
[Gyuwon] Ah.
Kuk's throwing very aggressively.

596
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,896
-[Jongkook] Whoa, that body shot!
-[Lee] That went in.

597
00:28:08,963 --> 00:28:10,431
-Man, that landed.
-[Jonghoon] Nice, Seungjun!

598
00:28:10,498 --> 00:28:11,499
Well done, Seungjun!

599
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:13,501
-It's only the first round…
-Wait, look.

600
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,036
Kuk Seungjun's doing good.

601
00:28:15,703 --> 00:28:17,472
[Hyunjae's father] Hyunjae, keep circling!

602
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:19,607
-[Hyunjae's mother] Take it slow!
-[Hyunjae's father] Slow down!

603
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:22,944
-That's it!
-[Hyunjae's father] Yes! There you go!

604
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,213
Stay calm! You're doing fine!

605
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,116
[Hyunjae] <i>My strategy is to figure out</i>
<i>exactly how close I need to be</i>

606
00:28:28,182 --> 00:28:29,484
<i>for my shots to land,</i>

607
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,820
<i>and keep moving more.</i>

608
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:36,524
[Gyuwon] Cho Hyunjae is using the ring,
not giving his opponent any openings.

609
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,926
He's circling the ring to pick his shots.

610
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:42,497
Whereas Kuk is holding the center,
constantly driving Lee to the corner.

611
00:28:42,563 --> 00:28:43,831
[Seungheon] All right!

612
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:45,867
[Jonghoon] Yes, that's it! Nice!

613
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:48,069
Great lead hook!

614
00:28:48,136 --> 00:28:49,704
Keep working in the clinch! Yes!

615
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,372
-Go, go!
-Just keep pounding!

616
00:28:54,308 --> 00:28:56,344
-[Jihyun] All right! That's it!
-[audience cheers]

617
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,146
[Hyunjae's father] There you go!

618
00:28:58,212 --> 00:29:01,582
[Jongkook] The range is slightly too short
for Kuk Seungjun.

619
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:03,317
[audience] All right!

620
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:05,486
[audience exclaiming]

621
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:09,690
[Lee] Seungjun should stay put
and plant his feet.

622
00:29:09,757 --> 00:29:11,392
[Jihyun] All right! Keep going!

623
00:29:11,893 --> 00:29:13,628
-That's it!
-[Hyunjae] Nice!

624
00:29:13,694 --> 00:29:15,496
He's an infighter, all right!

625
00:29:15,563 --> 00:29:17,265
-[Jihyun] All right!
-[audience gasps]

626
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:18,332
Nice shot!

627
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:19,700
[Jihyun] One more, one more!

628
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:21,536
His counter landed.

629
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,071
[Jihyun] Yes, that's it!

630
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:26,741
[Seungheon] Another one!

631
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,075
Hyunjae, doing well!

632
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:30,745
-[Jihyun] Hyunjae, you're doing good!
-[Seungheon] Cho Hyunjae…

633
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,713
His shots are landing with great accuracy!

634
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,715
-[Jonghoon] Seungjun, you're doing fine.
-Don't let him out.

635
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:36,450
-Nice.
-Yeah, doing good.

636
00:29:36,517 --> 00:29:39,854
Seungjun shouldn't try to match his speed.

637
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:43,324
He needs to fight like he did
in the opening exchanges.

638
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:46,994
If he tries to match the pace,
his punches start to lag.

639
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:50,665
Yes, that's it!

640
00:29:50,731 --> 00:29:53,267
Man, he swung too big.

641
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,203
[Seungheon] He's going for it.

642
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:57,371
Nice slip-and-rip there!
He's holding his ground!

643
00:29:57,438 --> 00:29:58,439
-And letting it fly!
-[bell rings]

644
00:29:58,506 --> 00:30:00,141
-[referee] Stop!
-[Lee] Hey.

645
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:01,843
[Seungheon] And that concludes the round.

646
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:04,478
[Gyuwon]
That was a really impressive first round.

647
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:08,449
Cho Hyunjae is trying to keep
Kuk Seungjun in check right now

648
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:11,285
with his footwork and punch selection.

649
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:14,088
Meanwhile, Kuk Seungjun is looking
to shut down Cho Hyunjae's momentum

650
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:16,724
with heavy shots, one punch at a time.

651
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,326
[cheering] Well done!

652
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,633
At first,
Cho Hyunjae looked a little rattled.

653
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,935
For about the first minute or so.

654
00:30:28,002 --> 00:30:30,938
But he adjusted quickly
and changed his game plan.

655
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:32,373
He looks more composed now.

656
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,709
Kuk Seungjun felt a bit rushed later on.

657
00:30:34,775 --> 00:30:35,843
Yeah, he was rushing.

658
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,311
Manage your energy,

659
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:39,914
and keep controlling the pace
like you are now.

660
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:41,515
If you pressure him,

661
00:30:41,582 --> 00:30:43,217
he's going to back up and turn out.

662
00:30:43,284 --> 00:30:44,619
That's your moment.

663
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:47,655
Do what you're good at.
Work the lead hand to the body.

664
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:50,691
[Seungjun] <i>Late in the round,</i>
<i>Cho Hyunjae surprised me</i>

665
00:30:50,758 --> 00:30:52,460
<i>by stepping inside my range.</i>

666
00:30:52,526 --> 00:30:55,596
-<i>That actually put me at a disadvantage.</i>
-[♪ tense music playing]

667
00:30:55,663 --> 00:30:58,866
[Seungjun] <i>I kept thinking,</i>
<i>"Do I keep going in and throwing punches?"</i>

668
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:01,969
<i>"Or do I pull back</i>
<i>and fight on the outside?"</i>

669
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:04,238
He's swinging big. Keep that in mind.

670
00:31:04,305 --> 00:31:06,040
You trade with him, you have the edge.

671
00:31:06,107 --> 00:31:07,975
When you land clean and step out,

672
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:09,644
and he chases after you like this.

673
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,545
-That's when he catches you.
-Got it.

674
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:13,848
So don't back straight up.
Slide to the side instead

675
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,449
when you get out. Got it?

676
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:17,084
Stay calm and take it slow.

677
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:18,586
Remember, calm and slow.

678
00:31:18,653 --> 00:31:23,124
This should be tough for both fighters,
given that this is an eight-round fight.

679
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,226
Let's see how they play this second round.

KUK SEUNGJUN X CHO HYUNJAE

-[spectator 1] Go, get in there!
-[spectator 2] Let's go!

684
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:34,535
[Seungheon] Kuk Seungjun's hunting
for something big!

685
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,237
Cho goes to the body and ties him up.

686
00:31:36,804 --> 00:31:38,072
[spectator] That's it!

687
00:31:38,139 --> 00:31:39,440

00:31:45,212 --> 00:31:46,681
[Seungheon] Wow, they're going at it!

691
00:31:46,747 --> 00:31:48,182
[Lee] He's getting caught.

692
00:31:48,249 --> 00:31:49,550
He caught that clean.

693
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,052
[coach] This is your range, you're good!

694
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,920
[Seungheon] Cho Hyunjae is
full-on infighting!

695
00:31:53,688 --> 00:31:55,289
-That's it!
-Add the hook!

696
00:31:55,356 --> 00:31:56,791
<i>He was taller than I'd expected.</i>

697
00:31:56,857 --> 00:31:58,859
<i>My jabs from the outside</i>
<i>just weren't landing,</i>

698
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:01,329
<i>so I figured I'd fight on the inside.</i>

699
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:02,830
[coach] That's it!

700
00:32:02,897 --> 00:32:04,899
-Nice body shot!
-[Hyunjae] All right!

701
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,267
Doing awesome!

702
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:08,135
[coach] Go! Double jab, then hook!

703
00:32:08,202 --> 00:32:10,638
[Jonghoon] Work the body! Go now!

704
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:12,573
[Seungjun] Nice!

705
00:32:13,074 --> 00:32:14,875
-[spectator 1] All right!
-[spectator 2] All right!

706
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:17,478
[Dex] There you go!

707
00:32:17,545 --> 00:32:19,747
[Seungheon] Cho Hyunjae is using
his upper body effectively.

708
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,950
[Jonghoon] Keep it short,
like we practiced earlier!

709
00:32:23,017 --> 00:32:24,352
Short! That's too wide!

710
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:27,321
Seungjun's getting pushed back
even when they trade.

711
00:32:27,388 --> 00:32:28,489
[Jongkook] Yeah, exactly.

712
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,792
[Seungjun] <i>Cho Hyunjae kept fighting me</i>
<i>on the inside</i>

713
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:35,396
<i>even though that's my game.</i>

714
00:32:35,463 --> 00:32:37,932
<i>I think that shook me mentally.</i>

715
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,233
[Seungjun supporter] You got this!

716
00:32:39,967 --> 00:32:42,536
[Lee] Seungjun needs to keep calm.
He shouldn't get worked up.

717
00:32:42,603 --> 00:32:44,271
-[Dex] He's looking a bit heated.
-[Lee] Right.

719
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,842
-That's it!
-Here he comes!

720
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:49,310
[coach] Nice! Well done!

721
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:52,013
[Seungheon] Cho Hyunjae is charging
forward aggressively now.

722
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,748
To the body, then the head.

723
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:56,951
[Gyuwon] You can clearly see
Kuk Seungjun's punches are getting wider.

724
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,487
It shows that Cho Hyunjae's game plan

725
00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:01,889
-is working exactly as intended.
-[Seungheon] Yes.

726
00:33:02,623 --> 00:33:04,425
-Take it slow!
-[Jonghoon] You're doing fine!

727
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:06,994
[Seungheon] Nice lead hand… Oh!

728
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:08,629
Cho has taken a big one!

[♪ intense music playing]

730
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:14,035
[Gyuwon] Cho is being
very expressive on the ring,

731
00:33:14,101 --> 00:33:16,370
and in doing so,
he's taking control of the fight.

732
00:33:16,437 --> 00:33:18,639
More often than not,
Kuk Seungjun reacts to that.

733
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:21,509
-Hence, the bigger movements.
-[Seungheon] That's right.

734
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:23,210
[Jonghoon] And a lead hook!
End it with a hook!

735
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:24,945
-That's it!
-Man, Cho Hyunjae is fast.

736
00:33:25,012 --> 00:33:26,013
He's good.

737
00:33:27,148 --> 00:33:28,849

00:33:36,023 --> 00:33:37,291
[Dex] That body shot just landed.

743
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:38,959
-Yes, keep that up!
-Let's go, go!

You got this, Seungjun!

751
00:33:56,644 --> 00:33:58,012
He's real sharp tonight.

752
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:02,149
[Lee] It feels like the fight is unfolding
exactly the way Hyunjae planned it.

753
00:34:02,216 --> 00:34:04,485
[Hyunjae] <i>Strategically,</i>
<i>things worked out really well for me.</i>

754
00:34:04,552 --> 00:34:07,121
<i>The momentum started to swing my way.</i>

755
00:34:08,689 --> 00:34:10,224
When you swing big, you wobble.

-You've got to work the body.
-Got it.

757

<i>in my favor either.</i>

758
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:17,932
I remember thinking,

759
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:20,067
"If this keeps up, I'm going to lose."

-He won't go down.

00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,609
-[Dex] Yeah, they both did well.
-Both of them.

841
00:37:48,676 --> 00:37:50,611
You know what you need to do right now?

842
00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:52,646
Just keep doing what you're doing now.

843
00:37:52,713 --> 00:37:54,515
-Got it.
-Manage your energy, fight bold,

844
00:37:54,581 --> 00:37:55,749
and leave no regrets.

845
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:57,251
[Seungjun] <i>From the fourth round on,</i>

846
00:37:57,318 --> 00:38:01,055
<i>I felt like I needed to put</i>
<i>some real power on my shots.</i>

847
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:03,857
-Don't clinch too much, okay?
-Yeah.

848
00:38:03,924 --> 00:38:05,526
[Hyunjae] <i>Toward the end of Round 3,</i>

849
00:38:05,592 --> 00:38:08,295
<i>I could see</i>
<i>that Seungjun was getting tired,</i>

850
00:38:08,362 --> 00:38:10,931
<i>so I figured I'd loosen up</i>
<i>and fight more comfortably.</i>

851
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:15,069
[Seungheon] And now,
the fourth round awaits.

852
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:16,670
ROUND 4 OF 8
KUK SEUNGJUN X CHO HYUNJAE

853
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:21,508
At this point,
it's fair to say this has already become

854
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:23,544
a battle of stamina.

855
00:38:24,111 --> 00:38:26,947
-[spectator 1] Let's go, Cho Hyunjae!
-[spectator 2] Let's go!

856
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:29,583
[spectators clamoring continues]

857
00:38:30,584 --> 00:38:31,819
It's okay. You're good.

858
00:38:32,553 --> 00:38:33,554
[Jonghoon] Keep it short!

859
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:35,155
[Seungjun supporter] That's it!

860
00:38:35,222 --> 00:38:36,290
-Short shots!
-Great!

861
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,359
-All right!
-[♪ intense music playing]

862
00:38:39,393 --> 00:38:42,296
-[Hyunjae supporter] Let's go!
-[Jonghoon] That's it!

863
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:43,864
[Seungjun supporter] You got this!

864
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:47,201
-All right!
-[Jonghoon] Seungjun, that's it!

865
00:38:47,267 --> 00:38:48,602
[Dex] Keep pressing!

866
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:50,304
[Seungjun supporter] You got this!

867
00:38:51,238 --> 00:38:52,606
Doing awesome, Seungjun!

868
00:38:53,841 --> 00:38:54,842
They're neck and neck.

869
00:38:54,908 --> 00:38:58,979
[Gyuwon] Both fighters are fighting
each round like it's the final round.

870
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:00,247
[spectator] Nice shot!

871
00:39:01,348 --> 00:39:03,016
[exclaims] Nice shot!

872
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:06,120
All right! That's gotta hurt!

873
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:08,989
You can do this!

874
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:13,026
[Hyunjae] <i>I came in thinking I'd loosen up</i>
<i>and fight comfortably,</i>

875
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:16,296
<i>but the moment the round started,</i>
<i>Kuk Seungjun charged in aggressively.</i>

876
00:39:16,363 --> 00:39:17,564
<i>That caught me off guard.</i>

877
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:20,200
[Jonghoon] Seungjun, this is it!
He's feeling the damage!

878
00:39:22,336 --> 00:39:23,637
[Seungheon] Another body shot!

879
00:39:24,338 --> 00:39:26,573
-[Jonghoon] Nice body shot!
-That's it!

880
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,208
It's fine! Take it slow!

881
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:30,144
[spectator] Go in now!

882
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:33,213
[Lee] Hyunjae's probably hurting
right now from all those body shots.

883
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,849
[Gyuwon] Both fighters are
giving it everything they've got.

884
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,386
[Hyunjae supporter] It's okay, it's okay!

885
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:40,821
[Jonghoon] Aim lower!

886
00:39:40,888 --> 00:39:42,389
That's it!

887
00:39:42,456 --> 00:39:43,624
[Jongkook] Nice body shot!

888
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,359
[♪ tense music playing]

889
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:46,427
[spectator] All right!

890
00:39:48,162 --> 00:39:49,430
[Jonghoon] Doing awesome, Seungjun!

891
00:39:52,332 --> 00:39:56,603
[Gyuwon] Kuk's body work's starting
to find a home… and there it is!

892
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,972
[Seungheon] That was
a big one to the body!

893
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:00,974
Awesome! You're doing so well!

894
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:06,280
[Lee] Man, he's good.

895
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:09,082
[coach] That's it!

896
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:11,185
[Hyunjae supporter] Yes, all right!

897
00:40:15,522 --> 00:40:18,625

-And that concludes the fourth round!

BOXING SCORE CARD
KUK: 38, CHO: 38

899
00:40:23,664 --> 00:40:28,068
-Seungjun's body work paid off here.
-Yes, it did.

900
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:30,804
He was pressing well earlier.

901
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:32,639
He was great when he was pouring it on.

902
00:40:32,706 --> 00:40:35,409
Hyunjae was in a bit of danger there,
taking a few to the body.

903
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:36,944
[Lee] His feet were tied down a bit.

904
00:40:39,146 --> 00:40:41,515
Sticking to him like that,

905
00:40:41,582 --> 00:40:44,351
you're taking shots you don't need to,
even with your guard up.

906
00:40:44,418 --> 00:40:45,719
Get your work done inside,

907
00:40:45,786 --> 00:40:47,254
then get out of there.

908
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:48,522
-Got it?
-It doesn't hurt.

909
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:50,257
Four more rounds to go, okay?

910
00:40:50,324 --> 00:40:51,959
What decides this fight from here?

911
00:40:52,025 --> 00:40:53,760
-Stamina.
-[Jonghoon] Yes, exactly.

912
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,362
-You're tired, right?
-Yes.

913
00:40:55,429 --> 00:40:57,664
-[Jonghoon] Trust me, he's more tired.
-[applause]

914

[♪ tense music playing]

915
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:03,971
[Seungheon] Neither fighter has
much experience going this many rounds,

916
00:41:04,037 --> 00:41:07,341
so every round
is a fight against themselves.

917
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:08,809
Cho Hyunjae versus Kuk Seungjun.

918
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,444

-Box!

ROUND 5 OF 8
KUK SEUNGJUN X CHO HYUNJAE

921
00:41:14,147 --> 00:41:15,582
They're starting a little slow.

922
00:41:15,649 --> 00:41:17,351
-Or maybe not!
-[Jonghoon] Nice shot!

923
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:21,788
[Lee] Now we need to see
if Hyunjae can bring his energy back up.

924
00:41:22,322 --> 00:41:23,323
[coach] All right!

925
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,058
Yes, go like that, man!

926
00:41:26,793 --> 00:41:28,595
[Gyuwon] Even with this being
the fifth round,

927
00:41:28,662 --> 00:41:31,098
Cho Hyunjae's footwork
is still going strong.

928

[clamoring continues]

929
00:41:32,566 --> 00:41:34,801
[Seungheon] Cho Hyunjae is still looking

930
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,004
to make use of his footwork here.

931
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,171
[Jonghoon] Nice shot!

932
00:41:38,238 --> 00:41:40,240
[Seungheon] He's letting him know
that didn't hurt.

933
00:41:41,642 --> 00:41:45,546
[Seungjun] <i>I was honestly surprised to see</i>
<i>Hyunjae still have that kind of stamina.</i>

934
00:41:45,612 --> 00:41:49,116
<i>I thought he'd be drained by then, but…</i>

935
00:41:49,683 --> 00:41:50,951
[exclaims]

936
00:41:51,018 --> 00:41:52,653
[spectator 1] Work the lead hand! Go now!

937
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,955
[Lee] Four rounds in,
and he's still bouncing around.

938
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,624
Hyunjae's gas tank is unreal.

939
00:41:57,691 --> 00:42:00,060
-Absolutely.
-[Lee] It's seriously impressive.

940
00:42:00,127 --> 00:42:02,796
[Seungheon] Cho Hyunjae's footwork is
starting to pick up again.

941
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:05,365
Cho's looking to hit and move.
He blocks the left hand nicely.

942
00:42:05,432 --> 00:42:06,700
Kuk Seungjun stays on him.

943
00:42:06,767 --> 00:42:08,101
He swings big but misses.

944
00:42:08,168 --> 00:42:09,202
[clamoring continues]

945
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:10,671
[Seungheon] That body shot landed!

946
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:11,805
From Cho Hyunjae.

947
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:16,610
[Hyunjae] <i>By the fifth round,</i>
<i>Kuk Seungjun was clearly tired.</i>

948
00:42:16,677 --> 00:42:18,745
<i>Stamina-wise, I still felt strong,</i>

949
00:42:18,812 --> 00:42:20,948
<i>so I decided to rely on my footwork.</i>

00:42:41,702 --> 00:42:43,537
[Seungheon] This time,
Cho's left hand lands!

[Jonghoon] It's fine! Keep it up!

962
00:42:49,476 --> 00:42:51,878
[Seungheon] This time,
Hyunjae steps forward aggressively.

963
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:53,447
-Go in now!
-[clamoring continues]

964
00:42:55,716 --> 00:42:58,685
[Jongkook] All of a sudden,
Seungjun's turned into an out-fighter.

965
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,054
[Lee] He's gassed right now.

966
00:43:02,022 --> 00:43:03,223
[Jongkook] That's it!

967
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,725
[Seungheon] Now, to the head!

968
00:43:06,593 --> 00:43:10,197

[Seungheon] And just like that,
the fifth round ends.

971
00:43:17,537 --> 00:43:19,439
Seungjun's tired now.

-He hit a wall all at once.
-Seungjun is… Yeah.

-Hyunjae's turned into the infighter.
-[Jongkook] Right, right.

00:43:24,044 --> 00:43:27,047
This could be
where Hyunjae makes his comeback.

The sixth round is on.

976
00:43:28,215 --> 00:43:30,350
[Gyuwon] From here,
it's a real test of mental toughness.

977
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:32,552
We're in the back half of the bout now.

-A big uppercut!

985

[Gyuwon] Even in close range,
Cho Hyunjae isn't backing down!

986
00:43:54,975 --> 00:43:56,176
[Hyunjae supporter] Way to go!

987
00:43:56,243 --> 00:43:58,779
Seungjun's getting pushed back hard.
He's completely spent.

988
00:43:59,246 --> 00:44:00,414
He can't even lift his guard.

989
00:44:02,149 --> 00:44:03,984
-No, stop.
-[Jongkook] You can't chase like that.

990
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:05,052
That won't land a thing.

991
00:44:05,118 --> 00:44:06,820
[Dex] He's going
to gas out if he keeps this up.

992

Slow down! Take it easy!

993
00:44:10,557 --> 00:44:12,893
[Lee] I'm sure he's exhausted now.

-Way too wide.

the punches get wide,
because he can't reach.

01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,975
<i>I thought he could really help.</i>

1335
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:11,444
Who are you fighting this time?

1336
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:12,945
-Chaehyun. Yep.
-Chaehyun?

1337
01:01:13,579 --> 01:01:16,415
He's a southpaw. That's never easy.

1338
01:01:16,482 --> 01:01:19,118
Exactly, I'm here for some southpaw prep.

1339
01:01:19,585 --> 01:01:21,454
[Minuk] All right, let's train.

1340
01:01:22,321 --> 01:01:24,557
-Eight rounds, was it?
-Yes, eight.

1341
01:01:26,659 --> 01:01:28,260
That actually works in your favor.

1342
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:30,830
-Since I've been through it before.
-Right.

1343
01:01:31,363 --> 01:01:35,434
Someone who's gone through that
and someone who hasn't…

1344
01:01:36,268 --> 01:01:37,269
Big difference there.

1345
01:01:41,574 --> 01:01:44,310
Chaehyun's flow is solid,

1346
01:01:44,376 --> 01:01:46,512
but you can't let yourself
get caught up in it.

1347
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:48,214
You've got to cut him off.

1348
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,281
Just like this.

1349
01:01:49,982 --> 01:01:51,550
Rather than up top,

1350
01:01:51,617 --> 01:01:52,618
aim for the body.

1351
01:01:53,185 --> 01:01:54,754
Open the body, the head follows.

1352
01:01:55,721 --> 01:01:56,722
Again.

1353
01:01:58,858 --> 01:02:00,993
[Ohgon] <i>The longer the fight goes,</i>

1354
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:03,095
<i>the less it's about technique</i>

1355
01:02:03,162 --> 01:02:06,031
<i>and the more about</i>
<i>who's stronger in the end.</i>

1356
01:02:08,033 --> 01:02:13,839
<i>I want to show amateur fighters</i>
<i>just how tough pro boxing really is.</i>

1357
01:02:14,473 --> 01:02:17,576
The one entering the<i> I Am Boxer</i> finals…

1358
01:02:17,643 --> 01:02:18,811
That would be me.

1359
01:02:26,552 --> 01:02:29,855
[Dex] Before we start,
let's hear from both fighters.

1360
01:02:30,422 --> 01:02:32,024
Up until now,

1361
01:02:32,091 --> 01:02:35,127
I've never lost against a pro once.

1362
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:38,798
That's why they call me "Pro Killer."

1363
01:02:39,698 --> 01:02:42,568
So tonight, I'll prove exactly why

1364
01:02:42,635 --> 01:02:44,103
I earned that nickname.

1365
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:47,006
All right! Well said!

1366
01:02:48,174 --> 01:02:50,209
To make this fight more interesting,

1367
01:02:50,276 --> 01:02:53,712
Lee Chaehyun just added
some real fuel to the fire.

1368
01:02:53,779 --> 01:02:54,780
Okay, great.

1369
01:02:54,847 --> 01:02:56,982
I started out in amateur boxing

1370
01:02:57,049 --> 01:02:59,451
and worked my way up
to becoming a pro champion.

1371
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:02,454
In other words,
I've already walked the path

1372
01:03:02,521 --> 01:03:04,990
Lee Chaehyun is on right now.

1373
01:03:05,057 --> 01:03:08,594
Since he still has a long road ahead,

1374
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:11,497
I'll give him a taste
of professional boxing.

1375
01:03:12,231 --> 01:03:14,333
All right! Let's go!

1376
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:17,636
KWON OHGON'S WIFE

1377
01:03:17,703 --> 01:03:19,705
[Jongkook] Fighters, please get ready.

1378
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:25,244
[Gyuwon] Kwon Ohgon is the type
to slowly close the distance

1379
01:03:25,311 --> 01:03:27,713
and finish it with sharp timing.

1380
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:30,983
Whereas Lee Chaehyun pulls his opponent
into his own range

1381
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:32,852
and controls the fight that way.

1382
01:03:32,918 --> 01:03:35,621
I can't wait to see
what strategies each fighter brings.

1383
01:03:36,121 --> 01:03:38,824
[Jongkook] Honestly, the height,
the reach…

1384
01:03:38,891 --> 01:03:41,660
They're almost on equal footing,
physicality-wise.

1385
01:03:41,727 --> 01:03:43,362
Almost, yeah.

1386
01:03:43,429 --> 01:03:44,730
Standing side by side,

1387
01:03:44,797 --> 01:03:46,198
there isn't much of a difference.

1388
01:03:46,765 --> 01:03:48,901
Technically, both fighters are solid.

1389
01:03:48,968 --> 01:03:51,303
If there's one issue, it's stamina.

1390
01:03:52,104 --> 01:03:54,773
Remember, slow but steady.

1391
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,775
For the first round, work the feints.

1392
01:03:56,842 --> 01:03:58,077
Go downstairs to the body.

1393
01:03:58,644 --> 01:04:01,547
At first, feel it out
and do your own thing.

1394
01:04:01,614 --> 01:04:02,915
Let's switch it up after.

1395
01:04:03,682 --> 01:04:04,850
I'm nervous.

1396
01:04:05,417 --> 01:04:07,353
[Jongkook] The semifinals of <i>I Am Boxer</i>.

1397
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:09,221
Let the bout…

1398
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:11,790
begin!

1399
01:04:13,259 --> 01:04:15,094
-Let's go, Chaehyun!
-Let's go!

1400
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,161
Let's go!

1401
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:17,796
Let's do this!

1402
01:04:17,863 --> 01:04:19,365
You got this!

1403
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,401
All right.

1404
01:04:22,468 --> 01:04:23,469
Box!

1405
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:25,271
Box!

1406
01:04:25,738 --> 01:04:27,106
[Seungheon] Here we go with Round 1.

1407
01:04:27,172 --> 01:04:28,374
Lee Chaehyun goes right in.

1408
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,776
KWON OHGON X LEE CHAEHYUN

1409
01:04:30,843 --> 01:04:32,678
[Gyuwon] Lee Chaehyun is
constantly on the move,

1410
01:04:32,745 --> 01:04:35,814
trying to drag him into his rhythm.

1411
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,551
As for Kwon Ohgon,

1412
01:04:39,618 --> 01:04:41,787
he's staying defensive,
looking for openings.

1413
01:04:42,454 --> 01:04:44,290
That's it. Ride the rhythm.

1414
01:04:45,157 --> 01:04:47,226
[Seungheon] Kwon's got a good read
on his movement.

1415
01:04:49,595 --> 01:04:50,763
[exclaims]

1416
01:04:50,829 --> 01:04:51,964
He caught him.

1417
01:04:52,031 --> 01:04:53,365
Man, that sounds heavy.

1418
01:04:55,734 --> 01:04:57,903
A clean right hand lands from Kwon Ohgon.

1419
01:04:58,704 --> 01:04:59,705
[referee] Break!

1420
01:05:01,106 --> 01:05:03,609
[Chaehyun] <i>His distance control was better</i>
<i>than I'd expected.</i>

1421
01:05:04,176 --> 01:05:05,444
<i>So I needed to focus more.</i>

1422
01:05:08,314 --> 01:05:10,316
[Seungheon] Lee Chaehyun is
mixing in feints.

1423
01:05:11,717 --> 01:05:14,420
[Dex] Kwon Ohgon sure looks composed.

1424
01:05:14,486 --> 01:05:17,456
[Ohgon] <i>Since it's an eight-round fight,</i>

1425
01:05:17,523 --> 01:05:19,825
<i>I planned to raise the tempo gradually.</i>

1426
01:05:23,696 --> 01:05:25,698
[Gyuwon] That jab landed
just a beat faster.

1427
01:05:26,565 --> 01:05:29,335
It looks like Kwon's got
a good read on Lee's rhythm.

1428
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:36,175
[Seungheon] Lee Chaehyun hasn't really
gotten his southpaw game going yet.

1429
01:05:39,645 --> 01:05:41,046
[Jongkook] He's setting things up now.

1430
01:05:41,513 --> 01:05:43,816
-Working high and low.
-[audience cheering]

1431
01:05:47,286 --> 01:05:49,054
That's it!

1432
01:05:49,788 --> 01:05:50,990
All right!

1433
01:05:52,658 --> 01:05:54,259
Lee Chaehyun isn't backing off.

1434
01:05:54,326 --> 01:05:55,327
He's not giving ground.

1435
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:58,030
[Jongkook] See that?
He's holding the center.

1436
01:05:58,097 --> 01:06:00,499
Lee Chaehyun is staying busy,
constantly throwing.

1437
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,968
Stay calm and collected!

1438
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:10,943
[Dex] Lee Chaehyun is doing really well.

1439
01:06:12,578 --> 01:06:14,813
[Gyuwon] Lee Chaehyun's accuracy
is excellent.

1440
01:06:20,786 --> 01:06:24,256
Lee Chaehyun's straight shots
aren't landing flush,

1441
01:06:24,323 --> 01:06:26,759
but they're keeping Kwon on his toes.

1442
01:06:26,825 --> 01:06:28,193
[Seungheon] Combo to the head from Lee.

1443
01:06:30,462 --> 01:06:32,231
And follows it to the body.

1444
01:06:32,998 --> 01:06:35,034
-[spectator 1] Come on!
-[spectator 2] Let's go!

1445
01:06:37,469 --> 01:06:39,038
He threw a big one there.

1446
01:06:39,104 --> 01:06:40,706
Yes! Doing well, Chaehyun!

1447
01:06:42,241 --> 01:06:44,043
-[bell dings]
-[Seungheon] Stop!

1448
01:06:44,109 --> 01:06:45,110
And that brings the round to a close.

1449
01:06:47,246 --> 01:06:49,248
Let's go, Kwon Ohgon!

1450
01:06:49,314 --> 01:06:50,883
In the first round,

1451
01:06:50,949 --> 01:06:53,619
Lee Chaehyun landed
a lot of clean, sharp punches.

1452
01:06:53,685 --> 01:06:55,687
He definitely kept Ohgon uncomfortable.

1453
01:06:55,754 --> 01:06:57,723
-He definitely threw more.
-[Lee, Jongkook] Mmm.

1454
01:06:57,790 --> 01:07:01,794
But if Kwon Ohgon gets a good read
on Lee Chaehyun's habits early on,

1455
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:04,730
he could start catching him with counters.

1456
01:07:04,797 --> 01:07:06,732
You have a read on his timing.

1457
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:08,500
Use that. Timing is everything.

1458
01:07:09,168 --> 01:07:10,602
[Ohgon] <i>That round was like</i>
<i>a testing phase,</i>

1459
01:07:10,669 --> 01:07:12,771
<i>seeing what kind of punches he throws.</i>

1460
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:15,841
<i>The plan was to turn up the pressure</i>
<i>from the second round.</i>

1461
01:07:15,908 --> 01:07:18,410
Ohgon's throwing big shots, right?

1462
01:07:18,477 --> 01:07:20,345
You've gotta keep making him do that.

1463
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:22,414
Work the body. His feet are planted.

1464
01:07:22,481 --> 01:07:23,482
Got it.

1465
01:07:23,549 --> 01:07:26,085
-Let's go, Chaehyun!
-Let's go, Chaehyun!

1466
01:07:26,151 --> 01:07:27,920
You got this, Ohgon!

1467
01:07:27,986 --> 01:07:29,321
Come on!

1468
01:07:30,155 --> 01:07:32,124
-[bell dings]
-Box!

1469
01:07:32,191 --> 01:07:33,225
KWON OHGON X LEE CHAEHYUN

1470
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:35,127
[Seungheon] The second round's begun.

1471
01:07:35,194 --> 01:07:37,296
Kwon's going noticeably faster this time.

1472
01:07:38,363 --> 01:07:40,566
He's turning it up.

1473
01:07:40,632 --> 01:07:42,801
-He's figured him out.
-[Jongkook] Ah…

1474
01:07:42,868 --> 01:07:46,004
[Ohgon] <i>Right off the bell,</i>
<i>I tried to back Chaehyun into the corner</i>

1475
01:07:46,071 --> 01:07:47,739
<i>and attack fast.</i>

1476
01:07:47,806 --> 01:07:50,242
[Gyuwon] When Kwon Ohgon starts
pushing this aggressively,

1477
01:07:50,309 --> 01:07:52,911
it means he's trying
to apply psychological pressure.

1478
01:07:54,246 --> 01:07:55,881
[Dex] Damn, he's fast.

1479
01:07:59,151 --> 01:08:02,554
[Gyuwon] The fact that Kwon Ohgon
is walking through Lee Chaehyun's punches

1480
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:04,189
tells you he knows he can take them,

1481
01:08:04,256 --> 01:08:06,091
-and he's confident.
-That's right.

1482
01:08:07,126 --> 01:08:08,393
[spectator] All right!

1483
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:13,298
Good, push him with your rear hand!

1484
01:08:13,932 --> 01:08:16,168
[Chaehyun] <i>Maybe he felt he couldn't win</i>
<i>the distance battle,</i>

1485
01:08:16,235 --> 01:08:17,336
<i>he started pressing forward.</i>

1486
01:08:17,402 --> 01:08:20,372
<i>So I thought,</i>
<i>"Fine, I'll plant my feet and fire back."</i>

1487
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:21,440
<i>"Let's do this."</i>

1488
01:08:22,007 --> 01:08:25,310
[Seungheon] Lee Chaehyun is easing
backward, throwing punches as he goes.

1489
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:29,214
Kwon throws a left-hand double.

1490
01:08:30,082 --> 01:08:31,550
[Jongkook] Kwon's looking for the counter,

1491
01:08:31,617 --> 01:08:33,118
but Lee's good at circling out.

1492
01:08:33,185 --> 01:08:35,454
[Lee] Ohgon's rhythm keeps
getting cut off.

1493
01:08:35,521 --> 01:08:37,222
He can't do what he wants.

1494
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,163
Right there, as he circles out.
Lee's great at that.

1495
01:08:44,963 --> 01:08:47,366
[spectator] Plant your feet
and watch for the big ones, Chaehyun!

1496
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:49,735
[Seungheon] Nice shot.

1497
01:08:49,801 --> 01:08:51,136
Lee's left hand lands clean.

1498
01:08:51,203 --> 01:08:52,304
Now, to the body.

1499
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:55,174
[exclaims]

1500
01:08:56,742 --> 01:08:59,478
[Gyuwon] Lee Chaehyun is tagging him
with a variety of punches.

01:08:59,545 --> 01:09:01,180
Yes, that's it!

1502
01:09:01,246 --> 01:09:03,048
Man, that straight is really good.

1503
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:07,119
[Ohgon] <i>I was pretty shaken there.</i>

1504
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:10,222
<i>I think I let my guard down a bit.</i>

1505
01:09:10,289 --> 01:09:11,490
Keep moving!

1506
01:09:13,292 --> 01:09:16,662
[Gyuwon] Lee's straight comes half a beat
faster, and it's very dangerous.

1507
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:21,500
[spectator] That's it!

1508
01:09:22,768 --> 01:09:26,672
-Oh… That was good.
-He's so clean and so fast.

1509
01:09:29,575 --> 01:09:32,077
[Gyuwon] Even in tight quarters,

1510
01:09:32,144 --> 01:09:35,013
he's still landing
a variety of punches on Kwon Ohgon.

1511
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,249
[Seungheon] Exactly.
Kwon Ohgon was the one to apply pressure,

1512
01:09:37,316 --> 01:09:39,318
but Lee Chaehyun
is throwing more efficiently.

1513
01:09:42,254 --> 01:09:45,023
[Gyuwon] Lee Chaehyun's head movement
is very impressive.

1514
01:09:50,128 --> 01:09:51,997
-[bell dings]
-[Seungheon] To the body, and that's it!

1515
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:55,000
The round has come to an end.

1516
01:09:55,968 --> 01:09:58,270
-[Jongkook] Lee Chaehyun really is good.
-Yeah.

1517
01:09:58,837 --> 01:10:01,974
-So far on points, it's Lee Chaehyun.
-Yeah, so far.

1518
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,842
Ohgon can't get his fight going.

1519
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:05,744
-That's the issue.
-Yeah, exactly.

1520
01:10:06,478 --> 01:10:09,214
Keep it nice and easy.
Don't let him connect anymore.

1521
01:10:09,681 --> 01:10:11,149
[Ohgon] <i>My gas tank's still good.</i>

1522
01:10:11,216 --> 01:10:13,852
<i>I'll make a statement this next round.</i>

1523
01:10:13,919 --> 01:10:15,254
You're doing well.

1524
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,290
You're landing clean,
throwing the lead one-two.

1525
01:10:18,357 --> 01:10:19,358
Keep that up.

1526
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:21,293
And if you're gonna throw big,
sit down on it.

1527
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:22,961
[bell dings]

1528
01:10:23,028 --> 01:10:24,696
-Box!
-[Seungheon] The third round has begun.

1529
01:10:25,564 --> 01:10:27,299
Kwon lunges right off the bat.

1530
01:10:27,366 --> 01:10:29,768
KWON OHGON X LEE CHAEHYUN

1531
01:10:29,835 --> 01:10:32,571
Kwon Ohgon's starting to lean forward.
And he steps in.

1532
01:10:34,172 --> 01:10:35,707
[Jongkook] That's it.

1533
01:10:35,774 --> 01:10:37,576
But hey, look how well he spins out.

1534
01:10:37,643 --> 01:10:39,411
If he gets stuck, it's over for him.

1535
01:10:40,579 --> 01:10:43,248
[Seungheon] Lee Chaehyun fires back.

1536
01:10:44,549 --> 01:10:47,452
[Chaehyun] <i>He kept pressing</i>
<i>to drain my stamina.</i>

1537
01:10:47,519 --> 01:10:51,390
<i>One of my strengths is that</i>
<i>I fire back well, even when I'm cornered.</i>

1538
01:10:51,456 --> 01:10:55,093
<i>So I think I was able to counter a lot</i>
<i>every time he came in.</i>

1539
01:10:55,594 --> 01:10:57,896
-[Seungheon] Lee's right hand lands!
-Well done!

1540
01:10:59,131 --> 01:11:00,799
That's it!

1541
01:11:03,568 --> 01:11:05,370
Nice, the slip-and-rip.

1542
01:11:06,138 --> 01:11:08,106
[♪ thrilling music plays]

1543
01:11:08,173 --> 01:11:10,742
-Lee Chaehyun's timing is excellent.
-That's right.

1544
01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:15,247
[Gyuwon] Kwon Ohgon is getting
visibly frustrated right now.

1545
01:11:15,314 --> 01:11:17,115
[Seungheon] Things aren't really
clicking for him.

1546
01:11:20,519 --> 01:11:22,120
Kwon Ohgon keeps chasing him down.

1547
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:24,790
-[person 1] The rear hand…
-[person 2] That's it!

1548
01:11:25,624 --> 01:11:27,025
[Lee] Great slip-and-rip.

1549
01:11:27,092 --> 01:11:29,695
-[♪ intense music playing]
-Man, his punches are really quick.

1550
01:11:30,395 --> 01:11:32,097
[person] Chaehyun, your timing is perfect!

1551
01:11:32,597 --> 01:11:35,600
[Seungheon] Kwon Ohgon continues
to turn up the pressure.

1552
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:37,135
[Jongkook] He circles out again. [groans]

1553
01:11:39,771 --> 01:11:41,506
Smooth slip out of the corner.

1554
01:11:41,573 --> 01:11:43,175
I know, right?

1555
01:11:50,482 --> 01:11:51,650
[Seungheon] Left hand this time.

1556
01:11:51,717 --> 01:11:53,819
-All right!
-Yes, well done!

1557
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,955
And he slides out again.
That's smart boxing from Lee.

1558
01:11:57,022 --> 01:11:59,091
And that brings the round to a close.

1559
01:11:59,591 --> 01:12:01,093
Every time Ohgon tries something,

1560
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:03,829
Chaehyun throws a jab in between
and cuts his rhythm off.

1561
01:12:03,895 --> 01:12:07,899
Even if the punches aren't heavy,
if you walk right into them…

1562
01:12:07,966 --> 01:12:09,835
-The impact of the collision.
-…your balance…

1563
01:12:09,901 --> 01:12:12,738
It really throws you off the rhythm.

01:12:12,804 --> 01:12:14,740
-[Seungheon] Here comes Round 4.
-Box!

1565

KWON OHGON X LEE CHAEHYUN

1566
01:12:16,508 --> 01:12:19,845
Kwon has been increasing the pressure
since the second round,

1567
01:12:19,911 --> 01:12:22,681
but it hasn't translated into results yet.

01:12:26,651 --> 01:12:27,652
He spins out again.

1571
01:12:29,287 --> 01:12:31,423

-[audience gasps]
-[Lee exclaims]

1573
01:12:38,797 --> 01:12:40,966

Lee Chaehyun lands clean.

1574
01:12:41,032 --> 01:12:42,534
Man, he's quick.

1575
01:12:43,168 --> 01:12:44,603
Kwon steps right back in.

1576
01:12:45,103 --> 01:12:46,872
This pattern just keeps repeating itself.

1577
01:12:48,006 --> 01:12:49,107
In goes the left hand.

1578
01:12:49,174 --> 01:12:50,876
This is what he's good at.

1579
01:12:50,942 --> 01:12:52,310
[spectator] Doing great!

1580
01:12:52,377 --> 01:12:56,548

-You're doing so well, Chaehyun!

[Seungheon] All right! Nice body shot!

1585
01:13:13,165 --> 01:13:14,966
That hook was beautiful.

1586
01:13:17,636 --> 01:13:18,837
[Seungheon] He extends the left!

And that concludes the round!

That counter timing was excellent.

1593
01:13:43,662 --> 01:13:47,232
[Gyuwon] Lee Chaehyun's strategy
is clearly working right now.

1594
01:13:47,299 --> 01:13:49,034
Despite it being the fourth round,

1595
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:51,536
he's not hesitating or shrinking at all.

1596
01:13:51,603 --> 01:13:52,771
-You've got him figured out.
-Hmm.

1597
01:13:52,838 --> 01:13:54,506
There's nothing there. He's weak.

1598
01:13:54,573 --> 01:13:55,907
You're not even feeling his shots.

<i>coming from or how they were thrown…</i>

<i>None of that really mattered to me.</i>

1601
01:14:00,946 --> 01:14:03,748
They were shots with virtually no damage.

reactions were on point earlier.

1605
01:14:10,755 --> 01:14:13,959
The question is
how Kwon Ohgon's big shot will factor in.

1606

That's it!

Double shot up top.

And plant your front foot!

You've got to answer back like that.

1613
01:14:29,107 --> 01:14:31,209
[Ohgon] <i>The plan was to tie him up first,</i>

1614
01:14:31,276 --> 01:14:33,211
<i>so I focused on attacking the body</i>

<i>and back him up to the corner.</i>

Open the body, the head follows.

Rather than up top, aim for the body.

Lee Chaehyun looks visibly shaken.

1644

Kwon Ohgon will only press harder.

-Let's go, Chaehyun!
-Let's go, Chaehyun!

This is the first time
we've seen Lee Chaehyun rattled.

1656

[Seungheon] It took Kwon Ohgon some time
to start revving things up,

1657
01:16:18,917 --> 01:16:21,486
but in this round,
it felt like he showed us

1658
01:16:21,553 --> 01:16:23,755
how he plans to break his opponent.

1659
01:16:23,822 --> 01:16:26,858
It's one of two things for Chaehyun.

1660
01:16:27,392 --> 01:16:30,862
The shots he was slipping earlier
are landing now.

1661
01:16:30,929 --> 01:16:32,297
So either he's gassed…

1662
01:16:32,364 --> 01:16:34,532
-Right.
-…or it's that body shot from earlier.

1663
01:16:34,599 --> 01:16:36,301
That was a heavy one.

1664
01:16:37,235 --> 01:16:39,270
It probably flustered him,
took his breath,

1665
01:16:39,337 --> 01:16:41,072
and drained his legs a bit.

1666
01:16:41,139 --> 01:16:44,142
How much he recovers from here
will make all the difference.

1667
01:16:46,711 --> 01:16:49,547
[Chaehyun] <i>I was worried, honestly.</i>
<i>That I wouldn't be able to bounce back.</i>

1668
01:16:49,614 --> 01:16:53,051
<i>If we started trading,</i>
<i>I knew I'd get pushed back.</i>

1669
01:16:53,118 --> 01:16:55,754
<i>So the plan was to avoid those exchanges,</i>

1670
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,456
<i>keep it long, and fight with speed.</i>

1671
01:16:59,457 --> 01:17:01,059
You've caught him a few times already.

1672
01:17:01,126 --> 01:17:02,994
Let's really take him to the ropes now.

1673
01:17:03,061 --> 01:17:06,498
<i>I landed a big shot clean to the head.</i>

1674
01:17:06,564 --> 01:17:08,900
<i>That probably shook him up a bit.</i>

1675
01:17:09,401 --> 01:17:12,470
<i>From there, I wanted to press harder</i>
<i>and knock him out.</i>

1676
01:17:12,971 --> 01:17:14,472
[spectator] Let's go, Ohgon!

1677
01:17:14,973 --> 01:17:17,642
-Let's go, Chaehyun!
-Let's go, Chaehyun!

1678
01:17:18,343 --> 01:17:19,177
[bell dings]

1679
01:17:19,244 --> 01:17:21,346
-Box!
-[Seungheon] Moving into the sixth round.

1680
01:17:21,413 --> 01:17:23,248
KWON OHGON X LEE CHAEHYUN

1681
01:17:23,314 --> 01:17:25,016
Once again, Kwon Ohgon marches forward.

1682
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:26,918
-Keep going!
-Yes, you're doing great!

1683
01:17:27,819 --> 01:17:29,554
[Gyuwon] Will Lee Chaehyun's
composure hold up,

1684
01:17:29,621 --> 01:17:31,723
or will Kwon Ohgon's strategy take over?

1685
01:17:36,061 --> 01:17:38,730
Combinations are landing at close range.

1686
01:17:40,131 --> 01:17:42,667
Ohgon, throw a hook once he's cornered.

1687
01:17:44,469 --> 01:17:45,804
[Jongkook] He's getting cut off.

1688
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,006
[Gyuwon] Kwon Ohgon has figured out
Lee Chaehyun's rhythm.

1689
01:17:48,573 --> 01:17:50,709
-He's really pressuring him right now.
-Mmm.

1690
01:17:50,775 --> 01:17:52,844
That's him trying to make it rough.

1691
01:17:53,411 --> 01:17:56,147
[Ohgon] <i>Lee Chaehyun was holding up</i>
<i>better than expected.</i>

1692
01:17:56,214 --> 01:17:57,882
That's it! Doing great!

1693
01:17:57,949 --> 01:17:58,950
-All right!
-[audience cheers]

1694
01:18:00,185 --> 01:18:03,121
<i>I knew I had to show something</i>
<i>in this round.</i>

1695
01:18:03,188 --> 01:18:04,355
[person 1] Chaehyun, go in first!

1696
01:18:04,422 --> 01:18:05,590
[person 2] Press him!

1697
01:18:05,657 --> 01:18:07,025
No, he's circling, man!

1698
01:18:07,759 --> 01:18:09,761
Yes! There we go!

1699
01:18:09,828 --> 01:18:12,630
-[♪ exciting music playing]
-Yes! There we go!

1700
01:18:12,697 --> 01:18:13,798
Let's go!

1701
01:18:13,865 --> 01:18:16,267
[Gyuwon] Kwon Ohgon shuts
him down aggressively!

1702
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:18,970
-Come on!
-That's it!

1703
01:18:19,037 --> 01:18:20,739
Yes! Let's go!

1704
01:18:22,674 --> 01:18:23,675
Get out of there!

1705
01:18:24,242 --> 01:18:26,144
[Seungheon] Kwon's trying
to swing the momentum.

1706
01:18:26,644 --> 01:18:28,279
He's looking to settle this!

1707
01:18:29,848 --> 01:18:31,983
Chaehyun, stay calm, man.

1708
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,351
No need to get worked up.

1709
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:36,554
[Seungheon] Kwon Ohgon is not slowing
down. He keeps pressing forward.

1710
01:18:42,127 --> 01:18:44,095
They've traded some big shots there.

1711
01:18:45,163 --> 01:18:46,197
[spectator] Stay sharp!

1712
01:18:46,264 --> 01:18:47,832
[person] Chaehyun, focus!

1713
01:18:48,867 --> 01:18:50,502
All right! That's it!

1714
01:18:53,238 --> 01:18:55,907
[Gyuwon] This is a fierce battle of timing
between the two.

1715
01:18:58,176 --> 01:18:59,344
Throw first! There you go!

1716
01:18:59,410 --> 01:19:01,212
Go ahead and tap! That's it!

1717
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:02,447
One more time!

1718
01:19:02,514 --> 01:19:04,382
-That's it!
-Love that.

1719
01:19:05,717 --> 01:19:07,152
[Seungheon] They're locked in.

1720
01:19:07,218 --> 01:19:08,753
[Gyuwon] The level of focus is incredible.

1721
01:19:09,287 --> 01:19:10,321
Doing great, Chaehyun!

1722
01:19:11,523 --> 01:19:13,191
[referee] Don't turn around. Keep going!

1723
01:19:13,258 --> 01:19:14,492
-Round's not over yet.
-[bell dings]

1724
01:19:14,559 --> 01:19:18,396
-Stop!
-That brings this round to an end.

1725
01:19:21,366 --> 01:19:23,835
Ohgon is starting to work through it.

1726
01:19:23,902 --> 01:19:25,236
But you never know.

1727
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:26,871
-All it takes is one shot.
-Absolutely.

1728
01:19:26,938 --> 01:19:28,573
You never know until the very end.

1729
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,309
One clean hook
and you could see him tighten up.

1730
01:19:33,311 --> 01:19:36,314
<i>There weren't many rounds left,</i>
<i>so I started to get impatient.</i>

1731
01:19:36,381 --> 01:19:38,550
[Ohgon] <i>I had to finish it this time.</i>

1732
01:19:38,616 --> 01:19:40,885
You're doing awesome.
He's getting impatient.

1733
01:19:40,952 --> 01:19:43,454
[Chaehyun] <i>I did get hit,</i>
<i>but honestly, they weren't too bad.</i>

1734
01:19:43,521 --> 01:19:45,156
<i>I just told myself to get my pace back,</i>

1735
01:19:45,223 --> 01:19:48,092
<i>and do what I'd been doing.</i>

1736
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,862
-Let's go, Chaehyun!
-Stay strong, Chaehyun!

1737
01:19:50,929 --> 01:19:52,497
Come on, Ohgon!

1738
01:19:52,564 --> 01:19:53,898
You got this!

KWON: 56, LEE: 58

1740
01:19:56,501 --> 01:19:58,536
-Box!
-And the seventh round begins.

1741
01:19:58,603 --> 01:20:03,174
[Gyuwon] From here on out,
it's a battle of stamina and focus.

1742
01:20:04,175 --> 01:20:05,610
[audience gasps]

1743
01:20:06,744 --> 01:20:09,147
[Seungheon] Both fighters exchange
big shots.

1744
01:20:09,814 --> 01:20:11,983
[Gyuwon] Kwon Ohgon's rough punches

1745
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:14,485
are going off properly at close range.

1746
01:20:16,087 --> 01:20:20,892
While fighting up close, Kwon's
lead hand is really giving Lee trouble.

1747
01:20:21,759 --> 01:20:23,962
Tag him! Tag him! That's it!

1748
01:20:24,863 --> 01:20:26,331
Did you see that just now?

1749
01:20:26,397 --> 01:20:28,766
[Gyuwon] That was
a perfectly timed body shot.

1750
01:20:33,404 --> 01:20:35,173
[Seungheon] Kwon Ohgon has
good upper-body movement.

1751
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:37,775
Still, Lee Chaehyun is hunting
for that long punch.

1752
01:20:37,842 --> 01:20:39,110
One more!

1753
01:20:39,177 --> 01:20:40,278
You have him!

1754
01:20:40,345 --> 01:20:41,346
Get in there!

1755
01:20:41,412 --> 01:20:42,680
Nice body shot!

1756
01:20:42,747 --> 01:20:43,982
Get in there! That's it!

1757
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:45,350
A great shot to the body.

1758
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:48,720
-Let's go, Kwon Ohgon!
-Come on!

1759
01:20:49,187 --> 01:20:50,188
All right!

1760
01:20:50,255 --> 01:20:51,522
Kwon makes use of that knee!

1761
01:20:51,589 --> 01:20:52,590
That's it!

1762
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,861
That slip-and-rip, though.

1763
01:20:56,928 --> 01:20:58,630
Chaehyun, don't stop!

1764
01:20:58,696 --> 01:21:00,531
-Stay calm!
-Now! Go for it!

1765
01:21:00,598 --> 01:21:01,866
Tag him first!

1766
01:21:01,933 --> 01:21:02,967
All right!

1767
01:21:03,034 --> 01:21:04,135
[Seungheon] Lee Chaehyun lands!

1768
01:21:04,202 --> 01:21:05,370
All right!

1769
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:08,473
Lee Chaehyun immediately gets inside.

1770
01:21:08,539 --> 01:21:10,375
Lee's left hand gets through clean!

1771
01:21:10,441 --> 01:21:11,776
He jabs right in your face.

1772
01:21:12,243 --> 01:21:13,745
His hands are right here.

1773
01:21:14,312 --> 01:21:16,414
[Gyuwon] Lee Chaehyun is
boxing smartly in Round 7.

1774
01:21:17,582 --> 01:21:20,251
And he's landing
quite a few shots upstairs.

1775
01:21:20,318 --> 01:21:21,486
Come on, tap, tap, tap!

1776
01:21:23,288 --> 01:21:26,457
Lee rolls and slides out.
His footwork's picking up.

1777
01:21:26,524 --> 01:21:28,893
[Dex] Kwon Ohgon's starting to rush now.

1778
01:21:29,294 --> 01:21:30,295
He's getting impatient.

1779
01:21:31,796 --> 01:21:33,131
That's it!

1780
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,434
There you go!

1781
01:21:38,569 --> 01:21:40,138
[Gyuwon groans]
Lee's movement is still sharp.

1782
01:21:41,372 --> 01:21:42,907
[person] Light and easy! Take it slow!

1783
01:21:42,974 --> 01:21:44,442
Throw back!

1784
01:21:48,813 --> 01:21:49,981
That's it!

1785
01:21:52,116 --> 01:21:53,484
[Gyuwon] Excellent combo!

1786
01:21:54,052 --> 01:21:55,386
-[bell dings]
-Stop!

1787
01:21:55,453 --> 01:21:59,123
[Gyuwon] And with that final exchange,
Round 7 comes to a close.

1788
01:22:00,992 --> 01:22:02,560
[cheering]

1789
01:22:05,997 --> 01:22:08,166
Chaehyun's got great stamina, though.

1790
01:22:08,232 --> 01:22:09,834
Right? His stamina's solid.

1791
01:22:09,901 --> 01:22:10,902
Yeah, it's amazing.

1792
01:22:10,969 --> 01:22:14,138
Here's something I learned on this show.

1793
01:22:14,205 --> 01:22:16,674
They say amateurs are only good
for three rounds.

1794
01:22:16,741 --> 01:22:18,109
-Couldn't be more wrong.
-No.

1795
01:22:18,176 --> 01:22:20,144
-They're solid all the way through.
-Exactly.

1796
01:22:20,211 --> 01:22:23,281
That whole "only good for three rounds"
is just a stereotype.

1797
01:22:23,348 --> 01:22:24,349
You're right.

1798
01:22:24,415 --> 01:22:26,985
-Even I had thought so at first.
-Right?

1799
01:22:27,051 --> 01:22:28,619
To be honest.

1800
01:22:28,686 --> 01:22:31,122
Skill is skill, in the end.

1801
01:22:32,423 --> 01:22:36,060
[Gyuwon] At times, it felt like Lee was
getting dragged into Kwon's fight.

1802
01:22:36,127 --> 01:22:38,229
But each time,
Lee Chaehyun held his ground.

1803
01:22:39,464 --> 01:22:40,865
As for Kwon Ohgon,

1804
01:22:41,366 --> 01:22:43,701
he is known as a ten-round fighter,

1805
01:22:43,768 --> 01:22:46,170
so he's going to put everything
into this final round.

1806
01:22:46,671 --> 01:22:49,540
-Let's go, Chaehyun!
-Let's go, Chaehyun!

1807
01:22:53,878 --> 01:22:55,913
[Chaehyun] <i>I'll send you back home, Ohgon.</i>

1808
01:22:56,914 --> 01:22:58,516
Let's go, Ohgon!

1809
01:22:59,917 --> 01:23:02,653
[♪ epic music playing]

1810
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:05,823
[Ohgon] <i>I'm going to</i>
<i>drop Chaehyun for sure.</i>

1811
01:23:06,991 --> 01:23:09,694
[Gyuwon] Boxing is about
that one percent chance.

1812
01:23:09,761 --> 01:23:12,130
The tables can turn at any moment.

1813
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:14,699
-[bell dings]
-Box!

1814
01:23:14,766 --> 01:23:16,000
KWON OHGON X LEE CHAEHYUN

1815
01:23:16,067 --> 01:23:18,469
The eighth and final round begins.

1816
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:20,004
[person] Do what you've been doing!

1817
01:23:20,471 --> 01:23:21,472
[Seungheon] Kwon closes in.

1818
01:23:21,539 --> 01:23:22,673
[person] Yes, that's it!

1819
01:23:23,808 --> 01:23:25,243
[audience gasping]

1820
01:23:26,077 --> 01:23:27,512
[Gyuwon] Yes, that straight!

1821
01:23:31,649 --> 01:23:32,717
[audience exclaims]

1822
01:23:34,886 --> 01:23:36,621
Lee Chaehyun is still going strong!

1823
01:23:36,687 --> 01:23:38,656
Whoa, did you see him spin him around?

1824
01:23:39,624 --> 01:23:41,426
Damn, that was amazing.

1825
01:23:43,661 --> 01:23:45,496
[Gyuwon] Just when his opponent is
about to charge,

1826
01:23:45,563 --> 01:23:47,565
Lee spins him around and strikes!

1827
01:23:50,868 --> 01:23:51,969
[person] Slowly! The rear hand!

1828
01:23:52,036 --> 01:23:54,105
-That's it!
-[Gyuwon] They're throwing nonstop!

1829
01:23:54,172 --> 01:23:56,607
That's insane strength
coming from Lee Chaehyun!

1830
01:23:57,208 --> 01:23:59,310
Great going, Chaehyun!

1831
01:23:59,377 --> 01:24:00,445
Let's go!

1832
01:24:00,511 --> 01:24:03,481
Kwon Ohgon! Kwon Ohgon!

1833
01:24:03,548 --> 01:24:04,549
Go in on him!

1834
01:24:08,619 --> 01:24:10,221
[Seungheon] He slips out to the side!

1835
01:24:11,122 --> 01:24:13,291
And drives in a big left hand!

1836
01:24:13,357 --> 01:24:16,794
[Gyuwon] Lee's speed is still there,
but so is Kwon's raw strength!

1837
01:24:17,328 --> 01:24:19,097
Yes, Ohgon, that's your game right there.

1838
01:24:19,163 --> 01:24:21,766
-Yes, that's his only option now.
-That's his game.

1839
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:24,168
-Let's go, Chaehyun!
-Let's go, Chaehyun!

1840
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:26,604
[Gyuwon] And the left connects!

1841
01:24:27,839 --> 01:24:30,341
He works the body, then goes upstairs!

1842
01:24:30,842 --> 01:24:32,176
[exclaiming]

1843
01:24:33,978 --> 01:24:35,546
Lee strikes a combo!

1844
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:36,614
[spectator] Go, Chaehyun!

1845
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:38,549
Lee's not backing down.

1846
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:40,952
[Gyuwon] That's amazing.

1847
01:24:41,018 --> 01:24:42,453
He's still got gas in the tank!

1848
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,956
-Let's go, Chaehyun!
-Let's go, Chaehyun!

1849
01:24:45,423 --> 01:24:46,691
Let's go, Ohgon!

1850
01:24:46,757 --> 01:24:48,259
Go for it now!

1851
01:24:50,094 --> 01:24:51,662
[Gyuwon] Lee still has power in the tank.

1852
01:24:51,729 --> 01:24:52,997
What's Kwon's next move?

1853
01:24:53,064 --> 01:24:56,200
Kwon's still trying
to win it with strength.

1854
01:24:56,267 --> 01:24:58,669
Lee cleverly strikes upstairs
and backs out.

1855
01:25:00,838 --> 01:25:02,707
This is the final round.

1856
01:25:02,773 --> 01:25:05,276
They must keep it simple and just fight.

1857
01:25:05,343 --> 01:25:07,512
[person] Make it count! Don't waste it!

1858
01:25:09,213 --> 01:25:13,217
[Gyuwon] Lee Chaehyun has figured out
Kwon Ohgon's right hook trajectory.

1859
01:25:13,284 --> 01:25:14,285
[groans]

1860
01:25:18,022 --> 01:25:20,691
[Seungheon] And he's slipping Kwon's shots
with smooth upper-body movement!

1861
01:25:24,529 --> 01:25:25,730
[Lee] Ohgon's tired now.

1862
01:25:26,264 --> 01:25:29,133
Kwon can't let the pressure get to him!
He has to stay composed!

1863
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,235
Look at Chaehyun move.
His stamina is insane.

1864
01:25:31,302 --> 01:25:32,303
He's unreal.

1865
01:25:32,803 --> 01:25:34,505
[Seungheon] It's not over until it's over!

1866
01:25:34,572 --> 01:25:36,674
Anything can change in a heartbeat!

1867
01:25:38,276 --> 01:25:41,078
Kwon Ohgon closes in as he throws!

1868
01:25:41,145 --> 01:25:42,313
[person] That's it!

1869
01:25:45,449 --> 01:25:46,484
All right!

1870
01:25:47,185 --> 01:25:48,419
Last round!

1871
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,154
Keep going till the end!

1872

KWON OHGON X LEE CHAEHYUN

1873
01:25:54,091 --> 01:25:56,460
You're doing awesome! Stay sharp!

1874
01:25:56,527 --> 01:25:57,895
Let's go, Ohgon!

1875
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:03,601
[Gyuwon] Time's almost up!

1876
01:26:04,202 --> 01:26:05,603
Lee Chaehyun versus Kwon Ohgon!

1877
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:10,074
Lee Chaehyun's footwork is still alive!
Last ten seconds!

1878

-And that's the end of the bout!

Lee Chaehyun versus Kwon Ohgon!

1880

Man, this was…

1881
01:26:32,797 --> 01:26:34,098
This was intense.

1882
01:26:34,165 --> 01:26:35,533
You did great, Pro Killer!

1883
01:26:36,434 --> 01:26:38,769
You did awesome, Ohgon!

1884
01:26:39,870 --> 01:26:41,806
We will now announce the result.

1885
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:44,041

The winner of this bout is…

[Ohgon] <i>The championship belt is</i>
<i>within reach.</i>

1891
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:03,761
<i>And it's mine to take.</i>

[cheering, squealing]

1896
01:27:22,713 --> 01:27:26,584
First of all, I'd like to thank Kwon Ohgon

1897
01:27:26,651 --> 01:27:28,386
for sharing the ring with me today.

1898
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:30,087
Actually…

1899
01:27:30,721 --> 01:27:34,091
today marks the one-year anniversary

1900
01:27:34,825 --> 01:27:37,395
of my grandfather's passing.

1901
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:40,164
[♪ emotional music playing]

1902
01:27:41,966 --> 01:27:45,136
After sending him off last year

1903
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:48,973
and pushing through a difficult time,

1904
01:27:49,507 --> 01:27:54,312
I'm grateful to be standing on a stage
this honorable just one year later.

1905
01:27:54,378 --> 01:27:57,615
I'm incredibly overwhelmed

1906
01:27:57,682 --> 01:27:58,983

[applause]

1908
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:08,326
So I'd like to dedicate today's victory

1909
01:28:09,126 --> 01:28:11,829
to my grandfather watching from above,

1910
01:28:11,896 --> 01:28:15,666
and to my family
who are here to support me.

1911
01:28:15,733 --> 01:28:17,001
I love you, all!

1912
01:28:27,912 --> 01:28:30,748
To me, boxing isn't just about the fight.

1913
01:28:30,815 --> 01:28:34,185
To me, it's an incredible sport
that shows perseverance and determination.

1914
01:28:34,652 --> 01:28:35,786
Here, in the arena…

1915
01:28:38,389 --> 01:28:39,390
My family is here.

1916

Including my son,
who's around 14 months old now.

KWON HORANG
OHGON'S SON

1918
01:28:49,066 --> 01:28:51,402
He's probably too young to know

1919
01:28:51,969 --> 01:28:54,839
what his dad does and why he is here.

1920
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:58,275
But someday, when he watches this,

1921
01:28:58,342 --> 01:29:00,678
I hope he'll think,

1922
01:29:00,745 --> 01:29:03,314
"I'm so proud of my dad."

1923
01:29:03,381 --> 01:29:05,249
I love you so much, Horang.

1924
01:29:05,316 --> 01:29:06,317

1936
01:29:49,326 --> 01:29:52,530
It was an honor to have faced

1937
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:53,898
such amazing fighters.

1938
01:29:53,964 --> 01:29:55,299
<i>As an amateur boxer,</i>

Thunder, Kwon Ohgon!

1951
01:30:31,702 --> 01:30:35,039
Will it be Kwon Ohgon's aggression,
or Kim Minuk's cold precision?

1952
01:30:37,575 --> 01:30:39,710
Saja, Myung Hyunman!

Tyson, Hong Sungmin!

01:30:42,446 --> 01:30:44,748
