4
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:35,535
This is the<i> I Am Boxer </i>deathmatch,
and we're down to the final bout.

5
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,104
It's finally the last one.

6
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,241
Now, these two
must've sparked the question,

7
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,510
-"Who'd win if they squared off?"
-Yes.

8
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:45,211
-Here we go.
-It's a big match.

9
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,679
Here we go, the real deal.

10
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:48,681
[Chaehyun] It's a giant versus a giant.

11
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,685
[Jongkook] Myung Hyunman from the blue
corner versus Julien Kang from the red.

12
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,788
They're facing off in this deathmatch.

13
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,790
Oh!

14
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,359
Unbelievable.

15
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,760
Feels like a knockout is coming.

16
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,796
This is the kind of matchup
you only dream about.

17
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,431
And now, we actually get to see it.

18
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,901
I'm sure the viewers have been
waiting for this matchup.

19

[Jongkook] All right.
Please get ready for the fight.

[contestant 1] <i>He's built for strength.</i>

[contestant 2] <i>You don't see</i>

24
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,416
[contestant 3] <i>Look at those shoulders.</i>

25
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,752
[contestant 4] <i>Julien's got a crazy reach.</i>

26
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,120

<i>I'm just gonna go all the way.</i>

29
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:33,493

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,629
[Hyunman] <i>I thought I'd better</i>

35

[cheering]

36
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,879
-[contestant] Just use the jab a lot!
-The ring looks small.

37
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:59,352
[contestants exclaiming] Hey! Oh!

38
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,123
[contestant 4]
Every shot looks so damn powerful.

39
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,191
A punch like that could kill you.

40
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:07,827
Yeah, if that overhand right lands.

41
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,463
[contestant 1]
If one of those lands, it's over.

42
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,831
[contestant 2] They punch like…

43
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,466
[contestant 3]
I'm shaking just watching this.

44
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,034
[contestant 4] One shot could drop them.

45
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,104
[Jongkook]
Neither of them throws light punches.

46
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,474
[contestants exclaiming]

47
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,776
[contestant 5]
This is all about the one big shot.

48
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,313
-[contestant 6] Man, his reach is insane.
-[contestant 7] Those arms.

49
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,415
He's got knockout power.

50
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,752
Each shot looks so heavy.

51
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,954
[Seongjun]
Just watching heavyweights square off

52
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,290
gives you a thrill because of the tension.

53
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,959
[contestant 1] There's a reason
heavyweight fights are most popular.

54
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,060
Those huge swings…

55
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,862
-Oh, nice counter!
-[Donghee] That was close.

56
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,998
[Dongeon] This is terrifying.

57
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,533
-Seriously.
-I'm sweating.

58
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,236
[contestant 4] It's nerve-racking
even without many clean shots.

59
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,605
[contestant 5]
Imagine how tense they must be.

60
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,208
They're being extremely cautious.

61
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,510
-Because one clean shot could end it.
-Exactly.

62
00:02:57,577 --> 00:03:00,313
How do you jump in when you know
one shot could knock you out?

63
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,449
[contestants exclaiming]

64
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,518
That's gonna be tough to get through.

65
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,187
[contestant 2] His reach makes it hard.

66
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,455
[contestant 3] He can't step in
because the reach is too long.

67
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,057
[contestant 4]
He's good at keeping distance.

68
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,695
[Kang] <i>With heavyweights,</i>
<i>one clean shot, and you're done.</i>

69
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,965
<i>So I was just focused on</i>
<i>controlling the range.</i>

70
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,700
<i>When he stepped into my range,</i>

71
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,137
<i>I hit him with a right or a jab.</i>

72
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,874
[contestant 1]
It's tough to close the distance.

73
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,878
[Jongkook] This is easier for someone
who's good at controlling the range.

74
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,582
[contestant 2] Guess it's hard to
close in on Julien, even for Hyunman.

75
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,152
[contestant 4] How are his arms so long?

76
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,721
-[all exclaiming]
-Yeah, like that! Like that.

77
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,592
[contestant 6]
He's making good use of his long arms.

78
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,026
[contestant 7] His physicality is unreal.

79
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:50,196
-Julien's got freaking long arms.
-Too long.

80
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,365
-[chuckles] Seriously.
-Yeah, you can't find an opening.

81
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,900
He's doing better than I thought.

82
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,403
He's using his long reach
to his advantage.

83
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,671
-[blows land]
-Damn.

84
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,175
[contestants exclaim]

85
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,377
[contestant 1]
Man, it's like a cannon shot.

86
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,412
[contestants exclaim]

87
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,648
[contestant 2]
His punching power is insane.

88
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,416
-[contestant 3] That's a smart move.
-Push!

89
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:13,052
-[contestant 4] It's a smart move.
-[contestant 3] Clinching, huh?

90
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,554
[judge 1] It's a solid plan.

91
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:18,191
You can feel
how insanely strong they both are.

92
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,760
-Their strength is just…
-It's like…

93
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,731
[contestant 1] It's hard to fight someone
with that kind of body,

94
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,065
even if he's not a boxer.

95
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,068
[contestants exclaim]

96
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,170
[contestant 2] They can't step in easily.

97
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,973
-[contestant 3] Ten seconds!
-[referee exclaims]

98
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,676
[contestant 4]
I'd say whoever closes in first wins.

99
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,878
-Their punches are like nuclear bombs.
-[bell rings]

100
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,313
-[in English] Stop!
-[contestants applaud]

101
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,381
ROUND 1 IS OVER

102
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,650
[in Korean]
Julien's gonna stick to that game plan.

103
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:44,751
-Yeah, I bet.
-Hmm.

104
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,086
[chuckles]
Then you never know how it'll end.

105
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,821
He came up with a good plan.

106
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,490
Yeah, so Hyunman?

107
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,460
He should throw a jab
and then go for body shots.

108
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,262
Body shots, and then up to the head.

109
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,666
And if he closes in like that,
Julien should hit and move.

110
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:04,370
[Hyunman] <i>Julien Kang was</i>
<i>keeping his distance with his lead hand.</i>

111
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,106
It threw me off a bit,

112
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:11,344
and I had to figure out
how to get past it.

Julien Kang's got powerful punches too.

[contestant 3] Man, that was close.

129
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,652
[contestant 4]
That could've knocked him down.

130
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,488
[contestant 5] If one of those lands,
you're done. This is just…

131
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:59,025
Julien Kang keeps driving
those long shots in. [chuckles]

132
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,927
[contestant 1] That makes it one-nothing.

133
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,262
-[contestant 2] Yes, go again! Again!
-[contestant 3] You got this!

134
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,331
[contestant 4]
He just switched to southpaw.

135
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,133
That might actually work better for him.

-That's it!
-Push him off!

139
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,475
That's the right move.

140
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,144
He needs to switch to southpaw
and crack him with a hook.

141
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,881
[Hyunman] <i>I changed my stance</i>

Stay far away. Stay away from him.

500
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,833
[contestants exclaiming]

501
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,068
[Chaehyun] I'm nervous.

502
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,303
[Lee] Competing in the cage…

503
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,905
[♪ tense music plays]

504
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,206
…will be 10 fighters.

505
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,341
-What?
-Did he say 10?

506
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,309
Five matches.

507
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:45,377
Number one.

508
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,713
[contestant] That's the last one I want.

509
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,649
Come on, not me. Don't put me in the cage.

510
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,653
[contestant] I didn't want
to fight in the cage.

511
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,657
I was afraid
I'd just get hit nonstop and be done,

512
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,859
so I definitely
didn't want to end up in there.

513
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,296
[Taesun groans]
This really is nerve-racking.

514
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,599
-Myung Hyunman.
-[contestants exclaim]

515
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:08,667
Myung Hyunman.

516
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,469
-[contestants exclaim]
-[contestant 1] That's insane.

517
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:11,970
[contestant 2] This is bad.

518
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:14,206
-They're putting a bull in a chicken coop?
-[contestant 3 laughing]

519
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,774
[contestant 4] This is crazy.

520
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,376
[Youngho] It's gonna be a slaughterhouse.

521
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,578
-Gosh, seriously.
-That's brutal.

522
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,313
Man, that's brutal.

523
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,982
Anyone getting called after this…

524
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,050
[Dex laughs]

525
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,119
[Jongkook] I bet they're all praying
it's not them.

526
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:28,987
-[contestant laughs]
-This is scary as hell.

527
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,890
-Whoever goes up against him is dead.
-Right from the start?

528
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,625
[Hyunman] Now that I knew
I was going into the cage,

529
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,295
I was thinking,
"Whoever ends up in there with me,

530
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,596
I feel bad for them."

531
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:40,165
I was confident I could beat
anyone who challenges me.

532
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,600
Honestly.

533
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,001
Number two.

534
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,737
[Yunchan] If you go in there, you're dead
for real. They'll carry you out.

535
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,739
I have a bad feeling about this.

536
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,874
Not gonna be me, right?

537
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,975
[Jongkook] Kwon Ohgon!

538
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,010

KWON OHGON - LIGHTWEIGHT

540
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,881
-[contestant 1] Tough lineup.
-[Juyeong] Couldn't be worse.

541
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,050
[contestant 2] It's going to be
really tough.

542
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,751
Number three.

543
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,819
Man, this is…

544
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,322
-Kim Taesun.
-[contestants exclaiming]

545
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,057
[contestant 1]
Are all the good ones in this group?

KIM TAESUN - CURRENT

547
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,126
[contestant 2] They're all pro boxers.

548
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,795
In that case, Kim Minuk should also…

549
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,964
I've had enough of that guy. [chuckles]

550
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,099
Number four.

551
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,233
Kim Hyunjun.

552
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,002

00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,144
Coach!

559
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,613
-The lineup's no joke.
-Yeah, you don't want to go there.

560
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,681
[Jongkook] Lee Daeyoung.

561
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,450
-[contestants exclaiming]
-Oh, man.

562
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,585
[contestant 3] A man full of surprises.

563
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,888
Guess this is as far as I go.

564
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:37,956
[Jongkook] Lim Yunchan!

565
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,057
LIM YUNCHAN

566
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,125

MOON JIHYEOK
PACQUIAO'S INTERPRETER

571
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,466
They're all tough fighters.

572
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,968
The kind who stand their ground
and trade heavy shots.

573
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,503
I'm scared.

574
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,704
[Jongkook] Lastly, number 10!

575
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,806
Boy, seriously…

576
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,141
[laughing]

577
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,943
They're all in the same group?

578
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,611
[contestant] There hasn't been
another heavyweight.

579
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,114
[Youngho] I bet they're all thinking,
"Not me."

580
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,116
Anyone but me, please.

581
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:05,350
Please.

582
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,352
[Jongkook] Lastly, number 10!

583
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,288
Kim Donghoe.

584
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,224

585
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,825
KIM DONGHOE
14-TIME KNSF CHAMP BOXING GHOST

586
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,060
This is absolutely insane.

587
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,728
[contestant 2]
Why's the lineup so tough here?

588
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,731
[contestants exclaiming]

589
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:20,899
You're kidding.

590
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:24,236
There's only one fighter
I'm worried about.

591
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,303
Kim Donghoe.

592
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:26,972
[sighs]

593
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:31,009
[Donghoe] Myung Hyunman was
one of the guys who got called.

594
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,577
He's the one I'm watching out for.

595
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:36,515
These 10 fighters
will have their match in the cage.

596
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,283
[contestants cheering]

597
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,985
-Go, Yunchan!
-You got this!

598
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:42,287
CAGE RING

599
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,455
[Dex] Let me announce

600
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:48,160
the eight fighters for the second ring,
the aqua ring.

601
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,628
Eight?

602
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,464
[Junseo] I was hoping
I'd get a shot at it.

603
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,733
You never see a setup like that
anywhere else.

604
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,902
[Dowoon] It's going to be
the sexiest fight ever.

605
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,707
Number one, Kim Minuk.

606
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:03,909
[contestants exclaiming]

607
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,177
[contestant 1] That's gonna be cool.

608
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:07,479
[contestant 2] It suits him.
He's got that cinematic boxer vibe.

609
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,148
[Youngho] Imagine him boxing
in pouring rain. It's gonna be fire.

610
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,950
This is really gonna look awesome.

611
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,152
-[Dex] Yuk Junseo.
-[contestants exclaiming]

612
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,887
[Sungwoon] UDT, let's get it.

613
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,590
-UDT fighting in water? Sounds right.
-It's gonna be cool.

614
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,358
Are they just picking good-looking guys?

615
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:21,693
[Dex] Kim Taekmin.

616
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,928
KIM TAEKMIN
STAR ROOKIE

617
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:25,497
I told you.
With the gloves on, you're the coolest.

618
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,066
-[Dex] Kuk Seungjun.

KIM DONGHYUN

624
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,275
-His hair's gonna get super curly.
-Yeah, you're right. [laughs]

625
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:38,343
Right?

626
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,578
[Dex] Lee Dowoon.

627
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,812
LEE DOWOON
ACTOR

628
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,080
They're pretty tough too.

629
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,749
I'm getting fired up now.

630
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,951
-You are?
-Yeah.

631
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,720
-I want to show them.
-Lastly,

632
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,423
number eight.

633
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,058
Hong Sungmin.

634
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,727
-[contestants exclaim]
-Hey, that's gonna be fun.

635
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,964
HONG SUNGMIN
3-TIME KNSF CHAMPION

636
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,232
Well, there are…

637
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,601
There are so many tough ones
in that group.

638
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,769
But their styles all match up.

639
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,572
Damn, I'm gonna be fighting him, aren't I?
I knew it.

640
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,574
[groans]

641
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,843
-Kim Taekmin's in that group.
-I know.

642
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,614
You can kind of see
those two getting matched up.

643
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,516
They've actually had a match before.

644
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:18,783
He lost.

645
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,385
-Hong Sungmin lost?
-Yeah.

646
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,721
[Dex] Is Kim Taekmin really that good?

647
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:23,922
-[Lee] He is.
-[Jongkook] He is.

648
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,958
[Sungmin] I'm not sure who'd win
if I went up against Kim Taekmin.

649
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:30,095
But I'll have to face him
sooner or later anyway.

AQUA RING

651
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,800
Guess the rest of them
are doing two-on-two.

652
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,469
-So we're all doing tag-team?
-Yeah.

653
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,570
Shoot, tag-team?

654
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,339
The tag-team match was my top pick.

655
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:45,343
I'm pretty good at stepping in and out,

656
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,113
so I felt confident about the range fight.

657
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,714
With our skill? No way we'll lose.

658
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:50,982
[Hyunjae] Definitely not.

659
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,352
If I'm teaming up with you,
that actually works better.

660
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:55,820
It's a two-on-two fight

661
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,757
with three 4-minute rounds.

662
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:02,127
I'm confident in managing the clock
and outthinking them.

668
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,710
[chuckles] The matchups are important.

00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,546
More important than which ring they're in.

670
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,248
The first fighter is

671
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,084
Kuk Seungjun.

please step forward.

687
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:09,527
[Lee] Will anyone challenge him?

688
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,596
-[laughs]
-[contestants exclaiming]

689
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,199
He went for it.
He's actually down for this?

690
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,267
[exclaiming continues]

691
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,840

-You're the man!
-Cool.

693
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,477
[contestant 1] This is crazy.

694
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,544
We get to see this?

695
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,513
[contestant 3] This is a big match.

696
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,949
[contestant 4] Feels
like the finals already.

697
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,885
Guess it's gonna be another fight
you'd pay to watch.

EPISODE 4
STEP IN, NOW!

706
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,355
Here we go, the first match.

707
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,125
From what I saw earlier,
the rain was pouring pretty hard.

708
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,562
Fighters who rely on quick reads

709
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,898
or do a lot of slip-and-rips

710
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,200
-might get affected.
-Yeah.

711
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,536
-There'll be a lot of factors at play.
-You're right.

712
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,471
It's hard to predict.

713
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,239
It's going to mess up your vision.

714
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,075
You're right. If your hair gets wet,

715
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:31,976
-it'll fall in your face.
-Exactly.

716
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,778
Once it starts raining,

717
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,980
will your shots get less accurate?

718
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,551
I think the worst part would be
the water getting in your eyes.

719
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,586
-It's gonna feel refreshing.
-I know.

720
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,888
[Minuk] It might
actually perk you back up.

[Lee] He's got a nice physique.

730
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,281
I hear he works out all the time.

731
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,450
[Jongkook] He didn't build
that body for show,

732
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,419
-but to use power.
-[Dex] Real fighting muscle.

733
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:16,921
He's won all seven of his fights in KSAF.

734
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,458
-That fireman was in the special forces.
-[contestant] Oh, was he?

Nice physicality.

742
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,910

SOLDIER TURNED FIREMAN
KIM DONGHYUN

745
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:43,915
Is he an out-boxer?

746
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,216
Seungjun? No, an infighter.

747
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,219
He stands his ground
and digs in with his shots.

748
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,587
Heavy, painful shots.

749
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,857
-He presses forward on anyone he faces.
-[breathes heavily]

[Donghyun] <i>Actually,</i>
<i>I knew who Kuk Seungjun was.</i>

751
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,465
He won gold at the KNSF
and tried out for the national team.

752
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,034
<i>He still trains with a works team.</i>

753
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,636
But I think

754
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:08,106
<i>he might actually let his guard down.</i>

755

<i>Pro or amateur,</i>

<i>I can beat them.</i>

I'm not gonna lose.
I'll fight till the end.

759
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,022
I'll treat this as my stage to shine
and prove myself.

-All right!
-You got this!

761

-[contestants exclaiming]
-[chuckles]

768
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,240
Some people do think it's about muscles.

-Yeah, I've seen plenty.
-[laughs]

770
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,511
Why do I feel attacked? [chuckles]

771
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:47,846
Why do I…

772
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:51,049
I'm into competitive boxing,

773
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:54,519
so someone who just boxes for fun
wouldn't really be a match for me.

774
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:55,987

-Keep your distance!
-Wait, what?

790
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,855
The fireman's no soft touch.

791
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,558
They're going at it from the start?
That's wild.

792
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,528
What? He's so good.

793
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,030
He could knock him out with that.

794
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:43,268
[Donghyun] <i>Because the ring was flooded,</i>

795
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,736
<i>our feet got tied down.</i>

796

<i>I was confident in my stamina,</i>

<i>so I figured</i>
<i>I should keep pressing forward.</i>

798
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:57,582
Looks like Kim Donghyun's plan
is to throw big swings.

799
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:58,750
Those could knock you out.

800
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:00,251
That's knockout stuff.

801
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:09,260
[Seungjun] <i>I simply thought the water on</i>
<i>the floor would just bother me a little,</i>

802
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,195
but it was surprisingly hard to deal with.

803
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,764
[contestant 1] Stay calm!

804
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,533
[contestant 2] They can't do
those quick, light steps.

805
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,868
It's hard to back up.

806
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,969
Going forward is easier.

807
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,972
[Seungjun] <i>If you move around</i>
<i>too much with your footwork,</i>

808
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,008
<i>you could slip,</i>

00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,810
<i>and that slip</i>

810
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,579
<i>could even lead to a knockdown.</i>

811
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,915

Looking great!

817
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,663
[contestant 1] That's crazy.

818
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,165

-[contestant 2] Yeah, <i>Nowhere to Hide</i>.

829
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,529
Now this is the stuff that fires you up.

830
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,802
They're fighting like
this is a single-round fight.

831
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,404
[contestant 1] They should save
their energy.

832
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,439
[contestant 2] Keep going till the end!

833
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:29,974
Nice body shot.

834
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,176
[contestant] Go to the body!
The body, Seungjun!

835
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,412
-Oh, nice body shot.
-Good one.

836
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,748
Kuk Seungjun is known for
his killer body shots.

837
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,683
Oh, so he's good at body shots?

838
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,185
[Lee] He needs
to rest, but Kim won't let him.

839
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,354
-He won't let him breathe.
-[Jongkook] He won't get off him.

840
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,658
[Donghyun] <i>When I took that body shot,</i>

841
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,462
-<i>it really threw me off.</i>
-[contestant exclaims]

842
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,598
[contestant 1] How is he
still standing after that?

843
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,667
[contestants exclaiming]

844
00:33:58,302 --> 00:33:59,804
He landed quite a few shots there.

845
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,375
-[bell dings]
-Stop!

846
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,111
-[contestants clamoring]
-[contestant 1] That was cool. So cool.

847
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:08,913
That was so cool.

848
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,349
[contestant 3] The grit.

849
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,117
[Youngho] That was amazing.

850
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:14,752
Awesome.

851
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:15,953
What a fight.

852
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,322
See that? He just keeps going like this.

853
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,658
Kim Donghyun had a close call there.

854
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,026
Those body shots, though.

855
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,229
Kuk landed it
right as Kim threw his right.

856
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:28,032
He throws it with both his left and right.

857
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,400
[Jongkook] That piles on the damage.

858
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,170
If you get clipped after that,
you're done.

859
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,871
<i>I had only one thought.</i>

860
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:35,206
Body shots all the way.

861
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,475
Aiming for a body-shot KO

862
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,377
<i>and going in hot</i>

863
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,345
<i>as an infighter.</i>

864
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,283
He took, like, 15 body shots.
I'm not kidding.

865
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,618
-The guy can take hits.
-He's holding up well.

866
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,889
[Donghyun] <i>I just kept telling myself,</i>
<i>"You can do this."</i>

867
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,158
The fact that I didn't go down
when he hit me

868
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,027
meant I could take it.

869
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,097
<i>So I thought, "Just hold up till the end."</i>

870
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,231
<i>"You've got this."</i>

871
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,439
ROUND 2 OF 3
KUK SEUNGJUN X KIM DONGHYUN

872
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:09,507
-[bell dings]
-Box!

873
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,110
Yes, keep pushing in.
Keep pushing in, and bang!

874
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,145
[contestants exclaiming]

875
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,713
You're doing great, Donghyun!

876
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,751
-Right from the start again?
-[contestant 4] They're going at it.

877
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,888
[exclaiming continues]

878
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,126
[contestant 5] That's some crazy stamina.
He keeps driving in.

879
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:33,664
-Oh, boy.
-All right!

880
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,800
[contestant 7] They've
both got amazing stamina.

881
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,572
[Jihyeok] Let's go!

882
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,908
[exclaims] You got him!

883
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,710
Man, he's got a great punch.

884
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,881
[Seungjun] <i>I was really trying to finish</i>
<i>the fight, throwing with everything I had.</i>

885
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,316
But he just wouldn't go down.

886
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,885
[contestant] Cover up your body!

887
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:00,925
Oh, that uppercut.

888
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:03,995
-His durability, though.
-I know, right?

889
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,164
[Seungjun] <i>When I land clean body shots,</i>

890
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,000
<i>even pros can't take them.</i>

891
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,269
<i>But he was actually countering them,</i>

892
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:15,106
<i>and I took a lot of shots</i>
<i>I didn't see coming.</i>

893
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,575
Don't let him hit you!

894
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,644
[contestants exclaiming]

895
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:21,946
[contestant] Nice uppercut.

896
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,850
Kim's throwing uppercuts knowing his chin
opens up when he goes to the body.

897
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,518
Those uppercuts are dangerous.

898
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,755
-Let's go!
-All right!

899
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,559
-[exclaims]
-[Hyunman grunts]

900
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:37,728
He's getting hit.

901
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:40,998
[Jongkook] He's got
a great short-range shot.

902
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,001
He's putting up a really good fight.

903
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,604
How's the fireman so good?
He's not even a pro.

904
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,545
[contestant 1] Oh, nice body shot!

905
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:55,913
Nice body shot!

906
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,518
-He caught him.
-[exclaim]

907
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,122
[exclaim]

908
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,191
-That looked bad.
-He just took three shots.

909
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:08,292
He's not going down.

910
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,061
-Cover up your body!
-He was doing so well.

911
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:16,634
[Lee] He's got great stamina,
and he just won't stop firing.

912
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,069
[Jongkook] He's throwing nonstop.

913
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,905
[Lee] He moves his head as he punches,
and that's great.

914
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,941
[Donghyun] <i>I've never fought</i>
<i>a trained competitive boxer before,</i>

915
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:28,446
<i>but if I just keep pushing in</i>
<i>and stay on him like glue,</i>

916
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,314
<i>I might find an opening.</i>

917
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,553
[contestant] You're awesome, Mr. Fireman!

918
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,655
Looks like he's getting a bit tired,

919
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,056
but he's still throwing.

920
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,261
-Ten seconds!
-Keep going till the end!

921
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,762
Keep going till the end!

922
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,401
[contestants exclaim]

923
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,537
[contestant 1] That one landed clean.

924
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,972
This is crazy.

925
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,843
ROUND 2 OF 3
KUK SEUNGJUN X KIM DONGHYUN

926
00:37:58,909 --> 00:37:59,910
-[bell dings]
-Stop!

927
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,979
[contestants exclaiming]

928
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,317
-Wow.
-That was cool.

929
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,253
He's still standing after that?

930
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:11,555
That's amazing.

931
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,992
-That's fighting spirit.
-He's got real grit.

932
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,229
When Kuk Seungjun digs to the body
and throws uppercuts,

933
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,630
they come whipping in from behind.

934
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:21,666
-That swing is so…
-Like this.

935
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,534
It's pretty unique.

936
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,836
[Lee] It's called a bolo punch.

937
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,505
You find the right timing.

938
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,874
With your left hand,
you dip and bring it up like this.

939
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,342
Yeah, he didn't even feint.

940
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,644
Kim Donghyun's holding up really well.

941
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:36,347
[Dex] He's
like a zombie that won't go down.

942
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,283
[contestant 1] Those shots were
powerful enough to drop him.

943
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,786
[contestant 2] He's got a chin,
but it's really his mental strength.

944
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:44,021
Honestly,
I'd already hit my limit by then.

945
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,957
<i>I'd taken too many body shots.</i>

946
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:49,894
<i>It was getting hard to breathe,</i>
<i>and I felt weak in the knees.</i>

947
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,197
<i>I kept thinking about</i>
<i>dropping to my knees,</i>

948
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,166
but I'm here representing firefighters.

949
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,502
If I keep fighting to the end
without going down,

950
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,071
then people

951
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,774
might see us as more dependable.

952
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,878
<i>That thought kept me going.</i>

953
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:11,949
-Let's go, Mr. Fireman! Keep going!
-[contestant 2] Come on!

954
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,352
-[contestant 3] Just keep going!
-[contestant 4] Go, Mr. Fireman!

955
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,721
-This is the last one!
-Don't give up!

956
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:17,788
[contestant 7] Let's go!

957
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,623
Keep going! Keep going!

958
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,958
Last one!

959
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,130
[bell dings]

960
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,631
-Box!
-[contestant 1] You got this!

961
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,133
[contestant 2] Focus!

962
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,035
[contestant 3] Nice jab.

963
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,972
-He's got crazy stamina.
-You got this!

964
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,074
-[contestant 6] Seungjun!
-Now it's all mental!

965
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,879
[contestants exclaiming]

966
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,914
-That one landed.
-Way to go!

967
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,357
[contestants exclaiming]

968
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,896
[contestant 1] He's still holding up?

969
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,665
His mental strength is insane.

970
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,167
-[contestant 3] Go, Seungjun!
-Let's go!

971
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,869
[Seungjun] <i>I looked him in the eye</i>

972
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:06,937
<i>and saw the fight in him.</i>

973
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:11,308
<i>I had to give it to him.</i>
<i>His mental strength is unreal.</i>

974
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:15,880
<i>I figured if I let my guard down,</i>
<i>I might be the one going down.</i>

975
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,415
[contestants] Let's go!

976
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,183
[Jongkook] Wow, that's real boxing.

977
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,152
Go, Mr. Fireman!

978
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:22,753
[contestant 1] Don't give up, Donghyun!

979
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,424
-Yes! Damn, that body shot.
-This is it!

980
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,491
[contestant 3] Go, Seungjun!

981
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:30,761
[Lee] Seungjun is leaving it
all out there too. He's fighting hard.

982
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,063
[contestants exclaiming]

983
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,498
[contestant 1] Focus, both of you!

984
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:37,435
-It's all mental!
-Keep going!

985
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,537
Show us what firefighters are made of!

ROUND 3 OF 3

00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,406
-Ninety seconds!
-Keep going!

988
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,408
-This is it!
-Don't give up!

989
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,544
[contestant 5] Hold on!
Stay with it and focus!

990
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:52,416
[contestants exclaiming]

991
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,189
They're really giving it their all.

992
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,890
[contestant gasps]

993
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,292
Push through!

994
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,461
-They look gassed.
-This is it!

995
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:07,264
[contestant 4] They're really amazing.

996
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,466
[contestant 5] It's almost over!

997
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:09,600
You're almost there!

998
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,969
That's pure mental strength.

999
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,107
[contestant 1] Man, that's real grit.

1000
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,876
-Box!
-[contestant 1] This is a great fight.

1001
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,845
[contestant 2] Come on,
come on! Keep going!

1002
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,613
Keep going! No regrets!

1003
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,181
[Lee] See that? He's still throwing.

1004
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:25,716
-Right, it's incredible.
-Yeah.

1005
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,987
[Dex] Wait, Kuk Seungjun is exhausted too.

1006
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,121
-He is.
-He's exhausted.

1007
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:33,257
He's tired too!

1008
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,659
It's not about technique now!
Just keep throwing!

1009
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:36,727
It's all instinct now.

1010
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,697
[contestants exclaiming]

1011
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,302
-That's it!
-Keep going till the end!

1012
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,171
-Don't go down.
-Don't give up!

1013
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,240
Wow, how do you…

1014
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:53,010
-I admire them, seriously.
-This is epic. Let's go!

1015
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,213
[contestant 1] It's almost over!

1016
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,648
[contestant 2] It's all instinct now!

1017
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,717
[contestants panting]

1018
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,889
[contestant 1] Keep going till the end!

1019
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,590
-Ten seconds!
-Gotta keep going!

1020
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:07,658
[contestant] Ten seconds!

1021
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,260
Ten seconds! Show us!

1022
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,961
[Seungjun] <i>I gotta finish it.</i>

1023
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:12,763
<i>Let's fight to the end.</i>

1024
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,266
[contestants panting, grunting]

1025
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,335
Come on, keep throwing!

1026
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,703
Final push!

1027
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,840
[contestants exclaiming]

1028
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:28,279
ROUND 3 OF 3
KUK SEUNGJUN X KIM DONGHYUN

1029
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:29,346
[contestant] That was insane.

1030
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:30,948
-[contestants cheering]
-[applause]

1031
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:32,149
[contestant 1] You were awesome!

1032
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,154
[cheering]

1033
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,793
That was really… [chuckles]

1034
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,094
[contestant 1] That was insane.

1035
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:45,696
[contestant 2] What a fight.

1036
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:47,798
[contestant 3] That was incredible.

1037
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:51,802
That's the real Korean Zombie right there.

1038
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,205
[contestant 5] Impressive!

1039
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,745
[Dex] Wow, that's so cool.

1040
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,147
[contestant 6] That's sportsmanship.

1041
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,485
There are fights that are fun,
and fights that are cool.

1042
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,521
[contestant 7] This one was
both fun and cool.

1043
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,625
[Lee] You were really, really awesome.
Both of you.

1044
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,927
-[Jongkook] Seriously.
-[Lee] It was like watching a movie.

1045
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,397
By judges' decision…

1046
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:26,437
[Donghyun] <i>I think I showed everything</i>
<i>I came here ready to show.</i>

1047
00:43:26,503 --> 00:43:28,038
<i>I have no regrets.</i>

1048
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,774
[Seungjun] <i>He was such a tough opponent,</i>

1049
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,177
<i>and I really gave it everything I had.</i>

1050
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:35,479
The winner is…

1051
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,484
-Kuk Seungjun from the red corner.
-[contestants clamoring]

1052
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,987
-[contestant 1] You put up a good fight!
-[contestant 2] Nicely done!

1053
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,856
-[contestant 3] That's so cool.
-[contestant 4] Well done, both of you.

1054
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,591
[contestant 5] That was
a highlight moment.

1055
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:49,326
He put up a hell of a fight.

1056
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:53,831
[chuckles, sighs] Kim Donghyun fought
so well.

1057
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:55,866
It was a great fight. Thank you.

1058
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,968
[Jongkook gasps, chuckles]

1059
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:01,538
Kim Donghyun, you were really awesome.

1060
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:05,743
Although my fight
in the boxing ring ends today,

1061
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,146
out there on the job, in my real ring,

1062
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,482
-I'll keep fighting even harder.
-[contestants cheering]

1063
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:12,683
Thank you.

1064
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,084
[contestant 1] Go get 'em!

1065
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,953
-You're the best!
-You're amazing!

1066
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,389
-Man, that was insane.
-[contestant 4] Go get 'em!

1067
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:20,524
Hunsu, you said you wanted
to be a fireman, right?

1068
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,526
-Yeah, and now I want it even more.
-[chuckles]

1069
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:24,328
I'm definitely becoming a fireman.

1070
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,698
Boy, next up we've got
two orthodox infighters.

1071
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:28,766
-Both of them?
-Yeah.

1072
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,535
Their reach, weight, and everything else…

1073
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:33,637
-They're similar, right?
-[Jongkook] They are.

1074
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:36,140
[Dex] They have a lot in common.

-A good-looking pair.

1086

Handsome guy.

1087
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:07,538
[contestant 1] He looks so good.

1088
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,174
[contestant 2] It's like he's
right out of a movie.

1089
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,813
[contestant 3] Do you know
the other guy's background?

1090
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,548
-He's just a regular guy.
-[exhales sharply]

1091
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:21,585
In Round 1, he looked like
he had the basics down.

1092
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,788
Well, he wanted to join the boxing team
at a sports high school.

1093
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:29,727
[Jongkook] Anyone
who wants to challenge Lee Dowoon,

1094
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,495
please step forward.

1095
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,565
[Junseo] <i>It's important</i>
<i>who you get matched with</i>

1096
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,333
<i>since it's a one-on-one fight after all,</i>

1097
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,305
<i>so I challenged the guy</i>
<i>I thought I could beat.</i>

1098
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,442
[Dowoon] <i>Even when we had</i>
<i>90 people in Round 1,</i>

1099
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,178
Yuk Junseo was the one I wanted to fight.

1100
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,713
-[contestant 1] Hello.
-[contestant 2] Hi.

00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,885
-Could I get a handshake?
-Oh, sure.

1104
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,320
Pleasure to meet you.

00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,188
-I've watched your show.
-[Junseo] Really?

1106
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,490
Thank you.

1107
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:01,725
[Dowoon] You look unreal in person.

1108
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,796
[Dowoon] <i>Junseo and I are not boxers</i>
<i>by trade.</i>

1109
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:10,801
[contestant] He's fast.

00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,370
[contestants exclaim]

1111
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,639
I want a match with Yuk Junseo.

1112
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,509
His style's similar to mine.

1113
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,145
<i>I don't know about anything else,</i>

1114
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,714
<i>but I think I can beat him in boxing.</i>

1115
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,916
I felt totally fired up.

1116
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,352
I'm gonna get past you and move up.

1117
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:29,453
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

1118
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,023

-[contestant 2] All right!

1123
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:50,240
ROUND 1 OF 3
LEE DOWOON X YUK JUNSEO

1124
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:52,776
One-two! Let's get it!

1125
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,712
[contestants exclaiming]

1126
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:57,514
Coming in hot from the start, as expected.

1127
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:01,385
[contestant 1] He's just a born fighter.

1128
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,955
[contestants exclaiming]

1129
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,194
[Jongkook] He's just throwing nonstop.

1130
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:13,797
Junseo's got some serious strength.

1131
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,232
See? Born fighter.

1132
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:17,568
[contestant 1] I think he
just fights on instinct.

1133
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,274
[contestant 2] Wow, he's got a good punch.

1134
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,644
Looks like he's getting hit,

1135
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:30,080
but Lee's actually doing well,
keeping his guard tight.

1136
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,616
-He's reading his pattern.
-[Jongkook] He is. He's observing for now.

1137
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:38,689
[Dowoon] <i>It was my plan</i>
<i>to take a few shots at first.</i>

1138
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:41,558
<i>If he kept pressuring me like that,</i>

1139
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,729
<i>I figured I'd wait for him</i>
<i>to let his guard down</i>

1140
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,464
<i>and land a good counter.</i>

1141
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,335
[contestants exclaiming]

1142
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,305
-Oh!
-Watch out for the big ones!

1143
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,673
That's it. That's how you do it.

1144
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,578
[Dex] Good! Stay calm!

1145
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:05,849
He's holding his own.

1146
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,150
-All right, all right!
-Nice!

1147
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,086
[contestant 3] They're doing great.

1148
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,954
One minute and 30 seconds! Let's go!

1149
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:12,556
-Jab!
-Be confident!

1150
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:15,859
-Nice jab.
-Great!

1151
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,995
He keeps working the jab.

1152
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,566
He's got to dig in deeper.
It's not landing.

1153
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,905
[Junseo] <i>I was landing my jabs,</i>
<i>but my one-twos weren't connecting.</i>

1154
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:31,808
<i>They kept missing</i>
<i>or getting blocked when he rolled.</i>

1155
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:34,544
So I tried to be as accurate as I could.

1156
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,948
[contestant 1] All right!

1157
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,655
They're on a similar level.

1158
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,356
Not many of their shots are landing.

1159
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:47,891
Keep your guard up.

1160
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:50,694
Ten seconds!

1161
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,930
-[contestants exclaiming]
-[gasps]

1162
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,612
-He got Junseo.
-You got it!

1163
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,814
Go for the big one!
Cover up and go for the big one!

1164
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,783
-Go, get in there!
-Go, step in!

1165
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:15,085
-Go, go, go!
-This is it!

1166
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,720

-[referee] Stop!

00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,355
[Dex] That was a close call just now.

1168
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:22,025
He was wobbling for a second there.

1169
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,064
[Junseo] <i>I took a few big ones</i>

1170
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,966
<i>trying to close in.</i>

1171
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:31,768
<i>Going into Round 2,</i>
<i>I knew I had to get my head on straight.</i>

1172
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,504
First of all,
Yuk Junseo keeps working his jab.

1173
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:36,273
-He keeps throwing.
-[Lee] Yeah.

1174
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,342
He's keeping the range pretty well too.

1175
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,410
But Lee Dowoon's got the mental toughness.

1176
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,413
[Jongkook] He does,
but his shots are missing something.

1177
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,115
[Dex] He should throw more.

1178
00:49:48,051 --> 00:49:49,720
-Go, Junseo!
-Let's go!

1179
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:51,455
-You got this!
-Keep going like this!

1180
00:49:52,055 --> 00:49:53,390
[contestant 5] Go, Dowoon!

1181
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:54,591
[contestant 6] Let's go!

[contestant 3] Come on, let's go!

1185
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,900
-Dowoon, be confident!
-You've gotta go first!

1186
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:05,168
Just push in.

1187
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,005
-Yes, there you go!
-All right!

[contestant 1] All right, great!

1190
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:14,211
Good! Nice one.

1191
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:15,879
Don't just stand there!

1192
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,381
-There!
-Yes, that's it!

1193
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:19,916
Yes, that's how you throw it.

1194
00:50:21,618 --> 00:50:24,321
[Dex] Lee Dowoon's got real weight
behind shots like that.

1195
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:28,959
[Junseo] <i>He was landing a couple</i>
<i>of those big, dangerous shots,</i>

1196
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:33,563
<i>so I tried to keep my distance</i>
<i>and avoid them.</i>

1197
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,035
[contestant 1] Nice moves!

1198
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,670
[contestant 2] He looks
even more confident than his last fight.

1199
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,572

Pick up the pace!

1203

He ate that one!

1204

[contestant 1] Come on, let's go!

1205
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:56,653
[contestant 2] Go to the body!

1206
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,890
[contestant 3] Yuk Junseo's got
real power.

1207
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:01,958
See how he's going after him?

1208
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,799
[contestant 5] Junseo's got this round.

1209
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:10,834
That's got to hurt.

1210
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,403
[Lee] Dowoon, jab! You've gotta fire back.

1211
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,106
[contestant 1] You've gotta go now!
Go now!

1212
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,208
Don't just sit in guard! Fire back!

1213
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,377
[Lee] You've got to attack!

1214
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,445
[contestant 1] Dowoon, jab!

1215
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:23,313
You've got to use
every last bit of strength.

1216
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,882
-He shouldn't be backing up right now.
-[Jongkook] Exactly.

1217
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,785
Dowoon, you've got to throw more!

1218
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:35,826
[Dowoon] <i>Taking his shots for real,</i>
<i>they were so heavy.</i>

-Damn!
-Wow.

1220
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,831
They hurt and made my head spin.

1221
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,266
<i>I was shaken, to be honest.</i>

1222
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:46,803
It's not going well for Lee Dowoon.

1223
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:47,871
He's getting roped in.

1224
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:50,774
[contestant 1] Ten seconds!

1225
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,109
He's been waiting for too long.

1226
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,277
[Lee] Fight back! You've got to fire back!

1227
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:56,079
This isn't the time to wait!

1228
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:57,514
Dowoon, step in!

1229
00:51:58,715 --> 00:51:59,716
[contestant] All right!

1230
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,785
No, his shots aren't landing. See?

1231
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:04,054
You've gotta keep moving!

1232

00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:14,798
[contestant 2]
I think Yuk Junseo's gonna win.

1237
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:18,602

Lee Dowoon's shots weren't really landing.

[Junseo] <i>It was only three rounds,</i>

-Definitely.

They're one of the tough ones.

[contestant 5] Both KAFAC boxers.

They're the pride of the Korean army.

They're both from

I picked Cho Hyunjae straightaway.

1402
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,234
[Jongkook] They need to use their size.

1403
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,836
[Dex] Right, they need to use
their weight advantage.

1406
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:36,980
But I'm bigger than both of them,

1407
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:38,615
so I figured I'd just knock them out.

-[Jongkook] He is.
-Yeah.

It's not just his weight.

1428

-His reach too. He's much taller.
-[Lee] That's right.

1429
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:32,435
[Lee]
Chaehyun and Hyunjae are both out-boxers

Yes, that's it!

1497
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:56,112
-There you go!
-Hey, shoot it up!

1498
01:01:56,512 --> 01:01:58,448
The shots are not doing anything to him.

1499
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,283
[contestant 1] Now, up! Throw a hook!

1500
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:02,318
-That's it!
-[Youmin] Keep going like that!

1501
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,087
[contestant 3] Awesome!

1502
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:06,789
-Extend it!
-"Bring it on." [laughs]

1503
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:10,593
[Lee] He might think
those shots are ineffective,

1504
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:12,361
but they wear you out

1505
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:14,230
if you keep taking them.

1506
01:02:15,765 --> 01:02:17,500
-[Sungwoon] Keep it coming!
-[referee] No turning.

1507
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:20,369
[contestants exclaim]

1508
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:21,437
Keep it coming!

1509
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:22,505
[contestants exclaim]

1510
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,974
[all shouting]

1511
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,409
[Lee] Nice counter.

1512
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:27,643
[Jongkook] Slip and rip!

1513
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:28,978
That was a slip and uppercut.

1514
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,013
-Wow.
-[Dex] Just when he stepped in…

1515
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,215
[Jongkook] Slip and uppercut.

1516
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:36,085
It didn't seem like the right time,
but he was waiting for it.

1517
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:37,420
That's why he kept provoking.

1518
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:38,755
"Come at me."

1519
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,491
[Hyunjae] It's okay, it's okay!

1520
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:43,392
[contestants exclaim]

1521
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:45,661
Stay calm, Chaehyun! Stay calm!

1522
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:47,163
Hey, you're strong!

1523
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,397
You're doing great!

1524
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:49,465
[Hyunjae] Wanna switch?

1525
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:50,967
[Youmin] Keep going!

1526
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:54,771
-[contestant 1] Nice one!
-Great.

1527
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:56,706
[Youmin] Toongsoon, go to the body first!

1528
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,908
[Dex]
Wait, Park Sungwoon's looking a bit tired.

1529
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,209
-[Jongkook] Yeah.
-[Dex] He's…

1530
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,011
[Jongkook]
His punches are starting to lose steam.

1531
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:03,813
[Dex] He's getting tired now.

1532
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,149
He's starting to breathe heavy.

1533
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,117
Toongsoon, keep moving!

1534
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:10,620
-Chaehyun, quick shots and get out! Yes!
-All right!

1535
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:12,021
[contestant 2] Uppercut!

1536
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:13,623
-[Hyunjae] Nice one.
-[referee] Swap!

1537
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:17,160
[contestant 3]
Hyunjae, you need to move quick!

1538
01:03:18,928 --> 01:03:20,863
-[Youmin] You want to switch?
-He should save his energy.

1539
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,632
It's better to switch.

1540
01:03:22,698 --> 01:03:23,699
[contestant 4] Save your strength.

1541
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:26,102
[Lee] Jin Youmin's up.

1542
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,171
Let's see if he can keep up
with Cho's speed.

1543
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:30,573
[Nam Minwoo]
Hey, he's gonna be even faster.

1544
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,075
-One minute left!
-[referee] Let's go!

1545
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:34,944
-Box!
-A pro versus an amateur.

1546
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:36,913
[contestant 2]
They're fighting for their pride.

1547
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,815
ROUND 1 OF 3
CHO HYUNJAE X JIN YOUMIN

1548
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,383
[contestants exclaim]

1549
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:41,450
[referee] Whoa, man.

1550
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,252
-[contestant 3] Strong opening.
-He's crazy strong.

1551
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:44,554
Wow, that grit.

1552
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:46,722
Box!

1553
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,958
[contestant 2] Yes! That's it!

1554
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,726
-[contestant 3] That looked heavy.
-[gasping]

1555
01:03:50,793 --> 01:03:53,196
A pro would definitely have
the upper hand in this ring.

1556
01:03:53,262 --> 01:03:54,697
[contestant 5]
Yeah, there's no where to run.

1557
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:56,999
The ring really changes the game.

1558
01:03:57,533 --> 01:04:00,636
[Hyunjae] <i>It was tougher than I thought.</i>
<i>The ring was different,</i>

1559
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,638
<i>and he kept coming in with his head down.</i>

1560
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,740
<i>It was a bit frustrating.</i>

1561
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:07,610
[Hyunjae]
<i>Still, I was confident in my speed,</i>

1562
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,179
so I figured
I'd just throw a lot and throw fast.

1563
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,282
-[contestant 1] Nice!
-Good going!

1564
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,650
[contestant 3] Wow, they're fast.

1565
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:16,085
[contestant 1] Smart moves!

1566
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:17,253
Hyunjae's so good.

1567
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:18,821
[Chaehyun] Doing great, Hyunjae!

1568
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,557
[Lee] Jin Youmin keeps…

1569
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:23,426
He keeps going in with his head down.

1570
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:25,728
He's aiming too low, isn't he?

1571
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:27,530
[Jongkook] He doesn't have to do that.

1572
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:28,664
[contestant 1] Stay calm!

1573
01:04:28,731 --> 01:04:29,932
[contestant 2] Ten seconds!

1574
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,234
[Lee] He doesn't have to do that.

1575
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,336
-[Jongkook] No, he doesn't.
-[referee] Watch it.

1576
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,271
[Dex] He's hitting a lot of arms
instead of the head.

1577
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:37,073
[contestant 3] Cho's good at clinching.

1578
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:38,307
[referee] Stop!

1579
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,675
[contestant 4] Good, good, good.

1580
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:40,910
[contestant 5] Well done.

1581
01:04:40,977 --> 01:04:42,245
-That was good.
-Yeah.

1582
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:46,182
Oh. It's not that
Jin Youmin lacks technique,

1583
01:04:46,749 --> 01:04:48,784
-so why go in blind like that?
-He's fired up today.

1584
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:51,921
I think that's his plan today,
to keep pressuring.

1585
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:53,389
But with his head down like this,

1586
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,158
his aim naturally drops.

1587
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,661
Toongsoon is so much better
than I expected, by the way.

1588
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:01,631
[contestant 1] Park Sungwoon was like…

1589
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:02,832
He's got a heavy punch.

1590
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,568
[Youmin]
Toongsoon, take your time in there.

1591
01:05:06,369 --> 01:05:08,137
-He's good.
-You're winning.

1592
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:09,205
[♪ tense music playing]

1593
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,276
[Sungwoon]
After taking a few shots, I realized

1594
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:14,844
there's not much to those elite boxers.

1595
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:15,978
I was ready to fight it out.

1596
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,214
I bet Red's got a lot to think about.

1597
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,282
[Hyunjae] You need more rest?

1598
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:21,784
-Are you all recovered now?
-[Chaehyun] Yeah, I am.

1599
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:22,985
-I'm not tired.
-[Hyunjae] All right.

1600
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,187
-It's the weight difference.
-Mmm.

1601
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,389
-I was…
-[Hyunjae] You should…

1602
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:28,958
-Get more snap in your punches.
-[Chaehyun] Faster?

1603
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,026
Get more snap in them.

1604
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,628
-I tried to take him head-on at first.
-[Hyunjae] It's fine.

1605
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:34,297
Should I go first?

1606
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:36,399
[Chaehyun] What if the big one comes out?

1607
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:37,934
[Hyunjae]
I'll try to get him with quick shots.

1608
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,769
If it doesn't work, you can tag in.

1609
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:40,903
We can switch then.

1610
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,274
[announcer] <i>Fighters, step into the ring.</i>

1611
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,109
-[♪ tense music playing]
-[Jihyeok] Come on, let's go!

1612
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,644
Who's up… Oh, damn.

1613
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:49,812
Damn.

1614
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:51,881
[Jihyeok] What? You sure?

1615
01:05:53,082 --> 01:05:54,450
[Seungjun] Oh.

1617
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,555
[Dex] Cho Hyunjae versus Park Sungwoon.

1618
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,124
-He looks like a giant next to him.
-Yeah.

1619
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,392
I can't wait to see this.

1620
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,428
[contestant 4]
There's a serious weight difference.

1621
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:07,897
They're 34 kg apart.

1622
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,832
-Oh!

-Just have fun with it!
-Way to go!

1641
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:48,871
[Jongkook] He's gotta corner him first.

1642
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:50,873
-Punching while he chases won't work.
-[cheering]

Hyunjae, you're doing awesome!

[Dex] Park Sungwoon's gassed.

1659
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:25,074
-He's looking exhausted.
-[Daeyoung] Yeah.

1660
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:26,709
Come on, focus!

1661
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,478
[contestant 1] Good! That's it!

1662
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,547
-He's gassed! Just have fun with it!
-Guard up!

1663
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:32,715
You caught him!

1664
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:34,483
-That's it!
-Yes, you caught him!

1665
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,619
-You can tag out!
-Great!

1666
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,254
[Lee] He's gassed out.

1667
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,855
Park Sungwoon's gassed out.

1668
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:41,524
-I'm exhausted.
-[laughing]

1669
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:43,359
What the heck?

1670
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:45,194
-He's gassed out.
-All right!

1671
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:49,265
BLUE CORNER SWITCH: JIN YOUMIN

1672
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:51,434
-Toongsoon's exhausted.
-No! [laughing]

1673
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:53,936
[Dex] He's totally gassed out.

1674
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:56,972
Sungwoon, breathe! Breathe!

1675
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:00,076
[Lee] Between Cho Hyunjae and
Park Sungwoon, Cho Hyunjae's the winner.

1676
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:01,710
-Between the two.
-[Dex] You're right.

1677
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:02,912
[Jongkook] Totally.

1678
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:04,280
Okay, good!

1679
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:06,415
[Hyunjae] Take it easy.
You're bigger than him.

1680
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,284
RED CORNER SWITCH: LEE CHAEHYUN

1681
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,186
Ready? Box!

1682
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,855
ROUND 2 OF 3
LEE CHAEHYUN X JIN YOUMIN

1683
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,557
-Hey, hey, oh.
-[contestants gasp]

1684
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:15,624
[contestant 2] Hey!

1685
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:17,359
-[Minuk] Hey.
-[contestant 3] Oh, hey.

1686
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,128
[Jongkook] He caught him with that.

1687
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:21,430
-[exclaiming]
-He's rushing.

1688
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,167
[contestant 4] He's going in.

1689
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:26,502
-That's it!
-Chaehyun!

1690
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,337
[Lee] He's going for a KO.

1691
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:30,239
He's going for a KO.

1692
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,775
Jin Youmin's going for a KO.

1693
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,044
[Youmin] <i>I figured I should crash in fast</i>

1694
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,512
<i>and keep the pressure on</i>

1695
01:08:36,579 --> 01:08:38,981
<i>before he could get any distance.</i>

1696
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:40,149
He's coming in strong.

1697
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,651
Read him before you throw!

1698
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:45,121
-Yeah, he keeps throwing hooks.
-Hooks to the head.

1699
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:46,455
-Way to go!
-[Jongkook] To the head.

1700
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:48,023
Chaehyun's getting roped in.

1701
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:50,059
[contestant 4] Chaehyun! Focus, man!

1702
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,193
[contestant 5] Keep going!

1703
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:52,962
-Stay calm!
-Cross-hook-uppercut.

1704
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:54,697
[Dowoon] Stay calm!

1705
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:56,332
Chaehyun! Cross-hook-uppercut!

1706
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:58,100
-Cross-hook-uppercut!
-[Dex] Chaehyun, focus!

1707
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,268
-All right!
-That's it!

1708
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:01,871
-[contestant 8] Stay calm!
-That's it!

1709
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:02,972
Nice.

1710
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,608
Chaehyun, distance. Keep your distance.

1711
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:07,409
Yes, that's it.

1712
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,878
That's it. You got it.

1713
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:10,312
[Hyunjae] Nice defense.

1714
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,248
-[referee] Thirty seconds!
-Keep going!

1715
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,717
-All right, 30 seconds!
-[Dex] Just 30 seconds!

1716
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:16,452
-Yeah!
-All right!

1717
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,487
-Nice one!
-[referee] Watch your head.

1718
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:20,055
All right, Chaehyun! Doing great!

1719
01:09:20,122 --> 01:09:21,857
One last shot! One last shot!

1720
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:23,492
One last shot! One last shot!

1721
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:24,560
[bell rings]

1722
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:25,661
-All right!
-Good!

1723
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,863
-Nice going.
-[applause]

1724
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:29,465
[Jongkook] Well done!

1725
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:31,500
He's got crazy stamina.

1726
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:33,469
Those guys train all day, every day.

1727
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:35,538
Park Sungwoon in the blue corner

1728
01:09:35,604 --> 01:09:37,773
-can't seem to recover.
-[Jongkook] Doesn't look like it.

1729
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,010
He looks like he's about to puke!

1730
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:42,178
He can't breathe.

1731
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:43,612
He doesn't have the gas.

1732
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:46,182
[laughing]
Three minutes isn't enough for him.

1733
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:47,249
[contestant 4] Get it together!

1734
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:50,286
If a heavyweight moves around
too much early on,

1735
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:52,188
he'll be gassed in the later rounds.

1736
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,523
I've been where
Park Sungwoon is right now.

1737
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:57,426
He needs a good 10 minutes
before he can do anything.

1738
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,895
-[Jongkook] He can't recover right now.
-It'll all be over by then.

1739
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:04,200
[Dex] Exactly. That's why Jin Youmin
has a lot on his shoulders right now.

1740
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:07,469
We can do this.

1741
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,038
We're almost there.

1742
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:10,773
They're tired too.

1743
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:14,910
Just take it easy and throw less.

1744
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:18,080
[Sungwoon]
<i>After Round 2, I was totally gassed.</i>

1745
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:21,350
<i>But it didn't look like</i>
<i>Youmin had fully recovered either.</i>

1746
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:23,352
So I figured I'd go first in Round 3,

1747
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,454
buy him some time to recover,

1748
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:27,923
and then let him finish it.

1749
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:30,626
-He came in with his head down.
-Deep breaths.

1750
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:32,461
-It really threw me off at first.
-Hey.

1751
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,063
[Hyunjae] Don't load up.

1752
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:35,297
Tap, tap, slip, then bang!

1753
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:37,199
-Only load up when you're sure.
-[Chaehyun] Okay.

1754
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:39,535
[announcer] <i>Fighters, step into the ring.</i>

1755
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:41,837
Keep those feet moving.

1756
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,006
-Go, Chaehyun!
-Let's go!

1757
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:46,508
[Dex] Looks like Lee Chaehyun
will keep going a bit longer

1758
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:48,611
and let Cho Hyunjae finish it.

1759
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,413
Hang in there, Toongsoon!
This is the last one!

1760
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,983
-Let's go, Sungwoon!
-Sungwoon, keep it together!

1761
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,251
[cheering]

1762
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:56,485
Chaehyun, you got this!

1763
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:58,354
This is the final round!

1764
01:10:58,854 --> 01:10:59,855
[bell rings]

1765
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:00,923
-Show your grit!
-All right.

1766
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,091
-Box!
-Focus!

1767
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:03,359
[Dex] Come on!

1768
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:04,827
-Chaehyun, he's gassed!
-No, no!

1769
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,161
[Hyunjae] Don't go for the big one!

1770
01:11:06,228 --> 01:11:07,396
Tap, tap, slip, then throw!

1771
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:08,764
[Youmin] You've gotta go in!

1772
01:11:10,199 --> 01:11:11,200
[contestants exclaim]

1773
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,136
-[contestants exclaim]
-[Daeyoung] That's it!

1774
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:15,371
-You caught him!
-That's it!

1775
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,872
-Chaehyun, give me one!
-Gotta move!

1776
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,774
Don't just stand there after you throw!

1777
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:20,709
Come on, keep fighting!

1778
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:21,777
Keep fighting!

1779
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:23,479
This is the last one!

1780
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:25,114
He's losing focus in his eyes.

1781
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,383
[Sungwoon] <i>I was dead tired,</i>

1782
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:29,084
<i>but he was bouncing around like nothing.</i>

1783
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:30,152
Go, Chaehyun!

1784
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:31,287
Just a little longer!

1785
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:32,821
-Almost there!
-Have fun with it!

1786
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:33,989
Get in there!

01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:37,393
-What?
-[contestant 3] Hey, that was close.

1789
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:39,595
[Jongkook] A cross-counter.

1790
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:40,829
-Wow.
-[Dex] That slip and rip…

1791
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:43,132
[Jongkook] He got caught while slipping.

[contestants exclaiming, cheering]

1793
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:49,071
-[contestant 1] That landed!
-He could've knocked him out.

1794
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,406
[contestant 3] It's all mental now!

1795
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,308

-It's all mental!

1796

Man, he's wiped out.

1817
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:40,022
All right, good. Let's see.

[Hyunjae] <i>This round is all mine.</i>

1824
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:57,973
I'm gonna give it everything I got
and make it happen.

1825
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,409
-You did your best!
-Go lower!

1826
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:01,710
ROUND 3 OF 3
CHO HYUNJAE X JIN YOUMIN

1827
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:04,313
[contestant 1] You've gotta keep moving,
Hyunjae! Just go crazy!

1828
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,881
[Jongkook] That's it. Yeah, that's better.

1829
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:07,483
-Keep going.
-Do what you gotta do!

1830
01:13:07,549 --> 01:13:09,017
Go for it! That's it!

1831
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:10,285
All right, nice counter!

1832
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:11,720
[contestant 3] Stay calm!

1833
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:14,156
[contestant 4] Read him before you throw.

1834
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,959
-[contestant 5] Read him first.
-I think this is gonna decide it.

1835
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:18,660
[contestant 2] Just pour it out!

1836
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:23,298
-[contestant 1] That's great!
-[contestant 2] Nice one! [exclaims]

1837
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,033
He can't touch you!

1838
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,202
[sighs]
He's got quick feet and a sharp eye.

1839
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:29,738
He's reading all his moves
and dodging every shot.

1840
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:32,174
How's he seeing all that?

1841
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,176
[Lee] His movement is spot on.

1842
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:36,478
[contestant 1] He's amazing.
He'd be so hard to hit.

1843
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:39,548
[exclaiming]

1844
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:41,984
-Nice one!
-One more! Throw a feint!

1845
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:43,719
Nice one!

1846
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,654
-That landed perfectly.
-That's it!

1847
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,956
[Lee] He's got him in the corner now.

1848
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:49,191
-Yes!
-Strike first!

1849
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:50,492
[Lee exclaims]

1850
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:54,963
[contestants exclaiming]

1851
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,899
[contestant 1]
You've gotta keep going! Keep going!

1852
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:59,067
[Jongkook] Man, I remember Jin
being better than this.

1853
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:00,436
-[Lee] They're on different levels.
-Yes.

1854
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:02,237
[contestant 1]
Here it comes! Here it comes!

1855
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:03,939
You've gotta do something! There you go!

1856
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,442
[contestant 7] You've gotta keep throwing!

1857
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:08,143
Don't just sit in guard!

1858
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:11,914
I started getting hit
right at the start of Round 3,

1859
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,650
and from there
I lost my sense of distance.

1860
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:17,486
<i>It was a really rough round.</i>

1861
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:19,121
[contestants cheering]

1862
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:20,556
[contestant 1] Damn, he's good.

1863
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:21,690
[Lee] He's dodging everything.

1864
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,125
[contestant 3] Way to go!

1865
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,593
[contestant 5] Hyunjae's getting tired!

1866
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:25,861
[contestant 6] Stay sharp!

1867
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:27,262
-No, no!
-Fire back!

1868
01:14:28,063 --> 01:14:30,032
[contestant 6] You've gotta keep throwing!

1869
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:31,967
[contestant 7]
Here it comes! Here it comes!

1870
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:34,236
[contestant 8] Come on! You got this!

1871
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,405
-[Jongkook] He's exhausted.
-[Lee] He's gassed out.

1872
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:38,674
[contestant 10] Let's go, Jin Youmin!

1873
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:40,876
Do what you gotta do.

1874
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:44,213
[Lee] Cho Hyunjae's reading him
like a book.

1875
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:46,215
[contestant 11]
He's got one hell of a gas tank.

1876
01:14:46,281 --> 01:14:47,983
[contestant 12] Just have fun with it!

1877
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:53,455
I could read all of Jin Youmin's patterns
and handle him easily.

1878
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:55,190
[contestant 10] Go to the body! Yes!

1879
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:57,493
-Thirty seconds!
-Hyunjae, pour it out!

1880
01:14:57,559 --> 01:14:59,394
-[Dex] You have 30 seconds left!
-[Jongkook] Focus!

1881
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:02,331
-Focus!
-That's what I'm talking about!

1882
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:05,133
-Nice going!
-Go to the body! The body!

1883
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,102
[contestant 2] Don't overdo it!
Just keep it going!

1884
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:08,170
[Dex] You've gotta go for it!

1885
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:10,172
-Ten seconds!
-[contestant 4] Ten seconds!

1886
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:12,207
[contestant 3] Just keep having fun!

1887
01:15:12,274 --> 01:15:14,176
-[contestant 2] All right, nice!
-[contestant 3] Great!

1888
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:16,078
-[Jongkook] His stamina, though.
-Man, it's over.

1889
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:17,145
Come on!

1890
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:18,447
ROUND 3 OF 3
CHO HYUNJAE X JIN YOUMIN

1891
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,548
-[bell rings]
-[Lee exclaims]

1892
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:21,350
[contestant 2]
They did a really great job.

1893
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:23,385
[contestant 3] The KAFAC duo was insane.

1894
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:25,454
-He's so good.
-Hyunjae won.

1895
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:26,722
Cho was incredible at the end.

1896
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:28,657
I know. If it wasn't for that…

1897
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:31,126
-Uh, Hyunjae was just…
-Yeah.

1898
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,662
Looked like he figured out everything
once he cornered Jin.

1899
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:34,863
From there he just went…

1900
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,799
Yeah, there's no way
to beat an out-boxer that good.

1901
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,536
They put on such an exhilarating fight.

1902
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:42,304
[Lee] They were great.

1903
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:43,639
[Dex] Nice!

1904
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:45,541
-[Jongkook] Great job.
-That's hot.

1905
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:47,543
[referee] Come on, get in here.

1906
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:49,611
[contestant 2] He can't get in.

1907
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:51,480
-Come on.
-Somebody, call him an ambulance.

1908
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,649
[contestant 3]
He does look like he needs one.

1909
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:57,486
I think Sungwoon needs to rest a bit more.

1910
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,087
[contestants laugh]

1911
01:15:59,154 --> 01:16:01,523
[contestant 1] Both of them
look pretty much out of it.

1912
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:04,493
[Lee] Uh,
you guys left everything out there.

1913
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:06,428
-It was cool.
-Stand tall!

1914
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,864
[announcer] <i>We will now announce</i>
<i>the result.</i>

1915

[contestant groans]

1916
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:11,900
The winners of this match are

1917
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:16,238
Lee Chaehyun, Cho Hyunjae
from the red corner.

1918
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:17,973
-[contestants exclaim]
-They really did well.

1919
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:19,641
[contestant 1] Way to go!

1920
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:21,410
-[contestant 2] They were great.
-[contestant 3] Yeah.

1921
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:22,844
The KAFAC salutes you. Attention!

1922
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:25,480
-Salute! Loyalty!
-Loyalty!

1923
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:27,516
-[contestants cheering]
-At ease!

1924
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,217
[contestant 4] How cool.

1925
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:33,689
[chuckling] Park Sungwoon,
I hope you're feeling a bit better now.

1926
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,625
You're a passionate young man
who gave it everything,

1927
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:38,994
but sadly,
you've been eliminated from <i>I Am Boxer</i>.

1928
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:40,095
[sighs]

1929
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:43,231
I was hoping to flip the script,
but I guess I came up short.

1930
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:45,634
The KAFAC boxers really live up to…

1931
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:47,603
They live up to their name.
I learned a lot.

1932
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:49,571
-What?
-Slow down.

1933
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,140
-You were great! Whoo!
-[♪ upbeat music playing]

1934
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:54,409
-All right!
-Awesome fight!

1935

[contestants exclaiming]

1936
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:58,013
-That was fun.
-Yeah.

1937
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,415
-It went by in a flash.
-I know. This is fun.

1938
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,085
[contestant 1] We get to see this?

1939
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,087
-Feels like the finals already.
-What a big match.

1940
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:06,188
Box!

1941
01:17:06,254 --> 01:17:07,289
The best versus the best.

1942
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:08,924
-If that lands, he's done.
-Insane.

1943
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,759
[contestant 2]
They might break down the cage.

1944
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,194
[contestants exclaiming]

1945
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,428
[contestant 3] Look at that combo.

1946
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:14,596
[exclaims]

1947
01:17:14,663 --> 01:17:16,031
[contestant 1] Here it comes.

1948
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:17,966
Gotta keep going till you drop.

1949
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,234
[contestant 2] That's savage.

1950
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,470
-[contestants exclaiming]
-Whoo!

1951
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:24,640
[Jongkook] The reigning undisputed unified
light heavyweight champion!

1952
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:26,575
-[contestant] Seriously?
-[in English] Champ, come in!

1954
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:31,446
-[in Korean] This is insane!
-[in English] My name is Dmitry Bivol.

1955
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:34,516
When I heard about Korea
and the boxing show,

1956
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:36,418
of course I didn't have any doubts.

1957
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,086
I wanted to come.
