He's insanely good.

35

He's one of Korea's strongest boxers.

36
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:56,826
For his weight class, his power is unreal.

-[Dex] Is that so?
-[Lee] Yeah.

38
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:02,298
Hello, I'm Kwon Ohgon,

Lightweight and Super Lightweight.

40
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:08,404
You can't beat me
with just your fists. Never.

41
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:11,274
I'm confident I can win.
Anyone's welcome to step up.

There are too many "champs" around.

Everyone claims they're a champion.

44
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:17,847
But I don't care who I'm up against.
I'll be the next champion anyway.

Seol Yeongho's gonna get beat up.

is called the original sport of the fist.

-[Jongkook] He really is fast, huh?
-[Lee] He's really fast.

62
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:04,227
He's incredible at those
sudden burst moves.

63
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,896
It's hard to catch from here.
Imagine being right in front of him.

64
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:09,432
-I bet you can hardly see it coming.
-[Dex] Right?

65
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:12,368
[contestant 5] Oh! Go again! Left hook!

66
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,339
[Dex]
Seol Yeongho's starting to smile now.

67
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,207
That's his signature move.

68
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:19,875
[Jongkook] He kind of enjoys getting hit.

69
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,177
[Dex] Yeah, exactly.

70
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:23,579
[Ohgon] I landed a shot,
then he came right at me smiling.

71
00:03:23,646 --> 00:03:25,948
[Yeongho] It stung a little.

72
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:27,516
But I wasn't that bothered.

73
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,885
You can't keep taking hits
and grinning forever. [chuckles]

74
00:03:31,654 --> 00:03:34,223
-[contestants exclaiming, murmuring]
-He moves like a real weapon.

75

[contestant 2] Look at that skill.

76
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,061
He's got insane speed.

77
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:44,300
[Jongkook]
Seol Yeongho's watching for an opening,

78
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:46,135
-but he can't land a clean shot.
-[Lee] Yeah.

79
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:51,874
It's not easy keeping up
with that kind of speed.

80
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:56,078
-He's not gonna catch him like that.
-He can't keep up.

81
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,614
[Dex] Looks like
he's getting a little tired now.

82

Seriously, man.

86
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,194
We could barely see those punches.

87
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:14,463
-No, they were so fast.
-If we can't see them from here,

88

If I'd had just 30 more seconds,
I could've finished him.

been finished. [chuckles]

[contestant 3]
Ring No. 8? This one looks fun too.

170
00:08:22,845 --> 00:08:24,146
[contestant 4] Whoa, it's Yang Sellchan.

171
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,748
[contestant 5] Ah,
it's Yang Sellchan's ring.

172
00:08:26,282 --> 00:08:28,250
Sellchan's got power. He's good.

173
00:08:28,984 --> 00:08:30,553
[contestant 6]
From the Youth National Boxing Team.

174
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,055
Hi, I'm Yang Sellchan,

175
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:35,724
former Youth National Team boxer,
and now a pro boxer.

176
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:40,763
I've had three wins and one draw so far.

177
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:42,331
The Korean scene

178
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,301
feels a bit limiting to me.

179
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,036
My goal is to become a world champion.

180
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,705
It doesn't matter who my opponent is.

181
00:08:49,772 --> 00:08:50,773
I'm here to win.

182
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:53,442
[contestant 1] Do you know who that is?

183
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:54,543
[contestant 2] No idea.

184
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,812
[announcer] <i>In the red corner,</i>
<i>from Japan's prestigious</i>

185
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:59,214
<i>Teiken Boxing Gym, Moon Youngwoong!</i>

186
00:09:00,215 --> 00:09:01,450
"Teiken"?

187
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:02,751
"Teiken"?

188
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:05,688
Naoya Inoue's from there, right?

189
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:06,755
The current world champ.

190
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:08,023
NAOYA INOUE

191
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,492
Apparently,
his father used to coach Inoue.

192
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:12,461
-That's wild.
-[Dex murmurs]

193
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:14,530
Hello, I'm Moon Youngwoong.

194
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:19,101
I've been boxing for about six years
at Teiken Boxing Gym.

195
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:23,172
My father used to be Inoue's trainer,
so he handled his bandage checks and such.

196
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:26,976
I've actually trained
alongside Inoue myself.

197
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:30,079
Being part of Teiken alone

198
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:33,949
is enough to set you apart.

199
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:35,751
That's all I need to say.

200
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,087
He's got that Japanese feel.

201
00:09:38,153 --> 00:09:39,221
I think he'll do well.

202
00:09:39,822 --> 00:09:42,091
[contestant 1] Red corner's from Teiken.

203
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:43,692
Sounds like fun, though.

204
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:46,629
[Sellchan] He was so good-looking

205
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:50,232
that I honestly didn't think
he was an actual fighter.

206
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,067
Then they mentioned Teiken.

207
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:56,038
So I'm like, "He's not what he looks like.
Better not underestimate him."

208
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:02,511
Let's get right into it.

209
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:05,147
-Okay, box!
-[bell rings]

210
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:06,915
Box!

211
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:09,284
-[bell rings]
-[contestants cheering]

212
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:10,753
-Let's go!
-Come on!

213
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,324
[contestants] Whoa!

214
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:17,426
[contestant 1] Nice double punch.

215
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,228
[contestants exclaim]

216
00:10:20,462 --> 00:10:21,463
[contestant 2] Go, Sellchan!

217
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,502
[contestant 3] Oh, he's good.

218
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:28,170
[contestant 4] He's really good.

219
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:29,505
[contestant 1] He's got clean technique.

220
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:31,140
[contestant 2] He's smooth.

221
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:34,943
[contestant 3]
It's like he's punching a punching bag.

222
00:10:35,444 --> 00:10:37,479
[contestant 4] That's the Japanese style,
precise and technical.

223
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,416
He definitely has that Japanese vibe.

224
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,087
-You can't let him go on like that.
-No.

225
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:48,624
[Hyeongbin]
Boy, it's getting dangerous fast.

226
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,726
[contestant 2] Think we're getting a KO.

227
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:52,161
[contestant 3] No, don't just stand there.

228
00:10:52,227 --> 00:10:53,529
Come on, find your moment.

229
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,932
Throw your punches, Sellchan.

230
00:10:56,999 --> 00:10:59,101
[contestant 1]
Red corner's calling it out.

231
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:02,304
[Youngwoong] At that point, I thought,
"This might be enough to finish it."

232
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,509
"I could close it out soon.
Let's keep this up."

233
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:11,980
Looks like he's trying to end it early.

234
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,482
-Yeah, he's pressing hard right now.
-Yeah.

235
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,917
[Lee] I think Sellchan was waiting

236
00:11:14,983 --> 00:11:17,886
for the right moment to counter,
but he took more hits than he expected.

237
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:19,421
[contestant 1] Stop waiting around.

238
00:11:21,824 --> 00:11:23,492
[contestant 2]
There you go, find your rhythm.

239
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:26,895
[in English] A liver shot.

240
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:29,531
-[in Korean] Nice, he's cutting in now.
-Is he getting started now?

241
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:31,500
-[contestant 3] He's going in.
-[grunts]

242
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,669
[contestants exclaim]

243
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:35,070
Whoa!

244
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:36,472
-Oh!
-Whoa!

245
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:40,209
[contestant 1] Whoa! There it is!

246
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:41,810
[contestant 2] He's got a sharp left hand.

247
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:43,011
He's got a punch in him.

248
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:45,380
[contestants exclaim]

249
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:48,383
[contestant 3]
He's killing it with his left.

250
00:11:50,986 --> 00:11:53,555
[contestant 1] He's throwing with just
the left, barely using the right.

251
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:56,158
He's not using his back hand.

252
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,228
That left hand, though.

253
00:11:59,728 --> 00:12:01,663
[Sellchan] Honestly,
I was getting pushed around at first,

254
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:04,266
but that lead hook started landing.

255
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,068
Then it clicked.
That's how I'll open him up.

256
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:08,904
[contestants exclaiming]

257
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:11,173
[contestant 4] He's in trouble.
No way he's getting out of that.

258
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:16,645
Whoa, he's holding on till the end.

259
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:19,114
Man, this is real fun to watch.

260
00:12:19,181 --> 00:12:20,749
Seeing their contrasting styles.

261
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,786
[contestant 3]
Japan's all about quick, clean combos.

262
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,790
Sellchan likes to go for the big shot.

263
00:12:27,856 --> 00:12:28,891
[contestant 5] Man, I love it.

264
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:32,027
[contestant 6] This fight's super fun.

265
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:36,965
-[bell rings]
-All right, that's enough.

266
00:12:37,032 --> 00:12:38,934
-All right, that's enough.
-Stop!

267
00:12:39,001 --> 00:12:41,069
-[announcer] <i>The fight is over.</i>
-Great fight.

268
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,740
[contestant 1] If we're talking
number of shots, it's all red corner.

269
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:47,042
[contestant 2]
But blue corner had the heavier shots.

270
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:48,911
[contestant 3]
This one's going to be tough to call.

271
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:52,114
All right then, I personally think…

272
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,951
they both did very well.

273
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:57,219
Is he advancing them both?

274
00:12:57,786 --> 00:13:01,390
I'm giving the win
to both red and blue corners.

275
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:03,258
[contestants exclaiming, applauding]

276
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,460
MOON YOUNGWOONG, YANG SELLCHAN
BOTH SURVIVE

277
00:13:06,028 --> 00:13:09,264
[Sellchan] It was a series
of unexpected moments.

278
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,200
At first, when I was getting pushed back,

279
00:13:11,266 --> 00:13:13,435
I thought I might hit the floor.

280
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:17,105
But then,
I turned the tables with pure grit.

281
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,842
There was a moment
when my vision went blank for a bit.

282
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:22,377
I was worried about my stamina too,

283
00:13:22,444 --> 00:13:23,645
but I had so much fun.

284
00:13:23,712 --> 00:13:26,648
Now I'm fired up
to give it everything I've got.

285
00:13:27,816 --> 00:13:30,786
[announcer] <i>Master,</i>
<i>please select the next ring.</i>

286
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:31,987
[Lee] Sure.

287
00:13:32,754 --> 00:13:34,323
-Let's go with Ring No. 2.
-Oh.

288
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:35,891
[contestants exclaiming]

289
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,392
[groans]

290
00:13:40,963 --> 00:13:42,164
[contestant 1] It's Jang Hyuk's ring.

291
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:44,266
[announcer] <i>Ring No. 2.</i>

292

295
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,808
[contestant 2] You got this!

296
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,276
"Wouldn't that be nice?"

297
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:56,044
"Un Nyun, my love"!

298
00:13:56,578 --> 00:13:58,714
[contestant 3]
Jang Hyuk is really amazing.

299
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:01,683
Hello, I'm Jang Hyuk, an actor.

300
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,619
I happened to walk into a boxing gym.

301
00:14:03,685 --> 00:14:05,087
After all that sweating,

302
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:07,456
I felt recharged after a boxing session.

303
00:14:09,124 --> 00:14:10,993
Though it first began as a hobby,

304
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,295
I later went for it
and got my boxing license.

305
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:17,132
[announcer] Jang Hyuk,
you've passed the boxing test!

306
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,034
I don't know whether I'll win or lose.

307
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,771
How far can I make it on my own two feet?

308
00:14:22,838 --> 00:14:26,375
I wanted to see for myself
how far I could go in this thing.

309
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:30,145
[contestant 1]
He's really consistent with his training.

310
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:33,382
He'll come straight from reading scripts
to hit the mitts nonstop.

311

[announcer]
<i>In the blue corner, we have a boxer</i>

313
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,253
LEE DOWOON
ACTOR

314
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,624
Hi, I'm Lee Dowoon,
born in 1999. I'm an actor.

315
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:46,361
I spent three years training
to become a pro boxer.

316
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,230
Since I've boxed for years,

317
00:14:48,297 --> 00:14:50,799
I can really bring
that movement to life in my acting.

318
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,971
It was after watching Jang Hyuk
that I dreamed of becoming an action star.

319
00:14:56,038 --> 00:14:58,941
Through this match,
I hope to carry on his legacy.

320
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:00,242
It is an honor.

321
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:01,543
Oh.

322
00:15:03,145 --> 00:15:04,246
[contestant 2] Nice backstory.

323
00:15:04,746 --> 00:15:07,916
Born in '76,
it's already been half a century.

324
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:09,618
I wish you all the best. [chuckles]

325
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:12,220
-Born in '76?
-[contestants exclaiming]

326
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,423
He and my mom are only two years apart.

327
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:16,058
[contestant 1]
I wonder what made him come here.

328
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,093
[contestant 2] Born in '76?
I've got so much respect for him.

329
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:23,198
[contestant 3]
He must be worried, since they're friends.

330
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,969
[laughing]
I've never seen Jongkook this worried.

331
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:29,871
He's gone up to the front for this.

332
00:15:29,938 --> 00:15:30,939
[Hyuk sighs]

333
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,208
This is driving me nuts.

334
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:37,713
I'm well past retirement age in boxing.

335
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,281
So if you ask why I'm here…

336
00:15:39,348 --> 00:15:40,549
Guess I felt like doing it.

337
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:42,818
Something must've pulled me in.

338
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,356
[Dowoon] I was thrilled to even be
in the same ring with him.

339
00:15:47,422 --> 00:15:48,857
It is such an honor.

340
00:15:48,924 --> 00:15:52,661
I hope to learn a lot
and take away great memories from this.

341
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:57,199
Let's go in strong.
Everyone, make some noise for them!

342
00:15:57,265 --> 00:15:58,333
-Let's go!
-Come on!

343
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,435
-Okay, box!
-Let's go!

344
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,570
[bell rings]

345
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:03,171
-Box!
-Let's do this!

346
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:05,640
[contestants cheering]

347
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:07,409
[contestant 1] Is Jang Hyuk a lefty?

348
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:08,844
[contestant 2] So he's a southpaw boxer.

349
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,614
[contestant 3] He's pushing hard.

350
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:17,386
[contestant 4 grunts]
He's not holding back.

351
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:19,755
[contestant 5] He's here to win.
This is a fight after all.

352
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:25,660
[contestant 6] Good defense.

353
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:29,064
[contestant 1]
Jang Hyuk's got a sharp eye.

354
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:32,000
[contestant 2]
Yeah, he reads the punches well.

355
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,635
He needs to go on the offense, though.

356
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,103
Come on, move in.

357
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,939
Push forward, come on.

358
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:41,209
[contestants exclaim]

359
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:45,647
[contestant 3]
His punches have an interesting rhythm.

360
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,215
He switched it up instantly.

361
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,252
That's an unusual rhythm, right?

362
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,822
[contestant 4]
It's almost like Jeet Kune Do.

363
00:16:57,592 --> 00:16:59,061
There it is, the Jeet Kune Do.

364
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:03,365
[contestant exclaiming]

365
00:17:03,432 --> 00:17:05,100
Got to be careful at times like this.

366
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,568
Cover up, man.

367
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:09,971
[contestant 1] Gosh, he took a big one.

368
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,474
[contestant 2] He's aggressive.

369
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:13,909
[contestant 3] This is it. Go for it!

370
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:17,179
[contestant 1] He's holding up well.

371
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:19,514
-You got this!
-[applause]

372
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,450
Let's go!

373
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:27,923
[contestants exclaiming]

374
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:32,727
[contestant 3] His rhythm's hard to read.

375
00:17:34,496 --> 00:17:35,497
[Jongkook] Keep it going!

376
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:36,565
Come on, push!

377
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:40,302
-No, too big.
-Too big a swing.

378
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:42,104
Come on, push.

379
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,338
He needs to push harder.

380
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:49,077
[contestant 2]
His backstep's quick, though.

381
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:51,179
[contestant exclaims]

382
00:17:51,246 --> 00:17:53,148
-[Jongkook] Go, go.
-[contestant 3] Push in.

383
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,384
-[contestant exclaims]
-That one landed hard.

384
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,886
It's okay. You're fine.

385
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:58,954
Keep pushing.

386
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,857
[Jongkook] Keep going. Go, now!

387
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:03,892
I'll give you five more seconds.

388
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:06,027
-Give it one last push.
-You gotta go now.

389
00:18:06,094 --> 00:18:07,762
-Come on.
-One last push!

390
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:08,830
[Jongkook] Come on, go.

391
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:11,633
[Hyeongbin] You got this!

392
00:18:13,502 --> 00:18:14,569
Five seconds left.

393
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:17,639
-[Dex] Five, four!
-[contestants] Keep going!

394
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:19,808
-[Dex] Three, two!
-[contestants] Go, go, go!

395
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:20,909
[Dex] One!

396
00:18:20,976 --> 00:18:22,911
-Okay, stop!
-[bell rings]

397
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:23,979
-[Lee] All right, stop.
-Okay.

398
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:26,014
[announcer] <i>The fight is over.</i>

399
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,552
[sighs] Damn it.

400
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,927
-That was incredible, considering his age.
-[chattering]

401
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,732
[announcer]
<i>We'll proceed with a medical check.</i>

402
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:45,667
-Is there a cut?
-Looks like it.

403
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:46,735
Do we have bleeding?

404
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:50,238
[contestant 1] Oh, he's got a cut.

405
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:01,016
[contestant 2]
There must've been a headbutt.

406
00:19:01,082 --> 00:19:02,217
[contestant 1] Oh, no.

407
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:04,286
An actor getting cut in the face?

408
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:06,121
[contestant 2] The bleeding won't stop.

409
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:09,090
[contestant 1]
He must feel awful right now.

410
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,227
[contestant 2] It looks pretty bad.

411
00:19:12,961 --> 00:19:14,296
[contestant 3] Looks like it's deep.

412
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,431
[contestant 4] Oh, boy.

413
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,568
Is he okay?

414
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:22,938
-Please give him a big hand, everyone.
-[contestants cheering, applauding]

415
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:24,372
You're amazing, man!

416
00:19:25,106 --> 00:19:26,341
He really is amazing.

417
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,979
Well, that was a true show
of grit and determination.

418
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,247
That was incredible.

419
00:19:32,814 --> 00:19:34,449
As your friend, I couldn't be prouder.

420
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:35,584
[Lee] Technique aside,

421
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,221
that fighting spirit is
what <i>I Am Boxer</i> is really about.

422
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:43,358
You both fought an extremely close match.

423
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:45,293
The winner of this match is…

424
00:19:45,827 --> 00:19:49,931
for landing more effective
and damaging punches…

425
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,067
[contestant 1] Who will it be?

426
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,202
[contestant 2]
This is a really tough call.

427
00:19:56,271 --> 00:19:58,340
Lee Dowoon from the blue corner.

428
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:02,944
-[contestants exclaiming, applauding]
-Jang Hyuk, you were truly inspiring.

429
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:04,579
I'll never forget your fighting spirit.

430
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:06,014
Thank you.

431
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,749
[Jongkook] Congratulations. Well done.

432
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,655
[Dowoon] Even when my hand was raised,
it really didn't matter that I'd won.

433
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:16,958
I was just so worried
about Jang Hyuk's injury.

434
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:22,030
Before that shutter went up,
we had a long talk together.

435
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:26,501
I dreamed of becoming an actor star
after watching you, sir.

436
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:30,672
Action scenes are built in collaboration
with the director and stunt coordinator,

437
00:20:30,739 --> 00:20:34,409
making sure the moves and blocks
align with the character's traits.

438
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:36,911
[Dowoon] He gave me so much good advice.

439
00:20:36,978 --> 00:20:37,979
Thank you, sir.

440
00:20:39,547 --> 00:20:43,585
This moment will definitely go down
as something I'll never forget in my life.

441
00:20:44,586 --> 00:20:46,554
All right, folks.

442
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:50,058
Next up is the showdown
between Korea's two strongest.

443
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,395
[contestants exclaiming]

444
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,797
-No way.
-This is insane!

445
00:20:55,864 --> 00:20:57,198
MOST ANTICIPATED MATCHUP?

446
00:20:57,265 --> 00:20:59,334
Myung Hyunman versus Jung Dawoon.

447
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:00,835
Myung Hyunman and Jung Dawoon.

448
00:21:00,902 --> 00:21:03,071
Jung Dawoon versus Myung Hyunman.

449
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:07,075
Let's be real,
the best fighter in Korea right now?

450
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:11,079
No doubt, everyone would say Jung Dawoon.

451
00:21:11,713 --> 00:21:16,551
[Hyeongbin] When it comes to MMA,
he's number one in the country.

452
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:18,920
And for stand-up striking,
that's Myung Hyunman.

453
00:21:20,288 --> 00:21:24,159
[Kang] Myung Hyunman? Heavyweight
kickboxer, like, total top class.

454
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:28,029
You don't see a match like this anywhere.

455
00:21:28,096 --> 00:21:29,164
This is insane.

456
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,699
It's really happening.

457
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:32,634
[in English] This is the real deal.

458
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:33,802
[contestants cheering]

459
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:35,337
[contestant 1, in Korean]
That's a scary sight.

460
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,206
-Holy cow.
-[contestant 2] This is insane!

461
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:40,008
-Wow.
-Here we go.

462
00:21:41,276 --> 00:21:42,444
Better watch this up close.

463
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:45,580
Let's watch from up here.

464
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:47,048
We can't miss this.

465
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,084
[contestant 3] It's the main event!

466
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:51,319
Man, this is incredible.

467
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:54,122
You can't see this anywhere else.

468
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:56,691
[Lee] Asia's top kickboxer

469
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,161
versus one of the UFC's strongest.

470
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,232
They're finally facing off.

471
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:07,168
Incredible. I can't wait to see this.

472
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:08,937
It's a battle of the monsters.

473
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:10,772
[contestant 3]
Wish this had a full three rounds.

474
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:13,808
A battle of the two strongest in Korea.

475
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:15,810
Who's your pick?

476
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,513
-[contestant 3] I still say Jung Dawoon.
-[contestant 4] I honestly can't pick.

477
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:22,484
[Dawoon]
Fans debate about it all the time.

478
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,854
Who'd win between Myung Hyunman
and Jung Dawoon?

479
00:22:26,855 --> 00:22:28,890
Honestly, I never gave it much thought.

480
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:31,092
I have the same answer for anyone.

481
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:33,495
I'm just on another level.

482
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,131
The difference is astronomical.

483
00:22:36,197 --> 00:22:38,967
You'd better be ready to give it your all.

484
00:22:39,033 --> 00:22:42,570
People call me "the old, retired fighter."

485
00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:45,974
They say I just sell
soy-marinated crabs now.

486
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,542
But Myung Hyunman is back.

487
00:22:48,042 --> 00:22:50,278
Dawoon, I'm not the kickboxer
you once knew.

488
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:52,947
Now, I'm just a boxer. So brace yourself.

489
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:54,015
This is gonna be good.

490
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,218
[contestant 1] I bet each landing shot
will sound like a cannon.

491
00:22:57,285 --> 00:22:59,053
[Lee] It's the ultimate showdown.

492
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:01,289
-Box!
-[bell rings]

493
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,491
-Box!
-[bell rings]

494
00:23:04,526 --> 00:23:06,127
-Box!
-[contestants cheering]

495
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:10,832
[contestant 1] Ooh.

496
00:23:11,366 --> 00:23:13,535
-It's like watching bears fight.
-[contestant 2] Oh!

497
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,070
[contestants grunting]

498
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:20,341
[contestant 1]
They're breaking each other.

499
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:23,011
[contestant 3] That was slick.

500
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,249
[contestant 4]
One of them might actually die.

501
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:29,784
[contestant 5] Those shots look lethal.

502
00:23:29,851 --> 00:23:31,586
[Lee] Right there. That can knock you out.

503
00:23:31,653 --> 00:23:32,654
That hook knocks you out.

504
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,721
-[Dex] Right?
-Yeah.

505
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:35,957
-Whoa!
-[contestants exclaim]

506
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:38,259
[contestants exclaim]

507
00:23:43,731 --> 00:23:44,966
[contestants exclaim]

508
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:50,004
-[referee, in English] Stop!
-He's down!

509
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:51,573
[referee] He's down.

510
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,876
-[in Korean] Whoa, I actually flinched.
-[gasps]

511
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,478
Whoa!

512
00:23:56,544 --> 00:23:58,613
Whoa! No way!

513
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:03,685
[contestants exclaim]

514
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:06,254
[contestant 1]
I thought I heard a bomb go off.

515
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:09,324
[contestant 2]
He landed that punch right behind the ear.

516
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,558
-The temporal region.
-Yeah.

517
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:11,893
[referee] Stop! He's down!

518
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,296
[in English] Down. Three, four…

519
00:24:15,363 --> 00:24:19,534
[Hyunman, in Korean] There were fights
where Jung Dawoon left his face open.

520
00:24:19,601 --> 00:24:21,870
That flashed through my head.

521
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:25,139
So I thought I'd land a hard hook
and do some real damage.

522
00:24:27,442 --> 00:24:29,110
I gave it a shot, and it landed.

523
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,311
My plan worked.

524
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:35,717
-Four, five, six…
-[Dawoon] When I took that big hit,

525
00:24:35,783 --> 00:24:37,519
I was actually stunned that I went down.

526
00:24:37,585 --> 00:24:39,387
My vision flashed. I was like, "What the?"

527
00:24:39,454 --> 00:24:40,855
I thought, "This is bad."

528
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,324
"I've got to fight back with heavy shots."

529
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:46,327
[in English] Seven, eight…
[in Korean] Can you go on?

530
00:24:46,394 --> 00:24:47,529
Lift your hands for me.

531
00:24:50,098 --> 00:24:51,232
All right then.

532
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,269
-Box!
-[contestant 1] Let's do this!

533
00:24:54,335 --> 00:24:55,637
[contestant 2] You got this, man!

534
00:24:56,738 --> 00:24:58,106
No open hands!

535
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,675
[contestant exclaim]

536
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,012
[contestant 3]
If that connects, he's done.

537
00:25:04,078 --> 00:25:05,213
[contestant 4] For real.

538
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,281
He's a goner then.

539
00:25:09,517 --> 00:25:12,153
[contestant 5] With heavyweights, it's
about power rather than technique, huh?

540
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,589
[contestant 6]
One of them is going down for sure.

541
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:16,424
[contestants exclaim]

542
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,401
[contestant 1] Whoa.

543
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:27,902
He took that.

544
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,139
[contestant 2] Oh, nice dodge!

545
00:25:32,507 --> 00:25:34,576
[contestant 1]
He saved himself by clinching.

546
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,446
-They're neck and neck.
-It's like watching dinosaurs fight.

547
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,715
[in English] Break!
[in Korean] Break it up!

548
00:25:44,018 --> 00:25:45,086
They sure are huge.

549
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:46,454
He needs to loosen up.

550
00:25:48,489 --> 00:25:50,325
[contestant 2]
Jung Dawoon's getting impatient.

551
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:52,660
It's because of that knockdown earlier.

552
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:56,297
He shouldn't throw hooks.

553
00:25:56,965 --> 00:25:58,299
Dawoon shouldn't throw hooks.

554
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:01,069
-He needs to stick to straights instead.
-[grunts]

555
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,304
[contestants exclaim]

556
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:05,540
[contestant] That's too big a swing.

557
00:26:09,043 --> 00:26:10,945
[contestant 2]
He's trying too hard for the knockout.

558
00:26:11,012 --> 00:26:12,013
Break it up!

559
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:17,118
-[contestant 3] Whoa.
-[contestant 4] Let's go, man!

560
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:22,056
-[contestant 5] That landed nicely.
-It was clean.

561
00:26:25,326 --> 00:26:27,161
Myung Hyunman strikes like no other.

562
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,031
-[contestant 5] He can really hit.
-[contestant 6] Whoa!

563
00:26:30,732 --> 00:26:32,367
[contestant 3] Nice body shots.

564
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:36,371
[Dawoon] I'd taken some damage.
I needed time to recover,

565
00:26:36,437 --> 00:26:38,940
but I guess I rushed back in too soon.

566
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:45,580
[contestant 2]
Hyunman's looking more relaxed now.

567
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,548
Break!

568
00:26:47,615 --> 00:26:48,883
Break it up!

569
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:51,285
[Lee] Keep it up, gentlemen.
I'd like to watch a little longer.

570
00:26:51,853 --> 00:26:53,354
Almost there!

571
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,223
[contestants exclaim]

572
00:26:55,757 --> 00:26:58,092
[contestant 1] Wow,
those hits are spot-on.

573
00:26:59,927 --> 00:27:02,363
Myung Hyunman's punches have real impact.

574
00:27:02,864 --> 00:27:03,998
It's got that weight.

575
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,335
[contestants exclaim]

576
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:09,937
-We'll stop here.
-[referee] Stop!

577
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,673
-Thank you. Well done.
-[bell rings]

578
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:13,007
[contestants cheer]

579
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:14,709
[contestant 1] Awesome fight! [exclaims]

580
00:27:15,376 --> 00:27:17,912
That's insane.
I'd be dead if I got hit by that.

581
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:20,281
The fact that he got knocked down, though.

582
00:27:20,948 --> 00:27:22,350
How about an overtime round?

583
00:27:23,084 --> 00:27:24,352
Can we get an overtime round?

584
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,722
Now this is what I call
a legendary matchup.

585
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:29,090
Seriously.

586
00:27:29,157 --> 00:27:32,760
That was truly an incredible fight.

587
00:27:32,827 --> 00:27:35,697
That could easily be
the highlight of I Am Boxer.

588
00:27:35,763 --> 00:27:36,864
[contestants cheer]

589
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:38,266
[contestant 1] That was insane!

590
00:27:38,766 --> 00:27:42,170
The winner of this match is…

591
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:45,006
Please don't let them
both survive. [chuckles]

592
00:27:48,443 --> 00:27:50,645
The one who dealt heavier damage,

593
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,714
more in line with modern boxing…

594
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:54,382
[contestant 1] Myung Hyunman?

595
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,218
[contestant 2] Jung Dawoon!

596
00:27:59,187 --> 00:28:01,489
Myung Hyunman from the red corner!

597
00:28:02,857 --> 00:28:03,925
Congratulations!

00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:05,226
RED CORNER
MYUNG HYUNMAN SURVIVES

599
00:28:05,293 --> 00:28:06,294
Congratulations.

600
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:09,564
That knockdown stung, huh?

601
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,566
That really got me, you know.

602
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:15,436
[Dawoon] I learned so much.

603
00:28:15,503 --> 00:28:18,906
I now realize
I still have a long way to go.

604
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:20,942
Hyunman was seriously strong.

605
00:28:21,008 --> 00:28:22,477
You all saw that, right?

606
00:28:22,543 --> 00:28:23,745
That's Myung Hyunman for you.

607
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,881
You'd better look forward
to the next fight as well.

617
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:56,177
There are a few fighters

618
00:28:56,244 --> 00:28:57,378
I just think

619
00:28:58,012 --> 00:28:59,213
are such a waste.

620
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:03,084
I know the production team
won't be a fan of this idea,

621
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:05,386
but I'd like to give

622
00:29:06,087 --> 00:29:07,789
some of them another shot.

Lee Sangsoo did well.

626

631
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,680
never giving up mid-fight.

632
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:34,649
Kim Taesun.

00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:45,159

[contestant 2] "No pain, no gain."

660
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:45,052
[in Korean] It's like a gym
you'd see overseas.

661
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,921
[contestant 3]
Look at that cardboard cutout.

662
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:48,456
[contestant 4] Are we having a match here?

663

-[contestant 5] This place is awesome.
-Right?

664
00:30:50,124 --> 00:30:52,627
[contestant 6] You'd actually want
to train in a gym like this.

[contestant 7] Yes, caffeine.

[Jongkook] It's good to see you all.

677
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:30,765
Round 1 was way more intense

678
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:33,301
-than we expected, huh?
-It was.

679
00:31:33,367 --> 00:31:37,638
Congratulations to all 48 survivors.

680
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:38,706
-[Dex] Congratulations.
-[all cheer]

681
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:43,911
[Jongkook] Right now, Master Don Lee
is preparing Round 2,

682
00:31:43,978 --> 00:31:47,615
something on a whole other level.

683
00:31:48,049 --> 00:31:51,052
Round 2 of I Am Boxer is…

684
00:31:54,088 --> 00:31:55,389
a team round.

685
00:31:55,456 --> 00:31:57,325
[contestants exclaiming]

686
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,461
What's that going to be like?

687
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:03,297
Better build a good team then.

688
00:32:03,364 --> 00:32:05,132
Where's Kim Donghoe?

689
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:06,200
[chuckles]

690
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:08,936
Boxing's an individual sport,

691
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:11,505
so when they said "team round,"

692
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:13,407
I couldn't quite wrap my head around it.

693
00:32:13,908 --> 00:32:15,743
As to what they'd have us do.

694
00:32:16,377 --> 00:32:19,080
I have this mind-set
that I am the weakest one here,

695
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,682
so I felt I had to pull my own weight.

696
00:32:21,749 --> 00:32:24,051
I was worried I might drag the team down.

697
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,057
The 48 fighters here will be divided

698
00:32:30,624 --> 00:32:33,995
into eight teams of six for this round.

699
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:37,631
In each Six-on-Six match,
all six from the winning team

700
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,433
will survive.

701
00:32:40,034 --> 00:32:41,602
Whereas the losing team's six…

702
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:46,007
will all be eliminated.

703
00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:48,576
[contestants gasping]

704
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:50,478
-All six?
-Yeah.

705
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:53,014
[exclaims]

706
00:32:54,582 --> 00:32:56,450
-[exclaims]
-That's intense. [chuckles]

707
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:58,019
I want to survive.

708
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,288
From I Am Boxer's Round 1

709
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:04,959
One-on-One Showdown,
we've chosen eight top performers

710
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:08,329
to serve as this round's captains.

711
00:33:09,296 --> 00:33:11,732
The first captain is…

712
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,701
Kim Minuk!

713
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:15,436
[contestants exclaiming]

714
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,739
-[Dex] Of course.
-[Jongkook] Well, he's…

715
00:33:18,806 --> 00:33:20,574
-No objections there.
-[Dex] None at all.

716
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:22,343
-I'll join him right now.
-[laughs]

717
00:33:22,843 --> 00:33:24,445
The second captain is…

718
00:33:25,846 --> 00:33:27,815
-Myung Hyunman!
-[contestants exclaiming]

719
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:30,017
[Jongkook] He sure was phenomenal.

720
00:33:30,084 --> 00:33:33,721
-[Dex] The floor was practically shaking.
-[Jongkook] That match was…

721
00:33:33,788 --> 00:33:35,723
-We were all pretty fired up.
-[Dex] Absolutely.

722
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,525
[Jongkook] The third captain is…

723
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,960
You can pretty much tell.

724
00:33:43,164 --> 00:33:44,565
Shin Jaehyuk!

725
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:46,567
-Shin Jaehyuk!
-Wait, me?

726
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,702
-Huh?
-[contestants exclaiming]

727
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:51,405
-[Dex] There he is!
-Yeah.

728
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,107
[Jaehyuk] I was like, "Why me?"

729
00:33:53,174 --> 00:33:54,175
SHIN JAEHYUK

730
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,510
-He's a beast.
-He's got crazy stamina.

731
00:33:57,011 --> 00:33:58,512
[contestant 1]
He never gets tired, does he?

732
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,517
[Jongkook] He showed true fighting spirit
all the way through.

733
00:34:03,584 --> 00:34:04,819
It was a great match.

734
00:34:04,885 --> 00:34:07,188
-[Dex] Your passion also counts.
-That's right.

735
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,789
-The fourth captain is…
-Yeah?

736
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,992
[Dex] Hong Sungmin!

737
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:13,094
[contestants exclaim]

738
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,500
-[Dex] Hong Sungmin, he's…
-Looks just like me, doesn't he?

739
00:34:19,567 --> 00:34:21,702
HONG SUNGMIN
SEOUL CITY HALL AMATEUR BOXER

740
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,604
He calls himself my look-alike.

741
00:34:23,671 --> 00:34:24,672
That's right.

742
00:34:24,738 --> 00:34:26,540
I think he looks more like Seo Janghoon.

743
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:28,509
[all laughing]

744
00:34:28,576 --> 00:34:30,010
[Jongkook] All right, moving on.

745
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:32,847
The fifth captain is…

746
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:35,483
Cho Hyunjae!

747
00:34:36,484 --> 00:34:39,053
[contestants exclaiming]

748
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,188
[Dex] He is one of
<i>I Am Boxer</i>'s pretty boys.

749
00:34:41,255 --> 00:34:43,190
-[Jongkook] That's right.
-[Dex] He'll be serving as a leader.

750
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:47,228
Hello, I'm Cho Hyunjae from the KAFAC.

751
00:34:49,263 --> 00:34:51,832
[contestant 1] He's the type
to really get on your nerves, huh?

752
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,367
[contestant 2] His footwork is no joke.

753
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:55,803
[contestant 3]
He's so fast. He's flying out there.

754
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:58,706
-[contestant 4] Good going!
-[Jongkook] He's got great showmanship.

755
00:34:58,772 --> 00:35:02,943
[Hyunjae] I just want to show
that I'm enjoying myself out there.

756
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,845
[Dex] The sixth captain is…

757
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,615
Lee Daeyoung!

758
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:09,216
Lee Daeyoung!

759
00:35:10,784 --> 00:35:11,785
Where is he?

760
00:35:13,787 --> 00:35:14,855
Lee Daeyoung?

761
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:16,891
-Wait, me?
-[Dex] Yes.

762
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:18,159
[all laughing]

763
00:35:18,225 --> 00:35:19,627
You sure that's not a mistake?

764
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:22,830
I'm just a regular office worker.

765
00:35:22,897 --> 00:35:24,098
LEE DAEYOUNG
L* ELECTRONICS EMPLOYEE

766
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:27,168
Who's that guy with the glasses?
The office worker.

767
00:35:27,234 --> 00:35:30,771
We had a regular office worker in his 50s.

768
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:33,641
I didn't see that coming.

769
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:37,411
[Dex] He powers up when he takes off his
glasses just like a comic book character.

770
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,788
[contestants exclaim]

771
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:51,292
-[laughs]
-Rumor has it that those glasses are fake.

772
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:52,660
[Dex] That's right.

773
00:35:52,726 --> 00:35:54,395
A disguise
to catch his opponent off guard.

774
00:35:54,461 --> 00:35:56,463
[Jongkook] And to hide his real power.

775
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,566
The seventh captain is…

776
00:35:59,133 --> 00:36:00,467
Shin Donghyun!

777
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:04,772
[contestants exclaiming]

778
00:36:05,506 --> 00:36:06,907
That guy's really good.

779
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:10,277
[Donghyun] I've won the championship
in four organizations in Korea,

780
00:36:10,344 --> 00:36:13,681
and I debuted
with one of the world's top promotions,

781
00:36:13,747 --> 00:36:14,982
ONE Championship.

782
00:36:15,783 --> 00:36:18,419
[Jongkook] He's a Muay Thai fighter,

783
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:19,520
but he can box too.

784
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:22,756
Last but not least, the eighth captain is…

785
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,859
-Kim Donghoe!
-[contestants exclaiming]

786
00:36:27,528 --> 00:36:30,598
He's our very last captain.

787
00:36:30,664 --> 00:36:32,299
[Jongkook] No objections there.

788
00:36:32,366 --> 00:36:33,667
[Dex] None at all.

789
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,936
KIM MINUK, MYUNG HYUNMAN,
SHIN JAEHYUK, HONG SUNGMIN

790
00:36:36,003 --> 00:36:38,105
CHO HYUNJAE, LEE DAEYOUNG,
SHIN DONGHYUN, KIM DONGHOE

791
00:36:38,172 --> 00:36:40,474
Now, let's begin the team selections

792
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:42,109
right now!

793
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:46,313
First, let me explain how it works.

794
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,949
Each team will have six members,

795
00:36:49,016 --> 00:36:50,751
so one captain

796
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:53,020
and five teammates.

797
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,456
Each team captain
will personally pick five members

798
00:36:55,522 --> 00:36:59,026
from those who picked them.

799
00:36:59,793 --> 00:37:01,695
-Who do I pick?
-Your brother, who else?

800
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:02,963
Forget about connections.

801
00:37:03,897 --> 00:37:05,432
[In English] Are we allowed to pick?

802
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:07,635
-They are gonna pick.
-Ah, they're gonna pick.

803
00:37:07,701 --> 00:37:10,204
[in Korean] This is gonna
hurt some feelings. [laughs]

804
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,007
If you don't get picked,
it'd be awkward to join another.

805
00:37:13,073 --> 00:37:14,174
It'd be humiliating.

806
00:37:14,241 --> 00:37:17,911
-Team selection starts now!
-All right!

807
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:19,513
Come on, world! [chuckles]

808
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,215
God, this is cruel.

809
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:22,783
What should I do?

810
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:24,318
What now?

811
00:37:24,385 --> 00:37:25,886
Gotta be decisive.

812
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:28,589
Minuk's basically
having an audition there.

813
00:37:28,656 --> 00:37:30,090
Who's done a ton of matches?

814
00:37:31,392 --> 00:37:33,894
[Kyungmin]
When they named the team captains,

815
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,597
I knew I had to join Kim Minuk's team.

816
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:38,699
"The one team that would never lose."

817
00:37:38,766 --> 00:37:40,200
I figured that'd be his team.

818
00:37:41,402 --> 00:37:43,570
Our star from Japan.

819
00:37:45,072 --> 00:37:46,640
-The one in the back?
-Yeah.

820
00:37:48,175 --> 00:37:49,310
I'm sorry, guys.

821
00:37:49,376 --> 00:37:51,211
I'm sorry, man, seriously.

822
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:53,013
[Minuk] Yes, I'm satisfied.

823
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,516
They're all experienced,
seasoned fighters.

824
00:37:55,582 --> 00:37:57,551
They've all been through a lot.

825
00:37:57,618 --> 00:38:00,087
I figured that'd work in our favor.

826
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:01,488
Come on, that's not fair.

827
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:03,223
-Wow, that's…
-No fair!

828
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,826
What are you,
forming a national team there?

829
00:38:06,393 --> 00:38:08,962
-That's just cheating.
-It totally is.

830
00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:11,365
KIM TAEKMIN
3-TIME KNSF CHAMPION

831
00:38:11,432 --> 00:38:12,700
Coach, come up here.

832
00:38:12,766 --> 00:38:14,034
Ah, appreciate it.

833
00:38:14,535 --> 00:38:16,737
LEE SANGGEUN
BOXING GYM OWNER, 177 CM/82 KG

834
00:38:16,804 --> 00:38:18,072
Would you like to join us?

835
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:21,175
PARK YOUNGHO
FITNESS MODEL, 180 CM/91 KG

836
00:38:21,241 --> 00:38:26,013
[Donghoe] I was planning to build my team
mostly with guys on the bigger side.

837
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,449
-[contestant] Donghoe's team looks strong.
-[contestant 2] They're tough.

838
00:38:29,016 --> 00:38:32,886
-There's clearly a crowd favorite.
-It seems so.

839
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:36,724
[Hyunman] Seeing everyone pick Kim Donghoe
and Kim Minuk got me thinking,

840
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,459
"I've got to promote myself."

841
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:41,128
Want some soy-marinated crab, sir?

842
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:43,397
Unlimited soy-marinated crab, everyone!

843
00:38:43,464 --> 00:38:46,834
Looks like Hyunman's trying
to win them over with his crabs.

844
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,137
The two in front of him look like
they love soy-marinated crab.

845
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:53,841
They've got that vibe, you know.

846
00:38:53,907 --> 00:38:55,709
[Hyunman] All right!

847
00:38:55,776 --> 00:38:58,278
-I love soy-marinated crab!
-[Hyunman] Okay! Nice!

848
00:38:58,345 --> 00:39:01,215
Hey, you like soy-marinated crab?

849
00:39:02,082 --> 00:39:03,684
Want free refills for life?

850
00:39:03,751 --> 00:39:05,219
-He's got speed.
-Right.

851
00:39:05,285 --> 00:39:06,653
We're a perfect mix of power…

852
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,389
-Okay, great!
-[contestants cheer]

853
00:39:08,455 --> 00:39:09,790
Now we're talking!

854
00:39:09,857 --> 00:39:11,258
Got some real characters there.

855
00:39:11,325 --> 00:39:12,326
TEAM MYUNG HYUNMAN
CELEBRITY SQUAD

856
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:13,961
All the national team guys grouped up.

857
00:39:14,027 --> 00:39:15,028
Those amateurs.

858
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:17,564
TEAM CHO HYUNJAE
ELITE AMATEUR BOXERS

859
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:18,999
We're done forming our team.

860
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,901
Size doesn't matter.

861
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:23,303
What matters is our teamwork.

862
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,539
GIJUN, YUNCHAN, JUYEONG,
SELLCHAN, SUNGMIN, JIHYEOK

863
00:39:25,606 --> 00:39:26,840
They're a team of foreigners.

864
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,475
TEAM HONG SUNGMIN
GLOBAL BOXING SQUAD

865
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,844
[Donghyun]
Our team is the "No Real Boxer Squad."

866
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:32,079
KIM HUNSU, KIM MINWOO, KO YOHAN,

867
00:39:32,146 --> 00:39:33,480
NAM MINWOO,
SHIN DONGHYUN, KIM DONGHYUN

868
00:39:33,547 --> 00:39:35,616
You can pick us last. It's fine.

869
00:39:35,682 --> 00:39:37,651
Team Lee Daeyoung? The weakest link.

870
00:39:37,718 --> 00:39:39,553
Feels like we can easily beat them.

871
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:44,224
All right,
our eight teams are now complete!

872
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:47,461
[Dex] Now,
it's time for the pre-game challenge

873
00:39:47,528 --> 00:39:50,097
with a major advantage at stake.

874
00:39:50,164 --> 00:39:51,165
Right now?

875
00:39:51,732 --> 00:39:54,835
The reward for this pre-game challenge is…

876
00:39:55,636 --> 00:39:56,637
A consolation match?

877
00:39:57,838 --> 00:39:59,540
[Jongkook] The right
to pick your opponent!

878
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,409
-I like that.
-What a major advantage.

879
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:03,877
That's huge.

880
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:07,047
[Dongeon]
If we can get a favorable matchup,

881
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:09,883
we could have a real shot at winning,
even as the underdogs.

882
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,518
[Dex] For this Six-on-Six team round,

883
00:40:11,585 --> 00:40:15,889
the pre-game event
with a huge advantage is…

884
00:40:16,523 --> 00:40:18,325
[Sungwoon]
Something that takes brains, please.

885
00:40:18,892 --> 00:40:20,294
What will it be?

886
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:23,330
-[Dex] …the punching machine!
-[contestants exclaim]

887
00:40:23,931 --> 00:40:25,532
Okay, the punching machine.

888
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:26,633
Sounds good.

889
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,869
Oh, come on…

890
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:29,970
This is just…

891
00:40:33,106 --> 00:40:36,109
DEMONSTRATION BY
A SKILLED INSTRUCTOR

892
00:40:44,685 --> 00:40:46,787
Oh! I scored 9,988.

893
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:48,522
[in English] Good!

894
00:40:52,292 --> 00:40:53,861
[Dex, in Korean] Out of all eight teams,

895
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:57,531
the one with the highest
punching machine score

896
00:40:58,232 --> 00:41:01,001
will earn the right
to choose their opponent.

897
00:41:01,068 --> 00:41:02,936
Before we get started,

898
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,372
let's play a game just for fun.

899
00:41:05,439 --> 00:41:07,307
All right then.

900
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:10,077
I don't want to use both hands
and embarrass myself with the score.

901
00:41:10,143 --> 00:41:11,245
I'll stick to one hand.

902
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:12,379
Okay, nice and easy.

903
00:41:12,446 --> 00:41:13,914
-[grunts] Like this?
-That's right.

904
00:41:14,882 --> 00:41:16,850
[Jongkook exclaims]

905
00:41:17,551 --> 00:41:20,053
Hey, that was pretty good!

906
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,822
That's pretty high.

907
00:41:21,889 --> 00:41:23,757
It went over 9,000.

908
00:41:23,824 --> 00:41:26,093
-[Jongkook] Hey, whoa!
-[Dex] My back hurts.

909
00:41:26,593 --> 00:41:27,895
Let's hope someone slips up.

910
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:31,131
I hope you all learn from me
and play smart.

911
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,199
[Jongkook] First up!

912
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:35,569
Team Myung Hyunman's representative,

913
00:41:35,636 --> 00:41:37,738
please step forward.

914
00:41:37,804 --> 00:41:39,506
That's a no-brainer.

915
00:41:40,374 --> 00:41:42,743
[Dex] As expected!

916
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:45,012
[Jongkook] There's no surprise there!

917
00:41:45,078 --> 00:41:46,079
I knew it.

918
00:41:46,146 --> 00:41:47,481
I knew it.

919
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:49,383
He's got a nuke of a punch.

920
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:50,751
Do you play this game often?

921
00:41:50,817 --> 00:41:51,885
-After a drink.
-Right.

922
00:41:51,952 --> 00:41:52,953
Of course.

923
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,855
I think I always hit the top score.

924
00:41:54,922 --> 00:41:56,056
-The top score?
-Yes.

925
00:41:56,123 --> 00:41:57,991
-Of course.
-I bet he tops us all.

926
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,160
Please slip up.

927
00:42:00,961 --> 00:42:02,529
Okay, here we go!

928
00:42:02,596 --> 00:42:04,197
-Let's go!
-Let's do this!

929
00:42:04,264 --> 00:42:05,265
[Jongkook] Ready.

930
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:08,535
[O3ohn] He might punch a hole in it.

931
00:42:08,602 --> 00:42:09,937
He'll destroy it.

932
00:42:10,003 --> 00:42:13,740
Myung Hyunman's got that nuclear punch,
so I was feeling pretty confident.

933
00:42:13,807 --> 00:42:15,576
I knew we'd take first place.

934
00:42:18,211 --> 00:42:20,147
[Jongkook]
Put your weight behind it. And boom!

935
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:23,050
Put your weight behind it. And boom!

936
00:42:23,116 --> 00:42:25,152
[exclaiming]

937
00:42:30,424 --> 00:42:32,993
TEAM MYUNG HYUNMAN: 9,291 POINTS

938
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,761
Is the max score 9,999?

939
00:42:34,828 --> 00:42:36,096
Oh…

940
00:42:36,163 --> 00:42:37,531
I thought it'd be around 9,600.

941
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:38,732
I swear I heard it break.

942
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:41,602
-Told you it measures differently!
-Ah…

943
00:42:41,668 --> 00:42:43,937
-There must've been a glitch!
-That's right!

944
00:42:44,004 --> 00:42:46,340
It sounded insane, though.

945
00:42:46,406 --> 00:42:48,775
-Who cares about that? It's about power.
-[laughing]

946
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,411
There's no way.

947
00:42:51,478 --> 00:42:53,146
-[Hyunman] Maybe I hit it wrong.
-One more try!

948
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:55,849
-Shoot.
-What an unexpected turn of events!

949
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:57,150
But it sounded like…

950
00:42:58,018 --> 00:43:02,689
Maybe I hit it too hard,
and the sensor broke.

951
00:43:02,756 --> 00:43:04,257
It couldn't handle all that power.

952
00:43:05,025 --> 00:43:06,159
That's gotta be it, right?

953
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,228
[Jongkook] Next up,

954
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:11,431
Team Kim Minuk's representative.

955
00:43:11,498 --> 00:43:13,233
-Please come forward.
-Oh!

956
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,202
[contestants exclaiming]

957
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:19,439
[Jongkook] Please come forward.

958
00:43:19,506 --> 00:43:20,507
TEAM CAPTAIN KIM MINUK

959
00:43:20,574 --> 00:43:22,743
It's the team captain himself.

960
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:25,812
I bet he'll do well.
He's got that one-punch power.

961
00:43:26,413 --> 00:43:29,016
I don't think anyone can score over 9,300.

962
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:31,284
-You think 9,300 is the max?
-[Hyunman] Yes.

963
00:43:31,351 --> 00:43:33,053
Yes, that's the max.

964
00:43:33,854 --> 00:43:35,856
-All right, are you going in with a hook?
-Yep.

965
00:43:35,922 --> 00:43:37,858
[Jongkook] He's going in with a hook.

966
00:43:37,924 --> 00:43:40,127
All right, whenever you're ready…

967
00:43:40,193 --> 00:43:41,228
[Jongkook gasps]

968
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,999
[exclaiming]

969
00:43:49,636 --> 00:43:50,971
TEAM KIM MINUK: 9,367 POINTS

970
00:43:51,038 --> 00:43:53,674
That's 9,367 points!

971
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,276
-What the…
-No way!

972
00:43:56,343 --> 00:43:57,377
Wow.

973
00:43:57,878 --> 00:43:59,713
[Jongkook] This works differently!

974
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,314
See? It's different!

975
00:44:01,381 --> 00:44:03,850
What did I tell you!

976
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:06,920
Lee Sanggeun here is the owner
and head coach of my gym.

977
00:44:07,554 --> 00:44:10,157
[Hyunman] I don't think
anyone can score over 9,300.

978
00:44:10,223 --> 00:44:11,324
-Let's see.
-You got this!

979
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,392
Let's go!

980
00:44:12,459 --> 00:44:14,394
[exclaiming]

981
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:18,065
TEAM KIM DONGHOE: 9,313 POINTS

982
00:44:18,131 --> 00:44:20,167
That's pretty high.

983
00:44:20,233 --> 00:44:22,602
Okay, we beat them.

984
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,204
But still!

985
00:44:24,738 --> 00:44:26,373
He beat Myung Hyunman's score!

986
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,709
-Nice!
-Ouch, that stings.

987
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:33,280
[Jongkook] Team Lee Daeyoung's brought out
their heaviest member!

988
00:44:33,346 --> 00:44:35,615
-Oh, he's staring down the machine!
-Look at that glare!

989
00:44:35,682 --> 00:44:36,917
-Come on!
-Here we go!

990
00:44:36,983 --> 00:44:38,752
[Jongkook] And swing!
That was a solid hit!

991
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:40,520
[Hyunman] I don't think
anyone can score over 9,300.

992
00:44:40,587 --> 00:44:42,055
-You got it!
-You got it!

993
00:44:42,122 --> 00:44:43,123
That was clean!

994
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,192
-You got it!
-You got it!

TEAM LEE DAEYOUNG: 9,342 POINTS

996
00:44:47,828 --> 00:44:50,630
[Jongkook] Looks like anyone can beat
Hyunman's score.

997
00:44:52,365 --> 00:44:55,168
[Dex] And now, from Team Cho Hyunjae,
we have Kwon Ohgon,

998
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:58,972
former Lightweight
and Super Lightweight Champion!

999
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:00,807
-Go, Ohgon!
-All right.

1000
00:45:00,874 --> 00:45:02,309
Ohgon's got heavy hands.

1001
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:03,443
Let's go!

1002
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:04,711
[Jongkook] I hope he also beats…

1003
00:45:05,712 --> 00:45:07,080
…he also beats…

1004
00:45:07,147 --> 00:45:09,750
[Hyunman] I don't think
anyone can score over 9,300.

Kwon Ohgon!

1011

Team Cho Hyunjae
just took down Myung Hyunman!

1012
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:30,337
-All right. Let's see now.

00:46:04,337 --> 00:46:06,506
[Lee] I mean, just look at all this.

1021
00:46:08,575 --> 00:46:10,277
[Dex] They're going to be dying out there.

1022
00:46:13,647 --> 00:46:15,115
-Let's do this!
-All right!

1023

-[grunts]
-Let's go!

1024
00:46:17,617 --> 00:46:18,618
Let's do this.

1025
00:46:18,685 --> 00:46:19,920
What is this?

1026
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:21,955
Damn, what is all this?

1027
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:23,957
-Hitting till it breaks?
-What is this?

1028
00:46:24,024 --> 00:46:25,025
[in English] Damn!

1029
00:46:25,091 --> 00:46:26,092
[in Korean] What is all this?

1030
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:27,794
No freaking way.

1031
00:46:27,861 --> 00:46:29,462
Are we supposed to pop all of these?

1032
00:46:29,529 --> 00:46:30,931
Guess we're smashing them all.

1033
00:46:31,665 --> 00:46:32,666
Ah.

1034
00:46:32,732 --> 00:46:34,067
I think we have to move them.

1035
00:46:34,134 --> 00:46:35,969
-I think that's it.
-Okay, got it.

1036
00:46:36,036 --> 00:46:38,004
-We're supposed to knock them off.
-By hitting them.

1037
00:46:38,672 --> 00:46:39,739
By hitting them, huh?

1038
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,641
How many are there?

1039
00:46:42,876 --> 00:46:44,277
Around a hundred?

1040
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:50,984

TEAM HONG SUNGMIN
VS TEAM SHIN JAEHYUK

1079
00:48:57,711 --> 00:48:59,980
[Lee, in Korean]
Team Red is made up mostly of boxers,

1080
00:49:00,046 --> 00:49:03,183
while Team Blue's got
a few MMA fighters in the mix.

1081
00:49:03,883 --> 00:49:07,454
-But Hong Sungmin is a great boxer.
-Yeah.

1082
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,922
HONG SUNGMIN
3-TIME KNSF CHAMPION

1083
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:12,292
[Dex] Shin Jaehyuk's really good too.
What they have in common is,

1084
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:14,427
-they're aggressive fighters.
-[Jongkook] Yeah, totally.

1085
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:16,696
They're both strong.

1086
00:49:16,763 --> 00:49:18,598
-[Lee] This already feels like the finals.
-[Dex] Right?

1087
00:49:19,299 --> 00:49:20,600
[Lee] I wonder who will win.

1088
00:49:21,901 --> 00:49:23,136
Who's feeling good right now?

1089
00:49:23,203 --> 00:49:24,204
TEAM RED

1090
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,106
Raise your hands. I feel pretty good.

1091
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,741
You good? All right.

1092
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,609
Then we'll go first in the first half.

1093
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:32,178
All right, it's decided.

1094
00:49:32,245 --> 00:49:34,948
Now, I think it's better
to start clearing from the far end.

1095
00:49:35,015 --> 00:49:37,250
-Got it.
-So let's start from the end.

1096
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:39,786
Okay, we're starting from the end.

1097
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,323
-Anyone want to go first?
-Who wants to be Group 1?

1098
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,959
No, current fighters should go first.

1099
00:49:46,026 --> 00:49:47,193
-Current fighters first?
-Yes.

1100
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:48,728
-So, us three?
-Gotta set the tone.

1101
00:49:48,795 --> 00:49:50,597
-Okay.
-You're Group 1.

1102
00:49:50,663 --> 00:49:52,799
But objectively speaking here,

1103
00:49:52,866 --> 00:49:54,834
those guys are just…

1104
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:58,004
They're all scrawny, and they're amateurs.

1105
00:49:58,772 --> 00:50:01,307
If we're talking punching power,
they can't beat us.

1106
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:02,409
That's true.

1107
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:06,046
[Jaehyuk] I'm a middleweight,
and so is Chungil.

1108
00:50:06,112 --> 00:50:11,251
If there's a weight difference,
our punches are bound to have more impact.

1109
00:50:11,317 --> 00:50:13,920
So I thought,
"We've got this. Totally got this."

1110
00:50:14,954 --> 00:50:16,222
Honestly, I wasn't worried.

1111
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:19,459
I thought the weight difference was huge,

1112
00:50:19,526 --> 00:50:23,396
but we're younger,
and we've got more current fighters.

1113
00:50:23,463 --> 00:50:25,999
So, we're definitely the stronger team.

1129
00:51:07,574 --> 00:51:09,609
Look at Hong Sungmin!

1130
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:12,045
He's looking light on his feet!

1131
00:51:15,014 --> 00:51:17,250
[Jongkook] Whoa,
he's going in with a flurry of punches.

1132
00:51:17,317 --> 00:51:18,384
Yes, that's it.

1133
00:51:18,451 --> 00:51:20,320
He's not doing too badly
with those combos.

1134
00:51:22,055 --> 00:51:23,723
They're doing well on the inside.

1135
00:51:24,524 --> 00:51:25,692
[Dex] Red's fast!

1136
00:51:27,594 --> 00:51:28,795
The other side's fast too.

1137
00:51:28,862 --> 00:51:29,929

[Jaehyuk] It won't budge.

1162
00:52:25,385 --> 00:52:27,020
It's getting caught at the end.

1163
00:52:28,254 --> 00:52:29,455
[Juhyun] You're right.

1164
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:33,393
[chuckles] Honestly,
I thought it'd drop right away.

1165
00:52:33,459 --> 00:52:36,262
But there was this little hook at the end,

1166
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:38,064
so it wouldn't fall off easily.

1167
00:52:44,003 --> 00:52:45,071
Why won't it drop?

1168
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:50,577
[Sungmin] You know that hook at the end?

1169
00:52:50,643 --> 00:52:53,012
It kept getting stuck there.

1170
00:52:53,913 --> 00:52:55,215
It's not moving, damn it!

00:52:59,085 --> 00:53:01,454

No, stop.

No, that's not how you do it!

1174
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,364
When you've got enough energy,
you can drop the punching bag.

1175

00:53:54,741 --> 00:53:55,775
Wait, it won't drop.

1197
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,249
Shin Jaehyuk looks a little flustered too.

1198

Look at this team. They're doing well.

1201
00:54:18,765 --> 00:54:20,233
They're doing great!

1202
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,036
Seriously, though…

1203
00:54:23,102 --> 00:54:25,672
-[Lee] Park Chungil's got…
-Insane power, right?

1204
00:54:25,738 --> 00:54:26,906
He's strong.

1205
00:54:27,573 --> 00:54:32,478
Look at him.
His punches carry real weight.

-Sellchan, use your feet!
-Keep going!

1210

Don't stop!

1211
00:54:46,526 --> 00:54:49,262
-No hooks, just straight punches!
-Just straight!

1212
00:54:51,297 --> 00:54:52,298
[Dex] Oh, no.

1213
00:54:52,365 --> 00:54:54,500
[Lee] If you hit it like that,
it's not going to fall.

1214
00:54:56,869 --> 00:54:58,371
[Sellchan] God, it was heavy.

1215
00:54:58,438 --> 00:55:00,340
I felt like there was no way through.

1216
00:55:02,909 --> 00:55:04,377
[Jongkook]
Gotta put your weight behind it.

1217
00:55:05,812 --> 00:55:08,915
Put your weight behind it.
There's no other way.

1218
00:55:09,582 --> 00:55:11,617
Move on to the next one!

1219
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:14,020

1221
00:55:17,256 --> 00:55:21,127
[Jongkook] One of their guys is just
too light to pack much power.

LEE JUYEONG/63 KG
0 PUNCHING BAGS DROPPED

1223
00:55:26,466 --> 00:55:28,000
[Juyeong] I was like,
"Why isn't this moving?

1224
00:55:28,067 --> 00:55:29,369
Wait, why won't it drop?"

1225
00:55:30,203 --> 00:55:32,772
"Wait, this is bad." [exclaims]

00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:34,107
"I'm dragging everyone down.

I really can't tell.

1242
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:20,052

00:57:05,565 --> 00:57:08,267
Whereas they've only cleared 40.

1262

[contestants whispering]

1264
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:16,242
[Yunchan] We were down by nine points.

1265
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:21,280
Since we don't have many heavyweights,

1266
00:57:21,347 --> 00:57:24,784
it was tough,
knocking the punching bags off the hooks.

Right.

1272
00:57:40,566 --> 00:57:42,401
It's easier
for the heavier guys after all.

1273
00:57:42,468 --> 00:57:44,470
It's easier if you're heavy,

1274
00:57:44,537 --> 00:57:46,072
so number one, two, three. Got it?

1275
00:57:46,138 --> 00:57:51,744
[Jaehyuk] I figured the second half
would all come down to individual skill.

1276
00:57:51,811 --> 00:57:54,881
If you're not too gassed,
we'll stick with the same order.

1277

All right, the other team's lost spirit.

00:57:59,352 --> 00:58:02,722
-It gets stuck on the hook at the end.
-I know.

1280
00:58:02,788 --> 00:58:07,460
But if it won't drop and you're too tired,
just leave it and come back.

00:58:07,527 --> 00:58:09,695
-Okay, got it.
-All right?

1282
00:58:09,762 --> 00:58:11,497
[Sungmin]
You know that hook at the very end?

1283
00:58:11,564 --> 00:58:13,432
That's where they seemed to get stuck.

1284
00:58:13,499 --> 00:58:17,970
But I figured
I could knock that off in one hit.

1285

-Yeah.

Just look straight ahead
and give it your all!

1288
00:58:27,046 --> 00:58:28,447
[Jaehyuk] The goal was simple:

1289
00:58:28,514 --> 00:58:30,716
focus only on what's in front of you
and knock it down.

-Okay.

-Okay, move on!
-All right!

1331
01:00:21,594 --> 01:00:23,129
We'd figured it out.

1332
01:00:23,763 --> 01:00:24,830
As for the lightweights,

1333
01:00:26,265 --> 01:00:28,968
it's hard to knock
the punching bags off completely.

1334
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:34,073
But it's easy to push them
to the point where they're about to drop.

1335
01:00:35,274 --> 01:00:37,309
Ah, so it's a pre-push strategy.

1336
01:00:37,376 --> 01:00:40,079
Yeah, they've got to
set them up like that.

1337
01:00:40,146 --> 01:00:41,881
-From the back!
-Who'll do the pushing here?

1338

-Okay.

[Juyeong] Sungmin told us
just to push them to the edge,

1342
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:55,327
so that's exactly what I did.

1343
01:00:56,429 --> 01:00:58,297

-That's insane.

1354

TEAM BLUE

1355
01:01:23,589 --> 01:01:24,757
-Come back.
-That's enough.

1356
01:01:24,824 --> 01:01:26,859
-Come on back!
-Let's switch!

1357
01:01:26,926 --> 01:01:27,993
-Let's switch!
-Switch!

1358
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,396
[contestants cheering, clamoring]

1359
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:33,265
TEAM RED: 45 - TEAM BLUE: 45

1360
01:01:33,332 --> 01:01:34,333
All right!

1361
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,736
[Taesun] I could've done a little better.

1362
01:01:36,802 --> 01:01:37,803
Did I stay in too long?

1363
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:38,871
[contestant] Come on, man!

1364
01:01:40,306 --> 01:01:41,674
-Nice!
-That's it!

1365
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:43,075
-But they're doing well.
-Yeah?

1366
01:01:43,142 --> 01:01:44,176
Yeah, they are.

1367
01:01:44,877 --> 01:01:46,412
After the pre-push, with a combo…

1368
01:01:46,479 --> 01:01:47,780
Keep it up, man!

1369
01:01:49,648 --> 01:01:51,584
[Jaehyuk] We've got a shot at this.

1370
01:01:57,356 --> 01:01:59,225
-Who's recovered a bit?
-Juyeong, that's enough!

1371
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:01,193
-Can you go next?
-Come back here!

1372
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,962
You're gassed. Just push it to the edge.

1373
01:02:03,028 --> 01:02:04,563
-Juyeong, that's enough!
-Run!

1374
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,766
-Run!
-Juyeong, come! Hurry!

1375
01:02:06,832 --> 01:02:07,967
Sungmin, finish them off.

1376
01:02:08,033 --> 01:02:09,468
-Your turn!
-Go, Sungmin!

1377
01:02:09,535 --> 01:02:11,070
That's it!

1378
01:02:11,137 --> 01:02:12,304
[Dex] Whoa, look.

1379
01:02:13,172 --> 01:02:14,373
He's pounding away.

1380
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:15,441
He's pounding at them.

1381
01:02:16,976 --> 01:02:19,745
-[exhaling]
-[red team cheers]

1382
01:02:19,812 --> 01:02:21,781
All right! Nice!

1383
01:02:22,848 --> 01:02:23,983
Gijun's going in!

1384
01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:26,051
[exclaiming]

1385
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:27,953
That's it!

1386
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,122
-Lee Gijun's fast!
-[Dex] Seriously, whoa!

1387
01:02:30,189 --> 01:02:31,690
-Wow.
-Wait, what?

1388
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,959
[Lee] Whoa, he's super fast.

1389
01:02:34,894 --> 01:02:36,295
[Dex] What's gotten into him?

1390
01:02:37,396 --> 01:02:38,664
Using his right hand only.

1391
01:02:40,432 --> 01:02:41,567
-Come back!
-Come, come!

1392
01:02:41,634 --> 01:02:43,435
[Jongkook]
They're swapping each other right out.

1393
01:02:43,502 --> 01:02:44,503
In you go!

1394
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:47,473
[both laughing]

1395
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:48,774
That's some killer strategy.

1396
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:50,509
[chuckles] They're thinking smart.

1397
01:02:50,576 --> 01:02:55,080
What's good about their strategy is
that they only use 30% of their energy,

1398
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:56,949
then tap out and recharge,

1399
01:02:57,016 --> 01:02:58,317
so it's super efficient.

1400
01:02:58,951 --> 01:03:00,119
They're now in the lead!

1401
01:03:01,554 --> 01:03:03,522
Ah, he's gassed. I'm tapping in.

1402
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:05,591
Go, Park Chungil!

1403
01:03:05,658 --> 01:03:07,326
TEAM BLUE

1404
01:03:07,393 --> 01:03:09,428
-Nice one.
-Yes, that's the way to go.

1405
01:03:11,564 --> 01:03:13,232
-Yes, that's it!
-Going good, man!

1406
01:03:13,299 --> 01:03:15,501
-You've found your rhythm!
-Use one-two combos!

1407
01:03:15,568 --> 01:03:16,702
One-two combos!

1408
01:03:16,769 --> 01:03:19,271
-[Jongkook] One-two! That's it!
-All right!

1409
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:20,806
-You got it, man!
-Nice.

1410
01:03:21,473 --> 01:03:24,109
Team Blue, you can still turn this around!

1411
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:26,378
-Great!
-He's killing it right now.

1412
01:03:27,379 --> 01:03:28,714
-He got the hang of it.
-Yes!

1413
01:03:28,781 --> 01:03:30,082
-Just leave it to him.
-You okay?

1414
01:03:30,149 --> 01:03:31,383
No switching. He's good.

1415
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:32,985
-Come back if you want!
-Just trust him.

1416
01:03:33,052 --> 01:03:34,053
He's got this.

1417
01:03:36,455 --> 01:03:38,424
[Dex]
Why's he doing everything by himself?

1418
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:40,025
They need to switch.

1419
01:03:40,092 --> 01:03:42,494
Team Blue, you've gotta switch!

1420
01:03:42,561 --> 01:03:43,829
You've gotta switch now!

1421
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:46,365
[Jaehyuk] Chungil was doing really great.

1422
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:51,337
We just wanted to trust him on this.

1423
01:03:52,104 --> 01:03:53,906
[Jongkook] He's doing great.

1424
01:03:53,973 --> 01:03:55,641
That's why they're letting him keep going.

1425
01:03:56,709 --> 01:03:59,144
[Dex]
But that's a heavy load for one person.

1426

1427
01:04:06,118 --> 01:04:07,820

-Nice job, guys!
-We did so well!

1445
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,697
[Jongkook] Wow, it's usually impossible
to turn this around.

1446
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:54,133
Well, that was…

Damn it!

1452
01:05:04,209 --> 01:05:05,945
[Jaehyuk] It was frustrating.

-We did well.
-[red team cheering]

1454
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,684
[Jaehyuk] We were solid in the first half.

1455
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:14,520
Things went downhill the moment
we went with that one-person strategy.

1456
01:05:14,586 --> 01:05:18,424
We thought it'd be fine
to leave it to individual skill, but…

1457
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:21,760
In the end, a team game takes

1458
01:05:21,827 --> 01:05:23,996
more than just one person doing well.

01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:08,774
What's all this?

1477
01:06:08,841 --> 01:06:10,976
Wait a minute!

1478
01:06:11,043 --> 01:06:12,544
Why are there so many of them?

1479
01:06:12,611 --> 01:06:14,046
No way!

1480
01:06:14,113 --> 01:06:15,981
Damn, this place is massive.

1481
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:20,319
-Just how many punching bags are there?
-This is wild.

1482
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,255
-[exclaims]
-[Donghoe] Seeing all those bags,

1483
01:06:23,322 --> 01:06:25,257
I was honestly shocked.

1484
01:06:25,324 --> 01:06:27,760
I kept thinking,
"Why are there so many punching bags?"

1485
01:06:28,327 --> 01:06:30,262
I'd never seen anything like it before.

1486
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:34,366
TEAM KIM DONGHOE
VS TEAM MYUNG HYUNMAN

1487
01:06:34,433 --> 01:06:36,902
-I think we need a plan.
-We do.

1488
01:06:36,969 --> 01:06:39,171
I'm thinking, one-two combos.

1489
01:06:39,238 --> 01:06:41,640
-Push them as you hit.
-I agree.

1490
01:06:42,674 --> 01:06:45,377
Who's gonna be the first three to go in?

1491
01:06:45,444 --> 01:06:48,347
-Should we go? Us three?
-Sure.

1492
01:06:48,414 --> 01:06:49,782
Okay, that's decided then.

1493
01:06:49,848 --> 01:06:51,216
We need a game plan.

1494
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:54,119
[Hyunman] The bars were L-shaped.

1495
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,455
The bars the bags were hanging from.

1496
01:06:57,056 --> 01:06:58,490
So to knock them down,

1497
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:00,459
you shouldn't use short bursts of power.

1498
01:07:00,526 --> 01:07:03,996
You've got to hit them straight,
like when you drop an opponent.

1499
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,398
Who will go first?

1500
01:07:06,465 --> 01:07:08,700
-The heavyweights should go in later.
-Later?

1501
01:07:09,268 --> 01:07:10,736
You three go first.

1502
01:07:10,803 --> 01:07:11,870
Ah, got it.

1503
01:07:12,571 --> 01:07:14,139
Don't get hung up on the ones

1504
01:07:14,773 --> 01:07:15,974
you can't drop.

1505
01:07:16,508 --> 01:07:18,077
"If it doesn't drop,

1506
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:21,113
the next person can finish it off.

1507
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,347
So, just move on."

1508
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:24,483
That was our strategy.

1509
01:07:25,784 --> 01:07:28,287
[Jongkook] Before we begin
the Six-on-Six Punching Race…

1510
01:07:28,353 --> 01:07:31,723
-[exhales]
-…let's hear how the teams are feeling.

1511
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:33,025
We'll do our best

1512
01:07:33,525 --> 01:07:35,694
to knock them all down as fast as we can.

1513
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:36,995
[Jongkook] Sounds good.

1514
01:07:37,496 --> 01:07:39,131
We'll all work together.

1515
01:07:39,698 --> 01:07:41,100
The first three will do their part,

1516
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:43,802
and we'll do whatever it takes
to knock them down, even blowing on them.

1517
01:07:43,869 --> 01:07:44,903
[all chuckle]

1518
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:46,738
That sounds awesome.

1519
01:07:46,805 --> 01:07:49,475
We're a bit worried
since your punches aren't the strongest.

1520
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:50,809

1522
01:07:53,112 --> 01:07:56,181
Well, this is punching bags
we're talking about.

1523
01:07:56,248 --> 01:07:58,684
-I've got this.
-All right, great.

1524
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:01,386
Looking forward to seeing a fiery match.
Good luck.

1525
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:03,422
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1526
01:08:07,326 --> 01:08:09,962
-Look at Team Red's lineup.
-[exclaims]

1527
01:08:10,028 --> 01:08:11,463
Sending out their strongest.

1528
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:12,598
Who's going first?

1529
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:15,000
Ah, it's the three up front.

1530
01:08:15,067 --> 01:08:17,803
Kim Donghoe and Kim Taekmin
are heading in there first, huh?

1531
01:08:19,638 --> 01:08:21,940
[Dex] And this side's got
a completely different setup.

1532
01:08:22,007 --> 01:08:24,243
YUK JUNSEO, O3OHN, BM

1533
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:26,411
Rear-wheel versus front-wheel formation.

1534
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,247
-Oh, right.
-Yeah, it's… [chuckles]

1535
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:29,581
You know what I mean.

1536
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:30,649
RED: 258 KG, BLUE: 210 KG

1537
01:08:30,716 --> 01:08:32,184
[Dex] Rear-wheel versus front-wheel.

1538
01:08:32,251 --> 01:08:34,586
[Jongkook] It's going to be a nail-biter,
opposite strategies and all.

1539
01:08:35,621 --> 01:08:37,322
[Donghoe] Honestly, I think we'll win.

1540
01:08:37,389 --> 01:08:38,891
I was confident.

1541
01:08:38,957 --> 01:08:40,626
-Let's go, guys!
-Let's go!

1542
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,863
[Junseo] Since it's a team round,
we'll work together and give it our all.

Yes, that's it!

1560
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:37,482
Straights are effective.

1561
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:39,585
Go with straight shots, guys!

Stay strong!

1567
01:09:53,298 --> 01:09:55,534
TEAM RED

1568
01:09:55,601 --> 01:09:56,602
[Taekmin] This is tough.

1569
01:09:57,102 --> 01:09:58,270
Why's it not dropping?

1570
01:09:59,438 --> 01:10:00,806
Hey, what's up with this!

1571
01:10:01,373 --> 01:10:02,841
-See? It won't drop.
-[exclaims]

1572
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:04,243
It won't drop easily.

1573
01:10:04,309 --> 01:10:05,978
[exclaiming]

1574
01:10:07,112 --> 01:10:09,748
-[Taekmin chuckles] What? It won't budge!
-Why won't it drop?

1575
01:10:09,815 --> 01:10:11,917
[Youngho]
Taekmin was right in front of me.

1576
01:10:11,984 --> 01:10:13,885
He was clearly hitting it hard,

1577
01:10:13,952 --> 01:10:15,554
but it still wouldn't move.

1578
01:10:15,621 --> 01:10:18,323
I thought,
"If even a pro like him can't drop it,

1579
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:20,592
what chance do I have?"

1580
01:10:20,659 --> 01:10:23,362
So I figured I'd better pick up
the knack of it fast.

1581
01:10:24,763 --> 01:10:25,764
[exclaims]

1582
01:10:25,831 --> 01:10:26,832
God, what is this?

1583
01:10:26,898 --> 01:10:29,101
-Try another one!
-[Taekmin] Darn it!

1584
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:34,339
The thing is,
we usually throw with a snap.

1585
01:10:34,406 --> 01:10:36,041
That's how we pack power into the punch.

1586
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:38,243
And when we first learn boxing,

1587
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:41,513
we're told not to make
the punching bag move.

1588
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,782
But here, the goal was to make it move,

1589
01:10:43,849 --> 01:10:45,017
and it wouldn't drop.

1590
01:10:45,083 --> 01:10:48,020
It got me thinking,
"My team might lose because of me."

1591
01:10:48,086 --> 01:10:49,254
It just wouldn't drop.

1592
01:10:49,321 --> 01:10:51,456
One minute and thirty seconds left!
Keep going!

1593
01:10:51,523 --> 01:10:54,059
Kim Donghoe's struggling over there.

1594
01:10:54,126 --> 01:10:55,861
-He's exhausted.
-[Jongkook] Yeah, he is.

1595
01:10:58,430 --> 01:11:00,299
No, don't throw hooks!

1596
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,902
[Donghoe]
It just wouldn't budge, you know.

1597
01:11:03,969 --> 01:11:05,337
I had a long way to go.

1598
01:11:05,404 --> 01:11:07,139
Donghoe, just move on!

1599
01:11:07,205 --> 01:11:09,741
-Just push it to the edge!
-[exhales]

1600
01:11:09,808 --> 01:11:11,176
Donghoe, move on!

1601
01:11:12,344 --> 01:11:15,280
-They've switched to a push-only strategy.
-Oh, right.

1602
01:11:15,347 --> 01:11:16,348
Yeah, it's working!

1603
01:11:16,415 --> 01:11:18,216
-Great thinking!
-[Dex] Nice! That's better!

1604
01:11:19,117 --> 01:11:20,118

[O3ohn] After about a minute,

1610
01:11:30,796 --> 01:11:32,397
I was completely spent.

1611
01:11:33,699 --> 01:11:36,268
-It won't budge.
-I tried hitting it in different ways,

1612
01:11:36,335 --> 01:11:37,869
but nothing worked.

1613
01:11:39,971 --> 01:11:42,074
[sighs] Damn, this is driving me nuts.

1614
01:11:42,774 --> 01:11:44,276
He's completely spent.

I don't think there was much of a gap.

01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:26,538
They could end it here!

1693
01:14:26,605 --> 01:14:27,939
[Jongkook] These teams are killing it!

1694
01:14:28,006 --> 01:14:29,808
They're both so good!

1695
01:14:29,875 --> 01:14:32,043
You're almost even!

1696
01:14:34,179 --> 01:14:36,915
You have to push! That's right!

1697
01:14:38,216 --> 01:14:41,319
[Youngho] I just kept thinking,
"If we don't pull this off, we're done."

1698
01:14:41,953 --> 01:14:44,990
Seriously,
I poured everything I had into it.

1699
01:14:46,925 --> 01:14:48,260
-Nice.
-They're doing great.

1700
01:14:48,326 --> 01:14:49,461
This guy's good.

1701
01:14:50,462 --> 01:14:51,796
[Lee] Nice, he's good.

1702
01:14:51,863 --> 01:14:54,533
You've got to push it in first,
and then strike.

1703
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:57,102
Push it! Now, finish it off!

1704
01:14:57,168 --> 01:14:58,270
-That's it!
-Yes!

1705
01:14:58,336 --> 01:15:00,839

-Nice one! Keep it up!

1706
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:04,009
Keep going! You're almost there!

1707
01:15:04,075 --> 01:15:05,510
It's neck and neck!

1708
01:15:06,144 --> 01:15:07,445
Almost there!

1709
01:15:07,512 --> 01:15:09,581
[Hyunman]
I was locked in on the punching bag,

1710
01:15:09,648 --> 01:15:11,316
thinking, "Either you go down or I will,"

1711
01:15:11,383 --> 01:15:12,918
and I didn't have time to look over.

1712
01:15:12,984 --> 01:15:15,320
I felt sure that if I gave it my all,

1713
01:15:15,387 --> 01:15:17,222
we could definitely win this.

1714
01:15:17,289 --> 01:15:18,790
[Kang] I was thinking, "Don't give up.

1715
01:15:18,857 --> 01:15:21,192
Be a machine
and smash them all till the end."

No, it's down to the wire.

1721
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:36,841
Keep going till the end!

1722
01:15:37,475 --> 01:15:38,476
That's it!

1723
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:40,345
Push it!

1724
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:42,747
Push it, then strike!

1725
01:15:42,814 --> 01:15:43,982
That's it!

1726
01:15:44,049 --> 01:15:46,651
Wait, they're almost done here too!

1727
01:15:47,352 --> 01:15:48,820
Just a few more!

Yes, that's it!

1731
01:15:56,361 --> 01:15:57,996
Push it first, then finish it off!

1732
01:15:58,063 --> 01:16:00,131
-There you go!
-In the back!

1733
01:16:00,198 --> 01:16:02,133

-You got this! Come on!
-One last time!

1742

Last one! Thirty seconds!

1743
01:16:17,515 --> 01:16:19,618
All right, awesome!

1744
01:16:20,552 --> 01:16:21,820
Strike! That's it!

1745
01:16:21,886 --> 01:16:23,254
Push, push!

1746
01:16:23,955 --> 01:16:25,123
Push it!

1747
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:26,725

1750
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:33,164
No, you've got to push it!

[Donghoe] The players who came in later
did such an amazing job.

1775
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:26,751
I thought, "I picked the right teammates."

1776
01:17:26,818 --> 01:17:28,319
-That's it!
-[Youngho] Sure, I was exhausted.

"Guess this is
what makes team matches special."

01:17:35,894 --> 01:17:36,961
That's what I thought.

1781

-Ugh, we lost.
-Yeah.

1785
01:17:46,638 --> 01:17:48,273
That's too bad. We were so close.

1786
01:17:49,374 --> 01:17:52,444
[Kang] We really gave it our all,

1787
01:17:52,977 --> 01:17:54,412
so seeing that result…

1788
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:56,214
It's a shame.

1789
01:17:56,848 --> 01:17:58,149
We did great.

I just can't believe we lost.

1792
01:18:01,986 --> 01:18:02,987
It almost…

1793
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:06,624
It feels like I'm dreaming.

1794
01:18:06,691 --> 01:18:08,493
We fought so well,

1795
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:10,395

You will be given one more chance.

[Hyunman] The time has come.

1813
01:18:43,895 --> 01:18:45,163
[Junseo] I'll push full throttle.

1814
01:18:45,697 --> 01:18:46,965
