-How many?

10
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,459
[Minuk] Are we taking all of these out?

11
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:51,260
[contestant]
Is it about who can go the longest?

12
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:53,296

18
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:08,511
-[Youmin] A punching race? Great.
-[Daeyoung] Ah.

19
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,213
[Lee] All right.

20
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:14,350
Team Lee Daeyoung. To be honest,

21
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:17,386
you're coming into this round
as the underdogs.

22
00:01:18,254 --> 00:01:19,655
How are you feeling right now?

23
00:01:20,156 --> 00:01:21,157
Uh…

24
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:24,293
[Jongkook] Please select your opponent.

25
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:26,429
We'd like to choose…

26
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,532
Team Lee Daeyoung.

27
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,766
-[contestant 1] Oh!
-[contestant 2] Yes!

28
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:34,904
[Jaewon] Team Lee Daeyoung looks
like the weakest team.

29
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:37,206
If it's about stamina,

30
00:01:37,707 --> 00:01:39,642
we've got the advantage.

31
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,244
Strength-wise, too.

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,614
Honestly,
I don't see a world where we lose.

33
00:01:45,248 --> 00:01:48,751
We'll show you what youthful grit
and teamwork look like.

34
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,820
This is the rise of the underdogs.

35
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:52,455
[cheering]

36
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:53,523
[Jongkook] Great.

37
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:57,693
We communicate well as a team,

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,128
so I think we've got this.

39
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,897
[Minuk] I was confident.

40
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:03,432
The other team is going to lose for sure.

41
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,435
I don't get why they think
we're pushovers.

42
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,372
[Sungwoon] Kim Minuk's team is basically
like the Avengers.

43
00:02:09,438 --> 00:02:13,876
But the Avengers breaking under us,
that's what everyone wants to see.

44
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:15,545
I thought, "Okay, bring it on.

45
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:17,313
We'll hit back just as hard."

46
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,849
We'll show you how the weakest take over.

47
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:22,752
-We've got a real shot at this.
-Yeah, I agree.

48
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:24,921
This round isn't just about skill.

49
00:02:24,987 --> 00:02:26,455
-It's comes down to grit.
-[Dowoon] Right.

50
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:27,690
Let's give this a shot.

51
00:02:27,757 --> 00:02:29,025
Wonder what their strategy is.

52
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:31,994
Once you start hitting,
the strategy just writes itself.

53
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:35,565
-Punch like it's your last three minutes.
-[Dowoon] Let's give it all we've got.

54
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:37,366

Prepare to see the underdogs rise.

55
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,969

Don't stop, man! Keep going, keep going.

68

[Lee] He needs to hit it loose. All right.

[Dowoon] Nice, that's it!

74
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:20,643
[Seungjun] I figured a big hook
would knock it down.

75

Keep going! Yes, that's it!

76
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:32,388

Team Blue really thought this through.

82
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:44,000
Just look at that guy.

83
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,970
-[Jongkook] Oh, he's going full combos.
-[Dowoon] All right!

84
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:49,672
That's it!

85
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,310
Going full force on a hundred of those
is only going to strain our shoulders.

86
00:03:54,377 --> 00:03:55,645
So let's rapid-fire it.

87
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:58,648

-[Sungwoon] That's it!
-They're only doing straight shots.

95

Team Blue is breezing through this.

96
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:17,333

-Doing great!

98
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:22,071
[Sungwoon] I went, "Huh?"

99
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:24,440
When I looked over, I saw Hong Junyoung

100
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,943
spending almost a full minute
working on one punching bag.

101
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,581
-Dang, it slid back.
-What the heck?

102
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:33,649
It won't drop.

103
00:04:33,716 --> 00:04:36,352
[Junyoung] It was right on the edge,
but it just wouldn't drop.

104
00:04:36,852 --> 00:04:38,054
[Jaewon] Just try another one.

105
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,588
Yes, switch to another one.

106
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:42,258
[Sungwoon]
I thought, "We might actually win this.

107
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,193

they were on our heels.

[Junyoung] After the first half,
I looked over to the other side

157

and saw they'd already dropped a ton.

158
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,954

-[Youmin] That's insane.
-[Sungwoon] You're a genius.

173
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,258
-There's hope!
-Let's move up!

174
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,694
-But don't get careless.
-Stay focused.

175
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,796
-Let's show them.
-We got this.

176
00:07:33,863 --> 00:07:34,964
-Let's go!
-It's okay, guys.

177
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,199
-If you're tired, just tag out.
-Okay.

178
00:07:37,266 --> 00:07:38,534
TEAM RED: 27, TEAM BLUE: 16

179
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:39,869
[Dex] There's a bit of a gap.

180
00:07:40,603 --> 00:07:41,604
[Jongkook] It's huge.

181
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,440
Think they can catch up
when they're 11 bags behind?

182
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:46,442
-[Jaewon] Just throw a lot of jabs.
-Okay.

183
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,878
No hooks. Just one-two combos.

184
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:50,613
Let's win this, guys!

185
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,448
-[Daeyoung] Who's going first?
-[Dongeon] I'll go.

186
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:53,949
Huddle up.

187
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,251
All right, guys.

188
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:57,152
-Three, two, one! Let's go!
-[team] Let's go!

189
00:07:57,219 --> 00:07:59,188
-Let's do this!
-Hey, gather around.

190
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:01,123
-Three, two, one. Let's go!
-[team] Let's go!

191
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,859
Louder, guys! I can't hear you!

192
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:07,363
[Dongeon] I thought, "Stay focused until
the end, and we might actually win this."

193
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:11,567
[Jaewon] Even if it takes
everything I've got,

194
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:14,003
I'll drop as many as I can.

195
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:16,472
[whistle blows]

196
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,040
-Go!
-[Daeyoung] Let's go, let's go!

197
00:08:18,107 --> 00:08:19,108
That's it, man!

198
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:20,309
TEAM RED

199
00:08:20,376 --> 00:08:21,977
-Okay.
-[Dowoon] Good, good.

200
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:23,579
That's it.

201
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:25,314
Come on!

202
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:28,851
TEAM BLUE

203
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:30,853
-[Daeyoung] You got it!
-[Youmin] That guy's insane!

204
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,087
[Daeyoung] That's it!

205
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:33,556
[Dex] Look at Kim Dongeon go.

206
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:35,024
[Daeyoung] That's it!

207
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,026
He's a total bulldozer. [chuckles]

208
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:39,795
He's already knocked down several
right from the start.

209
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:41,931
-[Daeyoung] Keep going!
-[Sungwoon] Twelve left!

210
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:44,733
-Yes, we're winning!
-Twelve left! Eleven left!

211
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,368
[Daeyoung]
When I saw that, I was convinced.

212
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:48,003
We're moving up for sure.

213
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:51,373
[Youngwoong] Okay, hit higher.

214
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:53,809
Just move on to the next one!

215
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:58,347
If he can't do it, they need to swap fast.

216
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:02,284
You can come back now.

217
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:05,020
-Let's switch!
-[Youngwoong] Yes, hit higher!

218
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,121
It's better to switch. Go.

219
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:08,257
TEAM RED
KIM JAEWON TO KIM SOOCHAN

220
00:09:09,858 --> 00:09:10,859
[Jongkook] There we go.

221
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,661
[Jaewon] Hurry, time's almost up!

222
00:09:14,163 --> 00:09:16,198
[Jongkook] Okay, nice. He's pretty fast.

223
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,567
Great, he's powering through.

224
00:09:18,634 --> 00:09:19,768
This is more like it.

225
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:20,836
[Jaewon] Keep going!

226
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:28,110
[Dowoon] Almost there!

227
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:30,879
[Daeyoung] If you're stuck,
just come back! Just finish that off!

228
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,115
-[Dongeon] Come back. No, don't.
-It's okay.

229
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:34,383
-Go!
-All right!

230
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,218
[Dex] As expected, Lee Dowoon's up next.

231
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,354
He did really well earlier.

232
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,855
[Sungwoon] Nice, keep going!

233
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:41,357
[Daeyoung] You're smashing it!

234
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:43,792
That's it! You got it!

235
00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:44,960
You're in the zone!

236
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:46,662
[Sungwoon] You're doing awesome!

237
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:48,631
-[Kyungmin] Keep it up until the end!
-That's it!

238
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:49,765
All right!

239
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:53,268
TEAM RED
KIM SOOCHAN TO HONG JUNYOUNG

240
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:57,506
[Jaewon] Come on, keep pouring it out!

241
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,241
Push harder!

242
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:01,610
Let's go all the way!

243
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:02,978
[contestants clamoring]

244
00:10:03,045 --> 00:10:04,279
[Seungjun] Last one! Hurry!

245
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:05,914
-Last one!
-Last one!

246
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:06,982
You're the star!

247
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,217
This is your moment!

248
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:11,153
-[Seungjun] Yes, keep going!
-[Daeyoung] Finish that off and come back!

249
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,354
[contestants cheer]

250
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:13,989
MATCH OVER

251
00:10:14,056 --> 00:10:15,157
[cheering]

252
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:16,725
[narrator] <i>The match is over.</i>

253
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,794
[cheering continues]

254
00:10:22,398 --> 00:10:24,266
-[Seungjun] All right!
-[Youmin] You're the star, man!

255
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,268
-[Sungwoon] Yes!
-[Youmin] You did so good, man!

256
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:31,173
Man, this really is an underdog uprising.

257
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,909
Kim Minuk must be really disappointed,

258
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:35,477
but it's not like he can let it show.

259
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:38,580
-In a team match, that's just how it goes.
-He's the team captain, too.

260
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:40,282
You were incredible!

261
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,751
-Seriously!
-[Daeyoung] Oh, it feels amazing.

262
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:46,488
They underestimated us
and picked us, right?

263
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:50,659
I knew I wasn't as strong
as the other team captains,

264
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:53,462
but my teammates still
put their faith in me.

265
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:56,632
I'm so proud of my team.

266
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,101
TEAM KIM MINUK VS TEAM LEE DAEYOUNG

267
00:10:59,168 --> 00:11:00,836
TEAM ELIMINATED

268
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,439
-[Lee] Finally, the last match.
-[Dex] Wow.

269
00:11:03,505 --> 00:11:06,175
Bet you're losing steam by now, right?

270
00:11:06,241 --> 00:11:07,543
I'm tired.

271
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:09,945
This is a candy called Kopiko.

272
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,180
It's sugar-free.

273
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:12,848
Yes, I love sugar-free stuff.

274
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:16,185
Let's have a quick pick-me-up
before the last match.

275
00:11:21,924 --> 00:11:24,159
-This takes me back.
-[Lee] It does.

276
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,327
It's tasty.

277
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:29,164
-[Jongkook] Here we go.
-[contestants clamor]

278
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,766
Let's do this!

279
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:31,934
[Minsung] I'm feeling great!

280
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:34,837
-Wait, what's this?
-Wow!

281
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:36,739
-What's this?
-Wow.

282
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:38,240
-How many are there?
-Why so many?

283
00:11:38,307 --> 00:11:39,341
-What is this?
-What?

284
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:40,876
[Donghyun] I have no clue
what we're about to do.

285
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:41,944
[contestant] What is this?

286
00:11:44,346 --> 00:11:45,414
Oh, this team…

287
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:51,420
Team Red's made up entirely
of amateur fighters or former fighters.

288
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:53,088
-Yeah.
-You're right.

289
00:11:53,155 --> 00:11:55,190
We've got to listen
to the rules carefully.

290
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:58,127
-Let me do my part as team captain.
-[chuckles]

291
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:01,196
[Hyunjae] I was completely confident.

292
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:05,067
All six of us are elite boxers.

293
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:08,370
Top-notch skills.

294
00:12:09,872 --> 00:12:11,039
Great stamina.

295
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:12,875
We're a team of real boxers.

296
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,209
We're the real deal.

297
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,611
I thought everyone looked strong.

298
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:18,013
I had zero worries.

299
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,316
[Dex] Now,
let's begin the team selections.

300
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:23,085
I think we're the strongest team.

301
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:24,153
I think so too.

302
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:26,088
I don't see us losing.

303
00:12:26,155 --> 00:12:28,957
We got this. We've got stamina,
and we're awesome boxers.

304
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:30,025
[Jungon] Let's crush it.

305
00:12:30,893 --> 00:12:32,261
[Donghyun] Who knows what we'll do?

306
00:12:32,327 --> 00:12:33,796
Who knows?

307
00:12:33,862 --> 00:12:36,598
-Are you a former fighter?
-No, I'm just your average civilian.

308
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,567
-You're a volleyball player?
-Yes.

309
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,435
[Donghyun] Welcome to the team.

310
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:43,272
I'm Kim Hunsu, a former volleyball player.

311
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:45,974
[Donghyun] I work at Yangju Fire Station
in the rescue unit.

312
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,376
I'm a bus driver.

313
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:49,311
I'll drive you straight to defeat.

314
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:50,813
The team we pick is…

315
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,581
Team Shin Donghyun.

316
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,583
We just picked them
because they looked weak.

317
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,285
[Dex laughs] You said it outright, huh?

318
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:57,753
Jeez…

319
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,023
[Donghyun] We'll beat them
and make them regret it.

320
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:03,559
In the spirit of <i>I Am Boxer</i>,

321
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,694
we'll show you how real elite boxers roll.

322
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:07,763
[Jongkook] Ah. Sounds good.

323
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,232
They might underestimate us,

324
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,568
but we'll show them how hard we can fight.

325
00:13:14,036 --> 00:13:16,538
But if you look purely at the lineup,

326
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:18,440
Team Blue really seems at a disadvantage.

327
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:19,508
Exactly.

328
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,577
[Dex] There are just
too many elite fighters

329
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:22,911
-on the other team.
-Right.

330
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:25,047
How'd the teams end up so lopsided?

331
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:26,615
[contestants] Get ready! Let's do this!

-All right!

00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:41,463
[Hyunjae]
We're going to win, no matter what.

337
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,531
-We got this!
-Yes!

SHIN DONGHYUN,
KIM DONGHYUN, HUNSU

339
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:45,701
[Donghyun]
We'll completely humiliate them.

They're going pretty far back.

[Jongkook]
Oh, they're starting from the back.

355
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,376

[Haengseok] We gotta push harder!

It won't budge.

00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:21,463
[Haengseok] Damn it.

378
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,265
[Chaehyun] Is it stuck at the end?

379
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:24,967
[Jungon] Move on to the next one!

380
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:26,101
Just move on!

381
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,477
[Hyunjae]
I managed to push it to the edge,

382
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:36,979
but it kept getting stuck there.

383
00:15:38,914 --> 00:15:41,750
I was so frustrated
that I felt like I was losing my rhythm.

384
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,121
Guys, they're falling behind!

385
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:47,589

394
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:14,750
He's going too slow.

395
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,452
[Chaehyun] Hyunjae has dropped one so far?

396
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,657
[Jongkook] Man, look at Cho Hyunjae.

397
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:24,026
[Lee] Ah.

398
00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:26,428
He's not delivering at all.

399
00:16:26,495 --> 00:16:28,230
-This is bad.
-Oh.

Damn it!

407
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:51,119
[Hyunjae] I just regret not doing better.

408
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:55,524
I felt like I was dragging the team down.

409
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,259
When I looked over to the other side,

410
00:16:57,859 --> 00:16:59,461
it seemed like they'd dropped a ton.

411
00:16:59,528 --> 00:17:00,896
It made me really anxious.

[Jongkook] That's not how you do it.

416
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:17,312
Those pity-pat punches won't work.

417
00:17:19,014 --> 00:17:21,149
[Haengseok] It's not dropping! [grunting]

418
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:22,384
Oh, man…

419
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:26,221
[Haengseok] Elite boxers like us usually
throw sharp, clean punches

420
00:17:26,288 --> 00:17:29,091
that snap off at the end,
so the punching bags don't swing much.

421
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:32,694
[Hyunjae]
I hit them like I usually do in training,

422
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:36,565
so it was just tiring me out for nothing.

423
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,634
Wait, why is he training here?

424
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:42,237
This side's playing the game,
but they're just boxing.

425

[Donghyun]
Power mattered more in this round.

426
00:17:45,907 --> 00:17:48,043
Our team was stronger physically,

427
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,979
so I thought we had the edge.

00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:02,457
I really can't tell
if we dropped more or less.

431
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:04,759
We dropped way more… Or is it less?

432
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:07,195
No, we're good.
We definitely dropped more in the back.

433
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:08,363

00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,964
[Ohgon] I hate losing, you know.

446
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:44,432
I really didn't want to lose.

-I'll go first.
-[Hyunjae] You wanna go first?

448
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:48,870
I'll start from here.

449
00:18:48,937 --> 00:18:51,506
When I come back in,
the second person can start there.

450
00:18:52,107 --> 00:18:53,241
I just can't figure it out.

451
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:54,676
Let's just rotate the four of us.

[Minsung] The four of us?

453
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,547
[Dex] Kwon Ohgon needs to step up here.

454
00:18:58,613 --> 00:19:00,048
He must be feeling the pressure.

-Right.

but since I'm the heaviest on our team,

510
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:10,378
all I could think was,
"Rather than waste time switching,

511

00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,222
-[Lee] It's a 20-point gap right now.
-Well, if it's 20…

514
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:23,358
We're ahead by 20!

515
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:26,061
-We're up by 20.
-All right!

516
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:27,495
[grunting]

517
00:21:27,562 --> 00:21:29,864
-Awesome!
-Let's finish them off!

518
00:21:32,033 --> 00:21:33,635
[Hunsu]
Let's have our captain finish it off!

519
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:35,503
-Last one!
-Let's go, captain!

520
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,505
-Darn it.
-We messed up big time.

521
00:21:38,473 --> 00:21:39,774
[Haengseok] Ohgon, you're doing great!

522
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:42,510
Keep pushing until the end!

523
00:21:47,382 --> 00:21:48,483
[grunting]

524
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,352
[Donghyun] Let's go!

525
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:51,619
-All right!
-That's it!

526
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:53,455
-[whistle blows]
-[contestants cheering]

527
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,291
TEAM SHIN DONGHYUN WINS

528
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:57,792
We did awesome!

529
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,527
[announcer] <i>The match is over.</i>

530
00:22:00,662 --> 00:22:02,630
-[Ohgon] I should've done better.
-No, good job.

531
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:04,632
Couldn't dial in.

532
00:22:09,904 --> 00:22:11,573
[Donghyun] Wow, this is insane.

533
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:12,707
We actually won.

534
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:16,010
It felt like we'd won the whole world.

535
00:22:16,077 --> 00:22:18,446
I feel like a weight's been lifted.

536
00:22:18,513 --> 00:22:20,281
-[Lee] Goodness.
-Oh, man.

537
00:22:20,348 --> 00:22:22,217
The lineup here, though.

538
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:23,284
They're great fighters,

539
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:25,553
-but what can you do?
-They're all so…

540
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,322
It can't be helped, I'm afraid.

541
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:31,059
What can I say? It's all on me.

542
00:22:31,126 --> 00:22:34,329
Honestly, I feel like I let my team down.

543
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:38,800
I don't think I did my job very well
as team captain.

544
00:22:53,481 --> 00:22:55,750
If we'd lost, we'd be in there with them.

545
00:22:55,817 --> 00:22:56,885
[sighs]

546
00:22:56,951 --> 00:22:58,386
Seriously, man.

547
00:22:59,154 --> 00:23:00,722
This stings. [chuckles]

548
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,323
Losing sucks, huh?

549
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:05,760
[Lee] Round 2 of <i>I Am Boxer</i> is over.

550
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,863
Well done, fighters.

551
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:15,036
As a result of Round 2,
the four winning teams,

552
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,205
a total of 24 fighters,

553
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:21,443
have survived and will advance
to the next round. Congratulations.

554
00:23:25,346 --> 00:23:27,615
As for the four losing teams,

555
00:23:27,682 --> 00:23:29,083
a total of 24 fighters,

556
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:31,152
have been eliminated

557
00:23:31,686 --> 00:23:33,888
from <i>I Am Boxer</i>.

558
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:34,989
[Donghee sighs]

559
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:36,291
Guess we're done here.

560
00:23:36,758 --> 00:23:38,660
I really felt the regret.

561
00:23:38,726 --> 00:23:40,929
Honestly, I just felt empty.

562
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:42,597
[Junyoung] Guess I'm going home.

563
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,366
[Lee] You all fought hard.

564
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:47,435
But…

565
00:23:47,502 --> 00:23:48,503
But…

566
00:23:51,272 --> 00:23:53,107
You will be given one more chance.

567
00:23:56,377 --> 00:23:57,912
[Youngho] Are we having a fight?

568
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:01,182
[Hyunman]
I might get another shot at this.

569
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:04,819
This chance will not be given to everyone.

570
00:24:04,886 --> 00:24:06,688
Out of the 24 who were eliminated,

571
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:08,990
those who get to fight the deathmatch…

572
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,993
are only 12.

573
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,862
[♪ dramatic music playing]

574
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:16,197
[Junyoung] Exactly half.

575
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:19,467
[Youngwoong]
So not everyone's getting this chance.

576
00:24:19,534 --> 00:24:21,603
[Taesun] This is too cruel.

577
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,444
[Jongkook]
Man, how are we gonna do this? Don.

578
00:24:29,944 --> 00:24:31,813
The one I feel worst about letting go…

579
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,815
That would be Kim Minuk.

580
00:24:33,882 --> 00:24:35,550
[Lee] He is such a skilled fighter.

581
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:38,253
His style is so explosive.
I really liked that.

582
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,555
All those elite boxers teamed up

583
00:24:40,622 --> 00:24:42,857
-and got knocked out together.
-All in one go.

584
00:24:42,924 --> 00:24:43,958
That's true.

585
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,727
We can't lose all of them now.

586
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:48,096
I wish I could save all of them, but…

587
00:24:48,162 --> 00:24:49,531
You should decide then.

588
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:51,633
-No, don't say that. I'm just as lost.
-[laughs]

589
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,034
-Hey.
-I can't do this.

590
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:55,103
Seriously, this is giving me a headache.

591
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:57,372
-Man, this is tough.
-[chuckles]

592
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:01,342
All right then, let me explain

593
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:03,978
how the deathmatch
on<i> I Am Boxer</i> will work.

594
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,849
This deathmatch will be fought one-on-one.

595
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:14,656
Each bout will be 2 rounds of 3 minutes.

596
00:25:15,456 --> 00:25:16,591
[contestant 1]
Two rounds of three minutes.

597
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,694
[contestant 2] Basically, six minutes
straight without a break.

598
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:22,397
[contestant 3]
Those two rounds will decide your fate.

599
00:25:22,463 --> 00:25:25,333
[Youngwoong]
Stamina is going to be a huge factor.

600
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,402
There is never an easy day.

601
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:30,805
If there is no winner
within the two rounds,

602
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:36,978
the decision will go to the three judges,
including Master Don Lee.

603
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,247
[Jungon] Please let me go one more time.

604
00:25:39,314 --> 00:25:41,115
[Chaehyun]
I've still got the stamina for the ring.

605
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:42,684
I hope I get picked.

606
00:25:43,117 --> 00:25:45,019
[Seongjun] We were thrown a lifeline.

607
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:46,521
I just wanted to grab it.

608
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,623
[Yejun] I really wanted it.

609
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,458
I thought,
"Let's climb back up from here."

610
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:54,696
[Dex]
I've never seen a fight this up close.

611
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:56,264
[Sanggeun] So who are the 12 going to be?

612
00:25:56,331 --> 00:25:58,333
[Youngho]
They'll probably start calling names here.

613
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:00,268
Then even if you're not on the list,

614
00:26:00,335 --> 00:26:01,903
you just have to wait till the end

615
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,638
-without knowing.
-Sweating bullets.

616
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:06,274
[sighs]
At least we lose half the competition.

617
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:07,809
[both chuckle]

618
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:13,181
[Jongkook] Let me announce the first
matchup of <i>I Am Boxer's</i> deathmatch

619
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:14,782
right now.

620
00:26:16,651 --> 00:26:19,721
The pressure is on a whole different level
compared to the first day.

621
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,856
-This is how society works.
-[contestant chuckles]

622
00:26:21,923 --> 00:26:23,191
Welcome to reality.

623
00:26:23,257 --> 00:26:26,661
The first fighter
to enter the deathmatch is…

624
00:26:26,728 --> 00:26:27,962
[Minsung] Please, let it be me.

625
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:29,364
The suspense is killing me.

626
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:31,299
Who will it be?

627
00:26:33,267 --> 00:26:34,869
[Lee] Pyeon Yejun.

628
00:26:34,936 --> 00:26:36,738
[all exclaiming]

629
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,539
[Sungwoon]
Gotta give it to him, he's good.

630
00:26:39,007 --> 00:26:41,876
Didn't Pyeon Yejun
get pretty famous recently?

631
00:26:41,943 --> 00:26:45,580
[announcer] His KO win has hit
11 million views. This is "Pyeonstar"!

632
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,915
Pyeon Yejun!

633
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:49,951
[commentator] Here comes Pyeon Yejun!

634
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:51,285
There's another kick.

635
00:26:51,352 --> 00:26:52,453
Now it's the punches.

636
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:56,357
The MMA guys these days
are really good at boxing.

637
00:26:56,424 --> 00:26:58,860
The MMA guys' skills have shot up lately.

638
00:26:58,926 --> 00:27:00,061
[Jungon] Let's go, Pyeon Yejun!

639
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:01,162
You got this!

640
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:03,364
[Yejun]
Wow, I couldn't believe I was called.

641
00:27:03,431 --> 00:27:05,900
I was like,
"I have to win this and move up."

642
00:27:06,768 --> 00:27:08,469
Who is he going up against?

643
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:10,238
The guy who sat right behind him?

644
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:12,940
[Jungon] I was confident I could take him,

645
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:15,109
so I was hoping to get called.

646
00:27:15,643 --> 00:27:19,480
[Minsung] I'm curious how he'd do
against one of Cho Hyunjae's amateur guys.

647
00:27:19,547 --> 00:27:20,748
Wonder how that'd go.

648
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,185
The fighter facing Pyeon Yejun is…

649
00:27:24,752 --> 00:27:27,321
All those elite boxers teamed up

650
00:27:27,388 --> 00:27:28,890
and got knocked out together.

651
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:31,125
-That's true.
-It's such a waste.

652
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:33,061
-Like Cho Hyunjae here.
-You're right.

653
00:27:33,528 --> 00:27:34,562
Same goes for him.

654
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:35,930
-Lee Chaehyun.
-Right.

655
00:27:35,997 --> 00:27:38,900
They're both great fighters.

656
00:27:38,966 --> 00:27:43,304
[Dex] They're some of the fighters
I really wanted to see box.

657
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:46,441
[Lee] The fighter facing Pyeon Yejun is…

658
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:50,712
Cho Hyunjae.

659
00:27:50,778 --> 00:27:53,281
-This is gonna be fun.
-[contestants applauding]

660
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:57,885
[Hyunjae] I was happy,

661
00:27:57,952 --> 00:28:00,822
but with all my teammates
sitting in the elimination zone,

662
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,590
I couldn't be all that happy.

663
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:05,259
-Remember, it's two rounds.
-Let's go, cap!

664
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:06,360
-Stay calm.
-You got this.

665
00:28:06,427 --> 00:28:07,428
Stay focused.

666
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:08,996
Give it everything you got, man.

667
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:11,866
-[contestant 1] This should be fun.
-[contestant 2] Who's gonna win?

668
00:28:13,034 --> 00:28:14,736
I'm ready to go do-or-die out here.

669
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,506
I'm afraid I'll have to crush him
and move up.

670
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:19,841
[contestants exclaim]

671
00:28:23,478 --> 00:28:26,714
Wait, Pyeon Yejun's only 18.

672
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:28,583
Geez, he's 18?

673
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:33,020
When I was 18,
I had my very first 4-round fight.

674
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,756
-[Jongkook] For real?
-Really?

675
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:37,425
-[Lee] Pyeon Yejun's got strong momentum.
-Right.

676
00:28:37,492 --> 00:28:38,926
[Lee] He's small, but strong.

677
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:41,229
[Jongkook]
But last time I watched Cho Hyunjae,

678
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:43,030
I noticed he fights like an out-boxer.

679
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:45,266
-Yes, that's right.
-[Jongkook] Really stylish.

680
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,401
[Lee] He's super fast.

681
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:50,071
Their styles are totally different,

682
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:52,006
so it'll be fun to watch.

683
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:53,141
[Lee] Let's begin.

684
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:56,043
[contestants] Let's go!

685
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,479
KAFAC BOXER CHO HYUNJAE
VS 18-YEAR-OLD MMA FIGHTER PYEON YEJUN

686
00:28:58,546 --> 00:28:59,747
[contestant] Let's go, Pyeon Yejun!

687
00:28:59,814 --> 00:29:00,815
Box!

688
00:29:00,882 --> 00:29:02,683
-[referee] Box!
-[bell rings]

689
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,252
-[contestant] Close the distance. Step in!
-Go!

690
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:05,887
-That's it!
-Get in there!

691
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,221
HYUNJAE X YEJUN

692
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:09,724
[contestants exclaiming]

693
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,594
-There you go!
-All right!

694
00:29:13,661 --> 00:29:14,896
-You're doing great!
-Nice!

695
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,964
[Dex] Pyeon Yejun's coming on strong.

696
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:18,032
[contestant 2] All right!

697
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:21,469
-Nice one!
-He caught him.

698
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,938
[Sungmin] It's all about timing!
Keep your rhythm!

699
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:27,341
[Seongjun] Throw the lead first! Great!

700
00:29:28,176 --> 00:29:29,644
[contestants exclaiming]

701
00:29:30,178 --> 00:29:31,345
Nice!

702
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,115
[Yejun] I got a little momentum early on,

703
00:29:34,682 --> 00:29:36,951
so all I was thinking
about was getting a KO.

704
00:29:37,885 --> 00:29:39,620
Yejun, you're doing great!

705
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:41,255
[Sungmin] Just fire away!

706
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,323
The head. That's it.

707
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,192
[Jongkook] No… Oh, nice! Nice dodge.

708
00:29:44,258 --> 00:29:46,661
Wow, he's reading him well.

709
00:29:47,428 --> 00:29:48,930
[Minwoo] Go for the body first!

710
00:29:50,298 --> 00:29:52,033
-All right!
-[Lee] Keep those feet moving.

711
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:54,635
-Stack up those points!
-Nice uppercut!

712
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,471
[contestants] All right! Nice shot!

713
00:29:57,538 --> 00:29:59,740
-Looks like he'll win this.
-That Pyeon Yejun kid.

714
00:29:59,807 --> 00:30:01,742
He's something else, isn't he?

715
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,446
[Hyunjae] His punches early on
had this unusual trajectory.

716
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:08,149
They came in slow,
out of my field of vision.

717
00:30:08,216 --> 00:30:10,484
It threw me off a bit.

718
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:12,486
Hyunjae, your distance!

719
00:30:12,553 --> 00:30:15,022
-Close the distance!
-Keep it short!

720
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:16,991
[Sungmin] Hyunjae, just loosen up!

721
00:30:17,058 --> 00:30:18,326
There! Good!

722
00:30:18,826 --> 00:30:19,827
Just let it go!

723
00:30:20,328 --> 00:30:21,629
[Hyunjae] I tried to find my rhythm,

724
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,899
and loosen up by circling around the ring.

725
00:30:29,403 --> 00:30:31,239
Yes, use the jab. That's it.

726
00:30:32,773 --> 00:30:34,876
[Minsung] All right, nice lead hand!

727
00:30:34,942 --> 00:30:36,844
Throw a feint, a feint!

728
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:37,912
That's it!

729
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,015
-[Jongkook] There you go.
-Nice footwork.

730
00:30:41,082 --> 00:30:42,350
-All right.
-He's got to step in.

731
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,451
[Sungmin] Nice speed!

732
00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:45,820
-All right!
-Nice shot!

733
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:48,623
Hyunjae, you're getting into your rhythm!

734
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:50,524
Hyunjae's footwork is waking up now.

735
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,928
[Sungmin] Punch then guard!
Punch then guard!

736
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:56,030
-All right, doing good!
-That's it!

737
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,499
-There you go!
-Nice one!

738
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,668
[contestants exclaiming]

739
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,238
-[bell rings]
-Okay, time!

740
00:31:04,305 --> 00:31:05,339
Yejun, you're a beast!

741
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:07,608
-You did awesome!
-[screams]

742
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:10,978
-[Hyunman] He looks a little tense.
-[Donghee] He does.

743
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:13,948
I think he's just not warmed up yet.
[chuckles]

744
00:31:14,015 --> 00:31:16,684
Early on, he got caught by a punch
he didn't see coming.

745
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:17,818
That looping hook.

746
00:31:17,885 --> 00:31:21,489
When you get hit by something like that,
it stuns you for a second.

747
00:31:22,189 --> 00:31:24,825
Most boxers go into their usual pattern
out of habit.

748
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:28,095
They open with that standard pattern.
"Bam, bam, bam."

749
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:30,097
He was probably expecting that, but then…

750
00:31:30,164 --> 00:31:32,233
That looping shot came out of nowhere.

751
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,734
It must've rattled him early on.

752
00:31:33,801 --> 00:31:35,169
[Dex] He certainly seemed stunned.

753
00:31:35,236 --> 00:31:37,605
-But still, he pulled himself together.
-Mmm.

754
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:40,408
Cho Hyunjae was a little shaken
in the beginning,

755
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:43,411
but as time went on,
he started finding his pace again.

756
00:31:43,477 --> 00:31:45,079
[Jongkook]
That wasn't completely one-sided.

757
00:31:45,146 --> 00:31:47,515
[Yejun]
My shots were landing one after another,

758
00:31:47,581 --> 00:31:50,451
so I thought it'd be an easier fight
than expected.

759
00:31:51,018 --> 00:31:52,687
You're the man!

760
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:54,555
[contestants cheering]

761
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:55,890
He's famous for that.

762
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:05,866
All right, nice!

763
00:32:05,933 --> 00:32:07,668
-Do whatever you want!
-[contestant] Great!

764
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,374
Hyunjae, the body's open on the left.

765
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:14,942
Last round! Stay focused!

766
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:16,143
Keep it together!

767
00:32:18,379 --> 00:32:20,314
-Yejun, breathe!
-Deep breaths!

768
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:22,016
Loosen up when you throw!

769
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:24,685
[Jaehyuk] Just do your thing!
Stick to your style!

770
00:32:25,953 --> 00:32:27,121
[contestant] Let's go, Hyunjae!

771
00:32:27,188 --> 00:32:29,390
-Last one, last round!
-[bell rings]

772
00:32:29,457 --> 00:32:31,826
-[contestant] Let's go!
-Let's go!

773
00:32:31,892 --> 00:32:33,627
HYUNJAE X YEJUN

774
00:32:34,462 --> 00:32:35,596
[Haengseok] That's it!

775
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:37,164
One more, one more!

776
00:32:37,231 --> 00:32:38,232
That's it!

777
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:40,301
[contestants exclaiming]

778
00:32:40,368 --> 00:32:41,469
[Ohgon] Uppercut incoming!

779
00:32:41,535 --> 00:32:44,839
-He's finally loosened up.
-[Minsung] There you go! All right!

780
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,941
One more! Bam!

781
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:48,109
Go again!

782
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:49,777
-All right!
-Drive it in!

783
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:51,045
All right!

784
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:52,113
Drive it in!

785
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,681
-Nice, doing good!
-That's it!

786
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:57,718
[Yejun] Cho Hyunjae's footwork
got pretty aggressive.

787
00:32:57,785 --> 00:32:59,053
He came in pretty hard.

788
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,422
If you want to slow down his feet,

789
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:02,923
you need to do some damage.

790
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,225
You gotta get rough with it!

791
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:05,292
Rough it up, man!

792
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:08,229
-You got this!
-Let's go!

793
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:09,797
All right!

794
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:12,700
-That's it!
-He's caught!

795
00:33:12,767 --> 00:33:14,168
Get in there!

796
00:33:14,635 --> 00:33:16,103
All right!

797
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,606
[Hyunjae]
I saw Pyeon Yejun's hair whip back,

798
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:21,175
and that's when I thought,

799
00:33:21,242 --> 00:33:22,743
"Round 2 is all mine now."

800
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,413
Hyunjae's too fast.

801
00:33:25,479 --> 00:33:27,214
-Yeah?
-[Lee] His counters. Yes.

802
00:33:28,616 --> 00:33:29,617
[Donghoe] Nice!

803
00:33:35,689 --> 00:33:37,358
He needs to step in.

804
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:41,228
That's it!

805
00:33:42,696 --> 00:33:44,031
[Lee] Good counter there!

806
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:45,166
That's it!

807
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,667
[Haengseok] Feint and fire!

808
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:47,835
[contestant] All right!

809
00:33:48,502 --> 00:33:50,438
He'll knock him out if he lands one!

810
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:52,573
Go for it! Crash into him hard!

811
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,041
[contestant] Keep going!

812
00:33:54,108 --> 00:33:55,276
[contestants exclaim]

813
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:57,778
[Jungon] Nice, nice! That's it!

814
00:33:58,412 --> 00:33:59,814
[Ohgon] Doing great, Hyunjae!

815
00:34:01,282 --> 00:34:02,283
[cheers]

816
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:04,018
[contestants cheering]

817
00:34:04,785 --> 00:34:08,089
HYUNJAE X YEJUN

818
00:34:08,155 --> 00:34:09,423
You've got to finish it!

819
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:11,292
You've got to finish it!

820
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:12,993
-That's it!
-[bell rings]

821
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,595
[referee] Stop! Stop, stop.

822
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,031
All right!

823
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:18,766
Man, they're good. [chuckles]

824
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,603
[Lee] Both fighters
put on a hell of a fight. Well played.

825
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,271
That was fun.

826
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:26,607
So this is why people watch pro fights.

827
00:34:26,674 --> 00:34:28,943
-It's seriously entertaining.
-You're a pro too, man.

828
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:30,044
[chuckling] I know, but still.

829
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:32,246
[Jongkook] Man, this is…

830
00:34:32,746 --> 00:34:33,814
This is tough.

831
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:35,449
Really tough.

832
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,653
[Dex] Pyeon Yejun was no joke.

833
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,289
-He's good. Got that confidence.
-He is.

834
00:34:42,356 --> 00:34:45,226
But if it's "power boxing"
like Don Lee said, it's Yejun.

835
00:34:45,693 --> 00:34:47,962
[Yejun] I pushed with momentum early on,

836
00:34:48,028 --> 00:34:50,931
so I think that gave me the edge.

837
00:34:51,432 --> 00:34:54,535
Still, red did a bit better.

838
00:34:54,602 --> 00:34:56,937
In terms of both balance and skill.

839
00:34:57,004 --> 00:35:00,274
[Hyunjae] I was pretty dazed in Round 1.

840
00:35:00,341 --> 00:35:03,210
But in Round 2, I fought with no regrets.

841
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:06,113
[Jongkook] Judge one scores it for

842
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,848
Cho Hyunjae from the red corner.

843
00:35:07,915 --> 00:35:10,084
RED CORNER CHO HYUNJAE WINS

844
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:12,853
[contestant] It's only the first judge.

845
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,089
Judge two scores it for…

846
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,292
Cho Hyunjae from the red corner!

847
00:35:18,792 --> 00:35:20,161
[Haengseok] All right!

848
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:22,563
-Awesome!
-Yes!

849
00:35:23,864 --> 00:35:25,666
The survivor of this deathmatch is

850
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:26,901
Cho Hyunjae.

851
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:28,636
-[Ohgon] Nice game!
-You fought well!

852
00:35:28,702 --> 00:35:30,070
RED CORNER CHO HYUNJAE SURVIVES

853
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:31,605
[Sungmin] Yejun, you fought well!

854
00:35:31,672 --> 00:35:33,274
Good job. Well done.

855
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,075
-Really well done.
-He fought well.

856
00:35:35,976 --> 00:35:40,614
I really wanted to move up so badly,
so I stayed focused and gave it all I had.

857
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,883
I'm glad it paid off. Thank you.

858
00:35:44,385 --> 00:35:45,386
Well done.

859
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:49,356
I really wanted to win.

860
00:35:49,423 --> 00:35:50,958
I'm really disappointed

861
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:53,561
I couldn't.

862
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:56,430
That's all.

863
00:35:57,598 --> 00:35:59,300
-Well done!
-You did great, kid!

864
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,501
This is heartbreaking.

865
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:05,239
[Yejun]
Even though I was given a second chance,

866
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:07,708
I couldn't seize it.

867
00:36:07,775 --> 00:36:09,476
That left me with a lot of regret.

868
00:36:12,613 --> 00:36:14,281
I'll keep working hard

869
00:36:14,348 --> 00:36:18,519
to grow into a better MMA fighter.

870
00:36:18,586 --> 00:36:20,588
-Great job. It's okay. Well done.
-I'm soaked.

871
00:36:20,654 --> 00:36:21,722
-Thank you.
-Well done.

872
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:23,991
-Well done, Yejun.
-You did amazing.

873
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:25,826
Hey, you were awesome up there.

874
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:29,096
[Jongkook]
He's only 18, though. That's wild.

875
00:36:29,163 --> 00:36:30,698
His future's bright.

876
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:35,903
All this for losing
that damn punching bag challenge.

877
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:39,940
-They're in heaven, we're in hell.
-Here we are, sweating bullets. [laughs]

878
00:36:40,007 --> 00:36:43,711
[Lee] Let me announce the next matchup
of <i>I Am Boxer's</i> deathmatch.

879
00:36:43,777 --> 00:36:46,347
The fighter to enter the deathmatch is…

880
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:49,683
[Dowoon] Who's it gonna be?

881
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:52,553
Yuk Junseo.

882
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,021
[contestants clamoring]

883
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:55,155
[applauding]

884
00:36:55,222 --> 00:36:59,460
He's crazy competitive. He's ex-UDT.
This is making me nervous.

885
00:36:59,526 --> 00:37:02,363
-[Lee] He really works hard.
-[Jongkook] Yeah, he does.

886
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,098
He's got grit, real grit.

887
00:37:04,164 --> 00:37:07,468
I hope Yuk Junseo really shows
what he's got this time.

888
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:10,604
[Jongkook] Yeah, when I saw him last time,
he definitely had punching power.

889
00:37:12,406 --> 00:37:13,774
[contestants clamor]

890
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:14,842
[contestant] Nice.

891
00:37:15,342 --> 00:37:16,377
[contestants clamor]

892
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:20,214
I'm going in
thinking this is my last shot.

893
00:37:20,281 --> 00:37:22,516
I'm going to give everything I've got.

894
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,418
I'll push full throttle.

895
00:37:24,485 --> 00:37:26,153
[contestant 1] Who's he up against?

896
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,355
-That's what matters.
-[contestant 2] Who's it gonna be?

897
00:37:28,856 --> 00:37:31,258
The fighter facing Yuk Junseo is…

898
00:37:32,393 --> 00:37:33,394
[contestant 3] <i>Maybe BM?</i>

899
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,398
[Lee] Moon Youngwoong.

900
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:44,938
Oh, his father coached…

901
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:47,841
Wait, what was his name?
He coached Naoya Inoue.

902
00:37:48,575 --> 00:37:49,576
[Sungmin] The pro from Japan.

903
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:51,879
[Jihyeok]
I remember him being pretty good.

904
00:37:51,945 --> 00:37:53,247
[Yunchan] He could take this.

905
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:58,419
When I fought him last time,
he rocked me hard.

906
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,621
He swung me as soon as we started.

907
00:38:00,688 --> 00:38:01,955
I was like, "Damn it."

908
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,559
-[contestant 1] Go, Sellchan!
-[contestant 2] He's good.

909
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,395
That's the Japanese style,
precise and technical.

910
00:38:09,129 --> 00:38:11,265
[contestant 1]
He definitely has that Japanese vibe.

911
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,137
Whoever I face, I'll stay confident
and give it everything I've got.

912
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:19,506
[BM]
There's a weight class difference here.

913
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:21,709
[Hyunman] Yeah, this guy's bigger.

914
00:38:21,775 --> 00:38:23,510
-He has a bigger frame.
-[Donghee] Oh, yeah?

915
00:38:23,577 --> 00:38:25,612
There's a weight difference,

916
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,314
and a height and reach difference.

917
00:38:27,381 --> 00:38:30,017
Moon Youngwoong has the clear edge here.

918
00:38:30,084 --> 00:38:32,619
-He's heavier, bigger, and longer.
-[Jongkook] That's right.

919
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,589
[Dex] And his boxing experience too.
It's seven years versus one.

920
00:38:35,656 --> 00:38:36,857
That's a huge difference.

921
00:38:37,491 --> 00:38:40,127
[Juyeong] And he's from Teiken.
That's not a gym you just walk into.

922
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:43,597
[Yunchan] The way I see it,
Yuk Junseo won't even last a minute.

923
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:45,299
[contestant 1]
Is Yuk Junseo gonna be okay?

924
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:48,335
[contestant 2] The gap's big enough
to call this a mismatch.

925
00:38:48,402 --> 00:38:50,304
He can't take this. The level gap is real.

926
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,373
-Really?
-He might get KO'd, for real.

927
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,310
[Youngwoong] There's a big difference
in our boxing experience,

928
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:59,279
so I think I've got a real shot
at winning this.

929
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,850
I may be behind in time and experience,

930
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:07,388
but I've made it this far,
so I'll do my best and see it through.

931
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:08,722
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

932
00:39:10,124 --> 00:39:11,158
[Sungmin] You got this!

933
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:12,493
Let's go!

934
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,660
Let's begin.

935
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:20,634
-Box!
-[bell rings]

936
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:23,437
-Let's go!
-Let's do this!

937
00:39:23,504 --> 00:39:26,373
YOUNGWOONG X JUNSEO

938
00:39:27,307 --> 00:39:28,909
[contestants clamor]

939
00:39:28,976 --> 00:39:30,010
Whoa!

940
00:39:31,278 --> 00:39:32,379
[contestant] He's coming on strong.

941
00:39:32,446 --> 00:39:34,882
[Sungwoon] Whoa!

942
00:39:35,682 --> 00:39:36,850
Whoa!

943
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,051
[referee] Break, break!

944
00:39:38,118 --> 00:39:40,120
-Guy's got fire.
-He's got power.

945
00:39:40,187 --> 00:39:42,122
[Dex] Hey, Yuk Junseo's doing good.

946
00:39:42,189 --> 00:39:43,190
Box!

947
00:39:44,725 --> 00:39:45,893
[Dongjin] Nice reflexes.

948
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,062
-[contestants clamor]
-Hey!

949
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:52,332
[O3ohn] He's got good moves.

950
00:39:54,535 --> 00:39:56,437
[contestants clamor]

951
00:39:58,338 --> 00:40:00,174
Man, he's fiery.

952
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,442
He's like a wild horse.

953
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:06,413
[Junseo]
Since he's taller and bigger than me,

954
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,182
I only had one option.

955
00:40:08,248 --> 00:40:10,818
Just go in, eat less, and land more.

956
00:40:10,884 --> 00:40:13,353
That was the only thing on my mind.

957
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:17,925
[contestants clamor]

958
00:40:20,327 --> 00:40:22,729
[Jihyeok]
You can feel how heavy his punches are.

959
00:40:22,796 --> 00:40:25,265
He's staying tight on him.
Man, that's a smart game plan.

960
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:29,570
[Dex] He's a real heavy hitter!

961
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:33,006
Early on, I kept thinking,
"This isn't going well."

962
00:40:33,073 --> 00:40:36,410
I pushed through the round like that.

963
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,545
[Sungmin] Keep those feet moving.

964
00:40:42,216 --> 00:40:43,283
[BM] All right!

965
00:40:44,017 --> 00:40:45,085
[contestants yell]

966
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,253
[Dex] He's a heavy hitter!

967
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,990
[Youngwoong] That was a style of boxing
I'd never experienced before.

968
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:53,060
He was super aggressive,

969
00:40:53,126 --> 00:40:56,396
and his punches had a lot of weight
because of his physicality.

970
00:40:57,231 --> 00:40:59,666
That threw me off a bit at first.

971
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:01,268
He's lost his flow, huh?

972
00:41:01,902 --> 00:41:03,337
Maybe he just fights well.

973
00:41:03,403 --> 00:41:05,205
-He's throwing off his rhythm.
-Right.

974
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:07,374
[Kyungmin] Just throw! Trade with him!

975
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:08,642
[Minuk] Nice jab.

976
00:41:11,812 --> 00:41:13,347
-Oh, no!
-[Sungmin] Counter!

977
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,052
-He's a natural.
-He's a total natural.

978
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,354
He's got that fighter instinct.

979
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,955
Yeah, he's got it.

980
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:24,725
[Jaehyuk] Those kinds of punches
are harder to dodge.

981
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,059
They come in at weird angles.

982
00:41:26,126 --> 00:41:28,128
-[contestant 1] Oi!
-[contestants yelling]

983
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,830
[Sungmin]
You need to take the initiative now.

984
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,465
[Dongeon] That jab landed.

985
00:41:32,666 --> 00:41:33,934
-[Dowoon] Is that a nosebleed?
-Is it?

986
00:41:34,001 --> 00:41:35,702
-Is his nose bleeding?
-He has a nosebleed.

987
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:39,940
Just a few seconds into the first round,

988
00:41:40,007 --> 00:41:42,342
I took two or three combo shots.

989
00:41:42,409 --> 00:41:44,678
That's probably
when my nose started bleeding.

990
00:41:45,546 --> 00:41:48,982
I didn't want to let that shake me,

991
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:52,052
so I figured I had to be
even more aggressive.

992
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:56,657
YOUNGWOONG X JUNSEO

993
00:41:58,325 --> 00:41:59,826
It's all about your grit!

994
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:01,428
-That's it, go harder!
-Go!

995
00:42:01,495 --> 00:42:03,564
-Yuk Junseo, keep going!
-Nice, that's it!

996
00:42:03,964 --> 00:42:05,265
[bell rings]

997
00:42:05,332 --> 00:42:06,700
Nice, guys!

998
00:42:08,101 --> 00:42:11,371
[contestants cheering]

999
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,108
He's a natural-born star. That was insane.

1000
00:42:15,175 --> 00:42:16,643
[Sanggeun] What a plot twist.

1001
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,879
He's got a hot body, he's good-looking,

1002
00:42:18,946 --> 00:42:20,347
and he's great at boxing too.

1003
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:25,085
You mean me?

1004
00:42:25,552 --> 00:42:28,388
It's crazy that an amateur
can do that well at all.

1005
00:42:28,455 --> 00:42:31,725
It's not easy for a non-pro
to box like that for three full minutes.

1006
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:33,126
[Soochan] Hey, Youngwoong.

1007
00:42:33,193 --> 00:42:35,162
You have to close the distance.

1008
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:37,998
[♪ tense music plays]

1009
00:42:38,065 --> 00:42:42,402
I clearly wasn't prepared
for that kind of style.

1010
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:45,772
I kept thinking,
"I have to break through this somehow."

1011
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,209
Then I decided to clear my head
and just go for it like him.

1012
00:42:49,276 --> 00:42:52,079
"If that's what you're going to do,
I can play that game too."

1013
00:42:52,646 --> 00:42:56,116
[Junseo] Either I knock you down
or you knock me down.

1014
00:42:56,183 --> 00:42:57,517
-Yuk Junseo!
-You got this!

1015
00:42:57,584 --> 00:42:58,719
Let's go!

1016
00:42:59,586 --> 00:43:02,255
-Let's fight!
-Come on! Last three minutes!

00:43:20,273 --> 00:43:21,375
Wait, what?

1025
00:43:22,275 --> 00:43:24,611
-Wait, what?
-[Hyunjae] Did he just cross-counter?

1026
00:43:26,446 --> 00:43:27,714
Keep the distance!

1027
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,418
Aim for the body!

1028
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,788
Aim for the body!

1029
00:43:37,591 --> 00:43:38,592
[Ohgon] Is that a knockdown?

1030
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:42,129
[referee] Slip, slip!

1031
00:43:42,195 --> 00:43:43,263
Slip, slip.

1032
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,798
It's just a slip, you're good!

1033
00:43:44,865 --> 00:43:46,800
[Dongjin] Both of them are going all out.

1034
00:43:46,867 --> 00:43:48,135
[Youngho] What a fiery match.

1035
00:43:49,903 --> 00:43:51,371
-Let's go!
-You got this!

1036
00:43:51,438 --> 00:43:52,973
-Let's go!
-Last round, guys!

1037
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,574
Let's fight to the max!

1038
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:56,877
Keep it long. Work the jab.

1039
00:43:57,644 --> 00:43:59,713
Use the jab. That's it.

1040
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,915
Keep your eyes on him!

1041
00:44:03,316 --> 00:44:04,317
All right!

1042
00:44:04,384 --> 00:44:06,186
[Chaehyun] You gotta box
like it's a real fight to win.

1043
00:44:06,987 --> 00:44:08,388
[Donghee] They're both spent.

1044
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:10,991
[Hyunman]
Now it's all stamina from here on out.

1045
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:13,760
Break, break!

1046
00:44:14,795 --> 00:44:15,862
[BM] Keep breathing!

1047
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:17,330
-Breathe!
-Deep breaths!

1048
00:44:18,098 --> 00:44:19,433
-Last round!
-Keep going!

1049
00:44:19,499 --> 00:44:21,802
Last minute, last minute!

1050
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,103
This is it!

1051
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,337
YOUNGWOONG X JUNSEO

1052
00:44:24,404 --> 00:44:25,539
One minute left!

1053
00:44:26,306 --> 00:44:27,908
-Jab first!
-Throw the right!

1054
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:29,109
Work the jab!

1055
00:44:30,677 --> 00:44:32,846
[Sungmin]
Now, hooks! Both hands, both hands!

1056
00:44:35,615 --> 00:44:36,817
You saw that? Damn!

1057
00:44:38,552 --> 00:44:39,753
[contestant clamoring]

1058
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,055
Think of this as a real fight!

1059
00:44:42,522 --> 00:44:43,790
One of them is gonna go down.

1060
00:44:44,257 --> 00:44:46,359
-Keep going!
-Let's go all the way.

1061
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,528
Drive into him! Drive into him!

1062
00:44:49,529 --> 00:44:50,831
Just drive into him!

1063
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:55,068
Keep going all the way!

1064
00:44:55,135 --> 00:44:57,204
Drive into him! 10 seconds left!

1065
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,905
-This is it!
-Let's finish this strong!

1066
00:44:58,972 --> 00:45:00,574
YOUNGWOONG X JUNSEO

1067
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,375
Pour it all out!

1068
00:45:03,443 --> 00:45:05,078
Keep throwing!

1069
00:45:05,946 --> 00:45:07,214
That landed hard.

1070
00:45:07,881 --> 00:45:10,083
[contestants clamoring, cheering]

1071
00:45:20,894 --> 00:45:22,562
-[bell rings]
-Stop!

1072
00:45:22,629 --> 00:45:24,531
[contestants cheering]

1073
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:36,710
-That was super fiery.
-Insane.

1074
00:45:36,777 --> 00:45:38,545
That was one hell of a fight.

1075
00:45:38,612 --> 00:45:39,946
Total testosterone overload.

1076
00:45:40,013 --> 00:45:41,181
No, that was awesome.

1077
00:45:41,248 --> 00:45:43,150
-That was fun.
-Totally unexpected.

1078
00:45:43,216 --> 00:45:44,684
Yeah, totally.

1079
00:45:45,152 --> 00:45:46,753
[Jongkook] All right then,

1080
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,157
we'll announce the judges' decision now.

1081
00:45:50,223 --> 00:45:52,058
Who's it gonna be?

1082
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:55,529
I think Yuk Junseo might win.
He landed a lot of aggressive shots.

1083
00:45:55,595 --> 00:45:57,664
[contestant 1]
He did land a couple of big shots.

1084
00:45:57,731 --> 00:45:59,399
[contestant 2]
Actually, I think he might lose.

1085
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:02,068
-At the end, though…
-Yeah, he got a bit wobbly.

1086
00:46:02,536 --> 00:46:04,805
[contestant 3] If we're talking rounds,
Round 2 should go to red.

1087
00:46:07,507 --> 00:46:10,010
[Jongkook] Judge one scores it for…

1088
00:46:10,877 --> 00:46:12,012
[Hyunman] I'm curious about this one.

1089
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:16,216
[O3ohn] Yuk Junseo from the blue corner!

1090
00:46:16,283 --> 00:46:17,951
BLUE CORNER YUK JUNSEO WINS

1091
00:46:18,718 --> 00:46:20,253
[Seungjun] He was a total beast.

1092
00:46:20,754 --> 00:46:22,823
Judge two scores it for…

1093
00:46:22,889 --> 00:46:24,624
[♪ tense music plays]

1094
00:46:29,229 --> 00:46:30,864
Moon Youngwoong from the red corner!

1095
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:32,632
RED CORNER MOON YOUNGWOONG WINS

1096
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:35,535
-Yes, all right!
-For real?

1097
00:46:35,602 --> 00:46:38,071
-This could go either way.
-Yeah, he took Round 2.

1098
00:46:38,138 --> 00:46:41,441
[Jongkook] According to the judges so far,
it's a draw.

1099
00:46:42,442 --> 00:46:45,445
-Then Don Lee will…
-Yeah, Don Lee will decide.

1100
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:47,247
[Junyoung]
The Master makes the final call.

1101
00:46:47,781 --> 00:46:49,015
[Kyungmin] Who will he pick?

1102
00:46:49,082 --> 00:46:50,116
[♪ dramatic music plays]

1103
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:53,153
[Youngwoong] I gave it everything I had
in those two rounds,

1104
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,754
so I had no regrets.

1105
00:46:56,223 --> 00:46:58,725
[Junseo]
The fight flowed exactly the way I wanted.

1106
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:02,429
The plan was to push forward
and stay aggressive.

1107
00:47:02,495 --> 00:47:04,764
So I thought I won, for sure.

1108
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,834
The survivor of this deathmatch is…

1109
00:47:13,106 --> 00:47:14,441
Yuk Junseo from the blue corner.

1110
00:47:14,507 --> 00:47:16,877
BLUE CORNER YUK JUNSEO SURVIVES

1111
00:47:16,943 --> 00:47:18,511
Yuk Junseo from the blue corner.

[applauding]

1114
00:47:20,747 --> 00:47:21,815
That's insane.

1115
00:47:21,882 --> 00:47:23,350
-[Jongkook] Congratulations.
-Well done!

1116
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:25,318
-You both did great.
-Amazing game.

1117
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:29,222
-Every match is epic.
-Yeah.

1118
00:47:29,289 --> 00:47:31,124
He held his ground impressively well.

1119
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:36,363
[panting] I'm grateful to the judges
for giving me this win,

1120
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:39,699
and I'll continue to push forward
with a learner's mind-set. Thank you.

1121
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:45,472
Yuk Junseo might've been the underdog.

1122
00:47:45,538 --> 00:47:47,340
But this is the rise of the underdog.

1123
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:48,842
That's what makes this fun.

1124
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,176
-Right.
-Because you never know.

1125
00:47:50,243 --> 00:47:53,280
But in the end,
in a survival format like this,

1126
00:47:53,346 --> 00:47:55,882
-if you only match pros with pros,
-Right.

1127
00:47:55,949 --> 00:47:57,484
-then…
-It defeats the purpose.

1128
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:00,820
You need those twists
where an underdog beats someone.

1129
00:48:00,887 --> 00:48:03,456
-That's something you never get to see.
-That's right.

1130
00:48:03,957 --> 00:48:06,226
The fighter to enter the deathmatch is…

00:48:06,293 --> 00:48:08,461
-[Ohgon] This is killing me.
-[Minsung] I'm losing my mind.

00:48:09,796 --> 00:48:11,698
[Minuk]
I'll win and move on, no matter what.

1134
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:12,899
[Lee] Myung Hyunman.

1135
00:48:12,966 --> 00:48:14,734

I've got to get past him fast and move on.

[Lee] The fighter facing Kim Minuk…
The fighter facing Myung Hyunman

1137

Please, I'm nervous.

1144
00:48:36,056 --> 00:48:37,057
Pick me.

1145
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,992
I've still got a lot to show.

1146

Lee Chaehyun.

[Juhyun] Man, I'm gonna lose my voice.

1151
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:56,276
[Jaehyuk] He's fast. He's no heavy hitter,

1152
00:48:56,343 --> 00:48:57,644
but he barely ever gets hit.

1153
00:48:58,278 --> 00:49:00,413
-He's quick.
-He's coming in hot.

Wow, he's good.

1157
00:49:07,988 --> 00:49:09,689
[Chaehyun]
I'm the definition of a real boxer,

1158
00:49:09,756 --> 00:49:11,224
so I figured I'd get picked.

1159
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:12,859
I thought, "I finally got my chance."

1160
00:49:12,926 --> 00:49:15,261
"I need to show 200% of myself."

1161
00:49:16,363 --> 00:49:18,231
Lee Chaehyun's been boxing for 13 years.

1162
00:49:18,298 --> 00:49:19,833
Basically, he's at his prime.

1163
00:49:19,899 --> 00:49:22,569
In other words, he's a total elite boxer.

1164
00:49:22,635 --> 00:49:24,237
-Thirteen years says it all.
-Hmm.

1165

And the fighter facing Lee Chaehyun is…

1166
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:29,576
Park Seongjun.

BLACK C*MBAT FIGHTER, "UNDERDOG"

1169
00:49:34,881 --> 00:49:37,017
Let's go, Park Seongjun!

1170
00:49:37,684 --> 00:49:39,119
[Seongjun] I knew he'd call my name.

1171
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:44,224
Somehow, I always get matched
with tall, good-looking guys.

1172
00:49:44,724 --> 00:49:46,993
This match is no exception.

1173
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,829
He was my opponent in Round 1.

1174
00:49:49,896 --> 00:49:50,997
-Ah.
-Hmm.

1175
00:49:52,065 --> 00:49:53,800
[Seongjun] During the first fight,

1176
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:56,636
I thought he was just an actor
doing some casual boxing,

1177
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:59,706
so I let my guard down a lot.

1178
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:05,945
[Lee] Kuk Seungjun from the red corner.

1179
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:11,718
[Seongjun] I'm still furious at myself
for doing so poorly in that fight.

1180
00:50:11,785 --> 00:50:13,686
I was finally thrown a lifeline,

1181
00:50:13,753 --> 00:50:16,089
so I grabbed it. I just wanted to grab it.

1182
00:50:16,156 --> 00:50:19,926
I'll show them who MMA's "Underdog"
Park Seongjun really is.

1183
00:50:20,794 --> 00:50:23,696
[Dex] He's been doing MMA for 10 years.

1184
00:50:23,763 --> 00:50:25,832
-[Jongkook] That's right.
-He's got tons of experience,

1185
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:28,334
-so he should be pretty sharp.
-Yes, 10 years in the game.

1186
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:30,203
But Lee Chaehyun's nickname is

1187
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:32,172
-"Pro Killer."
-That's right.

1188
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,207
-So you never know with these two.
-Right.

1189
00:50:34,274 --> 00:50:35,408
PARK SEONGJUN VS LEE CHAEHYUN

1190
00:50:35,475 --> 00:50:37,510
Lee Chaehyun looked
all sweet in the photo,

1191
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:39,946
but he looks totally fierce in the ring.

1192
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,714
-[Lee] He's good-looking.
-[Dex] He is.

1193
00:50:41,781 --> 00:50:42,782
Very dashing.

1194
00:50:43,283 --> 00:50:46,953
Athletes these days
are all handsome, aren't they?

1195
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,021
They're charming.

1196
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:50,023
Tiny faces like that? Hard to hit clean.

1197
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:51,324
Right, exactly.

1198
00:50:51,391 --> 00:50:54,360
-Unlike me, who gets hit a lot.
-You don't even try to dodge.

1199
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,096
-I just guard up.
-You don't even bother.

1200
00:50:56,162 --> 00:50:57,664
Like, "Go ahead and hit me."

1201
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:59,332
-Exactly.
-You just push through.

1202
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,401
You never know.

1203
00:51:01,468 --> 00:51:04,304
And with underdogs,
you can't help rooting for them.

1204
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:06,339
[Sungwoon] I really hope he shows everyone

1205
00:51:06,406 --> 00:51:08,441
just how tough MMA fighters are.

1206
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:10,810
[Lee]
You can't tell who'll win this fight.

1207
00:51:10,877 --> 00:51:11,878
You really can't.

1208
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:13,813
[♪ dramatic music plays]

1209
00:51:16,616 --> 00:51:18,885
-Let's get this rolling!
-Come on, let's go!

1210
00:51:18,952 --> 00:51:20,320
You got this, Chaehyun!

1211
00:51:20,386 --> 00:51:22,889
-Let's go, Underdog!
-Let's go!

1212
00:51:22,956 --> 00:51:25,391
We're in for a real treat with this one.

1213
00:51:26,092 --> 00:51:28,128
All right, box!

1214
00:51:28,194 --> 00:51:29,729
-[bell rings]
-Box!

1215
00:51:30,396 --> 00:51:33,333
Hey, you're rushing!
No need, take it easy!

1216
00:51:33,399 --> 00:51:35,001
[Dex] He's fast. Whoa!

1217
00:51:35,068 --> 00:51:37,137
SEONGJUN X CHAEHYUN

1218
00:51:37,203 --> 00:51:38,505
He's fast.

1219
00:51:40,607 --> 00:51:42,909
[Jongkook] All right, nice jab.

1220
00:51:44,077 --> 00:51:45,478
Jab, then one-two!

1221
00:51:45,545 --> 00:51:47,180
-There you go!
-That's it!

1222
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:49,616
-All right!
-Great instincts!

1223
00:51:49,682 --> 00:51:51,384
He's got a killer jab.

1224
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,055
[Lee] Great, that jab's nice.

1225
00:52:00,894 --> 00:52:02,228
-Come on!
-He's good.

1226
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:04,864
-Man, that jab-slip-cross.
-Hit and move.

1227
00:52:04,931 --> 00:52:06,432
That's it!

1228
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,501
He ate that counter head-on!

1229
00:52:08,568 --> 00:52:09,602
He's super fast.

1230
00:52:10,103 --> 00:52:12,005
That rear hand is super dangerous.

1231
00:52:12,705 --> 00:52:14,407
He's crushing him.

1232
00:52:14,474 --> 00:52:16,609
-He's good.
-To the center, to the center!

1233
00:52:16,676 --> 00:52:18,878
[Chaehyun] Hitting without getting hit,

1234
00:52:18,945 --> 00:52:20,880
that's the kind of boxing I like.

1235
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:23,149
And the goal was to do just that.

1236
00:52:23,216 --> 00:52:24,584
Do a feint!

1237
00:52:24,651 --> 00:52:25,885
That's it!

1238
00:52:26,286 --> 00:52:28,621
[contestant] Whoo!

1239
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:29,856
[Minwoo] He's just eating them.

1240
00:52:29,923 --> 00:52:32,392
[Lee] Park Seongjun's coming in too close.

1241
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:35,295
[Jongkook] He left his face wide open.
Cover up before you go in.

1242
00:52:35,962 --> 00:52:36,996
All right!

1243
00:52:37,897 --> 00:52:38,898
That's it!

1244
00:52:39,566 --> 00:52:42,468
[contestants cheer]

1245
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:43,703
Whoa!

1246
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:46,539
Down, down, down!

1247
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:50,443
[contestants cheer]

1248
00:52:51,477 --> 00:52:53,279
That's it! Whoo!

1249
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:55,114
PARK SEONGJUN KNOCKED DOWN

1250
00:52:55,181 --> 00:52:56,282
[O3ohn] His legs gave out.

1251
00:52:56,349 --> 00:52:58,351
[Donghee]
That one landed right on his face, huh?

1252
00:52:58,418 --> 00:52:59,485
This is getting good!

1253
00:52:59,552 --> 00:53:03,022
-Five, six, seven…
-[Seongjun] I got knocked down.

1254
00:53:03,089 --> 00:53:06,125
I tried to drag him
into the messy brawl I wanted,

1255
00:53:06,192 --> 00:53:08,328
but I think he knew I was gonna do that.

1256
00:53:08,962 --> 00:53:10,597
-Seven, eight…
-[Yejun] Take it slow, man.

1257
00:53:10,663 --> 00:53:13,099
It's fine! Breathe! Just breathe!

1258
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:14,934
[referee] Come in, box!

1259
00:53:15,435 --> 00:53:17,136
[Jaehyuk] There's a fire in his eyes now.

1260
00:53:17,704 --> 00:53:19,038
Underdog, power through!

1261
00:53:19,939 --> 00:53:21,874
Circle around! Don't get hit!

1262
00:53:24,143 --> 00:53:25,778
-Yes, that's it.
-Nice.

1263
00:53:25,845 --> 00:53:27,413
He's amazing. He's not getting hit.

1264
00:53:28,047 --> 00:53:29,782
Man, it's not going well for him.

1265
00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:30,883
Ten seconds!

1266
00:53:31,384 --> 00:53:32,785
He's too fast.

1267
00:53:32,852 --> 00:53:34,454
He's so good. Really tough to handle.

1268
00:53:35,688 --> 00:53:37,357
He's too fast to catch.

1269
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:38,524
All right, good!

1270
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,360
-He can't catch him.
-He's getting thrown off.

1271
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:41,427
-See that?
-[bell rings]

1272
00:53:41,494 --> 00:53:44,197
[Lee] That really messes you up,
breaking your rhythm.

1273
00:53:45,632 --> 00:53:46,766
[Yejun] He's seriously good.

1274
00:53:47,667 --> 00:53:50,203
[Dex] Lee Chaehyun's definitely has skill.

1275
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:51,404
[Jongkook] Yeah, he's good.

1276
00:53:51,471 --> 00:53:52,605
Real good.

1277
00:53:53,072 --> 00:53:54,073
It drives you crazy.

1278
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,375
You try to go in, but…

1279
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:57,210
-He keeps throwing off your timing.
-Yeah.

1280
00:53:57,277 --> 00:53:59,479
-It's maddening.
-And he's landing those straights

1281
00:53:59,545 --> 00:54:00,913
with rock-solid balance,

1282
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,815
so the damage keeps adding up.

1283
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:05,118
[Taesun]
You need to close in on him all at once.

1284
00:54:07,353 --> 00:54:10,223
[Seongjun] I was really pissed at myself.

1285
00:54:10,857 --> 00:54:12,625
"Why am I doing so badly?"

1286
00:54:12,692 --> 00:54:16,462
"Why am I getting hit this much?"
I couldn't shake that thought.

1287
00:54:16,529 --> 00:54:18,197
So I tried to pulled myself together,

1288
00:54:18,264 --> 00:54:20,433
thinking, "No, I can do this."

1289
00:54:23,102 --> 00:54:25,538
[Chaehyun] He couldn't land a single
clean shot on me the entire round,

1290
00:54:26,105 --> 00:54:27,974
so the momentum swung completely my way.

1291
00:54:29,175 --> 00:54:31,010
[O3ohn] Let's go, you got this!

1292
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:33,846
This is it! Show him what you've got!

1293
00:54:34,547 --> 00:54:35,982

-[bell rings]
-Box!

1295
00:54:37,116 --> 00:54:39,018

1296
00:54:39,085 --> 00:54:40,753
-All right, nice jab!
-Nice shot!

1297
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:42,488
[contestants] All right!

1298
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:44,891
[contestant 1] Keep it short! All right!

1299
00:54:44,957 --> 00:54:45,958
[Jungon] He ate that again!

1300
00:54:46,025 --> 00:54:47,393
-Doing good!
-Use your lead hand!

1301
00:54:48,695 --> 00:54:52,031
[Yejun] Don't get flustered!
Just stay calm, and keep your guard up.

1302
00:54:52,098 --> 00:54:54,033
[Jaehyuk]
Don't go first, just counter! Corner him!

1303
00:54:54,467 --> 00:54:55,468
That's it!

1304
00:54:55,535 --> 00:54:56,869
[Sanggeun] Nice!

1305
00:54:56,936 --> 00:54:58,404
[Hyunjae] Don't get flustered!

1306
00:54:58,471 --> 00:55:00,039
-Stick to countering!
-[Jungon] Nice jab!

1307
00:55:01,607 --> 00:55:03,543
[Hyunman]
He's throwing whatever he's got left.

1308
00:55:04,577 --> 00:55:05,611
This looks dangerous.

1309
00:55:05,678 --> 00:55:07,914
-[Yejun] Loosen up and throw.
-All right!

1310
00:55:08,981 --> 00:55:10,883
-[Taesun] You have to go in now.
-[Yejun] Yes!

1311
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,385
[contestants cheering]

1312
00:55:12,452 --> 00:55:13,453
Good one, man!

[cheering]

1314
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:20,293
-[Hyunman] That was a bit dangerous.
-[Jongkook] He landed one.

1315
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,862
Go again! Go again!

1316
00:55:22,929 --> 00:55:25,231
Swing with confidence, man!

1317
00:55:26,165 --> 00:55:27,367
[Jungon] You've landed one shot so far!

1318
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,335
-[Haengseok] Nice!
-[Jungon] That's it!

1319
00:55:29,402 --> 00:55:30,403
[Sungmin] Double jab!

1320
00:55:31,771 --> 00:55:33,139
-[Hyunjae] All right!
-[Jungon] There you go!

1321
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:34,974
[groans]

1322
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:36,776
[Jongkook]
He's got him. He's got him again.

1323
00:55:36,843 --> 00:55:37,844
He's got him.

1324
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:41,414
-[contestant] All right!
-[Hyunman] That's done some damage.

1325
00:55:41,881 --> 00:55:43,216
[Minwoo] Stay sharp!

1326
00:55:45,084 --> 00:55:46,619
You know it doesn't hurt! Get in!

1327
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,021
Stay focused! Stay focused!

1328
00:55:51,124 --> 00:55:52,525
[contestants shouting]

1329
00:55:52,592 --> 00:55:53,893
[Taesun] Oh, he's dialed in.

1330
00:55:54,827 --> 00:55:56,562
[contestants cheering]

1331
00:55:56,629 --> 00:55:57,764
[Taesun] He's good.

[contestants clamoring]

1333
00:56:01,868 --> 00:56:02,935
-He clipped him.
-Yeah.

1334
00:56:03,002 --> 00:56:06,372
[Dongeon] Man, his durability is crazy.
How is he taking all those shots?

1335
00:56:07,874 --> 00:56:09,442
[Youmin] Keep it up till the end!

1336
00:56:10,543 --> 00:56:12,011
[Junseo] Whoa, look at him.

1337
00:56:13,279 --> 00:56:14,680
SEONGJUN X CHAEHYUN

1338
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:16,783
-[Jongkook] Ten seconds, guys!
-Ten seconds!

1339
00:56:17,683 --> 00:56:19,118
-Ten seconds!
-[Yejun] Almost there!

1340
00:56:19,185 --> 00:56:20,820
[Donghee] Let's go, let's go!

1341
00:56:21,988 --> 00:56:24,557
[Kyungmin] They're going hard all
the way through. Pretty impressive.

1342
00:56:24,624 --> 00:56:26,159
-[bell rings]
-[referee] Stop!

1343
00:56:26,826 --> 00:56:28,528
-[Taesun] Well, that was…
-[Chungil] He won way too easily.

1344
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,830
-He breezed through it.
-[contestants applauding]

1345
00:56:30,897 --> 00:56:33,499
-[Seungjun] Man, he's good.
-[Dongeon] These amateurs…

1346
00:56:33,566 --> 00:56:34,901
Their style freaks me out.

1347
00:56:34,967 --> 00:56:36,302
Man, Lee Chaehyun

1348
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:39,238
-showed us what boxing really is.
-That was real boxing.

1349
00:56:39,305 --> 00:56:41,808
Boxing isn't a brawl. It's a sport.

1350
00:56:42,742 --> 00:56:45,278
We'll announce the decision now.

1351
00:56:45,344 --> 00:56:47,647
The survivor of this deathmatch is…

1352
00:56:48,214 --> 00:56:49,449
Lee Chaehyun.

fighting your hearts out.

1357
00:56:56,956 --> 00:56:57,957
[Haengseok] He's so cool.

1358
00:56:58,024 --> 00:57:00,092
Lee Chaehyun's on another level.

1359
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,494
He's just too good.

1360
00:57:01,894 --> 00:57:02,895
First off,

1361
00:57:03,596 --> 00:57:05,364
I'm really glad that I got the win.

1362
00:57:05,932 --> 00:57:07,733
I'll keep working hard

1363
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,235
to climb even higher.

1364
00:57:09,302 --> 00:57:11,337
[applause]

1365
00:57:13,606 --> 00:57:16,976
I lost the first fight
and got back in through the extra pass.

1366
00:57:17,043 --> 00:57:19,712
And you gave me
another huge chance this time,

1367
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:22,448
but I still couldn't make the most of it.

1368
00:57:22,849 --> 00:57:24,917
I'm really mad at myself for that.

1369
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:28,454
I promised my wife
I'd take her to Las Vegas. [chuckles]

1370
00:57:28,521 --> 00:57:30,790
I'll just take her somewhere even better.

1371
00:57:30,857 --> 00:57:32,458
-I love you, Jihyun.
-[Juhyun] You're the man!

1372
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:34,927
[cheering]

1373
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:36,362
I'd better do that too.

1374
00:57:36,429 --> 00:57:38,030
-You're the man!
-You did awesome!

1375
00:57:40,867 --> 00:57:43,569
POST-MATCH BREAK

1376
00:57:46,939 --> 00:57:49,342
[Dex chuckles] Hey, you're like a bull.

1377
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:58,351
[chuckles]

1378
00:57:58,417 --> 00:58:00,486
It's making you itch to fight, huh?

1379
00:58:01,654 --> 00:58:04,323
I've learned a lot in theory.
Like, the shoulder should go…

1380
00:58:04,724 --> 00:58:06,225
Right. When you punch?

1381
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:07,760
But I can't do it in practice.

1382
00:58:07,827 --> 00:58:09,228
You need to put in some work.

1383
00:58:09,295 --> 00:58:10,596
[Dex] Yeah, that's it!

1384
00:58:10,663 --> 00:58:12,999
-[Lee] It takes a lot of practice.
-[Jongkook] It's tough.

1385
00:58:13,065 --> 00:58:14,267
[chuckles] It's really hard.

1386
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:16,102
[Lee] It's the shoulder pop.

1387
00:58:16,602 --> 00:58:18,170
[Jongkook]
You don't even need to swing big.

1388
00:58:18,237 --> 00:58:19,639
Your shoulder just snaps naturally.

1389
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:23,042
You gotta pick it up over the years.

1390
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:25,611
-Yeah, like that.
-You have to pop it.

1391
00:58:25,678 --> 00:58:28,514
-It's something I can't teach you how.
-[Jongkook chuckles]

1392
00:58:28,581 --> 00:58:30,783
I don't understand the mechanics of it.

1393
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:36,923
Let's continue with the next matchup
of<i> I Am Boxer's</i> deathmatch.

1394
00:58:36,989 --> 00:58:38,658
The lineup's still stacked.

1395
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:41,027
-Man, I'm losing my mind.
-It's nerve-racking.

1396
00:58:41,093 --> 00:58:42,695
I'm losing my mind.

1397
00:58:43,262 --> 00:58:44,931
Most eliminated fighters are strong.

1398
00:58:44,997 --> 00:58:46,766
[chuckling] Right.

1399
00:58:46,832 --> 00:58:49,402
[Donghyun] <i>I hope none of them come back.</i>

1400
00:58:49,468 --> 00:58:52,071
If they come back,
I'll have to fight them again.

1401
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:53,739
[sighs]

1402
00:58:55,841 --> 00:58:58,377
[Lee]
The fighter to enter the deathmatch is…

1403
00:58:59,512 --> 00:59:02,415
[♪ dramatic music playing]

1404
00:59:03,282 --> 00:59:04,650
Kim Taesun.

1405
00:59:05,484 --> 00:59:06,852
Kim Taesun.

1406
00:59:07,386 --> 00:59:09,355
[contestants clamoring]

1407
00:59:09,422 --> 00:59:11,023
I knew it.

1408
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:13,025
[Juhyun] The resurrected prince.

1409
00:59:13,092 --> 00:59:14,427
[Seungjun]
Always coming back, like a phoenix.

1410
00:59:14,493 --> 00:59:16,529
[Taekmin]
He should change his nickname to that.

1411
00:59:17,029 --> 00:59:18,464
-Look at how happy he is.
-I know.

1412
00:59:18,531 --> 00:59:19,599
Lucky guy.

1413
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:23,402
And the fighter facing Kim Taesun is…

1414
00:59:24,303 --> 00:59:25,471
Who's it gonna be?

1415
00:59:25,972 --> 00:59:27,273
A rematch?

1416
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,341
[gasps]

1417
00:59:28,808 --> 00:59:29,909
Oh, Kim Minuk?

1418
00:59:31,077 --> 00:59:33,913
[Minuk] <i>I had a feeling I might go up</i>
<i>against Kim Taesun one more time.</i>

1419
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:39,652
-[Lee] Kim Minuk!
-[contestants clamoring]

1420
00:59:40,453 --> 00:59:43,055
[Sellchan] Wow, round two!

1421
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,490
It's a rematch!

1422
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:48,928
[shouts] That's brutal! [exclaims]

1423
00:59:48,995 --> 00:59:50,630
[contestants applauding]

1424
00:59:56,936 --> 00:59:58,004
Honored, sir.

1425
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,372
[Lee] We've got a rematch, everyone.

1426
00:59:59,438 --> 01:00:02,241
KIM MINUK VS KIM TAESUN

1427
01:00:02,308 --> 01:00:04,710
[Sungmin] Taesun kept saying
he wanted to fight him again.

1428
01:00:05,611 --> 01:00:07,713
Finally, it's happening.

1429
01:00:08,214 --> 01:00:12,318
Well, he beat me once, after all.

1430
01:00:13,252 --> 01:00:15,354
[contestant] Hey, get out of there.

1431
01:00:15,421 --> 01:00:17,056
[contestant 2]
He puts weight behind each one.

1432
01:00:17,523 --> 01:00:18,991
You can see the precision.

1433
01:00:20,793 --> 01:00:22,495
[Lee] The winner of this match is…

1434
01:00:22,561 --> 01:00:23,863
Kim Minuk from the red corner.

1435
01:00:25,731 --> 01:00:28,567
[Taesun] <i>It was seriously devastating.</i>

1436
01:00:28,634 --> 01:00:31,270
I never want to lose to him again.

1437
01:00:32,405 --> 01:00:33,806
Looking forward to this.

1438
01:00:34,273 --> 01:00:35,274
I'll prove it

1439
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:37,476
with my real skills.

1440
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:39,812
[contestants cheering, applauding]

1441
01:00:39,879 --> 01:00:41,113
[Seungjun] He seems really serious.

1442
01:00:41,947 --> 01:00:45,551
Kim Taesun's usually the playful type,

1443
01:00:45,618 --> 01:00:47,453
but he's dead serious right now.

1444
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,121
If he wins this,

1445
01:00:49,655 --> 01:00:51,023
he's a real phoenix.

1446
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:53,392
Beating the guy he already lost to once.

1447
01:00:53,826 --> 01:00:56,529
I'll put in the effort
and make it through again. Thank you.

1448
01:00:57,930 --> 01:00:59,198
[Dowoon] Since he's beaten him before,

1449
01:00:59,265 --> 01:01:01,067
I think he'll fight the way he did then.

1450
01:01:01,133 --> 01:01:03,602
Kim Minuk looks confident.

1451
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,738
He's got that signature calmness.

1452
01:01:06,939 --> 01:01:08,841
This match has two rounds after all.

1453
01:01:08,908 --> 01:01:10,710
-Yeah. You're right.
-Anything can happen.

1454
01:01:10,776 --> 01:01:12,511
And last time,

1455
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:16,115
Kim Taesun poured everything out

1456
01:01:16,182 --> 01:01:17,516
-and still lost.
-Right.

1457
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:19,885
-So how's he gonna approach it this time?
-Yes.

1458
01:01:19,952 --> 01:01:22,021
-Exactly.
-Yes, that's the key.

1459
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:26,859
-[Dex] If he changes it up, that means…
-[Lee] Right.

1460
01:01:26,926 --> 01:01:29,528
…he learned something from the experience.

1461
01:01:29,595 --> 01:01:31,063
That'll be interesting to see.

1462
01:01:32,465 --> 01:01:34,633
[Lee]
I'm really curious how this will play out.

1463
01:01:35,568 --> 01:01:36,736
[Minuk] <i>I was confident.</i>

1464
01:01:37,303 --> 01:01:38,871
<i>There's nowhere left to run,</i>

1465
01:01:38,938 --> 01:01:41,207
<i>so I'll just have to step over him</i>
<i>and climb back up.</i>

1466
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:45,578
[Taesun] <i>If I lose again…</i>
<i>Even the thought of it is terrifying.</i>

1467
01:01:45,644 --> 01:01:47,580
<i>I have to win this time.</i>

1468
01:01:49,982 --> 01:01:51,350
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1469
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:53,385
FORMER ASIAN SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMP
KIM MINUK

1470
01:01:54,019 --> 01:01:55,121
[Juhyun] Let's do this!

1471
01:01:55,821 --> 01:01:57,356
-This one's going to be fun.
-Totally.

1472
01:01:57,423 --> 01:01:58,424
Box!

1473
01:01:58,491 --> 01:01:59,725
[bell rings]

1474
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:02,061
-All right!
-You got this!

1475
01:02:02,128 --> 01:02:06,599
MINUK X TAESUN

1476
01:02:06,665 --> 01:02:07,967
[Jongkook] They're sizing each other up.

1477
01:02:10,469 --> 01:02:11,737
[contestant] His jab's just…

1478
01:02:11,804 --> 01:02:12,972
[contestant 2] It's heavy.

1479
01:02:14,707 --> 01:02:15,708
[contestant 3] Nice stance.

1480
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:17,610
-[Yejun] He's gotta go first. That's it.
-That's it.

1481
01:02:17,676 --> 01:02:18,811
This is tense.

1482
01:02:18,878 --> 01:02:20,880
My palms are sweating.

1483
01:02:23,883 --> 01:02:24,884
-[Jaewon] Nice body shot!
-There!

1484
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,018
Nice body shot.

1485
01:02:26,685 --> 01:02:28,754
[Soochan] Love how relaxed he is.

1486
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:33,893
[Seongjun]
His rhythm's completely different.

1487
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:36,395
-[Juhyun] From last time?
-[Chungil] He's a lot more careful.

1488
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:37,797
[Juhyun] He shouldn't be scared, though.

1489
01:02:38,464 --> 01:02:40,199
Play the offense, the offense.

1490
01:02:43,335 --> 01:02:44,603
[Chungil] He's moving slow today.

1491
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,038
[Yejun] Got to go in first, man.

1492
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:49,408
Wait, he's not usually like this.

1493
01:02:50,109 --> 01:02:52,411
-Taesun looks a little intimidated.
-Right?

1494
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:54,146
Taesun seems really tense.

1495
01:02:54,713 --> 01:02:57,817
I usually fight with more energy,

1496
01:02:57,883 --> 01:03:00,319
but I couldn't help feeling
the pressure today.

1497
01:03:01,353 --> 01:03:03,055
<i>"If I lose again, I'm done for."</i>

1498
01:03:03,122 --> 01:03:05,191
<i>"What if Plan A doesn't work?"</i>

1499
01:03:05,257 --> 01:03:06,859
<i>"What's my Plan B?"</i>

1500
01:03:06,926 --> 01:03:10,196
<i>Thoughts like that kept swirling,</i>

1501
01:03:10,262 --> 01:03:11,931
and I got pushed back early on.

1502
01:03:13,666 --> 01:03:14,934
[Sungwoon] Nice!

1503
01:03:15,835 --> 01:03:17,169
-That's it!
-He's got it.

1504
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:22,341
[Jongkook] They landed at the same time.

1505
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:25,444
-[Jaehyuk] Swing with confidence. Nice.
-Come on, swing first!

1506
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:27,780
Nice, keep up the footwork.

1507
01:03:30,249 --> 01:03:31,650
-[Yejun] He's cornered.
-[Seungjun] That's it.

1508
01:03:31,717 --> 01:03:33,118
-Go, go!
-Okay, now go for it.

1509
01:03:33,185 --> 01:03:34,253
Go for it!

1510
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,721
-Go! This is it!
-Go!

1511
01:03:40,626 --> 01:03:41,760
Oh!

1512
01:03:41,827 --> 01:03:43,529
[Minwoo]
How is he landing that from there?

1513
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:46,165
[Yejun] Watch out for the right uppercut!

1514
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,435
[contestants exclaim]

1515
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:53,239
[O3ohn] He's tracking his movement.

1516
01:03:54,006 --> 01:03:56,408
This range actually favors Minuk.

1517
01:03:59,945 --> 01:04:02,481
[Minuk] <i>I can inflict more damage</i>
<i>when I'm backed into the ropes,</i>

1518
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:04,817
<i>so I signaled for Kim Taesun</i>
<i>to come in, but he didn't.</i>

1519
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:09,855
[Dongeon] "Fine, I'll go then."

1520
01:04:11,991 --> 01:04:13,325
[contestants clamoring]

1521
01:04:15,227 --> 01:04:16,862
[Sungmin] I love cheeky stuff like this.

1522
01:04:16,929 --> 01:04:18,697
[contestants cheer]

1523
01:04:18,764 --> 01:04:20,032
[Kyungmin] Damn, nice angle.

1524
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:21,934
Kim Minuk's got the flow on his side.

1525
01:04:22,468 --> 01:04:23,702

That last shot really caught him clean.

[Hyunman] That was dangerous.

At the end of Round 1,
I lost my balance for a second

That definitely drained my stamina.
Those hits.

I feel intimidated just looking at him.

1693
01:11:09,274 --> 01:11:10,309
[Dongjin] I'd be scared.

1694
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:11,743
Imagine fighting him.

1695
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:14,780
MYUNG HYUNMAN
FORMER KICKBOXING HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMP

1696
01:11:14,846 --> 01:11:19,017
[Minuk] I don't think there's anyone
who can beat him here.

1697
01:11:19,084 --> 01:11:21,119
Honestly, I could die facing him.

1698
01:11:21,186 --> 01:11:22,788
[Juhyun]
Are they trying to kill us or what?

1699
01:11:22,854 --> 01:11:24,823
[Jaehyuk]
Now this is a literal deathmatch.

1700
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:28,493
[Minsung] But there's no one in there
who can take him on.

1701
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,028
[Seungjun] But you never know up there.

1702
01:11:30,095 --> 01:11:31,363
Everything can flip.

1703
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,733
The fighter facing Myung Hyunman is…

1704
01:11:38,236 --> 01:11:39,905
I think I know who it is.

1705
01:11:40,739 --> 01:11:42,307
[Yunchan] I think he knows it too.

1706
01:11:43,275 --> 01:11:45,110
He knows he's the only one
who can face him.

1707
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:48,213
[Lee] The fighter facing Myung Hyunman is…

1708
01:11:50,148 --> 01:11:51,350
Julien Kang.

1709
01:11:51,416 --> 01:11:52,684
[contestants exclaim]

1710
01:11:52,751 --> 01:11:54,219
[Youngho] Man, I knew it.

1711
01:11:54,286 --> 01:11:57,589
-[applause]
-[contestants exclaiming]

1712
01:11:58,390 --> 01:11:59,591
This is it!

1713
01:11:59,658 --> 01:12:01,093
Let's go, let's go!

1714
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:03,095
[Hyunjae] Wow, look at those shoulders.

1715
01:12:03,161 --> 01:12:04,596
[Chaehyun] He really is huge.

1716
01:12:04,663 --> 01:12:05,931
[Haengseok] He's massive.

1717
01:12:05,997 --> 01:12:07,466
[Minsung]
It's like the battle of the giants.

1718
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:09,067
[Chaehyun] It's a giant versus a giant.

1719
01:12:09,134 --> 01:12:11,069
[Ohgon]
Shouldn't there be two referees for this?

1720
01:12:11,136 --> 01:12:12,604
Boy, why am I shaking?

1721
01:12:13,071 --> 01:12:15,173
Feels like a knockout is coming.

1722
01:12:16,308 --> 01:12:17,542
[Minsung] I can't picture it.

1723
01:12:17,609 --> 01:12:20,145
[♪ energetic music playing]

1724
01:12:20,212 --> 01:12:22,047
[Youngho] Everyone would definitely
want to see this.

1725
01:12:22,114 --> 01:12:24,716
This is the kind of matchup
you only dream about.

1726
01:12:24,783 --> 01:12:26,718
And now, we actually get to see it.

1727
01:12:27,119 --> 01:12:28,220
MYUNG HYUNMAN

1728
01:12:28,286 --> 01:12:30,555
[Lee] Hyunman is about 16 kg heavier,

1729
01:12:31,356 --> 01:12:33,625
but Julien has a 12 cm reach advantage.

1730
01:12:33,692 --> 01:12:34,693
JULIEN KANG

1731
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:38,630
That kind of reach gap
is basically bigger than a full fist.

1732
01:12:38,697 --> 01:12:40,932
But with heavyweights, you never know.

1733
01:12:40,999 --> 01:12:43,168
Just as single shot could end everything.

1734
01:12:43,835 --> 01:12:45,170
It can go either way.

1735
01:12:45,237 --> 01:12:46,738
[Donghoe] Really can't predict a thing.

1736
01:12:47,205 --> 01:12:49,207
[Seungjun]
This bout already feels heavier.

1737
01:12:49,274 --> 01:12:51,243
[Dongeon] With their weight class and all.

1738
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:54,413
-I bet there will be a knockdown.
-For sure.

1739
01:12:55,013 --> 01:12:56,815
[Hyunjae] But with that kind of body,

1740
01:12:56,882 --> 01:12:58,450
Julien Kang won't get hit easily.

1741
01:13:01,186 --> 01:13:04,089
[Kang] <i>Honestly, I thought</i>
<i>I had a real chance of winning.</i>

1742
01:13:04,156 --> 01:13:06,825
I thought if I just do what I do
in practice every day,

1743
01:13:07,325 --> 01:13:09,394
I could definitely win.

1744
01:13:09,461 --> 01:13:12,364
<i>There's no going back now.</i>

1745
01:13:12,864 --> 01:13:15,600
<i>I have to be the one to move up this time.</i>

1746
01:13:16,134 --> 01:13:19,271
[Hyunman] <i>I was like, "Guess I'm going up</i>
<i>against the top celebrity fighter."</i>

1747
01:13:19,805 --> 01:13:22,574
He's got amazing athleticism
and combat instinct,

1748
01:13:22,641 --> 01:13:23,975
but he's not a pro.

1749
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:26,445
So I thought I'd better
finish him off fast and move on.

1750
01:13:26,912 --> 01:13:30,015
<i>I really felt like I could drop him,</i>
<i>or maybe even KO him.</i>

1751
01:13:30,482 --> 01:13:32,117
[Taesun]
My heart's pounding just watching this.

1752
01:13:34,252 --> 01:13:36,988
[Lee] All right, this is set
to be a fantastic bout.

1753
01:13:37,522 --> 01:13:39,124
-Box!
-[bell dings]

1754
01:13:39,191 --> 01:13:40,759
[Dex] Let's go!

1755

-[bell dings]
-Let's go!

1756
01:13:43,428 --> 01:13:47,532
JULIEN X HYUNMAN

1757
01:13:47,599 --> 01:13:48,934
[Jongkook] They're treading carefully.

1758
01:13:49,568 --> 01:13:50,702
Throw the jab!

1759
01:13:51,236 --> 01:13:52,337
The jab!

1760
01:13:54,206 --> 01:13:55,674
Break it up!

1761
01:13:57,576 --> 01:13:58,677
Break it up!

1762
01:14:01,146 --> 01:14:02,681
[Jongkook] Oh, he got him! He got him.

1763
01:14:03,181 --> 01:14:05,383
[Lee] Julien Kang's got serious power
behind his shots.

1764
01:14:05,884 --> 01:14:07,118
Damn…

1765
01:14:07,185 --> 01:14:09,588
Julien Kang keeps driving
those long shots in.

1766
01:14:12,924 --> 01:14:13,992
[O3ohn] Going for one big shot.

1767
01:14:14,626 --> 01:14:16,461
[Dex] A punch like that could kill you.

1768
01:14:17,562 --> 01:14:19,831
-I think they're pretty evenly--
-[contestants gasp]

1769
01:14:19,898 --> 01:14:21,366
He got hit? Whoa!

1770
01:14:21,933 --> 01:14:23,735

Down, down, down!

1775

He's down!

1776
01:14:41,319 --> 01:14:42,821
[Sungmin] <i>I never saw that coming.</i>

1777
01:14:42,888 --> 01:14:44,389
[Junseo] <i>Wow, this is insane.</i>

1778
01:14:44,456 --> 01:14:46,625
[Taesun] <i>Boxing in an arena like that?</i>

1779
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,326
-[Juyeong] Wait, what?
-Huh?

1780
01:14:48,393 --> 01:14:50,028

<i>Three rings.</i>

[Lee] <i>I really can't tell.</i>

Bring it on!

1787
01:15:02,007 --> 01:15:03,508
He's got to go in.

1788
01:15:04,142 --> 01:15:06,044
-[Minsung] That's it!
-[Sungmin] You're almost there!

1789
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,546
You gotta go for it!
