[narrator] <i>The winner of</i> I Am Boxer

00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:28,237
<i>and a top-of-the-line flagship SUV.</i>

3
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,642
[Lee] The quarterfinals of <i>I Am Boxer</i>.

4
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,078
Each bout consists
of six three-minute rounds.

5
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:39,315
[Seungheon] The first match prepared today
is between Kuk Seungjun and Kim Hyunjun.

6
00:00:39,382 --> 00:00:40,616
[Jongkook] He's going a bit out-boxer.

7
00:00:40,683 --> 00:00:43,152
Now that the ring is big,
he's showing more movement.

8
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:44,487
[Seungheon] Excellent uppercut!

9
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:47,356
-[Jonghoon] Okay, nice body shot!
-[Seungheon groans]

10
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,724
Whoa, that landed.

11
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,093
[Gyuwon] They're pushing to end it here!

12
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,828
[Lee] It's the last one,
so they're going all in.

13
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:53,062
[Seungheon] There isn't much time left!

14
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:54,664
-Kuk is working the body!
-[bell rings]

15
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,933
The bout has officially ended!

[Lee] The winner is Kuk Seungjun.

17
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,471
Let the second bout begin!

[Dex] Entering from the blue corner,
Pretty Boy, Cho Hyunjae!

[Jongkook] Entering from the red corner,
Blaze, Yuk Junseo!

Let's go!

21
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:11,114
Man, this one's hard to tell.

22
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:15,585
YUK JUNSEO X CHO HYUNJAE

23
00:01:19,522 --> 00:01:21,557
Next up is the second quarterfinal bout.

24
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:23,292
Yuk Junseo versus Cho Hyunjae.

25
00:01:26,262 --> 00:01:31,167
Considered one of the top elite boxers,
here's Cho Hyunjae getting warmed up!

26
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:37,507
Facing him is Yuk Junseo,
showing confidence and constant growth!

27
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:39,275
[spectator] Let's go, Yuk Junseo!

28
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:40,643
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

29
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,646
They're nearly identical physically.

30
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:46,682
This is gonna be wild.

31
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:49,685
Before the bout,
let's hear from both fighters.

32
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:53,389
Today, I'll show you
what elite boxing really looks like.

33
00:01:53,456 --> 00:01:55,525
And Yuk Junseo,

34
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,493
I know you like your slugfests.

35
00:01:58,427 --> 00:02:00,496
But today,
you're just going to be taking shots,

36
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:02,465
-so keep your guard up tight.
-[crowd clamors]

37
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:05,101
[spectator] Way to go!

38
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:10,840
The trunks I'm wearing right now are red.

39
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,942
By the end of this,

40
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:15,611
you won't know
if that's the original color or blood.

41
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,246
I'll turn this into a bloodbath.

42
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:18,648
That's intimidating.

43
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:21,317
Man, this one's going to be fun.

44
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:23,486
These two have fought before,

45
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:25,488
though it was three-way.
They know what's coming.

46
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:28,090
[grunting]

47
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:38,167
[Lee] The survivor of this match
is Cho Hyunjae.

48
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:41,804
[Hyunjae] <i>After clashing</i>
<i>in the last fight,</i>

49
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,206
I've got him all figured out.

50
00:02:43,806 --> 00:02:46,842
[Lee] In the blue corner,
Pretty Boy, Cho Hyunjae.

51
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:50,046
In the red corner, Blaze, Yuk Junseo.

52
00:02:54,317 --> 00:02:56,185
[Hyunjae] <i>The moment I heard</i>
<i>my opponent's name,</i>

53
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:58,688
I thought, "Yeah, I've got this."

54
00:02:58,754 --> 00:03:02,925
<i>When I fought Cho Hyunjae last time,</i>
<i>he was a really tough matchup for me.</i>

55
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:04,860
But I've been through him once,

56
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:06,862
so I know what to prepare for now.

57
00:03:10,132 --> 00:03:13,236
<i>To learn how to control</i>
<i>the pace of a fight,</i>

58
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:15,071
<i>I brought in Kim Sangwook,</i>

59
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,506
<i>an MMA fighter</i>

60
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:19,475
<i>with a strong understanding of boxing.</i>

61
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:20,710
KIM SANGWOOK
EX-UDT MMA FIGHTER

62
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:23,713
I've fought him before.

63
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:25,314
He's not an easy opponent at all.

64
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:26,782
I could barely

65
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:28,884
land any clean shots.

66
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,722
<i>Cho Hyunjae's strengths are</i>
<i>his polished technique,</i>

67
00:03:32,788 --> 00:03:37,126
<i>fast footwork, sharp ring IQ, and speed.</i>

68
00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:38,394
[participant] All right!

69
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:40,363
Your game plan has to be pressure.

70
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,565
You've got to come in big
and just stick to him.

71
00:03:42,632 --> 00:03:44,467
Keep it short and constant.

72
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:47,169
From here,
he's probably gonna try to escape.

73
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:48,337
Then you stay on him.

74
00:03:48,404 --> 00:03:49,872
Say he slides to the side.

75
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:50,940
That's it.

76
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:53,175
You have to keep it ugly.

77
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:55,611
He's a competitive boxer,

78
00:03:55,678 --> 00:03:58,214
so if you try to fight clean,
you'll never win.

79
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,583
You have to stay on him and wear him down.

80
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,251
[Junseo] <i>This time,</i>

81
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:04,754
<i>I'll step in first, run the fight…</i>

82
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:09,959
<i>and I'll make it ugly</i>
<i>to the point it feels excessive.</i>

83
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,229
YUK JUNSEO

84
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:15,798
<i>The plan is to drag him into a mud fight</i>

85
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,302
and try to take the win.

86
00:04:19,368 --> 00:04:22,038
I'll admit Yuk Junseo is strong.

87
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:24,774
How's Yuk Junseo? He good?

88
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,542
Just raw power.

89
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:28,744
So how do you deal with that?
When he throws,

90
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:29,912
back up quick, then ba-bam!

91
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,947
Punch like this. Pow!

92
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:33,249
Bam! Just like this.

93
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,586
I'll use my speed and conditioning

94
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,288
<i>to keep moving,</i>

95
00:04:39,355 --> 00:04:41,123
<i>draw him in with feints,</i>

96
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:43,793
<i>drain his stamina as much as possible,</i>

97
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:46,162
<i>and stay in control of the fight.</i>

98
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:48,097
CHO HYUNJAE

99
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,934
[Junseo] <i>Whether someone's a pro or not…</i>

100
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,537
<i>Background means nothing to me.</i>

101
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:00,943
<i>Boxer to boxer,</i>

102
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:03,679
<i>I'm focused only on my opponent.</i>

[Hyunjae] <i>I've been boxing for 11 years.</i>

104
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:13,889
<i>My boxing IQ is on a different level.</i>

105
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:18,794
<i>I'll show that those years</i>
<i>of boxing weren't for nothing.</i>

[spectators] Let's go!

108
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,672
-He just needs to stay calm.
-What?

109
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:31,173
He needs to stay calm.

110
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,275
This is gonna break
my mom's heart. [laughs]

111

YUK JUNSEO'S BROTHER

112
00:05:34,477 --> 00:05:37,313
Bell rings, you keep the lead hand active.

113
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,582
Throw some feints
and see how he comes in, okay?

114
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:42,151
Wait, the fringe is gonna cause friction.

115
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:44,487
Who knows what'll happen? You never know.

116
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,822
Cho Hyunjae's got great technique.

117
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,225
The question is
how effective Junseo's pressure will be.

118
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:51,360
-If he sneaks one in… Yeah.
-That could be trouble.

119
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,829
Hyunjae might get shaken by that.

120
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,399
-Exactly. That's how you lose your rhythm.
-He might.

121
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:58,634
The quarterfinals of<i> I Am Boxer</i>.

122
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,538

[Seungheon] The first round has begun.

YUK JUNSEO X CHO HYUNJAE

127
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:17,520
Cho Hyunjae starts with light punches.

128
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,522
Nice shot from Yuk Junseo!

129
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,923
-There it is.
-See that?

130
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,792
You can't avoid every punch.

131
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:28,063
[Junseo] <i>I threw a jab pretty early on,</i>
<i>and he got hit.</i>

132
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:30,699
<i>That's when I realized,</i>

133
00:06:31,634 --> 00:06:33,602
<i>it might not be impossible after all.</i>

134
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,704
[spectators exclaim]

135
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:41,210
[Seungheon] He landed a heavy straight
with that lead hand.

136
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:46,382
[Lee] I bet Cho Hyunjae's
feeling the weight.

137
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:48,684
[Jongkook] He's probably never felt
shots like that before.

138
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:50,453
[Dex] Right, he throws with raw power.

139
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:52,988
-It's all instinct, you know.
-Stop.

140
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:56,859
[brother] Hyunjae, use your footwork.

141
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,727
No holding.

142
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,763
[Hyunjae] <i>I was a bit caught off guard.</i>

143
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,798
-[in English] Box!
-[♪ tense music playing]

144
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:05,668
[Hyunjae] <i>I'd fought him before,</i>
<i>so I thought I had a read on his style,</i>

145
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:09,672
<i>but he opened</i>
<i>with a completely different approach.</i>

146
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:11,006
<i>That caught me off guard.</i>

147
00:07:12,575 --> 00:07:17,413
[Junseo] <i>I plan to be really aggressive</i>
<i>in the clinch.</i>

148
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,416
That kind of grabbing
should really rattle him up.

149
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:23,385
[spectator 1] Nice,
he's pretty tense right now!

150
00:07:24,286 --> 00:07:26,255
[spectator 2]
That's it! Trade shots like that!

151
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:28,924
[Seungheon] Coming in, Yuk Junseo.

152
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:32,928
-Nice!
-That's it!

153
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:36,298
[spectator 3] All right! Doing good!

154
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:38,534
All right! Doing good!

155
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,103
[Lee] Counters like that.

156
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,273
-They're big if you walk into them.
-Exactly.

157
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,374
Nice shot!

158
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:46,909
[ref] Break it up!

159
00:07:50,246 --> 00:07:52,448
[Seungheon] Nice uppercut!
Right back with one to the face!

160
00:07:56,118 --> 00:07:57,887
[Gyuwon] After Yuk Junseo
took that one shot,

161
00:07:57,953 --> 00:07:59,421
he's struggling to find his range.

162
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:01,624
That's right!
And that's when you need composure.

163
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:05,728
[spectator] Yes, a big left!

164
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:07,129
Ah…

00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:10,165
[judges groan]

166
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,167
[Lee] He took a big shot there.

167
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:13,702
-[coach] Guard up!
-That's right!

168
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:15,905
[Seungheon]
Yuk's holding his own right now!

169
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,341
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

170
00:08:19,408 --> 00:08:21,110
-Guard up, man!
-Ten seconds!

171
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:23,679
Round's almost done! It's almost over!

172
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,114
Don't forget to breathe!

173
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:26,916
[spectator] Stay on him!

174
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:31,220
-[bell rings]
-[in English] Stop!

175
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,389
[Seungheon]
That's the end of the first round.

176
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,692
[spectator] You got this!

177
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,562
[Seungheon] Cho Hyunjae showed us
some fantastic footwork there.

178
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:42,231
We didn't get to see
too many of those, though.

179
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:45,834
But we definitely got a good look at
what kind of talent Yuk Junseo has.

180
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,136
That was the first round.

181
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,672
Cho Hyunjae looked a bit rattled early on,

182
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,441
but toward the end,
he seemed to have found his rhythm.

183
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:55,411
Those uppercuts came in, "bam, bam, bam."

184
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:57,546
-And they all landed clean.
-Right.

185
00:08:58,113 --> 00:09:00,082
-[spectator 1] That's it!
-[spectator 2] Guard up, guard up!

186
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:02,084
[spectator] Yes, a big left!

187
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:06,455
Breaking Hyunjae down
might be tougher than expected.

188
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:09,959
At this point, you're just hoping
one big shot gets through.

189
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:11,660
You're doing awesome, man.

190
00:09:11,727 --> 00:09:12,728
Awesome.

191
00:09:12,795 --> 00:09:14,396
You're not flustered. He is.

192
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:17,032
But just keep one thing in mind.

193
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,133
Keep the left hand up.

194
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,935
You keep dropping it and getting hit here.

195
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:22,504
You've actually got
better straights than him.

196
00:09:23,706 --> 00:09:25,207
Good job. You did good, but--

197
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,810
-I'm tensing up?
-Yeah, you can't tense up too much.

198
00:09:27,876 --> 00:09:29,378
And always connect it to the left.

199
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,513
He's eating them all up right now.

200
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,149
Just do your thing.
Clean and sharp, pop-pop.

201
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:35,718
-Try it like that.
-Nice and easy?

202
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,986
Yeah, nice and easy.

203
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:40,189
Let's go, Hyunjae!

204
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:42,691
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

205
00:09:43,892 --> 00:09:45,828
[Seungheon] Let's see how
the second round unfolds.

206
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:47,997
YUK JUNSEO X CHO HYUNJAE

207
00:09:48,063 --> 00:09:49,064
-[in English] Box!
-[bell chimes]

208
00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:51,667
[spectator, in Korean] Let's go!

209
00:09:51,734 --> 00:09:53,168
Good start with the left.

210
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:54,970
Keep that left coming!

211
00:09:55,604 --> 00:09:56,972
[Jongkook] Yes, he has to go for it.

212
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,707
-[spectator] Come on, pop-pop!
-That's it!

213
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,979
[Seungheon] Cho's finding his rhythm,
slowly stepping inside.

214
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:06,482
[spectator] Keep moving! Don't stop!

215
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:08,484
Right hook! Go, go!

216
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:11,787
That's super scary. His right hand.

217
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:14,790
[Lee] He's getting figured out now.

218
00:10:14,857 --> 00:10:16,925
His straights are getting read.

219
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,129
[Hyunjae] I felt like I had a slight edge,
so from then on,

220
00:10:20,195 --> 00:10:22,064
I knew it was my pace.

221
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:23,766
[spectator] Okay, nice!

222
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:26,735
[Seungheon] Cho drops the guard
and uses his upper body to slip away!

223
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:29,138
-Guard up!
-Guard up!

224
00:10:29,938 --> 00:10:32,541
-Your footwork! Go now!
-[Hyunjae] <i>I wanted to fight smart,</i>

225
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:33,942
<i>so I dropped my guard</i>

226
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,512
<i>and tried to make it my kind of fight.</i>

227
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:38,747
[Dex] Now you've gotta fight on instinct.

228
00:10:44,787 --> 00:10:45,788
[spectators] All right!

229
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,223
[Gyuwon] That cross-upper-cross
was wonderful!

230
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:50,659
[spectator] Slip it all the way!

231
00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:54,196
[Dex] You can really see the difference
an elite boxer makes.

232
00:10:54,263 --> 00:10:57,833
-Even among them, Hyunjae stands out.
-[Lee] Right, he's a cut above the rest.

233
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,601
[spectators] All right!

234
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:04,973
I feel like we might see a knockdown.

235
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,408
This is getting fun.

236
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:08,544
-[ref] Break!
-[spectator] Keep going!

237
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,611
Nice, Hyunjae!

238
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:13,782
Keep them coming!

239
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,086
[Seungheon] Yuk Junseo,
now carefully putting up his guard.

240
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:21,657
-[Lee] That right hand's all Junseo's got.
-[Jongkook] You're right.

241
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,025
[coach] Guard up!

242
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,527
[Dex] He just needs
to drive it in with power.

243
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:26,862
It all depends on that one shot.

244
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:28,630
Don't give up!

245
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:30,232
Let's go, Junseo!

246
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:33,802
[coach] Let's go! One more time!

247
00:11:34,303 --> 00:11:36,138
-He's not gonna get caught.
-[Lee] Hmm.

248
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:37,639
-[exclaims]
-[exclaims]

249
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:39,508
Wait, he got caught? For real?

250
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:45,380
[Seungheon] Whoa!
It's a clean shot from Yuk Junseo!

251
00:11:45,447 --> 00:11:46,582
[exclaims]

252
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:52,654
[spectators clamor]

253
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:01,396
That's it, he's down!

254
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:02,464
[exclaims]

255
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:05,434
Ha, ha, ha. See, I told you!

256
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:09,071
[Gyuwon] Yuk Junseo snapped off
an explosive straight!

257
00:12:09,138 --> 00:12:10,739
Lightning fast,

258
00:12:10,806 --> 00:12:13,408
with monstrous power! That's amazing!

259
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:17,813
Everyone knows I've got heavy hands.

260
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,081
You've all seen it.

261
00:12:19,148 --> 00:12:21,483
<i>That's how I managed to get one knockdown.</i>

262
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,051
[coach] That's it! Well done!

263
00:12:24,353 --> 00:12:26,221
CHO HYUNJAE DOWN

264
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:29,091
-[in English] Two, three…
-[in Korean] Deep breaths, deep breaths!

265
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,027
That's his money shot!

266
00:12:32,094 --> 00:12:33,729
You mess around, and you get caught.

267
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,531
[Dex] He walked right into that one.

268
00:12:35,597 --> 00:12:39,568
That's the biggest problem
when you don't keep your guard up!

269
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,370
That's the wild card with Yuk Junseo!

270
00:12:41,436 --> 00:12:43,372
He's got excellent moves.

271
00:12:45,207 --> 00:12:46,308
This is frustrating.

272
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,878
[Hyunjae]
<i>I blinked, and next thing I knew,</i>

273
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:51,480
<i>I was sitting on the canvas.</i>

274
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:53,215
<i>First off, I was really rattled.</i>

275
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:54,750
<i>But I knew</i>

276
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:58,120
<i>I couldn't let my opponent see that.</i>

277
00:12:58,187 --> 00:12:59,521
<i>It's still early in the fight.</i>

278
00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:00,889
<i>Reset. Start again.</i>

279
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:02,658
[in English] Seven, eight!

280
00:13:02,724 --> 00:13:03,992
[in Korean] You okay? Come on.

281
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:07,362
[in English] Box!

282
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:09,398
[Gyuwon, in Korean]
This could be Yuk Junseo's moment.

283
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,601
-[coach] Guard up!
-[Lee] This could get bad.

284
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:14,436
Just keep going!

285
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,071
Yes, now back it up!

286
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:19,508
[Gyuwon] Now that Cho's taken damage,
Yuk Junseo's raw power

287
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:21,243
can change everything!

288
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,045
Yuk Junseo's out for revenge now!

289
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,282
Great! Yeah!

290
00:13:28,984 --> 00:13:30,819
YUK JUNSEO X CHO HYUNJAE

291
00:13:31,386 --> 00:13:33,188
[Dex] He's got momentum now.

292
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:35,357
His style's coming through.

293
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:40,596
[in English] Stop!

294
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:42,364
[Seungheon, in Korean]
That concludes the round! Oh!

295
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:45,300
That round was all
about Yuk's one big shot!

296
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,736
This round showed
exactly why boxing is a sport

297
00:13:47,803 --> 00:13:49,771
where even a one-percent chance matters!

298
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:51,340
Yuk answered it with his fists!

299
00:13:51,406 --> 00:13:53,408
[coach] You took this round.
Really well done.

300
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:55,878
Can you believe this?

301
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:59,248
I mean,
dropping an elite fighter like that…

302
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:02,951
[Lee] Hyunjae's probably never
faced someone this violent before.

303
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:05,020
Damn it.

304
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:07,122
[coach] Don't worry about it. You're fine.

305
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:08,457
This is good.

306
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:11,360
Just remember to mix in
those tap-taps, and slip-and-rips.

307
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:13,996
Use what you're good at, got it?

308
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,565
[Hyunjae] <i>I was a bit bothered.</i>

309
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:18,667
[coach] That's it!

310
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:23,472
[Hyunjae] <i>The moment I went down,</i>
<i>I locked eyes with my mom.</i>

311
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:25,908
<i>But it felt like she wasn't looking at me,</i>

312
00:14:25,974 --> 00:14:28,477
<i>just all the cuts on my face.</i>

313
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,880
I'd never been knocked down
in front of her before.

314
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:36,385
<i>That's when I decided</i>
<i>I wouldn't embarrass her again.</i>

315
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:38,287
<i>I was going to give everything I had.</i>

316
00:14:38,353 --> 00:14:39,721
[yells]

317
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:41,323
[father] Let's go, Hyunjae!

318
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,824
Slowly, loosen up, boy.

319
00:14:43,492 --> 00:14:45,193
YUK JUNSEO X CHO HYUNJAE

320
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,562
-Box!
-And we move into the third round!

321
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:51,300
BOXING SCORE CARD
YUK: 19, CHO: 18

322
00:14:54,202 --> 00:14:55,304
Nice shot!

323
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,673
He's totally found his rhythm.
This is bad.

324
00:14:58,674 --> 00:15:00,542
[Seungheon] Both exchange sharp punches.

325
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,514
[coach] You've got him rattled!

326
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,683
[Seungheon] Yuk lands clean
and pours on the pressure!

327
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:15,490
When it comes to aggression,
he's absolutely top-tier.

328
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:18,160
Probably the first time
Hyunjae's dealt with someone like that.

329
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,797
[Dex] Yuk Junseo's
turned this into a brawl.

330
00:15:21,863 --> 00:15:23,632
[Lee] Junseo's got that brawler instinct.

331
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:26,234
That's why this fight's so hard to read.

332
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,073
Hyunjae, slow it down!

333
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,140
[in English] Box!

334
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,509
[Lee, in Korean]
He needs to get back to his footwork.

335
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,579
[Seungheon] Nice left jab.

336
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:43,285
What? Why's he eating those jabs?

337
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,153
[coach] All right!

338
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:47,656
All right!

339
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:51,727
[Junseo] <i>I kept fighting aggressively,</i>

340
00:15:51,793 --> 00:15:53,462
<i>using what I'd learned.</i>

341
00:15:56,398 --> 00:15:58,767
<i>The plan was to drag him into a mud fight</i>

342
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,803
<i>and neutralize his offense.</i>

343
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,439
Keep it dirty, man!

344
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,242
People think clinching and hitting
is a foul,

345
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:10,612
-but until the ref steps in, it's fine.
-Right, doesn't matter until then.

346
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:15,784
[Gyuwon] That follow-up attack
that's coming in again and again,

347
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,319
that's the scariest part!

348
00:16:17,386 --> 00:16:20,622
Like a predator on the hunt,
he overwhelms his prey completely!

349
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,793
-Yes, that's it! All right! Keep going!
-That's great!

350
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,894
This is insane!

351
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,235
-[Lee] I don't know anymore.
-[Jongkook] Right.

352
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:34,369
Really can't predict a thing.

353
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:38,073
-Stop!
-[Seungheon] That concludes this round!

354
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:46,248
-What round are we in?
-We've just finished the third round.

355
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:47,315
You're doing amazing.

356
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,152
Is he winning?

357
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:52,721
-It's okay.
-Am I not hitting clean?

358
00:16:52,788 --> 00:16:54,489
No, but just don't force it.

359
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:55,557
Just keep this up.

360
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:58,693
[Lee] I thought Cho Hyunjae
would dominate this, but I was wrong.

361
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,895
-[Jongkook] Same here.
-Right.

362
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:02,364
-That's what's surprising.
-Yeah, real surprising.

363
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:04,566
I mean, that's boxing for you.

364
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:08,003
-You never know how it's gonna turn out.
-Right, right.

365
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,540
As fighters enter the fourth round,

366
00:17:11,606 --> 00:17:14,643
we often see them shift their gears.

367
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,045
Let's see
how that plays out for these two.

368
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:18,447
Round 4 is underway.

369
00:17:20,015 --> 00:17:21,349
[spectator] Let's go, Hyunjae!

370
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:26,888
Let's go, Junseo!

371
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:28,623
YUK JUNSEO X CHO HYUNJAE

372
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,559
-[Seungheon] The fourth round has started.
-Box!

373
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:34,830
Yuk charges in!

374
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:37,299
See? Even that jab's finding its mark.

375
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,636
[coach] Keep going!

376
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:44,039
[Seungheon] All right!
Yuk Junseo with the right hand!

377
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,607
[exclaiming]

378
00:17:45,674 --> 00:17:47,542
That's it! Let's go!

379
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,785
[in English] Stop!

380
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,422
-[in Korean] Damn it!
-Hey, it's okay!

381
00:18:00,489 --> 00:18:02,824
[Seungheon] Yuk is wearing Cho down
with sheer roughhouse tactics.

382
00:18:02,891 --> 00:18:05,060
This highlights
the importance of roughhousing.

383
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:07,662
[Dex] Hyunjae, don't let it get to you!

384
00:18:08,263 --> 00:18:09,731
Don't get rattled! Play along!

385
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:12,567
-Go to the body.
-Just have fun with it! Dance!

386
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,136
Box!

387
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,071
[Hyunjae] <i>Since he kept clinching,</i>

388
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:19,174
<i>I figured I'd use my footwork</i>
<i>more effectively</i>

389
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:20,475
<i>and make this my stage.</i>

390
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:23,979
[father] That's it!

391
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:29,184
[Seungheon]
Cho Hyunjae lands a combination!

392
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:31,786
Cho Hyunjae, the speedster,

393
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:34,322
it's about time
he brought out his star quality.

394
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,761
That's it!

395
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,329
Oh, he's angry now.

396
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:42,831
Play along!

397
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:47,936
[Lee] Right now, Cho Hyunjae

398
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:51,339
needs to draw him in with light jabs
and then counter.

399
00:18:51,406 --> 00:18:52,407
Just like that!

400
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,042
Touch with the jab.

401
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,245
Then counter, yes.

402
00:18:58,146 --> 00:19:00,649
-Look at that.
-He's controlling the distance now.

403
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:04,686
-[spectator 1] That's it!
-[spectator 2] Keep going! Follow through!

404
00:19:05,654 --> 00:19:06,821
[father] You have to chase him!

405
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,995
Junseo! If you're tired, clinch up!

406
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:17,666
[Gyuwon] This is Round 4 now,

407
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:20,235
and this may be the breaking point
for Yuk Junseo.

408
00:19:20,302 --> 00:19:21,903
His stamina's taken a big hit.

409
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,472
[spectators] Doing good, Hyunjae!
Keep it up, Hyunjae!

410
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:26,441
[exclaims]

411
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:27,509
Big one!

412
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:33,114
[Junseo]
<i>I suddenly felt my stamina give out.</i>

413
00:19:34,616 --> 00:19:38,019
I could feel my breathing getting ragged.

414
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:41,156
[spectator] That's it!

415
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:45,627
[Hyunjae] <i>When Yuk Junseo still had gas,</i>
<i>I couldn't see it.</i>

416
00:19:45,694 --> 00:19:47,929
<i>But once his stamina dipped,</i>

417
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:52,167
<i>openings began to appear.</i>

418
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,603
[coach] That's it! Last push!

419
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:58,873
Whoa, he's feeling it!

420
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,976
[Seungheon] A big left!

421
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:02,777
Cho lands amazing multiples!

422
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:04,446
[coach] Stay sharp, stay sharp!

423
00:20:04,512 --> 00:20:08,183
[Gyuwon] Cho Hyunjae is controlling
the rhythm on the ring right now!

424
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,819
[Seungheon] All right, nice body shot.
Cho goes back to the body again.

425
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:15,423
[Jongkook] Yuk Junseo looks gassed.

426
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:17,392
Junseo, keep your eyes open!

427
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:19,628
[spectator] Yes, that's it!

428
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,299
That's it! There you go!

429
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:25,800
[Lee] This looks dangerous.

430
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:30,972
[in English] Stop!

431
00:20:33,074 --> 00:20:35,710
[Gyuwon, in Korean]
This one-minute rest is huge

432
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,679
for both fighters.

433
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:40,282
If they don't catch their breath here,

434
00:20:40,348 --> 00:20:42,984
the fight could be decided
in the next round.

435
00:20:44,185 --> 00:20:46,254
Cho Hyunjae's back in the game now.

436
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:48,957
He took a hard beating,
and that snapped him back into it.

437
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:50,191
You're doing well.

438
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:53,962
[spectator] Let's go, Yuk Junseo!

439
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:56,264
-Let's go!
-You got this!

440
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,033
-Come on, let's go!
-Let's go!

441
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:59,267
You got this, Junseo!

442
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,703
Round 4 is done. Two more to go.

443
00:21:03,905 --> 00:21:06,408
[Junseo] <i>Every time I took a hit,</i>
<i>I could feel my stamina draining.</i>

444
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:11,813
<i>When the body combos came in,</i>
<i>it got hard to breathe.</i>

445
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:17,285
<i>But I went up there determined to win.</i>

446
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:19,587
<i>So I told myself I just had to endure.</i>

447
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:22,857
<i>Push through.</i>

448
00:21:26,027 --> 00:21:28,263
Leave it all in there!

449
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,531
Two rounds left, right?

450
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,400
BOXING SCORE CARD
YUK: 38, CHO: 37

451
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:33,968
-Box!
-[Seungheon] Round 5 kicks off!

452
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:35,036
You're doing awesome!

453
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:39,674
YUK JUNSEO X CHO HYUNJAE

454
00:21:40,642 --> 00:21:42,644
[Seungheon]
Cho Hyunjae throws sharp punches.

455
00:21:43,812 --> 00:21:46,681
Yuk Junseo comes in, aiming for the head!

456
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:50,585
Ooh.

457
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:53,488
Look at him go.
He's still got some strength left.

458
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,726
[spectator] That's it! Keep that up!

459
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,627
[Gyuwon] The fight's getting heated now.

460
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:02,197
This is a fascinating clash of styles.

461
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:05,400
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

462
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,403
You're doing great! It's okay!

463
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,938
Man, what a fun fight!

464
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:12,040
Who knew it'd be this entertaining?

465
00:22:14,642 --> 00:22:17,612
<i>I was able to read Yuk Junseo's rhythm,</i>

466
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,882
<i>and once I got used to how he comes in,</i>

467
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:24,018
<i>I started</i>
<i>adjusting my strategy accordingly.</i>

468
00:22:27,756 --> 00:22:29,657
Hey, stay focused!

469
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,595
Yuk fires, but Cho slips it easily.

470
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:36,264
Yuk Junseo closes in on him!

471
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:39,267
Cho works the ropes,
shifting side to side.

472
00:22:39,334 --> 00:22:41,236
But even in tight quarters, he slips.

473
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,304
Play with him! Yes!

474
00:22:44,606 --> 00:22:46,441
Once Hyunjae gets rolling,

475
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:48,009
nobody can stop him.

476
00:22:53,815 --> 00:22:55,650
I think he's about to do something now.

477
00:22:55,717 --> 00:22:56,751
Took him long enough.

478
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,525
Step forward!

479
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,626
Go to the body first!

480
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:22,944
Look at that unpredictable explosiveness!

481
00:23:23,511 --> 00:23:25,580
Cho Hyunjae won't like that at all.

482
00:23:25,647 --> 00:23:26,981
They usually come in like this,

483
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:28,283
-but he throws like this.
-Yes.

484
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:30,018
-It's confusing the poor boy.
-Exactly.

485
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,354
Go again, work the body first!

486
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:39,294
<i>My punches were starting to land</i>
<i>on Hyunjae's face.</i>

487
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:43,231
<i>That gave me a sliver of hope.</i>

488
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,801
<i>So I tried to put real impact</i>
<i>into every shot.</i>

489
00:23:49,537 --> 00:23:50,705
Hyunjae, right hand!

490
00:23:53,174 --> 00:23:56,544
That hunter instinct
is still alive in Yuk Junseo!

491
00:23:58,012 --> 00:24:01,449
-He's fighting on a one-percent chance.
-That's right.

492
00:24:01,516 --> 00:24:03,418
-And that one percent hit. It's insane.
-It did.

493
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:06,821
But Cho Hyunjae fires right back!

494
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,157
Don't give up!

495
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:10,825
That body shot landed!

496
00:24:10,892 --> 00:24:12,760
-That went in hard. He felt that.
-That landed.

497
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,295
That one sank in hard.

498
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:16,664
Hyunjae knows that too.

499
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:20,168
Another body shot connected.

500
00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:22,003
Yeah, he's really feeling it.

501
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,972
Right, he's doubled over.

502
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,174
Another body shot! He's doubling over!

503
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:28,877
The round's almost over,
and there have been dangerous body shots!

504
00:24:28,943 --> 00:24:31,279
You know you caught him, punk!
You caught him!

505
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:32,981
Grab and hold! Hang in there!

506
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,222
It's Cho Hyunjae's technique
versus Yuk Junseo's raw grit!

507
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:42,824
Now this is boxing.

508
00:24:47,228 --> 00:24:48,563
Come over here.

509
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:51,566

Keep your left hand up!

531

Yuk's taken the center,
hunting for the counter.

532

Junseo, step back! Step back, then fire!

533

but he's still holding on.

546
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:56,591
He's literally gasping for breath,

Junseo needs to keep his guard up.

550

Cho Hyunjae's footwork is picking up now.

551
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:11,305

556

The damage is adding up, so he clinches.

557
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:35,129
It's gotta be absolutely exhausting.

558
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,034
Yuk's still in it!

Still throwing lethal punches!

560
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:48,176
Meanwhile, Cho Hyunjae is doing everything
to finish this with his own hands.

561
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:50,211
I don't know how he's even standing.

He's amazing.

563

I won't say the thought of giving up
never crossed my mind.

569

Yuk Junseo is barely hanging on!

570
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,473
But still, he refuses to give up!

571
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,342

688
00:34:47,328 --> 00:34:49,130
"My man! My man!"

689
00:34:49,196 --> 00:34:50,197
"My man." [chuckles]

[crowd cheers]

692
00:35:05,613 --> 00:35:06,780
[Gijun] <i>As soon as I went up there,</i>

693
00:35:07,515 --> 00:35:10,217
<i>I could hear the roar of the crowd,</i>
<i>which felt great.</i>

694
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:14,288
<i>I knew then, "This is finally my chance."</i>

695
00:35:14,355 --> 00:35:16,423
"It's time to prove myself on stage."

696
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,658
I'm super excited.

697
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,029
<i>I'd wanted to box</i>
<i>ever since middle school.</i>

698
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:24,698
<i>Boxing was the only thing</i>
<i>I truly wanted to do.</i>

699
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:30,771
<i>But my biological mother</i>
<i>was against it at the time.</i>

700
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:33,507
<i>I really wanted to try,</i>
<i>but they just wouldn't let me.</i>

701
00:35:33,574 --> 00:35:35,176
So I asked my parents again,

702
00:35:35,242 --> 00:35:37,611
thinking it would be better
to learn boxing

703
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:40,648
than to waste time doing nothing.

704
00:35:41,448 --> 00:35:42,750
That's how I got into boxing.

705
00:35:43,217 --> 00:35:44,418
<i>It's been four years now.</i>

706
00:35:45,386 --> 00:35:48,289
<i>I currently train at Woosuk University.</i>

707
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:55,563
I'll show you the kind of boxing match
you don't usually see in Korea.

708
00:35:56,564 --> 00:36:00,134
[Jongkook] The fighter facing Lee Gijun
will now enter.

709
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:09,343

[Chaehyun] <i>Losing is not an option.</i>

717
00:37:00,361 --> 00:37:01,562
<i>I will win, no matter what.</i>

718
00:37:02,296 --> 00:37:04,898
As an athlete training with the KAFAC,

719
00:37:04,965 --> 00:37:06,433

-<i>I want to showcase my mental toughness…</i>

<i>…and physical endurance in this match.</i>

727
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,559
-Man, today's workout was brutal.
-Seriously, it was intense.

728
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:33,861
Let's perk up with this.

729
00:37:38,098 --> 00:37:39,767
-This tastes good.
-It's sugar-free.

730
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:40,901
[Chaehyun] For real?

731
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:44,405
-Quarterfinals, here we come.
-You got it.

732
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:50,611
[Chaehyun] <i>After making it this far,</i>
<i>I hate the thought of losing.</i>

733
00:37:51,512 --> 00:37:53,781
Without boxing,

734
00:37:53,847 --> 00:37:55,883
I wouldn't be where I am.

735
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:59,720
Boxing is… everything to me.

736
00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:01,288
It's my life.

737
00:38:01,355 --> 00:38:03,090
It really is my whole life.

738
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:05,859

LEE CHAEHYUN X LEE GIJUN

00:38:17,137 --> 00:38:19,573
These two are a great match physically.

742
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,874
-Right?
-Real great.

743
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:22,142
They're evenly matched.

-Let's go, Chaehyun!
-You got this!

765
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:24,772
[Jongkook] Before the matchup,
let's hear from both fighters.

766
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:27,775
Gijun, you all geared up for tonight?

767
00:39:29,243 --> 00:39:32,613
But I don't think any of that
is going to work on me.

768
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,015
[cheering]

769
00:39:37,284 --> 00:39:39,186
-That's the spirit!
-Well said, Son!

770
00:39:39,953 --> 00:39:42,156
Your ring name is "Prince," huh?

771
00:39:43,824 --> 00:39:46,693
Today, I'll send you home as a "Princess."

772
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:49,430
[cheering]

773
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:50,564
[chuckles]

774
00:39:52,132 --> 00:39:55,536
[Dex]
All right, fighters, prepare for the bout.

775
00:39:56,136 --> 00:40:00,374
Next up, the third quarterfinal bout,
Lee Chaehyun versus Lee Gijun.

776
00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:03,777
Lee Chaehyun is originally right-handed,

777
00:40:03,844 --> 00:40:05,412
but he switched to southpaw.

778
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:08,916
The constant variation
between the lead and rear hand

779
00:40:08,982 --> 00:40:11,285
will make him
especially intriguing to watch.

780
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:14,455
[Gyuwon] In terms of punching power,
Lee Chaehyun has a slight edge.

781
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:16,590
Lee Gijun holds the advantage

782
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:19,793
-in technique and rhythm.
-[Seungheon] That's right.

783
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:23,030
He could be the one
to set a new standard for ring rhythm.

784
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:27,067
He's physically gifted
and worth watching in so many ways.

785
00:40:27,668 --> 00:40:29,903
[Gyuwon]
That's why, in this matchup especially,

786
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,474
winning the distance battle early
will be key.

787
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:37,110
[Jongkook] Let the fight begin!

788
00:40:40,848 --> 00:40:42,883
[Lee] All right, southpaw versus orthodox.

789
00:40:44,384 --> 00:40:45,385
[in English] Box!

790
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:46,487
[bell rings]

791
00:40:46,553 --> 00:40:49,289
LEE CHAEHYUN X LEE GIJUN

792
00:40:49,356 --> 00:40:50,891
[Seungheon, in Korean]
And the first round begins.

793
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:55,195
Right away,
Lee Chaehyun extends the right hand.

794
00:40:55,262 --> 00:40:57,431
-[Lee] Both guys are good.
-[Jongkook] Right.

795
00:40:58,298 --> 00:40:59,533
Okay, nice!

796
00:41:00,601 --> 00:41:02,536
[Gyuwon]
Lee Chaehyun stepping inside like that,

797
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:05,739
it tells you he's looking
to slip and counter.

798
00:41:05,806 --> 00:41:08,942
[Chaehyun] <i>I tried to stay calm</i>
<i>and focus on controlling the distance.</i>

799
00:41:11,044 --> 00:41:12,212
You got this, Chaehyun!

800
00:41:14,414 --> 00:41:18,085
[Seungheon] They're trading slowly
with the lead hands.

801
00:41:20,787 --> 00:41:22,022
[Dex exclaims]

802
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:24,491
This early distance battle's important.

803
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:27,427
[Gyuwon] Lee Chaehyun is trying
to establish his rhythm,

804
00:41:27,494 --> 00:41:29,096
while Lee Gijun is

805
00:41:29,162 --> 00:41:31,298
watching for openings within that rhythm.

806
00:41:34,668 --> 00:41:36,770
[Jongkook]
How do you even close that distance?

807
00:41:38,005 --> 00:41:40,307
[Seungheon]
Lee Chaehyun strikes with his lead hand.

808
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:43,744
[spectator 1] His eyes are locked in.

809
00:41:47,848 --> 00:41:49,583
[spectator 2] Come on, you got this!

810
00:41:50,651 --> 00:41:52,352
[Seungheon]
Lee Chaehyun fires with his rear hand!

811
00:41:53,086 --> 00:41:57,190
[Gyuwon] That lead hand shot is what
got him that clean rear hand shot!

812
00:41:59,593 --> 00:42:03,797
When fighting a southpaw,
you have to take an extra step forward.

813
00:42:03,864 --> 00:42:05,198
They're farther out.

814
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:09,469
-Ten seconds!
-[Jongkook] First round's almost done.

815
00:42:10,637 --> 00:42:12,639
[Lee] Gijun is clearly feeling things out.

816
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,708
He's doing a proper feel-out.

817
00:42:15,676 --> 00:42:17,744
[Seungheon] He targets the body once,
then comes back upstairs again.

818
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:20,447
-[bell rings]
-And that concludes the first round.

819
00:42:20,514 --> 00:42:23,784
[Gyuwon] The timing battle
between these two was fierce!

820
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:27,387
Most of all,
it's a fierce battle for range and timing.

821
00:42:28,622 --> 00:42:31,625
[Dex] Gijun's not even sitting down.
Guess his tank's still full.

822
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:34,094
He throws that jab around a lot.

823
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:35,495
When he does, you've gotta strike.

824
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:38,432
[Gijun] <i>Due to Lee Chaehyun's speed,</i>

825
00:42:38,498 --> 00:42:41,268
<i>it wasn't easy</i>
<i>to get the proper distance down.</i>

826
00:42:43,337 --> 00:42:44,972
[Chaehyun] <i>I've got the speed.</i>

827
00:42:45,038 --> 00:42:47,608
<i>As long as I keep my range and angles,</i>
<i>I should be fine.</i>

[spectator] Let's go!

832
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:59,586
[Seungheon]
With a southpaw versus orthodox matchup,

833
00:42:59,653 --> 00:43:02,990
that previous round for distance
was tough on both sides.

834

[Seungheon] The second round begins.

837
00:43:08,562 --> 00:43:11,198
How will Lee Gijun break through
Lee Chaehyun's solid boxing?

838
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:12,399
[spectator] Let's go, Lee Chaehyun!

842
00:43:20,674 --> 00:43:21,975
[Seungheon] Big right hand coming in.

843
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:23,744
Ooh!

844
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,412
[Lee] Boy, he caught a heavy one.

845
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,715
[Gyuwon] He dipped low
and fired that straight right away!

846
00:43:28,782 --> 00:43:32,052
Yes, that's why
Gijun's counter landed clean.

847
00:43:32,886 --> 00:43:35,322
[Chaehyun] <i>Gijun was constantly trying</i>
<i>to close the distance.</i>

848
00:43:35,822 --> 00:43:37,524
<i>So I decided to turn up the pressure.</i>

849
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:43,030
[Seungheon] Once again,
he steps inside for a big shot.

850
00:43:44,965 --> 00:43:47,067
-[in English] Break!
-Lee Gijun spotted a small opening

851
00:43:47,134 --> 00:43:48,602
in Lee Chaehyun's solid defense.

852
00:43:49,703 --> 00:43:51,104
[spectator] Prepare to guard up!

853
00:43:53,407 --> 00:43:55,208
[Seungheon]
Another stance switch from Lee Gijun.

854
00:43:55,275 --> 00:43:58,912
He's switching stances freely,
just moving however he wants.

855
00:44:02,816 --> 00:44:04,418
[Gyuwon]
He momentarily switched to southpaw,

856
00:44:04,484 --> 00:44:08,088
using the stance change
to throw Lee Chaehyun off.

857
00:44:09,156 --> 00:44:10,157
[referee] Break it up!

858
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:17,164
-[both grunting]
-[Lee] Oh, boy!

859
00:44:19,166 --> 00:44:21,034
[Gijun] <i>Left-handers often struggle</i>

860
00:44:21,101 --> 00:44:23,070
<i>when facing opponents</i>
<i>using the same stance.</i>

861
00:44:25,005 --> 00:44:27,174
<i>That's why I kept changing stances</i>

862
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,475
<i>while firing away.</i>

863
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:32,312
[Seungheon]
Lee Gijun's moving aggressively now.

864
00:44:35,348 --> 00:44:36,550
That landed clean upstairs.

865
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:40,954
Lee Chaehyun attempts a combo!

866
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:43,323
-He steps to the side…
-[bell rings]

867
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:44,391
…and that ends the round.

868
00:44:47,094 --> 00:44:49,162
But still,
quarterfinals are quarterfinals.

869
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:51,031
-It hits different.
-Seeing Chaehyun get hit,

870
00:44:51,098 --> 00:44:52,265
and shaken at times.

871
00:44:52,332 --> 00:44:53,934
-Right.
-You don't usually see that.

872
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,336
-[Dex] Lee Chaehyun never struggles.
-[Jongkook] Exactly.

873
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:57,671
You don't see this often.

874
00:44:57,738 --> 00:44:59,773
-[Lee] They're really showing their skill.
-[Jongkook] Yeah.

875
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,509
Don't hold back. Just keep going.

876
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:04,111
Strike, jab, throw some feints…

877
00:45:04,177 --> 00:45:05,312
Got it.

878
00:45:05,378 --> 00:45:07,247
[Chaehyun]
<i>I plan to attack more decisively</i>

879
00:45:07,314 --> 00:45:08,515
<i>and throw more punches.</i>

880
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:11,284
Gijun, you got this, okay?

881
00:45:11,351 --> 00:45:13,186
Take it slow. You've got four more rounds.

882
00:45:14,187 --> 00:45:16,323
[Seungheon] Neither fighter is showing
any signs of fatigue.

883
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:18,091
Waiting for the next round to start.

887

[Lee]
That's how they needed to move all along.

888
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,668
[Jongkook] Yeah, that's much better.

889
00:45:30,303 --> 00:45:31,772
Man, he's really fast.

890
00:45:33,306 --> 00:45:35,008
[Gijun]
<i>I tried to edge in, little by little,</i>

891
00:45:35,075 --> 00:45:36,576
<i>then throw my lead hand.</i>

892
00:45:38,211 --> 00:45:39,913
[Dex]
It's like I'm watching a sword fight.

893
00:45:41,248 --> 00:45:43,416
[Jonghoon] That's it, one-two! Nice!

894
00:45:44,151 --> 00:45:45,418
[Lee] He's just too fast.

895
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:48,822
[Gyuwon]
Lee Chaehyun never misses his moment.

896
00:45:49,856 --> 00:45:51,792
[Jonghoon] Nice timing, Chaehyun!

897
00:45:52,392 --> 00:45:53,426
All right!

898
00:45:55,028 --> 00:45:56,396
[referee] Hey, break it up! No holding.

899
00:45:57,998 --> 00:45:59,299
[spectator] All right, all right!

900
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,501
He sure is a difficult one to hit.

901
00:46:02,502 --> 00:46:06,373
[Chaehyun] <i>My style is landing shots</i>
<i>without getting touched.</i>

902
00:46:06,439 --> 00:46:07,941
<i>I'll demonstrate that today.</i>

903
00:46:09,075 --> 00:46:10,544
-You're out of range!
-No!

904
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,745
Hit him right back!

905
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:13,680
[exclaiming]

906
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:18,485
-Nice going!
-He steps in and fires a straight.

907
00:46:18,552 --> 00:46:20,754
That's gotta land with real impact.

908
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:22,689
Man, Lee Chaehyun's fast.

909
00:46:24,524 --> 00:46:27,861
[Lee]
He punches, then steps just out of range.

910
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:34,367
[Seungheon]
Lee Chaehyun steps out of his reach.

911
00:46:35,468 --> 00:46:38,138
[Jongkook]
Wow, right on the edge of range.

912
00:46:49,516 --> 00:46:51,151
[both groan]

913
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:55,555
[Lee] Chaehyun's punches
hurt more than you'd expect.

914
00:47:01,328 --> 00:47:02,329
[bell dings]

915
00:47:02,395 --> 00:47:04,531
-Stop!
-And that's the end of this round.

916
00:47:04,598 --> 00:47:07,267
Lee Chaehyun's showing real experience.

917
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:10,871
He's breaking Lee Gijun's rhythm
using various lead hand movements.

918
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:13,840
Lee Chaehyun's just too fast.

919
00:47:13,907 --> 00:47:15,208
No joke.

920
00:47:15,275 --> 00:47:18,245
That's why Lee Gijun can't settle
into his usual rhythm at all.

921
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:21,214
[Gijun] <i>I felt boxed in.</i>

922
00:47:21,948 --> 00:47:23,149
<i>From the third round,</i>

923
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:27,954
<i>I planned to fight in my own rhythm.</i>

924
00:47:28,021 --> 00:47:29,990
<i>But his speed was making it impossible.</i>

925
00:47:31,424 --> 00:47:33,693
So far, his stamina looks okay.

926
00:47:35,862 --> 00:47:38,131
But it's his first time going six rounds.

927
00:47:40,133 --> 00:47:42,702
[Chaehyun] <i>It was my first three-minute,</i>
<i>six-round fight.</i>

928
00:47:42,769 --> 00:47:44,571
<i>That alone had me nervous.</i>

[Gyuwon] Lee Gijun's turning it up now.

937
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:15,535
Use the lead hand, man!

938
00:48:16,036 --> 00:48:17,270
[Lee] That's it, step in.

939
00:48:17,337 --> 00:48:19,572
-[Jongkook] Yes, move your head.
-[Lee] That's right.

[in English] Uppercut is there!

943
00:48:27,847 --> 00:48:30,350
[Lee, in Korean]
That was a great punch from Gijun.

944
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,422
-Short shots, yes.
-[Seungheon] Lee Gijun keeps pressing!

945
00:48:35,488 --> 00:48:36,823
[Lee] Keep it short.

946
00:48:41,027 --> 00:48:42,896
-That's how you go in.
-[Jongkook] That's right.

947
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:45,031
[Gyuwon]
Lee Chaehyun is starting to back up.

948
00:48:45,732 --> 00:48:48,101
It'll do him no favors
if he gets trapped in the corner.

949
00:48:50,904 --> 00:48:52,739
[Seungheon]
Lee Chaehyun backs up to the corner.

950
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:54,874
It looks like
he's getting caught in this flow!

951
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:56,843
He needs to regain control!

952
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:58,378
-[bell dings]
-[in English] Stop!

953
00:48:58,912 --> 00:49:01,414
[Gyuwon, in Korean] This round was
a real opportunity for Lee Gijun.

954
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:03,984
He needs to catch Lee Chaehyun
on the way in.

955
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:05,618
Remember, he's just as tired.

956
00:49:05,685 --> 00:49:09,322

for the next round.

[spectator] Let's go, Gijun!

964
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:24,804
[Seungheon] Round 5,
this is where stamina gets tested.

965
00:49:25,939 --> 00:49:27,540
-Here he comes.
-[spectator] That's it!

966
00:49:27,607 --> 00:49:29,109
[Seungheon] And Lee Chaehyun counters.

967
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:33,680
He's finding his rhythm again.

968
00:49:38,918 --> 00:49:40,720
[Gyuwon] That's his signature move.
The slip and rip!

969
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:42,789
You got this, Chaehyun!

970
00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:44,791
[Gyuwon] Now that is the art of timing.

00:49:48,795 --> 00:49:50,964
-[Jongkook] Nice shot!
-Nice, indeed.

973
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:53,266
[Seungheon] He's back in rhythm.

974
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:56,636
[Gyuwon] Whoa, a double combo!

975
00:49:58,038 --> 00:50:01,107
That combo was dangerous!
Look at him falter back!

976
00:50:03,943 --> 00:50:05,111
Go for it now!

977
00:50:05,178 --> 00:50:06,679
Go for it! Go for it!

978
00:50:06,746 --> 00:50:08,148
[Jongkook] Wait, what's he waiting for?

979
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:09,215
What is he doing?

980
00:50:09,282 --> 00:50:10,383
Go for it. Oh, man.

981
00:50:11,985 --> 00:50:13,353
[Jongkook] Why didn't he go in?

982
00:50:16,456 --> 00:50:19,492
[Chaehyun] <i>It looked like</i>
<i>Lee Gijun's stamina had dipped.</i>

983
00:50:21,261 --> 00:50:22,762
[Seungheon] Body combo!

984
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:25,532
[Chaehyun] <i>I figured I'd strike first</i>
<i>and break his rhythm.</i>

985
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:29,769
[Seungheon] Back to the center.

986
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:32,305
He tries firing combos again.

987
00:50:33,473 --> 00:50:35,475
[audience exclaims]

988
00:50:42,282 --> 00:50:43,316

Slip, slip, slip.

990
00:50:47,587 --> 00:50:49,622
[Gyuwon, in Korean]
He can't lose focus here.

991
00:50:49,689 --> 00:50:52,792
[Gijun] <i>I got too amped up</i>
<i>and a little tense today,</i>

992
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:54,194
<i>and my movements got too big.</i>

993
00:50:55,195 --> 00:50:58,031
-Gijun, deep breaths!
-You're okay, you're okay!

994
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:07,474
Come on, let's go!

995
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:11,845
[Gyuwon] Perhaps he's sensing
that Lee Gijun is going for the counter,

996
00:51:11,911 --> 00:51:13,379
he's being extra careful now.

997
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:14,614
[Lee] Come on, throw combos.

998
00:51:14,681 --> 00:51:19,919

-[bell dings]
-[in English] Stop!

1000
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,859
[Jongkook, in Korean]
Lee Chaehyun has the center.

1001
00:51:25,925 --> 00:51:29,229
That only makes things harder
for Lee Gijun.

1002
00:51:29,295 --> 00:51:31,498
[Dex]
It's my first time seeing him this tired.

1003
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:35,468
[Seungheon] This tells me this next round
is going to be crucial.

1004
00:51:35,535 --> 00:51:38,438
If the final round goes like this,

1005
00:51:39,005 --> 00:51:41,574
one attacking, the other staying calm,

1006
00:51:42,075 --> 00:51:46,312
the fighter who keeps it simple
will take the win.

1007
00:51:47,046 --> 00:51:48,414
[Dex] Is it already the last round?

1008
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:50,316
-That went by way too fast.
-Seriously.

1009
00:51:50,383 --> 00:51:51,784
Those rounds just flew by.

1010
00:51:51,851 --> 00:51:53,419

00:52:07,033 --> 00:52:09,502
[Seungheon]
I wonder how much they've recovered.

1017
00:52:09,569 --> 00:52:12,405
Lee Chaehyun and Lee Gijun,
about to head into the final round.

1018
00:52:12,472 --> 00:52:13,873
This is going to be fire!

1019
00:52:14,374 --> 00:52:16,342
Let's turn up the heat in here.

1020
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,646
[Gyuwon] Which fighter's punches
will spark fireworks?

1021
00:52:19,712 --> 00:52:21,047
-Let's find out now!
-You got this!

1022
00:52:21,648 --> 00:52:23,283
[Seungheon] Round 6 has started.

1023
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,684
Okay, box!

1024
00:52:26,286 --> 00:52:27,587
Yes, push hard!

1025
00:52:27,654 --> 00:52:29,689
-Yes, there you go!
-[Seungheon] Lee Chaehyun falls back.

1026
00:52:31,391 --> 00:52:33,159
Lee Gijun is hunting for a big shot.

1027
00:52:33,226 --> 00:52:34,827
That left hand fell a bit short.

1028
00:52:38,431 --> 00:52:40,366
This is it, Gijun! Last round!

1029
00:52:40,433 --> 00:52:42,702
All right, this is it! Use your lead hand!

1030
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:43,937
[Seungheon] They trade punches.

1031
00:52:44,003 --> 00:52:45,138
You have to go now!

1032
00:52:48,074 --> 00:52:49,742
Gijun, don't just stand there!

1033
00:52:51,077 --> 00:52:52,312
Remember, last round.

1034
00:52:56,482 --> 00:52:58,785
[Seungheon] Lee Chaehyun backs off,
clearly aware of the counter.

1035
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,120
Lee Chaehyun has the center.

1036
00:53:03,423 --> 00:53:05,258
[Gyuwon]
The more he hunts for that one big shot,

1037
00:53:05,325 --> 00:53:07,093
the more his stamina drains!

1038
00:53:10,063 --> 00:53:12,065
When you judge offensive control,

1039
00:53:12,131 --> 00:53:14,267
it really comes down to
who owns the center!

1040
00:53:14,334 --> 00:53:16,336
Right now, that's Lee Chaehyun!

1041
00:53:17,437 --> 00:53:20,740
[Seungheon] Clearly, we're seeing
some stamina issues for Lee Gijun here.

1042
00:53:20,807 --> 00:53:22,809
Lee Chaehyun steps back to the center.

1043
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:24,344
Come on, extend your arm!

1044
00:53:30,984 --> 00:53:32,552
[Seungheon] Oh, that was a big left jab!

1045
00:53:32,619 --> 00:53:34,153
[exclaiming]

1046
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,658
[spectator] Go, Lee Gijun!

1047
00:53:38,725 --> 00:53:40,493
Gijun, you have to strike first!

1048
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:46,065
It's now or never.

1049
00:53:46,132 --> 00:53:47,333
Crash into him!

1050
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,003
Jab, jab! Stick the jab!

1051
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:53,773
[Seungheon] Incoming Lee Gijun!

1052
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,075
-Keep going!
-You got this!

1053
00:53:58,011 --> 00:54:00,413
-[Jongkook] See that uppercut?
-[Lee exclaims]

1054
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,481
[in English] Break!

1055
00:54:01,547 --> 00:54:05,618
[Seungheon, in Korean] Both fighters
are running on fumes at this point.

1056
00:54:05,685 --> 00:54:07,720
[in English] Keep going, keep going!

1057
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:10,189
-[in Korean] Go, Chaehyun!
-You got this, Chaehyun!

1058
00:54:12,525 --> 00:54:13,559
[spectator] Ten seconds!

1059
00:54:14,027 --> 00:54:15,762
Ten seconds! Fire now!

1060
00:54:19,165 --> 00:54:20,300
[referee, in English] Slip, slip!

1061
00:54:22,535 --> 00:54:23,569
Slip, slip!

1062
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,775
[Jongkook, in Korean] His stamina's gone.

1063
00:54:28,841 --> 00:54:30,476
He's totally spent.

1064
00:54:31,177 --> 00:54:32,178
[referee] Okay, go!

1065
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:35,848
[Dex exclaiming]

1066
00:54:40,286 --> 00:54:41,454
[Gyuwon exclaims]

1067
00:54:42,455 --> 00:54:44,123
That punch was lightning fast!

1068
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:45,358
Stop! [in English]

1069
00:54:45,992 --> 00:54:49,329
[Seungheon] And the fight is over!
Lee Chaehyun versus Lee Gijun!

1070
00:54:49,395 --> 00:54:50,697
[shouts]

1071
00:54:50,763 --> 00:54:52,932
[Gyuwon] Well, I'll be…

1072
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:55,535
What a beautiful display of timing!

1073
00:54:55,601 --> 00:54:57,570
That was an incredible fight!

1074
00:54:58,971 --> 00:55:00,406
-That connected, right?
-It did.

1075
00:55:00,473 --> 00:55:02,275
-He drove it home.
-That's why in boxing,

1076
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:05,244
you can't let your guard down
till the bell rings.

1077
00:55:05,311 --> 00:55:06,979
He really nailed that one.

1078
00:55:09,248 --> 00:55:10,917
[Seungheon]
We now await the judges' decision.

1079
00:55:12,418 --> 00:55:14,821
Judge one scores it for…

1080
00:55:19,492 --> 00:55:20,893
Lee Chaehyun in the red corner.

1081
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,629
JUDGE 1
RED CORNER LEE CHAEHYUN WINS

1082
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,269

CHAEHYUN ADVANCES TO THE SEMIFINALS

1085
00:55:35,007 --> 00:55:36,109
Congratulations!

1086
00:55:36,576 --> 00:55:38,177
[Lee] All right then,

1087
00:55:38,244 --> 00:55:41,848
the winner of this bout is
Lee Chaehyun in the red corner.

1088
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:46,119
First of all, I'd like to thank Lee Gijun

1089
00:55:46,185 --> 00:55:49,722
for putting up a great fight.

1090
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:52,525
I truly…

1091
00:55:53,493 --> 00:55:55,228
love boxing.

1092
00:55:55,728 --> 00:56:00,133
Honestly, boxing is my life.

1093
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:04,103
My father was the one
who introduced me to boxing.

1094
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:08,274
And my mother has come to every fight

1095
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:10,510
and supported me the whole way.

1096
00:56:10,977 --> 00:56:12,145
I want to say thank you,

1097
00:56:12,211 --> 00:56:15,081
and that I want to make you proud.

1098
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,283
Mom and Dad, I love you!

1099
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,118
-We love you too!
-We love you too!

1100
00:56:25,258 --> 00:56:26,626
[Gijun] First off,

1101
00:56:26,692 --> 00:56:30,596
I want to thank my teammates
at Woosuk University.

1102
00:56:31,164 --> 00:56:32,632
I'll keep working harder

1103
00:56:33,399 --> 00:56:35,768
and become a fighter that people notice.

1104
00:56:35,835 --> 00:56:37,170
Thank you.

1105
00:56:39,472 --> 00:56:40,940
Great job!

1106
00:56:45,077 --> 00:56:47,480
When I first started boxing,

1107
00:56:47,547 --> 00:56:50,483
a lot of people said I wouldn't make it.

1108
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,219
<i>Even so, I've come this far.</i>

1109
00:56:53,986 --> 00:56:57,623
<i>I wouldn't be here</i>
<i>without the Woosuk University boxing team</i>

1110
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:01,260
<i>believing in me and training with me.</i>

1111
00:57:01,327 --> 00:57:03,229
<i>So I'm grateful for that.</i>

1112
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:07,300
I'll strive to become
a Korean boxer worth watching.

1113
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:10,236
[Lee] Let's keep this energy going

1114
00:57:10,303 --> 00:57:12,238
and introduce the advisors

1115
00:57:12,305 --> 00:57:14,607
who helped make<i> I Am Boxer</i> possible.

1116
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:18,211
Former WBA junior flyweight champion,

1117
00:57:18,277 --> 00:57:21,380
and an International Boxing Hall of Fame
inductee, Yuh Myungwoo!

FORMER JUNIOR FLYWEIGHT CHAMP

1119
00:57:26,118 --> 00:57:29,922
[Lee] And with the expertise
of Korea's top boxing professionals,

1120
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:31,791
<i>I Am Boxer</i> comes to life.

1121
00:57:31,858 --> 00:57:34,327
Once again, let's give them a big hand!

1122
00:57:37,864 --> 00:57:38,965
[Dex] I'm sure you all know,

1123
00:57:39,031 --> 00:57:42,235
but the most anticipated fight
always comes last.

1124
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:47,240
That final bout is just moments away.

1125
00:57:50,643 --> 00:57:51,644

[spectator]
Man, they really stacked this matchup.

1130
00:58:00,253 --> 00:58:02,655
[Dex] Let's call the fighters in.

1131
00:58:02,722 --> 00:58:04,757
Entering from the blue corner,

1132
00:58:04,824 --> 00:58:07,927
Tyson, Hong Sungmin!

1133
00:58:09,161 --> 00:58:11,163
[Sungmin] <i>Throughout my whole career</i>
<i>as an amateur boxer,</i>

1134
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,866
<i>I've never stood on a stage so big</i>

1135
00:58:13,933 --> 00:58:16,402
<i>with so many spectators.</i>

1136
00:58:17,436 --> 00:58:18,871
<i>That's what got me more stoked.</i>

Hong Sungmin is a real character.

[spectator 1] He's born for the spotlight.

1141
00:58:48,935 --> 00:58:50,570
[Dex chuckles] He's relaxed.

1142
00:58:51,771 --> 00:58:53,205

[spectator 1] It's the car.

HONG SUNGMIN'S PARENTS

1149
00:59:32,011 --> 00:59:34,981
[Sungmin] <i>I first went to a boxing gym</i>
<i>just to lose weight,</i>

1150
00:59:35,881 --> 00:59:37,483
<i>and somehow ended up here.</i>

1151
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:42,455
<i>I used to think talent was</i>
<i>what got you to the top.</i>

1152
00:59:42,922 --> 00:59:45,958
<i>But now I believe it's the one</i>
<i>who works harder and wants it more</i>

1153
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:49,061
<i>who comes out on top.</i>

1154
00:59:49,895 --> 00:59:51,664
<i>So I've trained harder than anyone else.</i>

1155
00:59:51,731 --> 00:59:55,401

01:01:29,095 --> 01:01:31,564
<i>I met my wife after I retired,</i>

1185
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:34,100
<i>so she's never seen me box.</i>

1186
01:01:35,301 --> 01:01:40,005
When I think about you going up against
such tough opponents,

1187
01:01:40,606 --> 01:01:43,242
I worry you'll get hit,
and that it'll hurt.

1188
01:01:43,309 --> 01:01:44,910
That's what worries me the most.

1189
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:47,780
Then, I guess I'll have to win.

1190
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:50,182
Extend all the way.

1191
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:51,884
<i>I want to show my wife and child</i>

1192
01:01:52,785 --> 01:01:57,656
<i>the kind of fighter I once was.</i>

1193
01:01:58,791 --> 01:02:02,161
Show me! Show me what you've got, mister!

1194
01:02:03,863 --> 01:02:06,899
-[spectator] Let's go, Kwon Ohgon!
-Let's do this!

1195
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:13,239
Let's go, Hong Sungmin!

1196
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:18,010
[Lee] Hong Sungmin's
already working the crowd.

1197
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:21,947
[Dex] That's the kind of fighter he is.

1198
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:27,219
Kwon Ohgon,
I'm sure you know that this match

1199
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:28,387
will be your last one.

1200
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:29,755
Whoo!

1201
01:02:30,823 --> 01:02:32,758
So I'd like to apologize in advance.

1202
01:02:33,859 --> 01:02:36,328
There's a reason my ring name is "Tyson,"

1203
01:02:36,896 --> 01:02:38,931
and why they call me the nuclear puncher.

1204
01:02:38,998 --> 01:02:43,102
I'll make sure
everyone here sees it tonight.

1205
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:52,077
It's been three years
since I've fought in front of a crowd,

1206
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:55,347
but I'm more excited than nervous.

1207
01:02:55,414 --> 01:03:00,019
I'm the last remaining pro boxer
in this survival show.

1208
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:02,888
I'm not worried about weight classes.

1209
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:05,958
I'll just show you exactly
why I was a two-division champion.

1210
01:03:06,025 --> 01:03:07,026
You'll see.

1211
01:03:07,092 --> 01:03:09,361
-Let's go, Kwon Ohgon!
-Let's go!

1212
01:03:09,428 --> 01:03:11,730
BOXING G.O.A.T CHAMP KWON OHGON

1213
01:03:12,565 --> 01:03:15,234
[Gyuwon] This fight has
a very clear theme.

1214
01:03:15,301 --> 01:03:17,903
A clash of speed versus power.

1215
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:22,107
Kwon Ohgon is known for his speed
in both the amateur and pro scenes.

1216
01:03:22,174 --> 01:03:24,710
He scores knockouts
with his lightning-fast movement

1217
01:03:24,777 --> 01:03:27,847
and showcases the art of timing
through his boxing.

1218
01:03:29,081 --> 01:03:31,784
On the other hand,
Hong Sungmin is a power boxer,

1219
01:03:31,851 --> 01:03:34,220
right in step
with the global trend in boxing.

1220
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,523
His punching power is extremely dangerous.

1221
01:03:38,591 --> 01:03:43,229
Fighters, show us what you're known for.

1222
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:46,465
KWON OHGON'S WIFE

1223
01:03:47,266 --> 01:03:50,269
[Ohgon] <i>I've done ten-rounders before,</i>

1224
01:03:50,336 --> 01:03:53,672
<i>and Hong Sungmin</i>
<i>has never fought in a six-rounder.</i>

1225
01:03:54,406 --> 01:03:56,609
[Sungmin] <i>None of that matters to me.</i>

1226
01:03:57,142 --> 01:03:58,811
<i>I'm going in to smash everything.</i>

1227
01:04:00,512 --> 01:04:02,348
[spectator] Let's go, Hong Sungmin!

1228
01:04:02,915 --> 01:04:05,117
[spectator 2] Let's go, Kwon Ohgon!

1229
01:04:05,184 --> 01:04:06,318
Box!

1230
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:07,386
[bell dings]

1231
01:04:07,453 --> 01:04:08,988
KWON OHGON X HONG SUNGMIN

1232
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:10,789
[Seungheon]
It's the final quarterfinal bout.

1233
01:04:10,856 --> 01:04:13,492
Kwon Ohgon versus Hong Sungmin begins now.

1234
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:16,095
-[Gyuwon] You're about to see real class.
-[Seungheon] That's right.

1235
01:04:23,769 --> 01:04:25,337
Hong Sungmin slowly comes in.

1236
01:04:26,105 --> 01:04:27,106
Nice body shot!

1237
01:04:27,172 --> 01:04:28,407
[groans]

1238
01:04:28,474 --> 01:04:29,909
Did I hear bones breaking?

1239
01:04:32,244 --> 01:04:34,079
[Lee] Didn't connect, landed on his guard.

1240
01:04:35,781 --> 01:04:37,116
[Seungheon] He's hunting for the big one.

1241
01:04:37,182 --> 01:04:39,885
[Sungmin] <i>I'm in the higher weight class</i>

1242
01:04:39,952 --> 01:04:41,053
<i>and I have more power,</i>

1243
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:44,423
<i>so my plan was to score points</i>
<i>by landing big shots, one at a time.</i>

1244
01:04:45,357 --> 01:04:46,759
[spectators groan]

1245
01:04:52,131 --> 01:04:53,999
[Gyuwon] You can tell they're
both experienced,

1246
01:04:54,066 --> 01:04:56,468
taking their time and reading each other.

1247
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,472
[Seungheon] Hong Sungmin slowly
adds pressure.

1248
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,675
-Oh!
-[Lee] Oh!

1249
01:05:02,741 --> 01:05:04,476
That right there is dangerous.

1250
01:05:04,543 --> 01:05:07,546
-He's got power. One clean shot ends it.
-Right.

1251
01:05:10,582 --> 01:05:11,884
[spectators gasp]

1252
01:05:11,951 --> 01:05:12,952
Nice going!

1253
01:05:14,787 --> 01:05:16,455
Let's go, honey!

1254
01:05:16,522 --> 01:05:18,857
[spectators laugh, cheer]

1255
01:05:18,924 --> 01:05:21,427
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1256
01:05:22,795 --> 01:05:26,699
[Ohgon] <i>My strength is my explosive speed.</i>

1257
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,370
<i>The plan was to find openings</i>
<i>and attack them hard and fast.</i>

1258
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:34,273
[spectators exclaim]

1259
01:05:35,474 --> 01:05:36,742
He's fast.

1260
01:05:36,809 --> 01:05:38,844
[Seungheon] So there was
a gap in that guard!

1261
01:05:38,911 --> 01:05:41,213
And Kwon Ohgon dug right into it!

1262
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:46,352
Looks like he's found an opening again.

1263
01:05:47,353 --> 01:05:48,520
That's it!

1264
01:05:49,521 --> 01:05:52,524
Man, those hands are fast.
You can't even see them.

1265
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:58,764
Short shots up top.

1266
01:05:59,732 --> 01:06:01,100
That's it.

1267
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:06,105
[Gyuwon] Kwon is clearly controlling
the fight with his superior speed.

1268
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,712
Oh… Neat blocking moves.

1269
01:06:14,279 --> 01:06:16,548
[exclaiming]

1270
01:06:23,822 --> 01:06:25,824
Did you see those moves? What was that?

1271
01:06:25,891 --> 01:06:27,026
Did he teleport or what?

1272
01:06:28,827 --> 01:06:30,496
-[bell dings]
-Stop!

1273
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:32,831
[Seungheon] That concludes this round.

1274
01:06:32,898 --> 01:06:35,868
[Gyuwon] The first round was filled
with intense mental warfare.

1275
01:06:41,707 --> 01:06:43,175
HONG SUNGMIN'S MOTHER

1276
01:06:43,242 --> 01:06:44,576
My heart's pounding…

1277
01:06:46,178 --> 01:06:48,781
It's a battle of true masters.

1278
01:06:48,847 --> 01:06:49,848
This is real boxing.

1279
01:06:49,915 --> 01:06:51,150
-Yeah.
-No doubt.

1280
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:52,818
This is boxing at its best.

1281
01:06:56,255 --> 01:06:58,657
-Bring over his chair.
-Nah, don't need one.

1282
01:06:58,724 --> 01:07:00,626
[Seungheon]
Wow, neither fighter is sitting down.

1283
01:07:00,692 --> 01:07:03,829
Hong Sungmin just said he didn't need one.

1284
01:07:03,896 --> 01:07:06,532
And Kwon Ohgon,
back in the ring after three years,

1285
01:07:06,598 --> 01:07:08,801
is savoring every step on the canvas.

1286
01:07:09,301 --> 01:07:10,502
Your tempo's good.

1287
01:07:10,569 --> 01:07:11,904
Just manage your pace.

1288
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:12,971
And take your time.

1289
01:07:13,472 --> 01:07:15,774
[Ohgon] <i>I think I did okay just now.</i>

1290
01:07:15,841 --> 01:07:17,976
<i>I'll just keep this up next round.</i>

1291
01:07:18,043 --> 01:07:19,278
<i>I think I can win this.</i>

1292
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,614
You're doing well,
but you're swinging a bit wide.

1293
01:07:22,681 --> 01:07:25,017
-Yeah, I know that.
-Yeah? Okay.

1294
01:07:26,018 --> 01:07:28,053
[Sungmin] <i>I need to loosen up more.</i>

1295
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,955
<i>My body's still a bit stiff.</i>

[spectator] Let's go, Kwon Ohgon!

1298
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:43,368
With these two, it's a real boxing match.

-Box!
-Second round starts now!

1301
01:07:50,843 --> 01:07:52,744
Hong Sungmin inches forward.

1302
01:07:56,648 --> 01:07:58,884
-[spectators groan]
-He steps in and lets it go.

1303
01:08:03,388 --> 01:08:04,623
[Jongkook] It's not landing.

1304
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:08,060
Neither one's giving openings.

1305
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:10,129
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

1306
01:08:12,731 --> 01:08:15,100
[Gyuwon] Both are locked
in a fierce battle,

1307
01:08:15,167 --> 01:08:17,870
trying to read each other's timing.

1308
01:08:17,936 --> 01:08:18,937
[Seungheon] That's right.

1309
01:08:21,173 --> 01:08:23,876
[Dex] So much happening
in that tight space.

1310
01:08:23,942 --> 01:08:25,310
[Lee] Gosh, it's a battle of timing.

1311
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,918
And he strikes with the right!

1312
01:08:32,985 --> 01:08:34,753
Kwon Ohgon's one-two combo!

1313
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:35,854
[judges, spectators exclaim]

1314
01:08:36,555 --> 01:08:37,756
Kwon Ohgon's fast.

1315
01:08:39,925 --> 01:08:42,861
[Ohgon] <i>If I read those punches well</i>
<i>and counter clean,</i>

1316
01:08:42,928 --> 01:08:44,530
<i>I might get to break his rhythm.</i>

1317
01:08:45,097 --> 01:08:46,999
[Gyuwon] Hong's trying
to establish his rhythm,

1318
01:08:47,065 --> 01:08:48,634
but Kwon keeps striking first.

1319
01:08:52,204 --> 01:08:53,305
And he swings his right!

1320
01:08:56,742 --> 01:08:58,510
And he swings his right!

1321
01:08:58,577 --> 01:09:01,346
Kwon Ohgon never misses an opening!

1322
01:09:01,947 --> 01:09:04,116
[Seungheon] Hong Sungmin ducks,
guard tight!

1323
01:09:06,919 --> 01:09:08,320
Nice shot!

1324
01:09:09,755 --> 01:09:11,890
Kwon's so fast it's hard to see!

1325
01:09:12,858 --> 01:09:16,428
[Don exclaims] He's fast.

1326
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:19,531
Ohgon's landing clean tonight.

1327
01:09:20,532 --> 01:09:22,534
He's in great form tonight.

1328
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,973
[Sungmin] <i>Honestly,</i>
<i>I was surprised by his speed.</i>

1329
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,942
<i>I thought I might lose my flow.</i>

1330
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:37,816
[Dex] He's got composure, too.

1331
01:09:41,053 --> 01:09:44,456
[Gyuwon] Kwon Ohgon is lowering
his level to change his stance

1332
01:09:44,523 --> 01:09:46,592
and throw off Hong Sungmin's accuracy.

1333
01:09:49,228 --> 01:09:51,263
Kwon Ohgon shoots… and lands!

1334
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:52,931
…and lands!

1335
01:09:53,498 --> 01:09:54,733
[Lee] Nice cross-counter.

1336
01:09:56,235 --> 01:09:57,803
[Seungheon] Another exchange of big shots.

1337
01:09:58,370 --> 01:09:59,371
And Hong lands!

1338
01:10:00,072 --> 01:10:01,473
And Hong lands!

1339
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,243
-[bell dings]
-And that concludes this round!

1340
01:10:08,981 --> 01:10:11,483
[Lee] Wow, this is a hell of a fight.

1341
01:10:13,085 --> 01:10:15,754
Feet planted,
trading right in rhythm at that range.

1342
01:10:17,055 --> 01:10:20,926
I was curious to see what kind
of game plan Kwon Ohgon would bring

1343
01:10:20,993 --> 01:10:23,028
against Hong Sungmin's infighter style.

1344
01:10:23,095 --> 01:10:26,598
I thought Kwon Ohgon might show us
some out-boxing today.

1345
01:10:26,665 --> 01:10:28,400
-That's what I figured.
-Exactly.

1346
01:10:28,467 --> 01:10:31,370
Turns out, the fight is unfolding
in a completely different direction.

1347
01:10:32,704 --> 01:10:35,841
[Sungmin] <i>I thought,</i>
<i>"He's not backing out at all."</i>

1348
01:10:35,907 --> 01:10:38,877
<i>"Then I'll land a few big shots</i>
<i>and slow him down."</i>

1349
01:10:39,678 --> 01:10:43,015
Seeing power fighters plant their feet

BOXING SCORE CARD
KWON: 20, HONG: 18

1355
01:10:54,793 --> 01:10:55,794
Big swing there.

1356
01:10:56,328 --> 01:10:57,696
Too big, son!

1357
01:11:00,032 --> 01:11:01,667
Hong's hunting for the right timing.

1358
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:04,036
He's stepping in. But again!

1359
01:11:04,536 --> 01:11:06,438
He's stepping in. But again!

1360
01:11:07,606 --> 01:11:09,875
[Lee] Ohgon's read his timing here.

1361
01:11:14,546 --> 01:11:16,014
[spectators gasp]

1362
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:17,983
Let's go!

1363
01:11:19,885 --> 01:11:20,919
[Lee] Hong Sungmin…

1364
01:11:21,453 --> 01:11:24,823
His timing's off against Ohgon right now.

1365
01:11:29,027 --> 01:11:31,430
[Gyuwon] Kwon Ohgon is half a beat faster.

1366
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:35,767
When Hong tries to set his rhythm
and find an opening,

1367
01:11:37,602 --> 01:11:40,105
Kwon beats him to it and strikes first.

1368
01:11:44,276 --> 01:11:45,644
[Lee] No, that didn't connect.

1369
01:11:45,711 --> 01:11:48,814
[Seungheon] Kwon Ohgon gives him
the head shake!

1370
01:11:57,522 --> 01:12:00,258
And he escapes!
Momentum's starting to swing Kwon's way!

1371
01:12:02,361 --> 01:12:03,395
So light on his feet.

1372
01:12:05,897 --> 01:12:08,700
Kwon Ohgon keeps pressuring on the inside,

1373
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:11,870
making it very hard
for Hong Sungmin to find his timing.

1374
01:12:11,937 --> 01:12:13,038
Big swing from Hong.

1375
01:12:13,638 --> 01:12:14,806
Kwon takes a step in.

1376
01:12:14,873 --> 01:12:16,007
And works the body!

1377
01:12:19,411 --> 01:12:21,713
[Lee] Ohgon's very sharp tonight.

1378
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,482
He's gonna be hard to take.

1379
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:25,117
Sungmin needs to raise the bar now.

1380
01:12:25,183 --> 01:12:27,753
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1381
01:12:27,819 --> 01:12:29,354
[Seungheon] Cross to the face!

1382
01:12:29,421 --> 01:12:30,655
Hong Sungmin lands clean!

1383
01:12:30,722 --> 01:12:32,023
Kwon counters!

1384
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:34,993
Hong Sungmin is trying
to rebuild his rhythm.

1385
01:12:35,961 --> 01:12:37,496
Kwon drops his level and fires low!

1386
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:38,563
Low left!

1387
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:41,099
And that brings us to the end of Round 3!

1388
01:12:45,303 --> 01:12:46,505
Bravo!

1389
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:52,277
He's showing how you nullify
a power fighter with technique.

1390
01:12:53,111 --> 01:12:54,980
You're doing well. You won this round.

1391
01:12:55,847 --> 01:12:59,351
He's not in his best form tonight.

1392
01:12:59,418 --> 01:13:03,522
[Lee] Ohgon took the first three rounds,
so this is not gonna be easy for Sungmin.

1393
01:13:04,523 --> 01:13:05,524
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

1394
01:13:06,992 --> 01:13:09,127
I feel like his stamina's dipped a bit.

1395
01:13:10,362 --> 01:13:12,264
<i>Trying to match Ohgon's speed,</i>

1396
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:13,765
<i>I couldn't play my own game.</i>

1397
01:13:13,832 --> 01:13:16,435
<i>So I decided to work the short shots</i>
<i>and get my rhythm back.</i>

1398
01:13:17,002 --> 01:13:21,006
[Lee] It's an impressive display
of veteran savvy from Kwon Ohgon.

1399
01:13:21,072 --> 01:13:24,109
Meanwhile, Hong Sungmin
appears deep in tactical thought.

1400
01:13:25,243 --> 01:13:27,379
-Now, into the fourth round.
-[bell dings]

1401

1402
01:13:28,814 --> 01:13:30,015
Round 4 has now begun.

1403
01:13:30,081 --> 01:13:31,716
KWON OHGON X HONG SUNGMIN

1404
01:13:32,784 --> 01:13:34,719
[Seungheon] Hong is still
finding his rhythm.

1405
01:13:37,189 --> 01:13:38,924
Kwon Ohgon looks confident enough.

1406
01:13:39,658 --> 01:13:40,759
[exclaims]

1407
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:47,232
[spectator] Stay sharp!

1408
01:13:48,033 --> 01:13:49,034
Hong Sungmin strikes.

1409
01:13:50,101 --> 01:13:52,337
Nice left hand from Hong Sungmin!

1410
01:13:55,707 --> 01:13:56,708
[Jihyun] That's it!

1411
01:13:58,009 --> 01:13:59,811
That's it! Throw combos!

1412
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:03,515
[Seungheon] Hong presses forward,
Kwon tightens his guard.

1413
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:07,619
Hong Sungmin looks to the body.

1414
01:14:08,186 --> 01:14:10,455
He takes a counter to the body,
then slips a big shot!

1415
01:14:10,522 --> 01:14:12,858
[♪ intense music playing]

1416
01:14:12,924 --> 01:14:14,459
That was clean.

1417
01:14:15,026 --> 01:14:16,928
Hong Sungmin is starting to pick it up.

1418
01:14:16,995 --> 01:14:18,063
I can feel it.

1419
01:14:20,365 --> 01:14:22,033
There it is.

1420
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,268
He's switched on.

1421
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:25,337
We're getting some of this action.

1422
01:14:25,403 --> 01:14:27,205
-You mean dancing.
-Right, "dancing."

1423
01:14:31,343 --> 01:14:33,945
[Seungheon] Kwon changes levels,
but Hong stays with him.

1424
01:14:34,713 --> 01:14:37,048
[Lee] He keeps working the body,
trying to slow him down.

1425
01:14:39,651 --> 01:14:41,052
He comes over the top again!

1426
01:14:41,586 --> 01:14:44,623
Ohgon is no easy opponent, though.

1427
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:46,525
[Seungheon] Kwon slips the left
and angles out.

1428
01:14:46,591 --> 01:14:48,159
Hong keeps up the chase.

1429
01:14:50,629 --> 01:14:51,863
Short shots from Hong!

1430
01:14:54,566 --> 01:14:55,567
And here's the left!

1431
01:14:58,236 --> 01:15:00,405
That shot just spun Kwon off to the side!

1432
01:15:04,009 --> 01:15:05,677
He keeps pressing. Ten seconds!

1433
01:15:10,682 --> 01:15:12,717
Final push from Hong Sungmin.
Here he comes.

1434
01:15:13,451 --> 01:15:14,719
[bell dings]

1435
01:15:17,122 --> 01:15:18,490
And that concludes this round!

1436
01:15:26,898 --> 01:15:28,867
Here we go.
Sungmin's starting to move like this.

1437
01:15:29,367 --> 01:15:31,403
He's gonna run these last two.

1438
01:15:32,704 --> 01:15:34,773
[Lee] He needs to show more.

1439
01:15:35,473 --> 01:15:36,608
You're not doing too badly.

1440
01:15:36,675 --> 01:15:39,411
I think you can take this round.

1441
01:15:39,477 --> 01:15:41,846
Just fire short shots.
He ate every single one.

1442
01:15:41,913 --> 01:15:43,315
Your tempo's good.

1443
01:15:44,316 --> 01:15:45,450
You don't need to move much.

1444
01:15:45,517 --> 01:15:46,818
Save it for the last round.

1445
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:50,288

All right! Just hang in there!

1455
01:16:14,346 --> 01:16:17,449
[Lee] Hong Sungmin sure is throwing
a lot of light jabs today.

1456
01:16:17,515 --> 01:16:20,552
He's just not letting his hands go
like he usually does.

[♪ suspenseful music playing]

1458

<i>he never fired back.</i>

1461
01:16:37,902 --> 01:16:39,471
All right!

<i>That was my moment to fire with impact.</i>

1464

[Seungheon] Hong Sungmin's starting
the fifth round a little differently.

[spectators gasping]

1466
01:17:12,937 --> 01:17:15,607
[Gyuwon] Even while firing combos,
he controls the pace!

01:17:15,674 --> 01:17:17,242
And that's why he's landing clean!

1468
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:20,178
-Come on!
-Don't let him hit you!

1469
01:17:20,912 --> 01:17:22,647
Kwon's looking a bit surprised there.

Even a fourth,
but Sungmin slips this time!

[Jihyun] One-two! One-two, that's it!

This is intense!

[Seungheon] He's using
his upper body and footwork,

slowly steering Kwon into the corner!

1482
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:08,293
As Hong Sungmin's rhythm picks up,
it's clearly making Kwon uncomfortable.

If he doesn't score a knockout,

Sungmin's chances are running thin.

1496
01:18:56,174 --> 01:18:58,343
He's got to step on it now.

01:20:04,843 --> 01:20:06,644
[Lee] Sungmin's gotta go now.
The clock's ticking.

1519
01:20:10,248 --> 01:20:13,017
[Sungmin] <i>It's the last round,</i>
<i>so I might as well go crazy.</i>

1520
01:20:14,118 --> 01:20:17,055
-Empty the tank! Leave it all in there!
-Keep going!

1521
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:21,326
[Lee] Go for it! Time's running out!

1522
01:20:23,962 --> 01:20:25,363
[Seungheon] Hong Sungmin fires back.

1523
01:20:31,603 --> 01:20:33,104
That was a dangerous counter cross!

1524
01:20:35,406 --> 01:20:37,008
Clean shot!

1525
01:20:37,075 --> 01:20:38,243
Hong follows up!

1526
01:20:38,309 --> 01:20:40,011
Kwon Ohgon fires back with big shots!

1527
01:20:40,778 --> 01:20:42,447
They're pushing to end it here!

1528
01:20:47,585 --> 01:20:49,354
Kwon Ohgon swings big and eats one!

1529
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,324
Stay on him!

1530
01:20:53,858 --> 01:20:57,295
-Come on!
-Let's go!

1531
01:21:00,031 --> 01:21:01,599
Full swings from both fighters!

1532
01:21:02,967 --> 01:21:05,169
They're letting the big shots fly!

1533
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:06,838
-That was an all-out exchange!
-[bell dings]

1534
01:21:07,305 --> 01:21:09,307
[spectators cheering]

1535
01:21:13,411 --> 01:21:17,448
[Ohgon] <i>It felt like we both had the</i>
<i>same thought. "Leave it all out there."</i>

1536
01:21:18,483 --> 01:21:22,253
<i>If you're scared to get knocked out,</i>
<i>you can't throw punches like that.</i>

1537
01:21:31,596 --> 01:21:34,632
[Gyuwon] That showed us
exactly why boxing is

1538
01:21:34,699 --> 01:21:35,800
a form of art.

1539
01:21:39,671 --> 01:21:42,173
Man, he went the full six rounds.

1540
01:21:43,908 --> 01:21:47,011
-[Dex] Sungmin turned it up at the end.
-[Jongkook] He really did.

1541
01:21:47,078 --> 01:21:49,914
I liked how he threw those short punches

1542
01:21:49,981 --> 01:21:52,183
hunting for the big shots,

1543
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:53,918
but he waited on it too long.

1544
01:21:54,452 --> 01:21:57,088
Hong Sungmin didn't throw
as much as usual.

1545
01:21:57,155 --> 01:21:58,790
-It just wasn't enough.
-No.

1546
01:21:58,856 --> 01:22:01,726
-But Kwon fought incredibly hard.
-Right.

1547
01:22:01,793 --> 01:22:04,429
He wasn't fazed by the size difference
and showed great timing.

1548
01:22:05,964 --> 01:22:07,932
We will now announce the result.

1549
01:22:09,033 --> 01:22:10,468
Who's it gonna be?

1550
01:22:11,736 --> 01:22:13,137
Honestly, whoever wins,

1551
01:22:13,204 --> 01:22:15,707
-it's well deserved.
-Totally.

1552
01:22:15,773 --> 01:22:17,809
Boy, my heart's pounding.

1553
01:22:19,644 --> 01:22:21,412
-[sighs]
-[laughs]

1554
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:22,480
Was that scary?

1555
01:22:23,881 --> 01:22:26,985
[Jongkook] Judge one scores it for…

1556
01:22:30,955 --> 01:22:34,759
<i>We both fought hard,</i>
<i>right down to the wire.</i>

1557
01:22:35,793 --> 01:22:39,130
<i>I felt I landed the more impactful shots,</i>

1558
01:22:39,197 --> 01:22:42,200
<i>so I thought I might have the edge.</i>

1559
01:22:44,769 --> 01:22:46,471
Hong Sungmin in the blue corner.

1560
01:22:46,537 --> 01:22:49,407

Oh, my gosh!

1566
01:23:18,036 --> 01:23:21,339
The score is now one to one.

1567
01:23:22,507 --> 01:23:25,877
-This is not an easy call.
-It sure isn't.

1568
01:23:25,943 --> 01:23:30,448
Let's hear the third
and final judge's decision.

1569
01:23:31,049 --> 01:23:33,518
All right, the winner is…

1570
01:23:35,253 --> 01:23:37,755
<i>Still, I fought without regrets.</i>

1571
01:23:38,389 --> 01:23:41,459
<i>I honestly think I have it.</i>

1572
01:23:42,660 --> 01:23:44,629
[♪ tense music playing]

1573
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:55,273
Kwon Ohgon in the red corner.

1574
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:59,277
The winner is Kwon Ohgon
in the red corner.

1575
01:24:00,445 --> 01:24:02,480
Really? Is this for real?

1576
01:24:02,547 --> 01:24:03,881
-Yeah.
-He won?

1577
01:24:08,419 --> 01:24:11,422
First, I want to thank Hong Sungmin

1578
01:24:11,489 --> 01:24:13,791
for putting up such a hard fight.

1579
01:24:14,292 --> 01:24:18,229
I'll keep pushing in the semifinals
and make it to the finals. Thank you.

1580
01:24:18,296 --> 01:24:20,565
-Let's go!
-It's the semifinals!

1581
01:24:23,768 --> 01:24:27,505
I may have taken a loss in the ring today,

1582
01:24:27,572 --> 01:24:29,240
but I'll keep working toward

1583
01:24:30,241 --> 01:24:33,077
the gold medals I want to win

1584
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:35,646
throughout my career.

1585
01:24:35,713 --> 01:24:38,916
And Ohgon, thank you for the great fight.

1586
01:24:40,618 --> 01:24:42,587
-You did awesome!
-Very well fought!

1587
01:24:42,653 --> 01:24:45,123
-You did so well!
-You were great up there!

1588
01:24:49,927 --> 01:24:52,063
You did amazing up there.

1589
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:53,464
-Took a lot of shots?
-Well done.

1590
01:24:53,531 --> 01:24:54,532
-I'm fine.
-Yeah?

1591
01:24:54,599 --> 01:24:58,069
<i>I was just living my life training hard,</i>

1592
01:24:58,136 --> 01:25:00,104
<i>and it paid off</i>

1593
01:25:00,171 --> 01:25:04,242
with an opportunity like <i>I Am Boxer.</i>

1594
01:25:04,308 --> 01:25:06,010
I'll let myself feel disappointed

1595
01:25:06,077 --> 01:25:07,512
and a bit sad today.

1596
01:25:07,578 --> 01:25:10,014
But I'll continue to move closer
to my dream,

1597
01:25:10,081 --> 01:25:13,050
so I hope you'll stay with me
on this journey.

1598
01:25:15,987 --> 01:25:18,556
She's just too nervous to speak right now.

1599
01:25:19,423 --> 01:25:23,161
<i>My wife's been working so hard</i>
<i>raising our kid, honestly.</i>

1600
01:25:23,227 --> 01:25:25,830
<i>I'm incredibly grateful to her.</i>

1601
01:25:25,897 --> 01:25:29,100
<i>She always wanted to see me box,</i>
<i>so I'm glad I finally showed her.</i>

1602
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:31,636
I think I put on
a solid performance today,

1603
01:25:31,702 --> 01:25:33,204
so I'm pretty pleased about that.

1604
01:25:33,704 --> 01:25:35,773
I'll make sure to deliver

1605
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,843
in the matches ahead,
so please look forward to it.

1606
01:25:40,711 --> 01:25:44,048
<i>I never imagined I'd make it this far.</i>

1607
01:25:44,115 --> 01:25:47,185
<i>One more win puts me in the finals.</i>

1608
01:25:47,251 --> 01:25:49,554
<i>The title's not that far away now.</i>

1609
01:25:50,154 --> 01:25:53,324
<i>I won't go down in the ring,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

1610

-Let us begin the semifinals!
-Last round!

1611
01:25:56,527 --> 01:25:57,929
Pour it all out! All of it!

01:25:57,995 --> 01:25:59,030
Go for it now!

1613
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:01,699
-He's staggering!
-Real damage on Cho Hyunjae!

1614
01:26:01,766 --> 01:26:03,067
Real damage for sure!

1615
01:26:03,134 --> 01:26:04,268
Your parents are watching.

1616
01:26:04,335 --> 01:26:05,803
Keep going for your mom.

1617
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:08,005
It's not over until it's over!

1618
01:26:08,072 --> 01:26:10,107
Anything can change in a heartbeat!

1619
01:26:10,174 --> 01:26:11,676
The winner of this match is…

1620
01:26:12,176 --> 01:26:13,578
Let's begin

1621
01:26:14,245 --> 01:26:16,380
the finals of<i> I Am Boxer.</i>

1622
01:26:18,649 --> 01:26:20,251
Let's do this!

1623
01:26:20,751 --> 01:26:22,687
A special performance by ATEEZ!

1624
01:26:23,654 --> 01:26:26,057
The fact that this matchup

1625
01:26:26,123 --> 01:26:28,459
even came together is unbelievable.

1626
01:26:28,526 --> 01:26:29,627
Is this for real?

1627
01:26:29,694 --> 01:26:31,195
That punch looks lethal.

1628
01:26:31,696 --> 01:26:35,366
A new champion will be crowned here today!

1629
01:26:36,267 --> 01:26:37,368
Box!

1630
01:26:37,969 --> 01:26:40,071
