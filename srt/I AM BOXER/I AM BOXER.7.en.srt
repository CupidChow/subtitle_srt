This fight is

5
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:25,146
Three-Man Battle.

6
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:27,281
[Youngho, in Korean]
A three-way fight? Geez.

7
00:00:27,348 --> 00:00:29,316
-You're doing awesome!
-Push harder!

8
00:00:29,383 --> 00:00:30,518

This deathmatch is

15
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:44,665
The Tire Brawl.

16
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:48,335
[Jongkook] Both fighters will have
one foot placed in the tire

17
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:49,870
and box it out from there.

18
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:51,839
I think we should stop.

19
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:54,308
[Jongkook] The fight will go on

20
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,177
until the Master calls it.

21
00:00:56,744 --> 00:00:58,145
Should a KO occur,

22
00:00:58,212 --> 00:01:01,549
your survival or elimination
will be decided on the spot.

23
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:06,720
-[Bivol] There's a 21-kilo difference.
-[Don] Twenty-one? Wow.

KUK SEUNGJUN VS PARK YOUNGHO

26
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,059
Honestly, I felt confident. No joke.

27
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:14,795
I've fought against Kuk Seungjun before.

28
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:18,332
<i>I could see that he preferred</i>
<i>to fight on the outside.</i>

29
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:21,102
<i>But say you tie us up close?</i>

30
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:22,636
"Yeah, I think I can do this."

31
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:23,938
That's what I thought.

32
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:25,206
I was terrified.

33
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:27,408
I was like,
"If he hits me clean, I'm dead."

34
00:01:28,008 --> 00:01:32,146
<i>Still, his boxing experience isn't long.</i>

35
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:34,915
<i>I figured I'd use the body combos</i>
<i>I've sharpened with my technique</i>

36
00:01:34,982 --> 00:01:37,351
<i>and really use my skills to the fullest</i>

37
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:39,220
<i>to show what I'm made of.</i>

-He's aiming at the body.
-He's going to the body.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,468
Nice short shots!

[Youngho] <i>He kept going to my body</i>
<i>in the earlier match too.</i>

50
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:34,742
But I've never gone down
from taking a body shot.

51
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:36,744
[Don] Seungjun, get your guard up!

52
00:02:37,778 --> 00:02:40,581
<i>Honestly,</i>
<i>I don't recall feeling any of it.</i>

-Guard up and breathe!
-Guard up!

58

Park Youngho's durability is…

59
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,660
Very nice.

60
00:02:52,726 --> 00:02:53,894
[Donghyun] He's about to gas.

61
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:55,362
Just hang in there, Youngho.

62
00:02:58,465 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes, keep breathing. That's it.

63
00:03:04,972 --> 00:03:06,173
You've got more power!

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,042
Guard up!

65
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:09,877
Don't try to slip everything!
Guard up, man!

66
00:03:12,513 --> 00:03:13,681
Slip!

67
00:03:14,181 --> 00:03:15,616
-Slip!
-Okay, slip, slip.

68
00:03:15,683 --> 00:03:17,418
-His power is insane.
-Right.

69
00:03:17,484 --> 00:03:18,819
Like bam, bam, bam!

70
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:20,688
He handled that great. Close call there.

71
00:03:21,755 --> 00:03:23,524
You're fine. Nice, that was great!

72
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:25,593
Man, you're mad strong.

73
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:29,296
He took control with his power.

74
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:31,098
He kept firing combos,

75
00:03:31,165 --> 00:03:33,667
<i>and I struggled to put out anything clean.</i>

76
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:34,735
Box!

77
00:03:38,906 --> 00:03:40,741
<i>So I had to rethink my approach.</i>

78
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:43,510
You're stepping straight in, Seungjun!
Remember, two-step!

79
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:44,912
Keep your guard high!

80
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:47,848
Just try sticking it in!

81
00:03:47,915 --> 00:03:49,483
-Drive that body shot in!
-[contestant 2] Work!

82
00:03:51,752 --> 00:03:53,220
[Seungjun] <i>But even then,</i>

83
00:03:53,287 --> 00:03:56,390
<i>I put a lot more power</i>
<i>into the body shots.</i>

84
00:03:57,891 --> 00:04:00,160
He's starting to feel those body shots.

[Seungjun] <i>Seeing him duck down like that,</i>

109
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:32,886
<i>I just couldn't throw.</i>

110
00:05:32,953 --> 00:05:35,489
<i>As an active amateur fighter,</i>

111
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:37,958
<i>I didn't want to keep hitting a hobbyist.</i>

112
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,860
<i>I was waiting for the Master to call it.</i>

113
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:42,196
Come on, what's the matter?

114
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:43,530

but you can't hold back!

118

Seungjun, don't get soft!

119

<i>Ending the fight quickly</i>

122
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,482
so I decided to push hard.

How do you even recover from that?
Well, damn…

And even with the weight difference,

00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:42,890
Seungjun did very well.

134
00:06:42,956 --> 00:06:45,492
He really used every ounce
of strength he had.

He gave it everything.

<i>Muay Thai fighter remaining.</i>

178
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,368
Oh, they're Muay Thai guys?

179
00:09:08,936 --> 00:09:10,737
Which gym are you from?

180
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:13,807
I recently fought in O*E Championship.

181
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:15,142
Muay Thai or kickboxing?

182
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:17,678
-Muay Thai.
-Muay Thai? I see.

183
00:09:18,245 --> 00:09:20,647

184

<i>cheering so he'd do well.</i>

185
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:27,187
Hyunjun, watch out after you land one.

186
00:09:27,254 --> 00:09:29,122
Hyunjun, make it tougher on him.

187

You're not hurt anywhere, right?

191

Even so,
if only one of us gets to survive,

192
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:49,042
I think it should be me.

193

for two Muay Thai fighters to face off.

-All right!
-Looks like he's switched it on.

213

He needs to extend more.

<i>Since we were fighting close,</i>
<i>I kept a high guard…</i>

<i>That was the strategy.</i>

221
00:11:30,243 --> 00:11:31,812
He's doing this efficiently.

222
00:11:31,878 --> 00:11:33,647
Their strikes hit different.

223
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:39,920
[Jongkook] He needs to cover up.

He covered up, took what he had to,

00:26:46,058 --> 00:26:49,629
Hearing all these ring names,
it's really sinking in now.

526
00:26:50,129 --> 00:26:51,797
Do you have a ring name?

527
00:26:51,864 --> 00:26:53,065
No, I don't.

528
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:56,035
-Everyone just calls me "Mavely."
-[all laugh]

529
00:26:56,102 --> 00:26:58,537
Do you like it? "Mavely"?

530
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:00,206
Of course. I love it.

531
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,541
-What's this?
-Man, what's this?

532
00:27:02,608 --> 00:27:04,877
-[♪ upbeat jazz music playing]
-Looks delicious.

533
00:27:04,944 --> 00:27:06,345
Amazing!

534
00:27:06,412 --> 00:27:07,613
-Looks tasty.
-That's insane.

535
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,814
It's Korean pork.

536
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:10,616
Pork's rich in protein,

537
00:27:10,683 --> 00:27:12,385
and helps with post-workout recovery.

538
00:27:12,451 --> 00:27:14,153
I hope you all enjoy it.

539
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,657
Personally, I prefer pork over beef.

540
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:19,859
-Pork tastes better, to be honest.
-It does.

541
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:22,561
Pork fat, what we call lard…

542
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:24,330
People say it's not good for you,

543
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:25,598
but that's all old talk.

544
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:27,066
Hope you enjoy.

545
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:30,002
It's not like you need to cut weight now,
so go ahead and eat.

546
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:31,370
-[all laugh]
-Let's eat.

547
00:27:31,437 --> 00:27:32,538
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

548
00:27:32,605 --> 00:27:34,340
-Enjoy.
-Thank you for the food. Enjoy.

549
00:27:34,407 --> 00:27:36,142
-This must be the pork.
-Mmm.

550
00:27:39,512 --> 00:27:40,546
It's super good.

551
00:27:41,113 --> 00:27:42,415
Can I take the leftovers home?

552
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:44,684
The meat is ridiculously tender.

553
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,053
Isn't this exactly
what you need for your training?

554
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:48,254
Yeah, for sure.

555
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,489
Korean pork, man.

556
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:53,025
Is there a match
that stuck with you the most?

557
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:55,695
Well, I mean…
Like one that's burned into your mind?

558
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:58,931
-The Three-Man Battle was super tough.
-Really?

559
00:27:58,998 --> 00:28:00,299
The Three-Man Battle, huh?

560
00:28:00,366 --> 00:28:03,002
Master Lee pressed the button
way too late.

561
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:04,403
Did I?

562
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,239
Was there a set time to press it?

563
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:10,643
I mean, I kept thinking,
"Wait, why isn't he pressing it?"

564
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,712
No wonder he kept glancing over at me.

565
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,616
-Like, "What's taking him so long?"
-"It's about time, isn't it?"

566
00:28:17,683 --> 00:28:19,385
That's why I looked away.

567
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:25,191
Well, let's get down
to business now, shall we?

568
00:28:25,858 --> 00:28:27,760
The eight of you here

569
00:28:27,827 --> 00:28:31,297
will battle it out head-to-head
once again in the next round.

570
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:33,165
We are

571
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,068
-revealing it right here, right now.
-[all gasp, exclaim]

572
00:28:38,003 --> 00:28:39,004
All right.

573
00:28:40,072 --> 00:28:42,475
Hope this doesn't upset your stomach.

574
00:28:43,242 --> 00:28:45,444
Out of the original 90 fighters,

575
00:28:46,011 --> 00:28:48,914
only eight remain.

576
00:28:49,615 --> 00:28:50,750
The quarterfinals

577
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,320
will be a formal one-on-one boxing match

578
00:28:54,887 --> 00:28:56,021
with six rounds,

579
00:28:56,489 --> 00:28:58,758
each lasting three minutes.

580
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,226
[♪ tense music playing]

581
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:03,129
Six rounds.

582
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,264
I've never done that before.

583
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:07,900
I'm dead.

584
00:29:08,968 --> 00:29:10,603
-This is intense.
-It's all stamina.

585
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:15,341
[chuckling] <i>Why hit us with this</i>
<i>on such a good day?</i>

586

<i>a nice meal together.</i>

587
00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:22,348
<i>I suddenly felt like I couldn't breathe.</i>

588
00:29:23,716 --> 00:29:28,487
All right then,
in Master Don Lee's hands lies

589
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:30,289
the quarterfinals matchup list.

590
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,728

591

592
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:41,367
When your name is called,
please step forward.

593
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:46,005
The quarterfinals, bout number one.

594
00:29:47,306 --> 00:29:48,307
In the blue corner…

595
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:52,411

596
00:29:52,912 --> 00:29:55,281
Body Killer, Kuk Seungjun.

597
00:29:59,685 --> 00:30:00,753
In the red corner…

598
00:30:06,158 --> 00:30:08,127
Shotgun, Kim Hyunjun.

599
00:30:12,164 --> 00:30:13,666
Someone's gonna get dropped.

600
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,236
[Gijun] <i>These two never back down.</i>

601
00:30:17,303 --> 00:30:18,971
<i>This one's gonna be fun.</i>

602
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:21,607
A good-looking pair.

603
00:30:21,674 --> 00:30:24,476
Kuk Seungjun from the blue corner,

604
00:30:24,543 --> 00:30:26,779
do you have any words for your opponent?

605
00:30:27,546 --> 00:30:31,951
I haven't been happy
with any of my performances so far.

606
00:30:32,017 --> 00:30:34,587
This time, I'll leave nothing behind.

607
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:38,290
As the last man standing
from another discipline,

608
00:30:38,357 --> 00:30:40,292
I'll make sure to prove myself.

609
00:30:42,061 --> 00:30:44,230
<i>It's gonna be a wild back-and-forth.</i>

610
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,831
Who will win?

611
00:30:52,338 --> 00:30:55,274
KUK SEUNGJUN, BODY KILLER
KIM HYUNJUN, SHOTGUN

612
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:57,243
[Lee] The quarterfinals, bout number two.

[sighs]

614
00:30:59,311 --> 00:31:00,512
I'm nervous.

615
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,514
[Lee] In the blue corner…

616
00:31:03,082 --> 00:31:05,017

618
00:31:07,753 --> 00:31:11,290
[Hyunjae] <i>Hearing it was six rounds</i>

619

620
00:31:13,158 --> 00:31:15,361

621

YUK JUNSEO, 176 CM/67 KG

625
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:25,304
[Jongkook] These two have fought before,

626
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:26,739
though it was three-way.

627
00:31:28,908 --> 00:31:30,676
Yes, that went in clean.

628
00:31:30,743 --> 00:31:32,378
[contestant] He's doubling over.

629
00:31:32,444 --> 00:31:35,581
[Lee] The survivor of this match is
Cho Hyunjae from the white corner.

630
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:41,253
I'll make it undeniable
that I'm better this time.

631
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:43,989
He's a really tough opponent,

632
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,358
but losing's not an option for me.

633
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:48,193
I'll bring the heat.

634
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,261

<i>I can take him.</i>

<i>I'm definitely not behind.</i>

the strongest of the remaining fighters,

655
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:45,651
I'll finish this with a bang

656
00:32:45,718 --> 00:32:47,386
and move up.

657
00:32:50,322 --> 00:32:53,092
Ohgon's got a family to go home to,

658
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:55,294
so I'll at least spare his life.

00:35:58,944 --> 00:36:00,312
[Jongkook] And finally,

700
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:02,214
a grand prize.

701
00:36:03,048 --> 00:36:04,349
A grand prize of…

702
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:06,785
three hundred million won!

703
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:08,787
…three hundred million won!

704
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,358
[Jongkook] As expected,

705
00:36:13,425 --> 00:36:16,728
the crowd is really reacting to that.

706
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:19,498
Hearing that makes even me think

707
00:36:19,565 --> 00:36:22,367
if there's a next season,
maybe I should apply.

708
00:36:22,434 --> 00:36:23,835
[Jongkook] Yes, sure.

709
00:36:23,902 --> 00:36:25,571
All right then, welcome to <i>I Am Boxer.</i>

710
00:36:26,505 --> 00:36:29,041
Let's get this show on the road.

712

Hello, viewers.
Welcome to the <i>I Am Boxer</i> Quarterfinals.

713
00:36:36,782 --> 00:36:39,851
I'm sportscaster Seong Seungheon,
joined by commentator Lee Gyuwon.

714
00:36:39,918 --> 00:36:43,155
[Gyuwon] Tonight's stage is
more than just a fight.

715
00:36:43,222 --> 00:36:47,059
It's about showing the world
how far Korean boxing has come.

716
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:49,027
This is a match that demands more focus

717
00:36:49,094 --> 00:36:51,463
and stronger conviction than any before.

718
00:36:52,798 --> 00:36:54,600
The quarterfinals of <i>I Am Boxer.</i>

719
00:36:54,666 --> 00:36:56,935
Let the first bout begin.

[spectator 1] Looking sharp!

725
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:41,046
[spectator 2] Man, he could
easily pass for a celebrity.

726
00:37:42,781 --> 00:37:44,249
[spectator 3] What a stud!

727
00:37:48,453 --> 00:37:50,222
[spectator 4] He's a total prince.

728
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,629
[Jongkook] And the fighter facing
Kuk Seungjun…

729
00:37:58,096 --> 00:38:01,033

731
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:25,157
[Dex] Well, he's definitely got some fire.

732
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:27,559
[Jongkook] Nice, he's got good energy.

733
00:38:30,662 --> 00:38:31,863
You got this!

734
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,699

This one's gonna be good.

737
00:38:41,807 --> 00:38:44,476
-I really don't know how this one will go.
-[Jongkook] Really, no idea.

Jab, jab, jab!

763
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:01,753
I hit with instant explosive force,

764
00:40:02,454 --> 00:40:05,924
hence the ring name "Shotgun."

765
00:40:05,991 --> 00:40:08,059
Think of me as Seungjun
and go for the body.

766
00:40:08,126 --> 00:40:09,694
KIM TAEHAN
KIM HYUNJUN'S MUAY THAI MASTER

767
00:40:10,262 --> 00:40:12,197
[Hyunjun] <i>Since Kuk Seungjun is tall,</i>

768
00:40:12,264 --> 00:40:16,334
<i>I mostly practiced punching</i>
<i>upward.</i> [grunting]

769
00:40:16,401 --> 00:40:19,971
<i>Given his ring name, "Body Killer,"</i>

770
00:40:20,038 --> 00:40:22,541
<i>I figure if I take the fight inside,</i>

771
00:40:22,607 --> 00:40:24,142
<i>I've got a real shot at winning.</i>

772
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:28,380
I want him to get a taste of my power.

773
00:40:30,816 --> 00:40:34,085
[Seungjun] <i>I'm Kuk Seungjun</i>
<i>of the Hwasun County Boxing Team.</i>

774
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:38,523
<i>I won gold medals in both high school</i>
<i>and university divisions at the KNSF.</i>

775
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:44,196
<i>My main weapon is the body shot.</i>

776
00:40:45,297 --> 00:40:47,399
That's why I went with "Body Killer."

777
00:40:47,899 --> 00:40:49,901
Since it's a six three-minute bout,

778
00:40:49,968 --> 00:40:51,670
you can't waste your stamina.

779
00:40:51,736 --> 00:40:53,738
Keep moving as you throw.

780
00:40:54,906 --> 00:40:58,243
[Seungjun] <i>Kim Hyunjun is</i>
<i>in a higher weight class than me,</i>

781
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:02,414
<i>so I prepared by doing longer rounds</i>
<i>with a heavier sparring partner.</i>

782
00:41:03,582 --> 00:41:05,283
That's the only way to get him!

783
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:09,955
When it comes to boxing,
I think I've got a definite advantage.

784
00:41:12,357 --> 00:41:16,194
[Jongkook] Before we start,
let's hear what the fighters have to say.

785
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:19,631
[Hyunjun] I climbed past
a lot of heavy hitters to get here.

786
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:21,633
No knees, no kicks.

787
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,504
I'll put him down using only my fists.

788
00:41:26,471 --> 00:41:28,807
[audience cheering]

789
00:41:31,243 --> 00:41:35,380
To a Muay Thai fighter
who trains with both hands and feet,

790
00:41:35,947 --> 00:41:40,519
I'll demonstrate the beauty of boxing,
where we train only with these fists.

791
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:41,853
[audience] Ooh!

792
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,922
[cheering]

793
00:41:45,957 --> 00:41:47,392
Their lines are getting good.

794
00:41:49,194 --> 00:41:51,263
[Seungheon]
The first match prepared for today

795
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:53,298
is between Kuk Seungjun and Kim Hyunjun.

796
00:41:53,365 --> 00:41:57,802
One of the biggest factors this time is
that it's a six three-minute round bout.

797
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:01,373
[Gyuwon] Exactly. The sixth round
will be the biggest factor.

798
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:04,242
-Kuk Seungjun is used to three-rounders.
-[Seungheon] Right.

799
00:42:04,309 --> 00:42:06,144
[Gyuwon] This is his first six-rounder.

800
00:42:06,211 --> 00:42:09,247
I'm curious if he will be able
to withstand the pressure.

801
00:42:09,314 --> 00:42:12,117
[Seungheon]
Meanwhile, Kim Hyunjun's strengths

802
00:42:12,183 --> 00:42:15,220
are his endurance and relentlessness.

803
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:19,991
I'm really looking forward to seeing
how he's adapted to the boxing rules.

804
00:42:20,058 --> 00:42:22,961
Seungjun is tall and has long reach,
but he's no out-boxer.

805
00:42:23,028 --> 00:42:25,764
-He just crashes in and brawls.
-That's right.

806
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:29,301
-So this fight should be super fiery.
-[Jongkook] It'll be fun.

807
00:42:29,367 --> 00:42:30,802
Yeah, real fiery.

808
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:32,571
You can turn into it and swing.

809
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:34,005
Don't just stay square.

810
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,675
And don't play in the center.

811
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:38,910
Push him to the corner.

812
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:41,746
You have plenty of time
to show your skill, okay?

813
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:44,516
Lure him in, tag with your lead hand.

814
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:45,917
Rotate, then rip the body.

815
00:42:45,984 --> 00:42:48,119
Who's your bet? My vote's on Shotgun.

816
00:42:49,754 --> 00:42:50,755
You too?

KIM HYUNJUN X KUK SEUNGJUN

823
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:10,542
[Seungheon, in Korean] Here come
both fighters for the first round.

824
00:43:12,577 --> 00:43:16,047
Kuk Seungjun starts off with a jab
to the body using his long reach.

825
00:43:16,615 --> 00:43:17,682
Sticking light jabs.

826
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:20,352
Curious to see how his opponent
plans to get past that reach.

827
00:43:22,587 --> 00:43:25,423
-He's using his footwork today.
-Mmm.

828
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:28,526
[Lee] With the larger ring,
he's really making use of his footwork.

829
00:43:28,994 --> 00:43:30,562
[Jongkook] He's going a bit out-boxer.

830
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:33,431
[Seungjun]
<i>When it comes to boxing distance,</i>

831
00:43:33,498 --> 00:43:35,734
<i>that's where I've got the edge.</i>

832
00:43:36,368 --> 00:43:40,605
<i>My plan was to establish my range</i>
<i>and run the fight from there.</i>

833
00:43:41,206 --> 00:43:42,207
[Gyuwon] Nice body shot!

834
00:43:42,273 --> 00:43:44,476
-That was perfect timing.
-[Seungheon] Indeed.

835
00:43:45,844 --> 00:43:46,845
[Lee] That's it.

836
00:43:47,545 --> 00:43:49,280
Strike and keep pivoting.

837
00:43:50,148 --> 00:43:52,651
[♪ tense music playing]

838
00:43:56,655 --> 00:44:00,725
Kuk Seungjun's jabbing
to bait him in a little.

839
00:44:01,292 --> 00:44:04,529
And Kim Hyunjun looks like
he's loading up for a big shot.

840
00:44:04,596 --> 00:44:05,697
-[audience gasps]
-Just like that.

841
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:08,600
Oh.

842
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,368
[Jonghoon] Relax, he missed! Take it easy.

843
00:44:13,705 --> 00:44:15,040
[audience member] He's coming!

[Hyunjun]
<i>I thought Seungjun was an infighter,</i>

847
00:44:23,982 --> 00:44:27,052
<i>but when I saw him</i>
<i>trying to fight from a distance,</i>

848
00:44:27,552 --> 00:44:30,221
<i>I knew I had to close the distance.</i>

849
00:44:31,189 --> 00:44:32,190
[trainer] That's it!

850
00:44:32,691 --> 00:44:35,060
Get in there! Don't let him off the hook!

851
00:44:37,696 --> 00:44:38,897
Keep it long!

852
00:44:41,866 --> 00:44:46,004
[Gyuwon] Kim Hyunjun's showing zero fear
of Kuk Seungjun's punches.

853
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:50,942
[Seungheon] Looks like he's thinking
he can handle the shots.

854
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,244
And he closes in!

855
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:54,312
[audience member] Nice!

856
00:44:55,313 --> 00:44:56,948
[Seungheon]
Sharp left hand on Kuk Seungjun!

857
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:02,387
Whoa, big left landing there.

858
00:45:06,157 --> 00:45:07,292
[audience member] Slip that!

859
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:10,195
Kim Hyunjun's punches aren't connecting
as much as expected.

860
00:45:10,261 --> 00:45:11,463
He's moving his feet a lot.

861
00:45:11,529 --> 00:45:14,065
-You mean Kuk Seungjun? I see.
-Yeah.

862
00:45:14,132 --> 00:45:16,267
[Dex] He's constantly going
for that hit-and-move.

863
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:19,070
[Lee]
He's constantly circling left and right.

864
00:45:19,137 --> 00:45:20,939
-The hit-and-move.
-[Dex exclaims]

865
00:45:21,005 --> 00:45:23,708
Hyunjun can't get the distance.
He hasn't found his range at all.

866
00:45:23,775 --> 00:45:25,343
[Dex] He's gotta be thrown off.

867
00:45:29,214 --> 00:45:31,116
[Lee] Look, those kinds of body shots.

868
00:45:31,182 --> 00:45:32,517
He's hunting for those.

869
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,055
-[bell dings]
-[referee, in English] Okay, stop!

870
00:45:37,122 --> 00:45:39,290
[Seungheon, in Korean]
And that's the end of the first round!

871
00:45:39,357 --> 00:45:40,358
[audience cheers]

872
00:45:40,425 --> 00:45:44,162
[Gyuwon] That was a first round
fought like a final round.

873
00:45:44,662 --> 00:45:48,066
[Seungheon] Kim Hyunjun pushed forward
and tried to take control,

874
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:50,769
but Kuk Seungjun's pinpoint shots
were incredibly impressive.

875
00:45:50,835 --> 00:45:53,805
What's smart about Kuk Seungjun's play is,

876
00:45:53,872 --> 00:45:55,874
when we gave him a small ring,

877
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,642
-he fought inside.
-Yeah.

878
00:45:57,709 --> 00:45:58,910
Now that the ring is big,

879
00:45:58,977 --> 00:46:00,512
-he's showing much more movement.
-Mmm.

880
00:46:00,578 --> 00:46:04,983
You're fighting great right now,
but you get clipped when you get out.

881
00:46:05,049 --> 00:46:06,785
-Watch out for that, okay?
-[Seungjun] Okay.

882
00:46:07,385 --> 00:46:09,020
<i>I'm thinking if I keep this up,</i>

883
00:46:09,087 --> 00:46:12,557
<i>I should have the edge in this fight.</i>

884
00:46:12,624 --> 00:46:15,093
[trainer] He keeps throwing jabs.
That's when you should stick it.

885
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,728
Don't try to end it with one shot.

886
00:46:16,795 --> 00:46:18,196
Make your moment, got it?

887
00:46:18,763 --> 00:46:21,766
[Hyunjun] <i>Right now,</i>
<i>I'm losing on distance and footwork,</i>

888
00:46:22,367 --> 00:46:24,102
<i>so I have to dig further in.</i>

889
00:46:24,736 --> 00:46:25,904
[whistle blows]

890
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:28,072
All right, let's start the second round!

You have to just go for it.

896

-[audience member] Go in further!
-Right.

897
00:46:45,256 --> 00:46:46,457
[Lee] He's pivoting.

898
00:46:46,524 --> 00:46:48,193
[Jonghoon] Okay, nice body shot!

899
00:46:48,259 --> 00:46:49,794
[Dex] Yes, there it is.

900
00:46:49,861 --> 00:46:51,963
[Seungheon] He's now using
his footwork more. Falling back.

901
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,364
And another body shot!

902
00:46:53,965 --> 00:46:55,300
[audience member] All right!

903
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,635
He's starting to work the body.

904
00:46:58,203 --> 00:47:01,873
[Seungjun]
<i>With Hyunjun coming forward aggressively,</i>

905
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,711
<i>I took a step back</i>
<i>and worked my specialty, the body shots.</i>

906
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:09,214
[audience member] That's it!

907
00:47:13,818 --> 00:47:15,286
-[audience member 2] There you go!
-Ooh.

908
00:47:16,154 --> 00:47:18,957
[Gyuwon] That body shot landed
right in the gut!

909
00:47:19,023 --> 00:47:20,191
[audience member] Move away!

910
00:47:20,258 --> 00:47:21,392
[Lee, Dex gasping]

911
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,128
[Dex] He's definitely feeling it now.

912
00:47:27,332 --> 00:47:28,800
[Seungheon]
Kuk Seungjun drifts to the back.

913
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:31,402
[Hyunjun] <i>I pushed in harder</i>
<i>than in the first round,</i>

914
00:47:31,469 --> 00:47:34,639
<i>but Seungjun's footwork was too good,</i>
<i>I couldn't catch him.</i>

915
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,408
<i>I knew I had to stop him somehow.</i>

916
00:47:37,475 --> 00:47:38,676
<i>So I decided to corner him.</i>

917
00:47:38,743 --> 00:47:40,178
[audience member] All right!

918
00:47:40,245 --> 00:47:42,614
[Seungheon]
Kim Hyunjun fires back! Left and right!

919
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,550
He's got to really pressure him
to drain his gas tank.

920
00:47:45,617 --> 00:47:49,187
Kim Hyunjun's not going to
run out of steam easily.

921
00:47:50,488 --> 00:47:52,457
[Dex] He's got solid durability too.

922
00:47:55,226 --> 00:47:56,628
[Seungheon exclaims]

923
00:47:57,795 --> 00:47:59,264

[audience gasps]

925
00:48:01,232 --> 00:48:02,500
Go for it! Yes, go for it!

926
00:48:02,567 --> 00:48:03,735
-There you go.
-That's it.

927
00:48:03,801 --> 00:48:05,370
Can't just sit and wait, you know.

928
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:07,572
[Seungheon] Kim Hyunjun
threads that left in beautifully!

929
00:48:08,539 --> 00:48:09,540
Nice body shot!

930
00:48:10,608 --> 00:48:11,609
[Gyuwon exclaims]

931
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:15,914
[Seungheon] Neither fighter is
fighting for points.

932
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,917
They want real damage
that could lead to a knockdown.

933
00:48:22,587 --> 00:48:26,190
[Gyuwon] Kim Hyunjun's adding pressure,
and it's genuinely terrifying.

934
00:48:26,257 --> 00:48:31,162
That's probably making it tough
for Kuk Seungjun to find clean openings.

935
00:48:37,135 --> 00:48:38,136
-[bell dings]
-Stop!

936
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:39,904
[Seungheon] And just like that,
the round ends!

937
00:48:39,971 --> 00:48:41,973
[audience cheering, applauding]

938
00:48:44,042 --> 00:48:45,610
Keep it rough like that.

939
00:48:45,677 --> 00:48:48,079
And you have to fire back
when he comes in.

940
00:48:48,146 --> 00:48:51,215
Hard to tell
where Hyunjun's stamina is right now.

941
00:48:51,282 --> 00:48:53,851
He might look fine,
but he has still taken a few to the body.

942
00:48:53,918 --> 00:48:55,586
-Little by little, that adds up.
-Right.

943
00:48:55,653 --> 00:48:59,557
Those body shots are starting
to take their toll, I believe.

944
00:48:59,624 --> 00:49:01,059
Even for someone like him.

945
00:49:01,125 --> 00:49:03,494
[Hyunjun] <i>Seungjun's punches</i>
<i>weren't painful per se.</i>

946
00:49:03,561 --> 00:49:06,230
But when you keep eating them,
it gets annoying.

947
00:49:06,297 --> 00:49:09,000
<i>Since he knows</i>
<i>I'm hunting for that big shot,</i>

948
00:49:09,067 --> 00:49:12,003
<i>I figured I'd have to sneak it in</i>
<i>in the third round.</i>

949
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,237
You're doing well.

950
00:49:13,304 --> 00:49:15,373
Keep the footwork under control.
He's easy to read.

951
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,641
-Am I right?
-Right.

952
00:49:17,575 --> 00:49:19,210
[Seungjun] <i>The plan was to conserve energy</i>

953
00:49:19,711 --> 00:49:21,112
<i>and keep movement to a minimum.</i>

954
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:22,380
Fight with confidence, kid.

955
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:26,517
[Seungheon] Let's see how Round 3 unfolds.
Round 3 coming up next.

Let's go, Seungjun!

957
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:32,390
I'm curious to see
how Kuk Seungjun handles this round.

958

[Seungheon] Round 3 has begun.

961
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,395
Kim guards up and goes back in.

962
00:49:37,462 --> 00:49:41,199
[Gyuwon] Round 3 is going to be
crucial for both fighters.

963
00:49:45,103 --> 00:49:46,971
[audience member] All right! Nice shot!

964

Don't trade with him!

He digs inside, aiming upstairs.

967
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,548
Kuk Seungjun backs out.

[Lee] Well, that was neat!

980
00:50:33,885 --> 00:50:35,219
That one-two was sharp.

981
00:50:37,889 --> 00:50:41,225
[Gyuwon] Kim Hyunjun's still taunting,
but he can't afford to eat shots here!

982
00:50:43,027 --> 00:50:44,295
That connected!

[exclaiming]

984
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:53,671
[Gyuwon] But it seems
Kim Hyunjun is tracking every punch.

985
00:50:53,738 --> 00:50:55,440
The shots you see won't drop you.

986
00:50:55,506 --> 00:50:56,741
[Seungheon] That's right.

987
00:50:56,808 --> 00:50:58,076

[Dex] Seungjun's running out of steam now.

992
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,555

996
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:22,900
[Gyuwon] That sway is an indicator

997
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:25,103
that he's figured out
Kuk Seungjun's rhythm.

998
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:28,172
[Seungheon] That's right.
And Kuk Seungjun is looking visibly tired.

999
00:51:29,674 --> 00:51:32,810
[Lee] Seungjun needs to tighten his guard
and start engaging.

00:51:35,546 --> 00:51:37,115
[Seungheon] Guard up, back in he goes.

1001
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:38,549
He keeps going to the left.

1002
00:51:38,616 --> 00:51:40,585

[spectators exclaiming]

1032
00:52:44,315 --> 00:52:45,316
[spectator 1] That landed!

1033
00:52:45,783 --> 00:52:47,752
[spectator 2] Hyunjun,
stay rough! Throw them in pairs!

1034
00:52:48,186 --> 00:52:50,154
Looks like he's been saving energy.

1035
00:52:52,557 --> 00:52:53,624
[Seungheon] Here he comes!

1036
00:52:53,691 --> 00:52:55,059
[spectators exclaim]

1037
00:52:55,126 --> 00:52:56,460
Whoa, that landed.

1038
00:52:57,395 --> 00:52:59,230
[Seungjun] <i>I felt</i>
<i>like I was finding my groove…</i>

1039
00:52:59,297 --> 00:53:00,364
[exclaiming continues]

1040
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:02,233
[Seungjun] <i>…but then I ended</i>
<i>up eating a big one.</i>

1041
00:53:02,934 --> 00:53:04,435
<i>I'm like, "He's got insane power."</i>

1042
00:53:04,502 --> 00:53:06,837
<i>"If that lands clean, I'm in trouble."</i>

1043
00:53:06,904 --> 00:53:08,139
He's falling for the same shot.

1044
00:53:08,206 --> 00:53:09,607
He could use more head movement.

1045
00:53:09,674 --> 00:53:10,675
[spectator 1] All right!

1046
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:17,348
[Hyunjun] <i>Kuk Seungjun kept running</i>
<i>around during the first three rounds,</i>

1047
00:53:17,415 --> 00:53:20,885
<i>so once we hit Round 4,</i>
<i>he was clearly gassed.</i>

1048
00:53:21,586 --> 00:53:24,655
<i>I hadn't even used half my tank,</i>

1049
00:53:24,722 --> 00:53:27,291
so I had the edge in stamina.

1050
00:53:28,826 --> 00:53:30,127
[Seungheon] Now he presses forward.

1051
00:53:30,194 --> 00:53:32,129
Kuk Seungjun goes in
and lands a great body shot!

1052
00:53:32,196 --> 00:53:33,197
Circle out of there!

1053
00:53:33,264 --> 00:53:34,865
Kim Hyunjun fires back with an uppercut!

1054
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,369
Kim Hyunjun fires back with an uppercut!

1055
00:53:38,436 --> 00:53:40,071
He's got to watch that hand.

1056
00:53:40,137 --> 00:53:41,939
Eyes on his chest! Push in!

1057
00:53:42,607 --> 00:53:43,841
[spectator 2] Nice shot!

1058
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:45,643
[spectator 3] Keep going!

1059
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:48,179
His shots aren't landing though.

1060
00:53:48,246 --> 00:53:49,547
There's no weight behind them.

1061
00:53:50,548 --> 00:53:51,816
[Lee] He's burned a lot of energy.

1062
00:53:51,882 --> 00:53:53,417
He keeps leaning forward like that.

1063
00:53:53,484 --> 00:53:54,885
That's how you get tagged big.

1064
00:53:55,486 --> 00:53:57,455
[spectator 1] Backhand, counter!

1065
00:53:57,955 --> 00:53:59,590
[spectator 2] Nice! That's it!

1066
00:54:00,224 --> 00:54:01,425
Doing good, Seungjun!

1067
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:03,728
Ten seconds!

1068
00:54:05,396 --> 00:54:07,531
[Jongkook] He's swinging big.

1069
00:54:11,335 --> 00:54:12,336
[bell dings]

1070
00:54:12,403 --> 00:54:14,739
-Stop!

[applause]

1072
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:19,944
This is gonna be tough to call.

1073
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:21,646
We're already in the fifth. What now?

-[Jongkook chuckles]
-[sighs]

1075
00:54:23,981 --> 00:54:26,517
[Seungjun] <i>Honestly,</i>
<i>I was starting to gas out.</i>

1076
00:54:26,584 --> 00:54:28,252
<i>So I told myself to lock in.</i>

1077
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,787
[Hyunjun] <i>I managed to land a big shot,</i>

1078
00:54:29,854 --> 00:54:31,622
<i>so I just needed to keep it up.</i>

1079
00:54:31,689 --> 00:54:32,990
[bell dings]

1080
00:54:33,057 --> 00:54:34,091

[spectator 3] Man, that was close!

1084
00:54:43,701 --> 00:54:45,036
[Jongkook] He slipped well this time.

1085
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,208
You've gotta go. Yes, go now.

1086
00:54:52,643 --> 00:54:55,446
[Seungheon] Kim Hyunjun charges
forward relentlessly.

1087
00:54:55,513 --> 00:54:56,981
[Lee] Hey, careful, careful.

1088
00:54:57,048 --> 00:54:58,249
Stop!

1089
00:55:00,051 --> 00:55:01,585
[Dex] They both seem a bit tired.

1090
00:55:01,652 --> 00:55:03,354
All right, box!

1091
00:55:03,854 --> 00:55:04,922
[referee] Go in now!

1092
00:55:04,989 --> 00:55:06,123
[spectator 1] That's it!

1093
00:55:08,092 --> 00:55:09,093
[Dex] Oh, boy.

1094
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,461
Is he bleeding?

1095
00:55:10,528 --> 00:55:13,597
[gasps] His fighting spirit is insane.

[Dex exclaiming]

1097
00:55:17,068 --> 00:55:18,302
[spectator 1] That was…

1098
00:55:18,369 --> 00:55:20,471
That same shot keeps landing.

1099
00:55:20,938 --> 00:55:23,941
[Seungjun] <i>He was throwing</i>
<i>at strange beats, and it threw me off.</i>

1100
00:55:24,008 --> 00:55:25,443
<i>I couldn't afford to lose focus.</i>

1101
00:55:25,509 --> 00:55:26,510
[spectator 1] Great!

1102
00:55:26,577 --> 00:55:27,978
[spectator 2] All right!

1103
00:55:28,045 --> 00:55:29,914
[Seungheon] Once he got
that distance down,

1104
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,383
he's landing with more effect now.

1105
00:55:33,284 --> 00:55:34,719
He just keeps coming.

1106
00:55:41,492 --> 00:55:42,526
[referee] Careful, the head!

1107
00:55:42,593 --> 00:55:43,861
-[exclaims]
-Man, they've headbutted.

1108
00:55:43,928 --> 00:55:45,296
There must've been a headbutt.

1109
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,365
[Gyuwon] That was a heavy collision.

1110
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:49,166
When you charge in like that…

1111
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:53,304
This happens all the time in pro boxing.

1112
00:55:53,371 --> 00:55:54,572
[Seungheon] That's right.

1113
00:55:54,638 --> 00:55:56,640
[referee] Hold on.
Let's wipe the blood off.

1114
00:55:57,541 --> 00:55:59,777
Well, that wasn't intentional.

1116
00:56:02,113 --> 00:56:03,180

Just score points.

Dive headfirst, but don't lift.

Just dive in and pour it all out.

<i>in this final round.</i>

1139

[Seungjun] <i>I've got to dig deep now.</i>

00:57:00,171 --> 00:57:03,140

Here we go.

00:57:18,556 --> 00:57:20,458
Stepping forward,
Kim Hyunjun moves in tight.

1150
00:57:21,926 --> 00:57:23,828
[Dex] They're lighting it up.

1151
00:57:23,894 --> 00:57:25,596
[Jongkook] Yes, that's how you do it.

1152
00:57:25,663 --> 00:57:26,664
[Lee exclaims]

1153
00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:29,033
[Seungheon] He swings big with the left,
then pulls back!

1154
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:32,069
Kuk Seungjun presses forward again,
using big upper-body movement!

1155
00:57:32,136 --> 00:57:34,405
While in close,
Kim Hyunjun fires short punches!

1156
00:57:34,472 --> 00:57:36,240
-Doing pretty well.
-I'm proud of him.

1157
00:57:36,307 --> 00:57:37,308
He's good.

1158
00:57:37,908 --> 00:57:38,909
[spectator 1] Very.

1159
00:57:39,443 --> 00:57:40,678
[spectator 2] All right!

1160
00:57:42,813 --> 00:57:45,015
[spectator 3] Yes, that's it! Nice shot!

00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:46,750
[Lee gasps]

1162
00:57:46,817 --> 00:57:49,653
Kuk Seungjun's using
a ton of head movement.

1163
00:57:53,791 --> 00:57:56,427
[Gyuwon] He's waiting for
the right timing, looking to put him down.

1164
00:57:56,927 --> 00:57:58,896
It's the last one,
so they're just going all out.

1165
00:57:58,963 --> 00:58:00,931
No need to think about what comes next.

1166
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,568
[Seungheon] The volume definitely matters,

1167
00:58:04,635 --> 00:58:06,537
but landing clean shots is crucial here!

1168
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:09,173
[Lee] There you go!

1169
00:58:10,774 --> 00:58:11,775
There you go!

1170
00:58:11,842 --> 00:58:13,210
Work it up and down.

1171
00:58:15,846 --> 00:58:18,616
[Gyuwon] Kuk Seungjun is showing
amazing speed.

1172
00:58:20,718 --> 00:58:24,121
[Seungheon] Kuk Seungjun's finding
a second wind this round.

1173
00:58:24,188 --> 00:58:25,890
[Gyuwon] Real grit he's got there.

1174
00:58:25,956 --> 00:58:27,258
[spectator 1] Nice rhythm!

1175
00:58:27,324 --> 00:58:30,194
-Kuk's more durable than you'd think.
-You're right.

1176
00:58:31,095 --> 00:58:32,463
He just keeps going like that.

1177
00:58:35,366 --> 00:58:37,034
[spectator 1] All right! That's it!

1178
00:58:39,236 --> 00:58:41,672
[Seungheon] Kuk Seungjun is focusing
on volume now.

1179
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:47,912
[Jongkook exclaiming]

1180
00:58:50,848 --> 00:58:53,284
[Gyuwon] Since Kuk Seungjun is
always the one to land first,

1181
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:56,353
it's definitely starting
to take a toll on Kim Hyunjun.

1182
00:58:57,354 --> 00:58:58,756
[spectators exclaim]

1183
00:58:58,822 --> 00:59:00,291
-[Dex] It's a slip!
-[spectator 1] Slip!

1184
00:59:00,357 --> 00:59:02,560
-[referee] Get up.
-[spectator 2] Last round, focus!

1185
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:04,828
[spectators exclaiming continues]

1186
00:59:04,895 --> 00:59:06,330
You got this!

1187
00:59:06,931 --> 00:59:08,332
[spectator] Let's go, Kim Hyunjun!

1188
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:12,269
[Hyunjun] <i>Don't give up.</i>
<i>Finish it with no regrets.</i>

1189
00:59:13,003 --> 00:59:15,072
[Seungjun] <i>Show</i>
<i>that fighting spirit to the very end.</i>

1190
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:17,541
[referee] Box!

1191
00:59:18,075 --> 00:59:20,377
[Seungheon] Here comes
the final push from Kim Hyunjun!

1192
00:59:20,444 --> 00:59:22,146
He's targeting the inside. Body again!

1193
00:59:34,091 --> 00:59:35,859
Kuk Seungjun's actually pushing him back.

1194
00:59:35,926 --> 00:59:37,461
Exactly.

1195
00:59:37,528 --> 00:59:38,729
[spectator 1] All right, nice!

1196
00:59:40,631 --> 00:59:41,799
[spectator 2] Keep it up!

1197
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:44,001

01:09:42,065 --> 01:09:44,034
<i>it might not be impossible after all.</i>

1367
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:51,641
[Gyuwon] He landed a heavy straight
with that lead hand.

1368
01:09:54,744 --> 01:09:56,813
[Dex]
I bet Cho Hyunjae's feeling the weight.

1369
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,882
[Jongkook] He's probably never felt
shots like that before.

1370
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:00,884
[Dex] Right, he throws with raw power.

1371
01:10:01,651 --> 01:10:03,420
-It's all instinct, you know.
-[ref in English] Stop.

1372
01:10:06,056 --> 01:10:08,024
[brother] Hyunjae, use your footwork.

1373
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:09,125
No holding.

1374
01:10:09,192 --> 01:10:11,194
[Hyunjae] <i>I was a bit caught off guard.</i>

1375
01:10:11,261 --> 01:10:13,129
-[in English] Box!
-[♪ tense music playing]

1376
01:10:13,196 --> 01:10:16,499
[Hyunjae] <i>I'd fought him before,</i>
<i>so I thought I had a read on his style,</i>

1377
01:10:16,566 --> 01:10:20,103
<i>but he opened</i>
<i>with a completely different approach.</i>

1378
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:21,404
<i>That caught me off guard.</i>

1379
01:10:23,006 --> 01:10:27,911
[Junseo] <i>I plan to be really aggressive</i>
<i>in the clinch.</i>

1380
01:10:28,478 --> 01:10:30,847
That kind of grabbing
should really rattle him up.

1381
01:10:31,881 --> 01:10:33,817
[spectator 5]
Nice, he's pretty tense right now!

1382
01:10:37,787 --> 01:10:39,356
[Seungheon] Coming in, Yuk Junseo.

1383
01:10:43,426 --> 01:10:44,861
[♪ tense music playing]

1384
01:10:44,928 --> 01:10:46,730
[spectator 6] All right! Doing good!

1385
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,965
All right! Doing good!

1386
01:10:50,267 --> 01:10:51,735
[Lee] Counters like that.

1387
01:10:52,435 --> 01:10:54,704
-They're big if you walk into them.
-Exactly.

1388
01:10:54,771 --> 01:10:55,839
Nice shot!

1389
01:10:56,339 --> 01:10:57,340
[ref] Break it up!

1390
01:11:01,645 --> 01:11:02,879
[spectator 5] Guard up, man!

1391
01:11:06,516 --> 01:11:08,385
[Gyuwon]
After Yuk Junseo took that one shot,

1392
01:11:08,451 --> 01:11:09,853
he's struggling to find his range.

1393
01:11:09,919 --> 01:11:11,988
That's right!
And that's when you need composure.

1394
01:11:12,555 --> 01:11:14,691
[Gyuwon] Yuk Junseo,
now carefully putting up his guard.

1395
01:11:16,126 --> 01:11:19,296
-[Lee] That right hand's all Junseo's got.
-[Jongkook] You're right.

1396
01:11:19,362 --> 01:11:20,563
[coach] Guard up!

1397
01:11:21,231 --> 01:11:23,133
[Dex]
He just needs to drive it in with power.

1398
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:24,868
It all depends on that one shot.

1399
01:11:28,938 --> 01:11:30,173
He's not gonna get caught.

1400
01:11:31,941 --> 01:11:34,144
Wait, he got caught? For real?

1401
01:11:36,646 --> 01:11:39,049
Ha, ha, ha. See, I told you!

1402
01:11:39,115 --> 01:11:40,383
[gasps]

1403
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:46,289
He's totally found his rhythm.
This is bad.

1404
01:11:46,356 --> 01:11:47,691
Yes, that's it!

1405
01:11:47,757 --> 01:11:51,061
[Gyuwon]
Look at that unpredictable explosiveness!

1406
01:11:51,127 --> 01:11:53,129
Cho Hyunjae won't like that at all.

1407
01:11:53,663 --> 01:11:54,664
Damn it!

1408
01:11:54,731 --> 01:11:56,199
Man, this one's hard to tell.

1409
01:11:56,266 --> 01:11:58,201
[Dex] Striker, Lee Gijun!
Prince, Lee Chaehyun!

1410
01:11:58,768 --> 01:12:00,637
That's it, one-two! Nice!

1411
01:12:00,704 --> 01:12:03,106
[audience exclaiming]

1412
01:12:04,374 --> 01:12:05,742
Go for it!

1413
01:12:06,609 --> 01:12:07,744
He's fast.

1414
01:12:08,878 --> 01:12:10,313
[ref] Down!

1415
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:12,549
-Keep going, keep going!
-Whoa!

1416
01:12:12,615 --> 01:12:14,117
[Dex] Thunder, Kwon Ohgon!

1417
01:12:14,184 --> 01:12:15,752
Tyson, Hong Sungmin!

1418
01:12:17,387 --> 01:12:19,022
[audience shouting]

1419
01:12:19,089 --> 01:12:20,690
-Come on!
-Don't let him hit you!

1420
01:12:21,157 --> 01:12:23,860
[Lee]
He's fighting on a one-percent chance.

1421
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:26,896
[Hyunjae] <i>I'll fight to the end and win,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

1422
01:12:26,963 --> 01:12:29,132
[Lee] The winner of this match is…

1423
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,201
[♪ rhythmic music playing]

1424
