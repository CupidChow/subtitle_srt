00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,566
[contestant 1, in English] Open the doors.

6
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,335
-Wow.
-[contestant 2, in Korean] Goodness.

7
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,338
[Donghoe] This place feels
way too familiar now, huh?

8
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,240
[Youngho] Long time no see.

9
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,142
It's been a hot minute.

10
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,210
-It's exactly how I remember it.
-[contestant 2] Exactly the same.

11
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,345
Nothing's changed.

12
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,148
-It's good to see you, sir.
-Likewise.

13
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,150
-Oh, hey.
-Hello, sir.

14
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,620
Been good, my man?
Looking as handsome as ever, huh?

15
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:57,357
-Saw you grinding the other day.
-Nah, I'm just doing what I can.

16
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,558
Oh, hey.

17
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,026
Do you live around here?

18
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:01,728
-Yeah, I live nearby.
-Right?

19
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:03,863
[Youngho] Did you have breakfast?

20
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,833
-[Gijun] No, I skipped it.
-There's a lot of food here.

21
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,602
[contestant] What's good?

22
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,272
[Junseo] Try the K**danmyeon
with some sauce.

23
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,706
It's actually pretty good.

24
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,645
It does kind of smell like chicken breast.

25
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,346
-It does?
-Oh, you're right.

26
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,982
-It totally does.
-It's super high in protein.

27
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,585
People who train should love this stuff.

28
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,787
Do you eat a lot
of high-protein stuff, Gijun?

29
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,191
-Yeah, but never in noodle form like this.
-[Youngho] Right?

30
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,625
All right then.

31
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:33,760
[Junseo] Let's dig in.

32
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,101
-It's straight-up pasta.
-Totally.

33
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,269
-Tastes like normal pasta.
-It's so good.

34
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,973
It tastes… freakin' good.

35
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,743
[contestant 1]
The place feels so empty now.

36
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,979
All right. I love it.

37
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,715
-Only the strong remain.
-Good to see you too.

38
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,518
We're down to the strong ones now.

39
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,920
Can we stop fighting already?
I'm a pacifist.

40
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,196
-Let's go get some protein.
-Okay.

41
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,165
[Youngho] There are three flavors.

42
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,368
-These are all different flavors?
-That's right.

43
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,539
-[Gijun] Are they sugar-free?
-Yep.

44
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,208
Makes you wonder,
"How is it this sweet with no sugar?"

45
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,944
-It's good.
-[Junseo] What a great time to be dieting.

46
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,313
I know, right?
Well, that was a tasty meal.

47
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:29,916
Let's get to work.

48
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,786
-Wonder what we're doing.
-[Chaehyun] I'm sensing a team match.

49
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,321
-Three teams of five?
-Yeah.

50
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,923
How about four teams of three?

51
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,626
-What?
-Yeah, four teams of three.

52
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,594
Someone's coming back today, I bet.

53
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,630
Feels like they'd want 16
for whatever's next.

54
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:46,566
Should we take them out
the moment they walk in?

55
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,535
If it's Myung Hyunman, no shot.

56
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,770
-Hello, hello!
-Hi, everyone.

57
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,639
-Hello.
-Hello.

58
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:53,873
Hello.

59
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,543
Have you all been well?

60
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,810
-Yes.
-Good.

61
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:00,880
Coach, wasn't this meant
to be a quick trip down memory lane?

62
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,718
Today, Master Don here has invited

63
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,888
a very special guest…

64
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,558
-[contestants exclaim]
-…exclusively for you all.

65
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,626
Wow, nice.

66
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,361
Must be someone famous, right?

67
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:16,763
Yeah, sounds like it.

68
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,932
He's a friend who boxes a little.

69
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:20,600
Huh? Huh?

70
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,035
Huh? Who?

71
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,570
"A friend who boxes a little"?

72
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,205
-Canelo?
-Mayweather?

73
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,272
[laughs]

74
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:29,042
An amateur record of 283 fights

75
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,910
with 268 wins.

76
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,080
And a pro record of 25 fights with 24 wins

77
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,648
and 12 KOs.

78
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,783
Huh?

79
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,420
All right then, WBC!

80
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,621
-What?
-"WBC"?

81
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,523
-WBA!
-Huh?

82
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,992
IBF and WBO!

83
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,060
Huh?

84
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,195
-Is it Naoya Inoue?
-"IBF"?

85
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,597
Nah, no way.

86
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,532
-[Jongkook] The reigning…
-"Reigning"?

87
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:57,070
…undisputed unified
light heavyweight champion!

88
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,204
Light heavyweight?

89
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,706
Seriously?

90
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,341
-Wait, for real?
-Who is it?

91
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,812
Bivol… I think it's Bivol.

92
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,380
I think it's Deontay Wilder.

93
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:08,681
-Wow.
-Are they seriously here?

94
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,984
-Is Beterbiev or Bivol here?
-[Hyunjun] Seriously?

95
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,157
[in English] Champ, come in!

96
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,393
-[Hyunjae, in Korean] I think it's Bivol.
-[Hyunjun] For real?

97
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,829
Wait, hold on. Is this for real?

98
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,200
[exclaims]

99
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,736
Whoa! This is insane!

100
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,473
[Dex] Please welcome Dmitry Bivol!

101
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,241
[contestant] Whoa, that's really him!

102
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,510
-[exclaiming]
-What the…

103
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,646
-It's actually Bivol!
-Whoa, it's Bivol.

104
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,447
[contestants exclaim]

105
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,352
Holy crap!

106
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:51,491
When he said "unified champion,"
I was like, "Don't tell me it's Bivol."

107
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,426
Then he actually showed up.

108
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,963
Wow, I actually got to see Bivol.
I can die happy now.

109
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,398
He's a legendary boxer.

110
00:04:58,464 --> 00:04:59,766
The absolute best in the world.

111
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,904
[Chaehyun] When I found out it was him,
I literally screamed inside.

112
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,241
My heart still races
just thinking about it.

113
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,109
Having someone I've admired for so long

114
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,211
standing right in front of me
felt like a dream.

115
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,013
I was over the moon.

116
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,316
-Hi, guys.
-How did they even get him here?

117
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,383
Hi.

118
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,486
[Jongkook]
He's basically the BLACKPINK of boxing.

119
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:22,522
-[Dex laughs]
-[in English] One more, please.

120
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,057
One more. Okay!

121
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:25,858
[Youngho, in Korean]
Might as well get a hug then.

122
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:26,959
[in English] Welcome.

123
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,528
[Taekmin] Very, very big fan.

124
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,897
[exclaims, sniffs]

125
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,566
[in Korean]
This is total mayhem, isn't it?

126
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,269
They're smelling his belt and everything.

127
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,371
Big fan, big fan.

128
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,908
-Holy cow.
-Man, he's so cool.

129
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,811
[in English] <i>My name is Dmitry Bivol.</i>

130
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:48,948
I'm a light heavyweight
undisputed champion.

131
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,652
-[crowd cheers]
-[commentator] Look at him go. Oh, my…

132
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,093
[Bivol] WBA,

133
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,195
WBO,

134
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:07,266
WBC, and IBF undisputed champion.

135
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:12,038
I love boxing a lot
and everything connected with boxing.

136
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,974
When I heard about Korea
and the boxing show,

137
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,843
of course I didn't have any doubts.

138
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,544
I wanted to come.

139
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,913
Uh, my mother, she's Korean.

140
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,750
This is how I'm connected with Korea.

141
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,520
I want to see the level of Korean boxers.

142
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,857
I want to see the show…
What is the idea of the show?

143
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,492
Who will be the winner?

144
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,395
What I'd like to see is,
how he will do it.

145
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,798
[contestant, in Korean] This is just…

146
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,800
I've never seen you looking this excited.

147
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,803
You look happier than
when you won your own fights.

148
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,004
Yeah, I'm over the moon.

149
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,739
-Hey, get back to your spot.
-What?

150
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:47,907
Don't steal my spot.

151
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,009
-You didn't see this coming, did you?
-No.

152
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,744
This is unreal.

153
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,313
-Is this CGI or what?
-I know. Doesn't feel real.

154
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,216
[Lee] He's literally beaten everyone
in the light-heavyweight division.

155
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,553
-There's no one left for him to fight.
-[contestants exclaim]

156
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,155
So since he was on a break,

157
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,023
I asked if he could stop by.

158
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,159
And he really came.

159
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,827
Let's give him a big hand.

160
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,463
Big fan here, big fan!

161
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,532
-How is this even real?
-Appreciate it. Thank you.

162
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,500
When would we ever see him for real?

163
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,503
Seriously, it's downright impossible.

164
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,238
[in English] Yeah. Hello, guys.

165
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:22,775
Nice to see you.
Nice to be a part of this show.

166
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,343
[Taekmin, in Korean] Man, this is nuts.

167
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,546
[Bivol, in English]
And nice to come to Korea

168
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:31,384
because it's my motherland,
and this is my first visit.

169
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,919
-And, uh…
-[in Korean] It's his first time here.

170
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:37,323
[Bivol, in English]
Today, I will give you some advice.

171
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,194
Not for all of us,
but, uh, for some people, yeah.

[contestant 2]
Well, that really woke me up.

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,570
[Dex, in Korean] Now, if I may,
I have one question for Bivol.

176
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,939
What would you say
is the most important thing in boxing?

177
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:56,943
[in English]
What is the important… boxing? [chuckles]

178
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,045
[in Korean]
Wow, that was… That was very concise.

179
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,847
-[Dex, in English] Sorry.
-[Jongkook] Ah.

180
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,683
I think it's everything from the legs.

181
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,251
-Yeah, from the legs.
-Oh, okay.

182
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,019
This is like engine.

183
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,655
And then, body is like a wire.

184
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:12,191
Finally, you're doing punch.

185
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,794
-[in Korean] All in the legs, huh?
-His legs do look solid.

186
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,829
[Jongkook] If anyone here has a question

187
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:21,000
they've been dying to ask Master Bivol,
go ahead.

188
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,138
[Taekmin] Feels like I shouldn't even
be allowed to ask him anything.

189
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,808
"How long does it take to get like you?"
[laughs]

190
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,177
I want to ask what he eats,
but maybe that's too much.

191
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,552
I'm curious, do you do weight training?

192
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,188
Great question. Weight training.

193
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,524
[in English] Yeah, of course
we're doing it, not too much.

194
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,093
But we have to do weight training.

195
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,297
Every morning, I'm running very slow,
around 20 minutes.

196
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:55,067
Maybe three kilometers, four,
it's in the morning.

197
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:57,436
But once a week, we're running

198
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,505
around 11 kilometers.

199
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,674
One hour running with sprints.

200
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,076
-[contestants exclaim]
-[in Korean] Wait, 11 kilometers?

201
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,313
-Guess we were doing it right.
-[chuckles] Yeah, I guess.

202
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,315
Man, he trains a lot.

203
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,884
[Youngho] I'd love to train with Bivol
for two or three days.

204
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,422
This really shows
he didn't become the best by accident.

205
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,657
For sure.

206
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:22,295
Before we move on,
since we have a world champion here…

207
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,597
Let me see what his punch feels like.

208
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,232
[contestants exclaiming]

209
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,871
I've only seen clips of this,
and now I'm watching him spar in person.

210
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,706
Everyone's moving up.

211
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,074
[laughing]

212
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,476
I wanna watch
from as close up as possible.

213
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:41,447
[Youngho]
Man, talk about a rare experience.

214
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,750
It's completely different
seeing him move in person.

215
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,353
-I can't believe I'm seeing this.
-Same.

216
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,256
Jab.

217
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,557
Two.

218
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,292
One, two.

219
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,061
Ooh!

220
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,265
-He always finishes with a hook.
-Yeah.

221
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,369
He's got real rhythm in his punches.

222
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,539
Can't believe he's in our gym.

223
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,640
Right-left hook.

224
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,308
Upper, hook.

225
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,510
-His punch snap is different.
-Upper, hook.

226
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,214
It's light, but the impact is there.

227
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,783
-That's what's scary.
-Right, it packs a punch.

228
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,353
[Taekmin] If you want to keep throwing
for 12 rounds,

229
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,854
you can't load up on every shot.

230
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,489
[in English]
Okay, let's do it one more time.

231
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:25,791
[contestant 2, in Korean]
His finish is flawless.

232
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,627

233
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,865

234
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,167
Respect! I love you!

235
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,139
[in Korean] He's got serious rhythm.

236
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,807
Unreal, huh? His punches.

237
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,309
So, how are his punches?

238
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,746
He keeps his shots relaxed
without over-rotation,

239
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,014
but they still land heavy.

240
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,181
Ah!

241
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,651
He digs in with every shot.

242
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:52,985
He really presses it in.

243
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,353
He's on a different level.

244
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,690
-All right, shall we move on to Round 4?
-Yeah, sounds good.

[Lee] For Round 4,

246
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,095
Bivol and I prepared the fight together.

247
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,097
They prepared it together?

248
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:06,832
What is it?

249
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,635

a fight more extreme…

250

Yes, again.

00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,635
will go before us.

344
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,704
I think Kim Minwoo will be called.

345
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,640
[announcer] <i>Kim Minwoo!</i>

346
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,876
KIM MINWOO
MMA FIGHTER, RING NAME "MAD DOG"

347
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:25,084
I'm not that worried
about the lightweights.

348
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,119
I thought, "This is good for me."

349
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,555
-[in English] He's an MMA fighter.
-Yeah.

350
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,591
[Lee] Elite boxer, MMA fighter.

351
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,394
[announcer, in Korean]
<i>Facing Cho Hyunjae and Kim Minwoo,</i>

352
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,530
<i>from the blue corner…</i>

353
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,133
Wait, could it be me?

354
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,069
[contestant 3] Yuk Junseo? I think so.

355
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,572
[announcer] <i>Yuk Junseo!</i>

356
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,639
Oh, my God.

357
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,775
YUK JUNSEO
EX-UDT ARTIST

358
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,482
[Junseo] When the two of them were called
out, I was already preparing myself.

359
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,218
I knew they were skilled fighters,

360
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,754
so I didn't have much room to relax,
to be honest.

361
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,222
I was feeling pretty nervous.

362
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,190
But I've come this far,

363
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:09,128
so I'll do my best and see this through.

364
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,096
[Jongkook]
Cho Hyunjae from the white corner,

365
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,665
let's hear your resolve
going into this match.

366
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:18,303
Everyone here has been cutting sleep,
preparing for this round.

367
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,607
I'll make sure you can all rest easy
after today.

368
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:22,841
-[contestants exclaim]
-[Lee laughs]

369
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,209
[contestant 4] He's taunting.

370
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,445
[Dex] The trash talk is getting fun now.

371
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:31,383
He's trash-talking like a boxer.
We had a lot of MMA fighters,

372
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,252
but I'm the only one left.

373
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,121
I'll prove through today's fight,

374
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,023
why I'm the last MMA fighter standing.

375
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,995
I'm pretty much the only non-athlete left.

376
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,798
With all these boxers watching,

377
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,867
I'll give you
the most exciting fight I can.

378
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,035
Thank you.

379
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:51,703
[Jongkook] Yes.

380
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,440
-[in English] Interesting combination.
-[Jongkook laughs] Right.

381
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,675
[Bivol] It will be an interesting match.

382
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,277
CHO HYUNJAE,
KIM MINWOO, YUK JUNSEO

383
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,913
[contestant 5, in Korean] What if
this turns into a 40-rounder? [laughs]

384
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,481
[in English] Cho Hyunjae, yeah?

385
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:07,719
[Lee, in Korean] Cho Hyunjae is an
out-boxer who leans on his speed.

386
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,489
We're going to see real speed in this one.

387
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,897
-If I jumped like that, I'd be exhausted.
-[Jongkook, Dex laugh]

388
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,332
You'd have to take a rest.

389
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,967
-Yeah, I would.
-[Jongkook] Definitely.

390
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,470
[in English] What about Kim Minwoo?

391
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,173
How's his MMA fighting?
He's good in MMA, or…

392
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,575
-He's good.
-He's good, yeah?

393
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,877
-He's good for an MMA fighter.
-[Bivol] For an MMA, he's good?

394
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,046
[Lee] His MMA is based on boxing.

395
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,081
-[Bivol] Oh, okay.
-[Lee] Yeah.

396
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,350
[Jongkook, in Korean]
Yuk Junseo is a unique one. Seriously.

397
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,519
He keeps you on edge the whole time.

398
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,821
He needs to be careful today.

399
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,256
[Jongkook] Right, I agree.

400
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,593
Because up until now,
none of the ones he fought were technical.

401
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,528
[Lee] Right,
he's only fought amateurs so far.

402
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,930
[Jongkook] The guys he's up against today
actually know the craft.

403
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,133
[Dex] I think it might
throw him off, actually.

404
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,301
[Jongkook] Yeah.
He'll get pulled out of his rhythm.

405
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,604
[in English]
This time, you're gonna say "Box."

406
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,939
-I'll let you know when. Yeah.
-Okay.

WHITE CHO HYUNJAE
VS RED KIM MINWOO

411
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,417
[contestant] There's a height difference.

412
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,787
[Hyunjae] Standing face-to-face,
he was shorter than I expected.

413
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,390
So I thought, "This might be pretty easy."

414
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,092
Box!

415
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,260
-Let's go!
-Box!

00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,395
[contestants] Let's go!

00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,796
I hope they do well.

ROUND 1
CHO HYUNJAE X KIM MINWOO

419
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,501
[contestant]
Hyunjae, keep it nice and light.

420
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,506
No, you're going for the big ones again.
Just keep it light.

421
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,075
[Jongkook] Why does he always
get caught in the face like that?

422
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,444
He's gotta keep that guard tight.

423
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,180
[Lee] Take a step back… Nice!

424
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:44,816
That was close.

425
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,719
-Hyunjae, don't just let him hit you.
-Gotta move more.

426
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:49,855
[Seungjun]
The ring was smaller than it looked,

427
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,291
so it was bound to favor the MMA guys.

428
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,892
-All right.
-There you go.

429
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,229
-Mad Dog is doing well.
-All right, you got this.

430
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:59,164
[Hyunjae] When I first fought Kim Minwoo,

431
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,667
I think I might've gone in
a little too confident.

432
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,902
I was thrown off a bit.

433
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,638
Never take your opponent lightly.

434
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:11,677
Hyunjae doesn't have big power,
so he needs to get technical.

435
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,112
[hosts exclaim]

436
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,547
Nice body shot!

437
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,882
Keep your distance.

438
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,584
No need to rush, Hyunjae.

439
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,386
That counter connected.

440
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,022
Nice uppercut.

441
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,625
Stay calm and control the pace.

442
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,160
You've got plenty of time.

443
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,129
-All right.
-[bell dings]

444
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,898
-Stop!
-That was good.

445
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,200
All right, Round 1 is over.

446
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,369
Okay, feel each other out.

447
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,538
ROUND 2
KIM MINWOO X YUK JUNSEO

448
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,707
It all depends on Junseo's endurance.

449
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,242
How much stamina he's got.

450
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:49,414
[Junseo] Since I got to watch
the other two fight first,

451
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:53,418
I was thinking about how I should pace
my round while I watched.

452
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,854
-Nice in and out.
-Let's go!

453
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,955
He's gotten better.

454
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:58,957
Nice move!

455
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,492
His moves have become cleaner.

456
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,327
He's actually doing pretty well.

457
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,931
[exclaiming]

458
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,234
Looks like he's put in a lot of work.

459
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:13,038
[Lee]
Yuk Junseo's rhythm has gotten better.

460
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,206
He had no rhythm before.

461
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,208
-Right.
-[Dex] You seem really intrigued.

462
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,877
His footwork is better than before.
Compared to two weeks ago.

463
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,480
[Dex] Everyone's really improving.

464
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:22,881
[Jongkook] He got better.

465
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,353
Just move your head!

466
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:33,792
[Minwoo] He's actually managing
his distance well.

467
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:34,860
[bell dings]

468
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,662
-Stop!
-Okay, that was good.

469
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,163
That was good.

470
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,765
BLUE YUK JUNSEO VS WHITE CHO HYUNJAE

471
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,733
Two straight rounds is tough.

472
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,235
It ain't easy.

473
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,337
[bell dings]

474
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:46,405
Box!

475
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,309
ROUND 3
YUK JUNSEO X CHO HYUNJAE

476
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,512
[Jongkook] I wasn't sure
about Yuk Junseo's style,

477
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,515
so I focused on throwing fast
and throwing a lot.

478
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:57,582
[Don] Yes, that's it.

479
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,851
Yes, keep those feints going.

480
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,988
-He's pretty good.
-He's too tense.

481
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,256
His body's wide open now.

482
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,524
Nice one!

483
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,727
Hey, don't get greedy!

484
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,130
-Jab and body!
-Throw that jab!

485
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:14,700
-Jab and body!
-Hyunjae's speeding up.

486
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:17,903
[Lee] Junseo's pulling his head
too far back. That's dangerous.

487
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:19,438
-More feints!
-[Jongkook] Stop leaning back.

488
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,607
But with Hyunjae firing nonstop like that,
it must be disorienting.

489
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,710
Looks tough to deal with.

490
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,311
Let's go!

491
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,282
All right!

492
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:37,122
[Lee] It's hard to break that rhythm,
so Junseo can't throw full power there.

493
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,924
-You're right.
-He's fast.

494
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,659
Don't waste your energy!

495
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,695
-[bell dings]
-All right, nicely fought.

496
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:45,097
He did well.

497
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,565
Breathe, Junseo.

498
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,166
Tough, huh? Just breathe, man.

499
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,137
[Don] Fighting Hyunjae must've been
really tough for Junseo.

500
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:57,008
[Junseo] His movement
was definitely better than mine.

501
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,544
"Strategy is going to be key here,"

502
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,380
that's what came to mind.

503
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,447
Don't get too close.

504
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,282
-[bell dings]
-Box!

505
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:05,884
ROUND 4
CHO HYUNJAE X KIM MINWOO

506
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,255
Yes, that's it! Only go in when he's open!

507
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,358
I knew I couldn't match
his rhythm in pure boxing,

508
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:17,329
so I went in trying to turn it into
more of a hand-to-hand fight.

509
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,865
-Relax and have fun with it. That's it.
-[Lee] Good.

510
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,133
Yes, nice movement.

511
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,136
Here he comes.
Don't just let him hit you, Hyunjae.

512
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,771
Kim Minwoo has more power.

513
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,640
There's a strength difference here.

514
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,741
There is.

515
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,577
Hyunjae's shots are lighter,
so he needs to keep that guard tight.

516
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,146
-Nice defense.
-He needs to cover up.

517
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:37,082
[Hyunjae] Maybe it's because
he's an MMA fighter,

518
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,518
but he was really trying to close in hard.

519
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,086
So I thought, "Stay calm."

520
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,054
"Just land one with real impact."

521
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,927
[all exclaim]

522
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,165
[in English] Nice uppercut, yeah?

523
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:55,200
[in Korean]
That uppercut timing was insane.

524
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,768
He's walking right into it.

525
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,003
Yeah, love that.

526
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,070
Manage your distance.

527
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,138
Keep your rhythm.

528
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,573
That's it, that's it.

529
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,442
Go for a straight shot! Make it clean!

530
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,244
Go for a straight shot! Make it clean!

531
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,514
-All right!
-[Lee] Nice… Oh, dear.

532
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,383
Where are you going?

533
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,919
-[laughing]
-Don't waste your energy!

534
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,089
Hyunjae's got real showmanship.

535
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,259
ROUND 4
CHO HYUNJAE X KIM MINWOO

536
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:22,327
[bell dings]

537
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,862
-Stop!
-Good job, man!

538
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:24,930
[Minwoo] He really is good.

539
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,299
Kim Minwoo's holding up well, though.

540
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:30,435
ROUND 5
KIM MINWOO X YUK JUNSEO

541
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,237
Now, this is it. Let's see what happens.

542
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:37,008
Yuk Junseo's probably going to try
to finish him off here,

543
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,410
since Kim's pretty drained.

544
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:41,646
That's it.

545
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:42,914
[all exclaim]

546
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,251
That kind of rushing,
that's his specialty.

547
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,121
-If you get caught clean by that…
-[Lee] He just needs to loosen up a bit.

548
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:51,823
[Dex] That's what's scary about him.

549
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,225
Breathe through it.

550
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,262
[Dex] Yes, use it to your advantage.

551
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,364
Got to finish the guy
whose stamina is dropping.

552
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,535
[Junseo]
Even if it took a toll physically,

553
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:06,538
the plan was to keep the guard up
and just push forward.

554
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,176
-Stop!
-His style's coming out now.

555
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,544
[in English] You know this guy?

556
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,779
-He really has good power.
-[Jongkook] Right, right.

557
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:18,049
-[Bivol] His natural power is really good.
-[Jongkook] Right, right.

558
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:21,920
Yuk Junseo's definitely got
KO power in those hands.

559
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,325
[Minwoo] I've trained
with a lot of different fighters,

560
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,962
but I'd never felt
a punch quite like that.

561
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,565
So I knew he wouldn't be easy.

562
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,100
-Let's go!
-You got this.

563
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,769
-[Lee] Because of their styles…
-Stop!

564
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:41,673
…Yuk Junseo is overpowering Kim Minwoo.

565
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,642
-[laughing] Yeah, that's how it looks.
-Both rounds.

566
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,944
He's beating Kim Minwoo.

567
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:49,314
[Dex] But against Cho Hyunjae,
he's still looking a bit rattled.

568
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,551
[Lee] Junseo's gassing out.
So Hyunjae needs to go for it now.

569
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,686
ROUND 6
YUK JUNSEO X CHO HYUNJAE

570
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,254
[Jongkook] This round's
gonna be tough for Yuk.

571
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,857
He's going to struggle in this one.

572
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,193
Guard up. There you go.

573
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:03,929
All right!

574
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,736
[Jongkook] Cho Hyunjae is
charging straight in.

575
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,104
He's keeping it tight.

576
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:16,608
He usually fights on the outside.

577
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,510
But now he's going all the way in.

578
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,278
That's not his style at all.

579
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:24,983
For this match, since the fighter
who scores a KO takes the win,

580
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,887
I figured I had to KO someone
the moment I saw an opening.

581
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,356
He really wants to win.

582
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,459
-Stay loose, Hyunjae.
-Light on the feet.

583
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,961
He's going for the body.

584
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,629
He's working on that left body.

585
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,131
For regular guys like us,
catching a few of those body shots…

586
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:41,733
-Brings you down.
-…really throws us off.

587
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,168
He wants the KO finish.

588
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,369
Save your energy!

589
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,804
Keep the defense tight.

590
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,138
Fifteen seconds!

591
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,608
-Oh, gosh.
-His body is too open.

592
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,042
-Whoa.
-That's what Cho wants.

593
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,444
Stay light.

594
00:26:53,144 --> 00:26:54,279
Keep moving.

595
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,848
He's trying to end it here.

596
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,850
I think it'll end in one or two rounds.

597
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,386
-[bell dings]
-Break!

598
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,921
Cho really drained him.

599
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,424
[in English] Well, good. It was good.

600
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,827
It's not his style at all, but it's good.

601
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:12,931
[Hyunjae] I tried experimenting
with both infighting and out-boxing.

602
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,367
So when I finally
got used to my opponents,

603
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:18,136
I was ready to show them
what a boxer can really do.

604
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,204
[bell dings]

605
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,041
Here he comes.

606
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,744
-Here he comes.
-That's his thing.

607
00:27:27,746 --> 00:27:28,747
[contestants exclaiming]

608
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,218
-Oh, boy.
-Goodness.

609
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,921
There you go!

610
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:39,424
There you go!

611
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,892
Nice one!

612
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,827
Did you see that hand roll feint?

613
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,331
No need to rush.

614
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,932
Yes, that's it.

615
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,468
He needs to go to the body.

616
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,304
Let's just land one clean shot.

617
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,243
-Five seconds!
-All right!

618
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,780
-Just have fun with it.
-[bell dings]

619
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,947
He didn't get to do much.

620
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,616
Right, that guy's really good.

621
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,784
He's really good.

622
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,819
[Lee] Junseo can't seem
to land on Hyunjae.

623
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:11,756
[Junseo] Hyunjae was
a tough matchup for me.

624
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,258
He's got a tricky style.

625
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:17,295
In comparison, my style matched up better

626
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,664
against Kim Minwoo.

627
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,466
[bell dings]

628
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,870
-He's pushing hard.
-See?

629
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,205
Look at him go.

630
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,909
He's like a bull charging forward.

631
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,677
He's like a beast.

632
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:38,683
[Junseo] I thought, "The only way I can
win this is to knock out Kim Minwoo."

633
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,553
-[Youngho] All right, let's go!
-[Sanggeun] Yeah!

634
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,855
[Lee] No one knows how this will turn out.

635
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,057
We could still get a knockdown.

636
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:49,294
If one guy gets KO'd,
do the other two keep fighting?

637
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,361
[Shin Donghyun] No, they…

638
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,464
So if I score a knockout,

639
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:54,599
I survive, and the other two get cut.

640
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:58,103
[contestant 1] Junseo might
actually send someone out.

641
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,039
[Jongkook] If Kim Minwoo has
any stamina left, he needs to go in now.

642
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,041
Yuk Junseo is pretty gassed right now.

643
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,712
-[Lee] Yuk Junseo is doing very well.
-[Dex] Right.

644
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,014
He's doing well
against these pro athletes.

645
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,082
[bell dings]

646
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,053
[Dex] Cho Hyunjae and Kim Minwoo
have totally different styles.

647
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,756
Switching between styles
is making it more challenging.

648
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:19,591
[contestant 1] Yes, keep it light.

649
00:29:19,657 --> 00:29:22,060
-[contestant 2] Loosen up, Hyunjae!
-[contestant 3 exclaims]

650
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,295
[Junseo] When I was
up against Cho Hyunjae,

651
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,931
I went in thinking,
"I've got to hold out, no matter what."

652
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,600
[exclaims]

653
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,469
[Lee] I'm honestly impressed.

654
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,172
He's doing everything he can
to break that rhythm.

655
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,974
-[bell dings]
-Box!

656

[Dex, contestants exclaiming]

658
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,353
[contestant 2] Let's go first, man!

659
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,891
[Junseo] I wasn't thinking
about conserving stamina.

660
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,926
The plan was to go all in

661
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,895
and knock out Kim Minwoo.

662
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,431
There's nowhere left to fall back to now.

663
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,570
[contestants exclaiming]

664
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,671
I feel it coming!

665
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:08,540
[Youngho] He's loose now.

666
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,475
[contestant 1] Looks
like he's loosened up.

667
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,076
[Lee] Wow, there it is.

668
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,946
[Dex] He's still throwing those fast jabs.

669
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:17,949
[contestant 2] He's coming!

670
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,017
[contestant 4] Wow, he's good.

671
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,052
He's reading every shot and slipping them.

672
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,453
[contestant 2] Man, this is intense.

673
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,156
[Lee] Everyone's exhausted now.

674
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,791
They're starting to gas out.

675
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:30,562
[contestant 2] This really is tough.

676
00:30:30,628 --> 00:30:33,398
-[contestant 3] It just won't end.
-This looks like the real deathmatch.

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,375
They have to stay focused
until the very end.

681
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:46,277
[contestant 1] Don't get impatient.
Wait for it.

682
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:50,448
[Lee] Hyunjae's stamina is incredible.

683
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,151
Running around like that nonstop
is really hard, you know.

684
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,188
Look, he's still skipping.

685
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,257
[contestant 2] All right. Keep your cool.

686
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:01,092
-[in English] Cardio's good.
-Yeah.

687
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,527
[Lee] He's still running around.

688
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,829
-Yes, he can move.
-[Lee] Yeah, he can…

689

-[Dmitry] He can fight like this more…
-[Lee] Yeah.

690
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,168

691
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,502
[contestant 2] Stay calm!

692

699

Minwoo's in trouble now.

700
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,689
He's looking really gassed.

701
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,292
And he's up against
a recharged Yuk Junseo.

702

[exclaiming]

708
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,309
[Junseo] I thought, "This is the moment."

709
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,311
"I have to knock him out this time."

710
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,981
-Keep it up, you two!
-All right!

711
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,118
[Jongkook] Funny enough, Kim Minwoo's
backing away from Yuk Junseo

712
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,352
and inching toward Hyunjae.

713
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,323
[Hyunjae] Yuk Junseo was really attacking
Kim Minwoo hard.

714
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,192
I was starting to get nervous
that he might score a KO first.

This round is going to be tough
for Yuk Junseo.

720
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,747
-Gonna be tough.
-[Dex] Yeah, he's gassed.

721
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:30,949
Yeah, this might be it.

722
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,583
Plus, Cho Hyunjae's looking fresh.

728
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,662

You have to go now!

I saw it as my last chance.

738
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,752
I knew I had to finish it with a KO.

739
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,687
As expected.

740
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:10,788
[Jongkook] Double left.

741
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,559
All right, that body shot landed.

742
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,663
-[contestant 3] His guard's dropping!
-[Jongkook] Go to the body now. There.

743
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,099
-Yes, that went in clean.
-[contestant 1] It did.

744
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,034
[contestant 2] He's doubling over.

I really put in everything.

I'd actually trained

I was sure I could win.

00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,454
[Shin Donghyun] As a Muay Thai fighter,

797
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,357
I was matched up against two boxers.

798
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:03,528
I'll prove that
I'm just as much of a boxer as them.

799
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,364
Because I'm not a boxer,

800
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,100
I can't help rooting for
the other non-boxers.

801

00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:24,382
let's hear your resolve
going into this match.

808
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:28,653
[Yunchan] I'm honestly glad
I get to face such strong opponents.

809
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,689
I've got a score to settle with Chaehyun.

810
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:35,660
A rival of mine? Chaehyun.

811
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:40,431
I wanted to go up against Yunchan.

812
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,333
He's a close friend I care about.

813
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,635
[Yunchan] We're pretty close,

814
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,637
so I was glad to get matched with him.

815
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:51,309
We said we'd fight but never did
since he's in the military.

It'd be fun to meet him here.

Why are you in your military uniform?

-[Chaehyun] How's that?
-Here we go again.

826
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,470
We've sparred quite a bit this year.

827
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,806
Earlier this year, when I was rehabbing,

828
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,442
the first thing I did was spar with him.

829
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:26,577
I naturally found myself rooting for him.

830
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:27,778
Yunchan, you're doing great!

831
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,213
Let's go, Lim Yunchan!

832
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,650
[Yunchan] I really respect Chaehyun.

833
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,252
You got this, Chaehyun!

834
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:35,453
Go, Chaehyun!

835
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:39,790
But I blinked,
and there were only 15 of us left.

836
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,459
It made me want to win more.

837
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:45,196
I knew that he was good,
but I still felt like I could take him.

838
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,364
I was confident.

839
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:50,134
[Yunchan] I'll make sure
to show up this time.

840
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,235
Let's have fun!

841
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,536

848
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,722
[Dex] This should be a fun match.

849
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,557
ROUND 1
LEE CHAEHYUN X LIM YUNCHAN

850
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,860
With both having long reach,
they're struggling to land.

851
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,562
-[contestant 1] Follow up with a hook!
-[exclaims]

852
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,730
[contestant 2] Nice shot!

853
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,266
[Lee] They're both out of range.

854
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,436
-Ba-bam!
-[Lee groans]

855
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:29,140
[contestant 4] Jab-slip! Jab-slip!

856
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,509
Following up with a hook! Nice!

857
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,944
-It's a battle of counters now.
-Exactly.

858
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:37,481
-[exclaim]
-He caught that counter.

859
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,687
[Chaehyun] I threw light jabs
with my lead hand,

860
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,221
just like I do in practice.

861
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,191
They were just landing so well,

862
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:48,592
so I felt confident.

863
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,032
Man, he's getting worked.

864
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:58,302
Lee Chaehyun is starting off
on the attack.

865
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:04,408
[contestant 1] Wow,
Lee Chaehyun's level of skill is…

866
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,609
[Jongkook] He's good.

867
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,680
[contestant 2] Ten seconds!
Chaehyun, 10 seconds!

868
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,583
Ten seconds! Yes, back off now.

869
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:15,419
[contestant 2] He slips so well.

870
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,222
-[contestants grunting]
-[contestants exclaim]

871
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:20,191
-[bell dings]
-[Youngho] This is fun.

872
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,860
-[contestant 1] Let's go, Donghyun!
-[contestant 2] Let's go!

873
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:23,928
[bell dings]

874
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:25,463
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

875
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,864
ROUND 2
LIM YUNCHAN X SHIN DONGHYUN

876
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,035
[contestants exclaim]

877
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,904
[Lee] Lim Yunchan's straight is solid.

878
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,941
[Jongkook] Oh, his reach is super long.

879
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,009
[contestant 1] He's clean, isn't he?

880
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,745
Body, then up top.

881
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,213
Go again! Keep it flowing!

882
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,348
He's got long, extending punches!

883
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,017
[Jongkook] This group's starting off slow,

884
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,753
-by the looks of it.
-[Lee] You're right.

885
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,321
[contestant 2] Five seconds!

886
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,991
[Dex] Okay,
this was just a feeling-out round.

887
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,227
-Stop!
-[Jongkook] Just feeling each other out.

888
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,329
[Lee] Both fighters played it calm so far.

889
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,830
-Let's see what happens now.
-[bell dings]

890
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,265
ROUND 3
SHIN DONGHYUN X LEE CHAEHYUN

891
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,934
-[Lee] I'm sensing a throwdown.
-[contestant 2] Let's go!

892
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,003
[exclaims]

893
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,807
[contestant 3] Get a little lower.

894
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,942
Pressure him. Yes, go again!

895
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,912
His lead hand is insane.

896
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,383
[Lee] Blue's looking a bit passive.

897
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,623
Maybe Shin Donghyun
is not in good shape today?

898
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,025
[Shin Donghyun] I had a strategy in place.

899
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:34,198
After watching the previous match
go up to around 20 rounds,

900
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,167
I figured I'd make the other two fight

901
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,035
and save my energy until the 10th round.

902
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,839
I was pacing myself.

903
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:47,211
[Jongkook] Shin Donghyun's really trying
to conserve his energy.

904
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,412
[bell dings]

905
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,048
-He's just…
-He's just watching them, isn't he?

906
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,652
He's waiting for the right timing,
hunting for that one clean shot.

907
00:40:54,718 --> 00:41:00,324
ROUND 4
LEE CHAEHYUN X LIM YUNCHAN

908
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,059
[grunting]

909
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,828
[contestant 1] Both are working
the lead hand.

910
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:05,429
[contestant 2] Nice lead hand!

911
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:09,200
[Jongkook] Lee Chaehyun's having trouble
landing because of Lim's long reach.

912
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,603
-[contestants exclaiming]
-[huffs]

913
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:18,409
[Yunchan] I tried to read his moves
and get the right distance

914
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,743
since my reach's much longer.

915
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,245
[contestant 1] All right!

916
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,713
[Lee] That was great.

917
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,084
[contestant 1] All right!

918
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,087
[Youngho] That was lit.

919
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:34,391
Lim Yunchan's counters are landing well.

920
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,994
His specialty is his straight shots.

921
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,263
Taking one of those could be lethal.

922
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,099
[Chaehyun] I was honestly surprised.

923
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,102
Yunchan was really picking up steam
as the minutes went by.

924
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,238
Chaehyun shouldn't let his guard down.

925
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,874
[both grunting]

926
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,010
[contestant 1] Five seconds!

927
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,616
-[bell dings]
-[referee] Stop!

928
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,653
ROUND 5
LIM YUNCHAN VS SHIN DONGHYUN

929
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,421
[Jongkook] He needs to strike now.

930
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,424
[Jongkook, Dex exclaiming]

931
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:14,298
[Yunchan] I was trying to use my footwork
and change the tempo.

932
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,469
[contestant 1] Lim Yunchan really knows
how to control distance.

933
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,437
ROUND 6
SHIN DONGHYUN VS LEE CHAEHYUN

934
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,073
[contestant 1] Too wide.

935
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,310
He's looking for the right timing
to go in with the big shots,

936
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,478
but it's not working out.

937
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,547
-[contestant] Good, good.
-[Lee] An overhand right.

938
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,849
-[bell dings]
-I'm starting to feel it coming.

939
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,718
[both grunting]

940
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,487
[Dex] These two are heating up.

941
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,959
-[bell dings]
-You have to throw something at least!

942
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:43,494
Just like that!

943
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,929
That's a Muay Thai punch.

944
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,164
[bell dings]

945
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,265
Yes, a follow-up hook!

946
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:52,202
-Jab-slip-cross!
-Yes, here it comes! [exclaims]

947
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:55,172
It was kind of easy, to be honest.

948
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:57,441
I knew I had it.

949
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,377
[bell dings]

950
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:01,579
-Box!
-Let's go!

951
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,614
[contestant 2] Let's go, Lim Yunchan!

952
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,382
ROUND 10
LEE CHAEHYUN X LIM YUNCHAN

953
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,485
Keep those feet moving! Keep them moving!

954
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,654
-[both grunting]
-[contestants exclaim]

955
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,827
[contestant 4 exclaims]

956
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,398
Someone might really get hurt. Careful.

957
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,468
[Lee] Don't get carried away.

958
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,741
-[Chaehyun] You okay?
-Yeah, I can keep going.

959
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:32,276
-Wait, you're bleeding.
-[referee] Stop!

960
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,577
Wait, you're bleeding.

961
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:34,878
Stop, stop, stop!

962
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:35,946
Let me see.

963
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,382
Hold still for a sec.

964
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,117
I knew this was gonna happen.

965
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:42,219
Oh, they butted heads.

966
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,221
I'm fine.

967
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,091
[referee] Doctor!

968
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,525
Is there a cut?

969
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:49,793
[contestant 1] There's a cut?

970
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,196
Doctor, over here.

971
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:54,832
-Doctor, over here.
-Oh, he's bleeding.

972
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,033
-Goodness.
-Oh, boy.

973
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,435
He must be a bit dazed right now.

974
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,673
[Yunchan] Chaehyun maintains
a quick tempo.

975
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,043
I tried to keep up with him,
and we ended up butting heads.

976
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,681
[Chaehyun] Maybe Yunchan was getting
a bit impatient.

977
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:13,150
He put up a high guard
and tried to fight on the inside.

978
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:16,086
The moment we headbutted,
I thought, "That's a tear."

979
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,621
And I was right.

980
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,657
I felt terrible.

981
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:22,259
I just felt bad for him before anything.

982
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,894
I'm sorry, man.

983
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,165
If it leaves a scar, I'm suing you.

984
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:31,468
[Chaehyun] Man, I feel terrible.

985
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:33,871
-Oh, boy.
-Goodness.

986
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,005
Will he continue?

987
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:37,708
Let's have the doctor do a quick check

988
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,677
and see if he can keep going.

989
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,782
[referee] Can you
just handle the bleeding?

990
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:51,388
He got a bit of blood in his eye.

991
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:56,560
[contestant 1]
But that's clearly a cut, so…

992
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:57,695
Does he need stitches?

993
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,464
Yikes. What happens now?

994
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,567
-What now?
-They might call the fight right away.

995
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,937
[in English] I'm not sure
he can fight more.

996
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:08,238
I think so.

997
00:45:10,307 --> 00:45:11,308
[referee, in Korean] Hold on.

998
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,380
Let me see. It's not that deep.

999
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:18,882
-[Yunchan] Is it a deep cut?
-No, not really.

1000
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,251
-The bleeding stopped, right?
-I think so.

1001
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,453
I think you're fine.

1002
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:24,588
Yeah, he can keep going.

1003
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,825
This level of injury
is really common in boxing.

1004
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,860
The bleeding should stop when treated.

1005
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,262
If it opens up any more,
I'll stop the fight.

1006
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,264
[in English] He can fight, yeah?

1007
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:35,632
[Jongkook] Yeah.

1008
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,001
[in Korean] One more round? Okay.

1009
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:44,274
We'll do just one last round each.

1010
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:45,342
[grunts]

1011
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:48,412
This one was the shortest, 10 rounds.

1012
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,549
[Yunchan] Yeah, I was disappointed,
but I had to see it through.

1013
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,118
I had to do my best.

1014
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,185
-[referee] You okay?
-[sighs]

1015
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,087
-[referee] Does it hurt?
-Slightly.

1016
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:58,288
[referee] Slightly? Okay.

1017
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:02,359
[Shin Donghyun] I thought, "This is bad."
"How's this gonna go for me?"

1018
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,829
When he said we'd do one more round each,

1019
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:08,699
I realized I had no other choice.

1020
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:11,368
I just had to score a KO.

1021
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,139
ROUND 11
LIM YUNCHAN X SHIN DONGHYUN

1022
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:16,540
-Box!
-[contestant 1] Stay confident!

1023
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:20,344
[Youngho] It's the last round! Let's go!
Burn it up! All right!

1024
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,212
[Dex] Look at Shin Donghyun go.

1025
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,414
-He's just…
-[Youngho] Fire away!

1026
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:27,918
[contestants exclaim]

1027
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,621
He should've done that earlier.

1028
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:35,726
[contestant 3] Okay, nice.

1029
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,961
-Keep going! It's your last chance!
-[contestant 4] Go big!

1030
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:42,166
[Chaehyun] To be honest,
I was a bit worried.

1031
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:45,269
He's got plenty of gas left.

1032
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,472
-[contestants exclaim]
-[contestant 1] That's a slip.

1033
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:49,807
He's aiming for that KO.

1034
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,309
[referee] Box!

1035
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:55,279
[contestants exclaiming]

1036
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,614
[chuckling] Oh, hey!
He might finish him right now.

1037
00:46:58,749 --> 00:46:59,783
-[grunts]
-[exclaims]

1038
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,754
[Shin Donghyun] I knew it was my chance
to finish off Lim Yunchan.

1039
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,222
So he was holding back until now.

1040
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,257
[contestant 2] If he drops him, it's over.

1041
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,725
Looks like he could do it!

1042
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:10,093
[Lee] He got caught.

1043
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,129
[Chaehyun] I thought,
"Man, Yunchan's out of gas."

1044
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:15,098
"Figures, he's injured."
"The cut must be bothering him."

1045
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:21,805
[Shin Donghyun] I honestly think I had
Lim Yunchan outmatched.

1046
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:24,942
I was thinking, "After the 10th round,
I'll send you flying."

1047
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,944
I was waiting for the perfect moment.

1048
00:47:28,078 --> 00:47:29,446
[contestant 1 exclaims]

1049
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:32,616
[Sanggeun] Wow, this is just…

1050
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,520
[contestant 1] Ten seconds!

1051
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,089
Box!

1052
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,696
-[bell dings]
-Stop!

1053
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,332
Okay, last round!

1054
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,400
He really left it all out there.

1055
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:51,535
Last one, let's go!

1056
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,036
-Let's go!
-Show him, Donghyun!

1057
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,171
It's the last round!

1058
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:56,206
Let's go, Chaehyun!

1059
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:57,374
You got this, Donghyun!

1060
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,776
-[bell dings]
-Box!

1061
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,879
[contestant 1] You've got
to pour it all out.

1062
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:05,582
ROUND 12
SHIN DONGHYUN X LEE CHAEHYUN

1063
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:06,750
Okay, he ate that cross.

1064
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,286
[contestant 4] You've gotta go in!
Pressure him!

1065
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:11,989
[Youngho] Nice one!

1066
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,392
[Shin Donghyun] Lee Chaehyun seemed
a bit tired.

1067
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,195
So I knew I had to bite down
and start trading to win.

1068
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:20,764
<i>I got quite a bit flustered.</i>

1069
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,332
He kept pushing forward.

1070
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,269
I told myself, "Don't let him get close.
Keep your distance."

1071
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:28,672
I thought, "I should amp up the pressure."

1072
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,073
"I need to knock him out."

1073
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,242
[Dex] What a strong offense.

1074
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,344
[grunting]

1075
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,446
[in English] He's strong, the blue one.

1076
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:40,050
[Dex, in Korean] Last 20 seconds!

1077
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:41,985
-Last 20 seconds!
-Come on!

1078
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,587
-You have to go in!
-Fifteen seconds!

1079
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,155
-Fifteen seconds!
-Show us something!

1080
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:49,326
[Yunchan] I was worried
the fight might swing his way there.

1081
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:51,128
-Go, Chaehyun!
-Almost there!

1082
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:52,896
-Fifteen seconds, Donghyun!
-Almost up!

1083
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,131
-Fifteen seconds!
-Ten!

1084
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:56,466
-Ten seconds!
-[contestant 2] Ten, nine…

1085
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:57,801
[Youngho] Step on the gas!

1086
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,469
Oh, boy.

1087
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:00,537
[Dex] Five seconds!

1088
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,105
-Four, three…
-One more, one more!

1089
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:03,373
[Lee] Keep going!

1090
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,441
[bell dings]

1091
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:05,976
-Stop!
-He was so close!

1092
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:08,245
Nicely fought.

1093
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:10,847
[Chaehyun] I was
pretty desperate down the stretch.

1094
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,649
Things weren't going my way,

1095
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:14,952
so I was really worried.

1096
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,254
This one's real iffy.

1097
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:18,655
No clue what to do here.

1098
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:24,728
[in English] The red one didn't show
anything good in the last two rounds.

1099
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,432
I would say that the white one
is more of a boxer.

1100
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,634
-Yeah, he is.
-[Bivol] He has good skills.

1101
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:34,338
-But I think the blue one is good also.
-Yeah.

1102
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:36,406
It's all equal.

1103
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,643
[in Korean] I think Donghyun is moving up.

1104
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,311
[contestant 1] For me, white corner.

1105
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:45,048
Maybe Chaehyun? Actually, I'm not sure.

1106
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,317
[Lee] By judges' decision,

1107
00:49:47,384 --> 00:49:49,252
the survivor of this match is…

1108
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,521
[contestant] Who will it be?

1109
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:56,059
[Chaehyun] I think it could be me.
I fought clean, at least.

1110
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,996
[Shin Donghyun] Please let it be blue…
Please.

1111
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,565
…no one.

1112
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:03,400
-…no one.
-[Gijun gasps]

1113
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,268
[gasps]

1114
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,273
-[contestant 2] Everyone's eliminated?
-[contestant 3] Oh, no.

1115
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:14,711
[Chaehyun] I was shocked.
I was like, "I'm going home like this?"

1116
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:18,782
[Shin Donghyun] How can there be
no winner? Then are we all getting cut?

1117
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:23,353
[Lee] After discussing with Bivol,
we decided to have an overtime round.

1118
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,789
We decided to have an overtime round.

1119
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,392
UNPRECEDENTED
OVERTIME ROUND ANNOUNCED

1120
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:32,229
Only two fighters will compete
in overtime.

1121
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,898
Lee Chaehyun and…

1122
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,534
Shin Donghyun.

1123
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:39,302
All right.

1124
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,505
[Lee] …Shin Donghyun.

1125
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,941
[Yunchan] I respected their decision.

1126
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:49,646
With the headbutt and all,
I didn't think I could continue either.

1127
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,649
So I started rooting for Chaehyun.

1128
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,786
[Chaehyun] Now that it's come to this,
I'll fight for Yunchan's sake.

1129
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,857
The overtime round
will be one decisive five-minute round.

1130
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:02,025
[Sanggeun] Five minutes?

1131
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,127
-Did he say five minutes?
-Five minutes?

1132
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,430
[Shin Donghyun] "Okay,
five minutes is good."

1133
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:08,799
Think of it like a O*E Championship bout.

1134
00:51:08,865 --> 00:51:10,434
I thought it worked in my favor.

1135
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,537
[in English] Let's see what happens.

1136
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,405
-[in Korean] Box!
-[bell dings]

1137
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:17,240
-Let's go!
-You got this, Chaehyun!

1138
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:19,810
-Let's go, Donghyun!
-Nice!

1139
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:21,144
OVERTIME ROUND
LEE CHAEHYUN X SHIN DONGHYUN

1140
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:24,381
-Show us what you got, Donghyun!
-[Youngho] It's showtime!

1141
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,951
[Shin Donghyun] I started off
by pressuring him nonstop.

1142
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,088
[contestant exclaiming]

1143
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:34,991
Lee Chaehyun seemed a little scared
of taking a decisive shot from me.

1144
00:51:35,058 --> 00:51:37,661
He was very careful not to get hit.

1145
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,596
[contestant 1 exclaims]

1146
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,364
[in English] Good body shot.

1147
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,933
[in Korean] Make every shot count!

1148
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,668
[in English] The blue one
because of power.

1149
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,504
-Yeah.
-And he has aggressive, yeah.

1150
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:52,275
[Chaehyun, in Korean] His punches
were so powerful. He was pretty strong.

1151
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,379
It was frustrating
not being able to defend properly.

1152
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,717
[contestant 1] He's getting lit up.

1153
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:03,787
[Yunchan] I was getting a bit worried.

1154
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:05,989
Hey, it's okay! It's okay!

1155
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:07,991
[Hyunjae exclaims]

1156
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:09,759
He looks a bit tense.

1157
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:10,827
You need to loosen up.

1158
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:16,500
[Chaehyun] I tried to stay calm
and go at my own pace.

1159
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,236
[contestant 1] All right, nice slip!

1160
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,839
[Youngho] He's definitely good
at slipping. His movement's sharp.

1161
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:24,374
Smooth defense.

1162
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,042
[Youngho] Yes, it was.

1163
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,378
[Dex] His distance control is great.

1164
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:32,149
His sense of distance is so good
that he's almost untouchable.

1165
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:33,984
[Chaehyun] Looked
like his distance control was off.

1166
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,118
[contestant] Nice slip!

1167
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,588
I had to win,
so I figured out a game plan.

1168
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,659
I tried to grind him down
with my lead hand jabs.

1169
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,062
[Yunchan] All right, nice jab!

1170
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:47,397
All the jabs are landing.

1171
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:50,800
[Chaehyun] My plan was to wear him down
and take him out.

1172
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,969
-Nice jab.
-[contestant 1] There you go!

1173
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:58,175
[Lee] Shots like that drain your gas fast.

1174
00:52:58,241 --> 00:53:00,744
Man, those punches were annoying.

1175
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,413
Like someone keeps poking at you.

1176
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:06,983
Felt like I was constantly losing points.

1177
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,819
So I thought,
"Guess I'll have to push harder."

-[contestant 2] No.

1187
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,982
[Chaehyun] I said no,
because if the doctor stopped it then,

You can just patch me up.

…was what I was afraid of.

To be honest, I knew I could still fight.

1216
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:46,716
It didn't matter if I was bleeding.

1217
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,819
I just prayed
they wouldn't stop the fight.

1218

1237
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:48,345

[Chaehyun] I was pretty sure I had it.

1254
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,418
Which makes you a better boxer?

1255
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,153
Having that one powerful shot or…

1256
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,956
Generally, the one
with polished technique is better.

1257
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,925
Power's something you're partly born with.

No, I mean it.
I can't even put it into words.

1268
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:08,658
Now I've got to prove

1269
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:11,361
I truly earned my spot in the Top Five

1270
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,495
on my skill alone.

1271
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:17,600
Now, from the red corner, Lim Yunchan,
how do you feel after the match?

1272
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:22,372
I thought about quitting boxing,

1273
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:27,310
but <i>I Am Boxer</i> made me want
to get back in the ring again.

1274
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:31,181
To be honest,
most of my boxing memories were bad ones.

1275
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:34,484
I fought a lot with my dad
over boxing, and…

1276
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:44,828
Not long after my first pro fight,
my dad fell sick and passed away.

1277
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,765
Even when he was ill,
I was determined to keep boxing.

1278
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:52,669
He said he was proud of me
for my hard work.

1279
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:59,609
[breathing shakily] But after he died,
all I did was drink, and I barely trained

1280
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:01,444
because I didn't want to do it anymore.

1281
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:06,149
Then I met Chaehyun early this year.

1282
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,384
We trained together,

1283
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:10,420
and boxing became fun again.

And I found family in the boxing society

1295

1346
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,321
[contestant 2] Kim Donghoe,

1347
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,958
[Seungjun] This final group is insane.

1348
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,627
[Youngho] This is gonna be wild.

1349
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:42,432
I was hoping to see this matchup.

-Yes.

1365
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,301

[contestant, in Korean]
Well, this is just…

1377
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:45,928
-The three amateur kings.
-[Sungmin] Head-to-head at last.

1378
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:48,431
-[♪ tense music playing]
-When I joined this show,

1379
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:51,534
I figured I'd face Taekmin one day.

1380
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,835
And that day is today.

1381
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:58,107
[Taekmin] Donghoe and I spar full-contact
at least four times a week.

1382
01:02:58,174 --> 01:02:59,609
We know each other inside out.

1383
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:03,279
And we both know
Hong Sungmin's game really well too.

1384
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:06,315
I'm up against Korea's top fighters,

1385
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:07,617
but I can beat them both.

1386
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:11,287
As the oldest guy here from a works team,

1387
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,790
I want to show I've still got it.

1388
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:17,460
Honestly, any one of them could win.

1389
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,295
It's about to get wild in here.

1390
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:21,831
-Let's go, guys!
-[contestant 1] Let's go!

1391

[contestant 2] You got this!

1392
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,902
[Youngho]
Man, the pressure hits different here.

1393
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,571
[contestant 3] Everyone here
brings serious weight to the ring.

1394
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,506
Only one of these guys gets to move on.

1395
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,875
Crazy when you think about it. [chuckles]

HONG SUNGMIN X KIM DONGHOE

1404
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,565
[Donghoe]
It was my first time facing Taekmin,

1405
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:58,301
so I started light, just feeling him out,
conserving my energy.

1406

[contestants exclaim]

1407
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,304
[Taekmin] He's really loading up.

1408
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:09,345
[Sungmin] That round was just
to figure him out and get my body going.

-Seriously.
-Wow.

1412
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:20,156
[Jongkook, in English]
Kind of a different level, right?

1413
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,526
[in Korean]
Kim Donghoe is about 10 kilograms heavier.

1414
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:26,462
[contestant 2] Sungmin, close that gap!

1415
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:30,032
Step in as you punch, Sungmin.

-[referee] Stop!

1417
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:34,103
First round's pretty chill.

1418
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,105
-Just feeling each other out.
-Yeah.

1419
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:37,874
[contestant] You did good.

1420
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,210
[Sungmin]
Since I'm in a lighter weight class,

1421
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:45,047
I was scared I might gas out
in the later rounds.

1422

I'm literally holding my breath.

1426
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:55,758
[Taekmin] To be honest, I felt confident.

1427
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:59,395
If this went 30, 40, 50 rounds,
I knew I'd win in the end.

He's just cruising in there.

[Donghoe]
My game plan was to conserve energy.

1438
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:43,506
Slipping shots, avoiding exchanges

1439
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:47,209

-[bell dings]

1441

[Taekmin]
I played it defensive in the first round.

1442
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:03,893
Since this could go 30 or even 40 rounds,

1443
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:06,595
I just told myself,
"Play it safe. Don't get greedy."

1444
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,831

01:09:33,035 --> 01:09:35,304
[Sungmin] It felt like
the real fight was about to begin.

1509
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:37,973
So I really focused on
not losing the momentum battle.

1510
01:09:38,641 --> 01:09:41,076
[Donghoe] The plan was still
to be patient, conserve energy,

1511
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:42,144
and go slow and steady.

1512
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:44,613
-[bell dings]
-All right, box!

1513
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,351
[contestant 1]
Sungmin, keep that rhythm going!

1514
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,353
[contestant 2] Nice slip, Sungmin!

1515

1516
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:58,961

Get in with confidence!

1519
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:11,040
[Lee] Go for it now!

1520
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:14,977
He should slowly shift gears.

1521
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:17,980
If he doesn't go harder now,
he'll be the one losing out.

1522
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,849
[Donghoe] Time to start picking him apart.

1523
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:24,787
[Taekmin] With unlimited rounds,
this fight's only just getting started.

1524
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:29,358
[Sungmin] Forget conserving energy,
I'm just pushing forward now.

1525
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:31,026
You got this!

1526
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:36,999
[in English] Three more rounds, yeah?

1527
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:38,734
[Jongkook] Oh, three more rounds?

1528
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:40,502
One last round for each!

1529
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,304
One last round for each!

1530
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:43,372
[Donghoe] Already?

1531
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,574
This is really it?

1532
01:10:47,776 --> 01:10:49,044
[Taekmin] That's unexpected.

1533
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:52,114

HONG SUNGMIN X KIM DONGHOE

1535
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:57,519
[Sungmin]
I threw the game plan out the window

1536
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,588
and just decided to empty the tank.

01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,431

[contestant 2] He's moving well.

1542
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:22,945
Kim Donghoe usually cruises
through his opponents,

1543
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,747
but not this time.

1544
01:11:25,881 --> 01:11:28,517
I usually use the ring ropes

1545
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,819
to corner my opponent and attack.

1546
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:32,154
So without the ropes,

1547
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:34,657
I couldn't keep my offense going.

You're doing great.

[Taekmin] I could tell
Donghoe was starting to lose steam.

1563
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,968

A little bit, right?

1565
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,872
He's at a disadvantage

01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:55,137
We're on the highest level, I think, yeah?

1675
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:58,774
You ever fought on top of a building?

1676
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:01,076
-I never have… I have never tried that.
-[laughing]

1677
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:03,679
[in Korean] Right?

1678
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,183
[Lee] So, this is our deathmatch arena.

1679
01:18:08,717 --> 01:18:12,421
We talked it over
and picked 6 out of the 10 who lost

1680
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:14,356
to give another shot.

1681
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:16,491
We'll run three matches tonight,

1682
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:18,827
and the winners will earn an extra pass.

1683
01:18:20,862 --> 01:18:23,231
-They're all too good to cut.
-Man, who should we pick?

1684
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,069
-[Dex] I'd love to see Yuk Junseo again.
-[Lee] Yeah, same.

1685
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,770
I love that aggressive style of his.

1686
01:18:28,837 --> 01:18:30,472
[in English] I think he was good.

1687
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:33,375
[in Korean] Yeah, let's give him
another shot. I want to see him again.

1688
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:35,744
-Kuk Seungjun?
-Great.

1689
01:18:36,311 --> 01:18:38,346
-[in English] This is MMA fighter, yeah?
-Yeah.

1690
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:40,582
[in Korean]
I'd like to see Hyunjun go again.

1691
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:41,650
Okay.

1692
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,554
[Dex, Lee] Here they come.

1693
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:48,924
[exclaims]

1694
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:50,225
[Dex] Oh…

1695
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,228
[Jongkook] They look awesome.

1696
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,397
[Dex] They look like gladiators.

1697
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,132
[contestant 1] Wow!

1698
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:00,368
-[Youngho] Man, what's this now?
-[contestant 2 sighs]

1699
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:03,171
[Shin Donghyun] Guess we're doing
another crazy thing on the roof tonight.

1700
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:07,409
[Junseo] I've made it this far.
I'll die on my shield if I have to.

1701
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:12,114
[Youngho] So it's not over yet.

1702
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:15,584
[Jongkook] Man, this will be tough.

1703
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:21,256
Bivol, please reveal the deathmatch.

1704
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:24,126
[in English] This deathmatch is

1705
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,394
The Tire Brawl.

1706
01:19:26,461 --> 01:19:27,963
The Tire Brawl.

1707
01:19:28,029 --> 01:19:30,031
[contestants exclaim]

1708
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,533
Whoa…

1709
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:34,136
Oh, dear Lord.

1710
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:37,172
[Hyunjun] What is that tire?

1711
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:39,508
[Seungjun]
Will I be fighting in that tiny space?

1712
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:42,310
[Junseo]
Hmm. I've never tried that before.

1713
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,912
How does that even work?

1714
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:47,349
[Jongkook] Let me explain the rules
of this deathmatch,

1715
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:49,184
The Tire Brawl.

1716
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:52,988
Both fighters will have one foot
placed in the tire

1717
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:54,689
and box it out from there.

1718
01:19:57,759 --> 01:20:00,929
The Tire Brawl is a single round fight.

1719
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:02,564
[in English] I think stop.

1720
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,065
-Stop! Stop!
-[bell dings]

1721
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:06,401
[Jongkook, in Korean] The fight will go on

1722
01:20:07,302 --> 01:20:08,937
until the Master calls it.

1723
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:15,343
Now, here's how many of you
will survive this deathmatch.

1724
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:17,679
Out of the six of you here…

1725
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:21,917
three will survive.

1726
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:25,086
-Oh… Three? So half will survive.
-[♪ tense music playing]

1727
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:28,590
[Minwoo] Hearing that three of us
would get back in the game

1728
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,425
really fired me up.

1729
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:34,229
[Junseo]
So I have to beat my opponent to survive.

1730
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:36,932
[Jongkook] Should a KO occur,

1731
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:40,502
your survival or elimination
will be decided on the spot.

1732
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,537
[Shin Donghyun] I have to score a KO.

1733
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:45,340
If no KO occurs,

1734
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:49,978
the Masters will choose
the final survivors.

1735
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:53,014
[Youngho]
I'll give every last drop I've got.

1736
01:20:53,081 --> 01:20:55,083
[Minwoo]
This is the last consolation match,

1737
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,151
so I'll go all out.

1738
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:59,688
[Seungjun] I plan to keep pushing
and rise even higher.

1739
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:02,490
[Dex] Ah, I could never do this.
I'd be scared out of my mind.

1740
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:04,259
Fighting at this distance?

1741
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,295
-[♪ intense music playing]
-[Jongkook] We'll announce the matchups

1742
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,564
of the Tire Brawl deathmatch.

1743
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,701
[Lee] The fighter
to enter the deathmatch is…

1744
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:16,471
Park Youngho.

1745
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:21,576
[Jongkook] He has great stamina.

1746
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:23,745
He's strong, and he's got the weight.

1747
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:25,380
[contestant 1 sighs]
This is just too scary.

1748
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:29,985
The person I want to avoid
is Park Youngho.

1749
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:33,822
He's got the weight
that lets him absorb those hits.

1750
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:36,791
The guy's strength is no joke.

1751
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,361
[Shin Donghyun laughing]

1752
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:40,428
That's freakin' scary.

1753
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:42,030
I trained really hard for this.

1754
01:21:42,097 --> 01:21:43,732
I'm ready to fire up an engine now.

1755
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,469
Since I'm the type who prefers infighting

1756
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:51,473
and slugging it out up close,

1757
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:53,642
I figured I'd have the edge here.

1758
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:56,344
[Lee] The fighter facing him is…

1759
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,048
Kuk Seungjun.

1760
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:01,816
Kuk Seungjun.

1761
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:03,418
[contestants clapping]

1762
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:07,455
[contestant 1]
This is really going to be tough for him.

1763
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,660
-[Bivol] There's a 21-kilo difference.
-[Lee] Twenty-one? Wow.

1764
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:13,094
That's a bit of a gap.

1765
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:15,563
[in English] Is, uh, the skill…

1766
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:17,899
-Skill guy? He's skillful, yeah?
-[Lee] Yeah.

1767
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:21,436
Against not skillful, but a big one, yeah?

1768
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:22,871
-And a strong one.
-[Lee] Yeah.

1769
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:25,707
[Jongkook, in Korean]
But he can really take hits, you know.

1770
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,108
You saw it earlier.

1771
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:28,343
He absorbs all the damage.

1772
01:22:29,244 --> 01:22:30,512
[Youngho] I felt confident.

1773
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:33,048
Honestly, I really did. No joke.

1774
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:35,784
I've fought against Kuk Seungjun before.

1775
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:39,321
I could see that he preferred
to fight on the outside.

1776
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,456
But say you tie us up close?

1777
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,491
I'm the infighter between us.

1778
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:46,361
"Yeah, I think I can do this."

1779
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:47,696
That's what I thought.

1780
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:49,030
I was terrified.

1781
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:51,099
I was like,
"If he hits me clean, I'm dead."

1782
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:56,004
Still, his boxing experience isn't long.

1783
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:58,673
So I figured I'd use the body combos
I've sharpened with my technique

1784
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:01,176
and really use my skills to the fullest

1785
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:02,978
to show what I'm made of.

1786
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:10,618
[Lee] The Tire Brawl deathmatch…

1787
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,289
starts now.

1788
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:17,459
Box!

1789
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:18,793
[bell dings]

1790
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:20,261
-[contestant] Let's go!
-[referee] Box!

1791
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,166
[Jongkook] Okay, nice.

1792
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,369
[contestant 2] Don't forget to breathe!

1793
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:30,372
-Oh, boy.
-Nice, that's it. Keep going.

1794
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,882
Yes! Drive that hook into the body!

1795
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:43,184
-He's aiming at the body.
-He's going to the body.

1796
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,754
[Seungjun]
He kept a high guard the whole time,

1797
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:48,723
so my plan was to spot the openings

1798
01:23:48,790 --> 01:23:52,427
and go to the body or throw hooks.

1799
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:56,765
[contestant 1] Okay, sweet!

1800
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:02,203
[Jongkook] Oh! Nice short shots!

1801
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:04,039
[contestant 2] Keep it short and sweet!

1802
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:07,542
[Youngho] He kept going to my body
in the earlier match too.

1803
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:11,346
But I've never gone down
from taking a body shot.

1804
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:13,581
[Lee] Seungjun, get your guard up!

1805
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:17,118
[Youngho] Honestly,
I don't recall feeling any of it.

1806
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:19,421
Hey! Hey!

1807
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:22,323
[contestant 1] Get lower!

1808
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,758
-You're too high!
-[Jongkook] Hey, hey!

1809
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:25,060
[contestant 2] Keep it short, man!

1810
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:26,728
-Guard up and breathe!
-[Jongkook] Guard up!

1811
01:24:26,795 --> 01:24:28,396
Park Youngho's durability is…

1812
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:29,664
Ouch.

1813
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:33,068
[Shin Donghyun] He's about to gas.
Just hang in there, Youngho.

1814
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:37,705
Yes, keep breathing. That's it.

1815
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:44,446
-[contestant 1] You've got more power!
-[contestant 2] Hey.

1816
01:24:44,512 --> 01:24:45,814
[contestant 1] Guard up!

1817
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,049
Don't try to slip everything!
Guard up, man!

1818
01:24:48,116 --> 01:24:49,717
[contestants exclaim]

1819
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,157
The fighter to enter the deathmatch is…

1820
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:58,960
The two Muay Thai fighters,
carrying its pride.

1821
01:24:59,027 --> 01:25:00,762
[Minwoo]
I'll tear into him like a real mad dog.

1822
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:03,531
-Box!
-[Dex] That one got in.

1823
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:06,568
-[Lee] Oh! Down!
-[referee] Down!

1824
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:07,769
[contestant] Hey, hey!

1825
01:25:07,836 --> 01:25:09,370
Keep going! Don't stop!

1826
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,172
[in English] Work, work, work, work!

1827
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:15,176
[in Korean] We have three empty seats.

1828
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,645
-Are they not coming?
-Maybe they're hiding.

1829
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:19,614
WHO ARE THE THREE SURVIVORS
OF THE DEATHMATCH?

I will win this no matter what.

1833
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:29,791

you'd better brace yourself.
