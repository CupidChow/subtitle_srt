It's way too narrow.

-Looks like an underground arena.
-Yeah.

25
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:37,263
Honestly, this setup

48
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,733
It looks even smaller with them in there.

49
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,735
There's no way he'd lose this.

50
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:56,342
First off, I'm just glad to go up
against such an admirable opponent.

51
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:59,913
I'll show you what a champion can do.

52

-Love that confidence.
-[Jongkook] Absolutely.

53

He's not losing this one.

55

[sighs] It's so tiny, though.

56
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,092
[contestant 2] Sure, we can manage.
But that's way too tight for you guys.

57
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,694
It's crazy tight in there.

58
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,996
That thing's cramped.

59
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:18,998
They just have to bang it out in there.

60
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,900

63
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,944
<i>So I thought,</i>
<i>"How do I game-plan in here?"</i>

64
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:37,584
<i>Until now, I have only ever fought</i>
<i>in square rings over five meters in size.</i>

65

90
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,481
[Sanggeun] That jab's really landing.

91
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,021
[Dex] His jabs are knocking
Kim Taesun's whole body back.

92
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,889
Man, I want that jab.

93
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:54,394
[Taesun] <i>He's in a higher weight class,</i>
<i>so I found myself getting pushed back.</i>

94
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:59,065
But my strength isn't just
my punching power.

95
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,500
I've got a good chin too.

96
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,005
<i>I wanted to read his style</i>
<i>and drain his gas tank a bit,</i>

97
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:08,841
<i>so I figured I'd eat a few shots.</i>

98
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,113
The damage is probably adding up.

99
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,250
His lead hand is great.

100
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,519
[contestant 2] Don't go in.
Strike from there.

101
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:21,120
Stay there and strike.

102
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,822
Since it's so tight.

103
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,658
-No room to dodge.
-Find your rhythm, Taesun.

104
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,962
[Taesun] <i>But once I started taking</i>
<i>the hits, they just kept landing.</i>

105
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,265
<i>I thought, "This isn't going right."</i>

106
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,570
[contestant 1] Man,
the lead hand really matters, huh?

107
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,506
Wow, that jab is clean.

108
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,580
[contestant 2] He needs
to catch him when he jabs.

109
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,516
[contestants gasping]

110
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:54,587
Okay, strike from there.

111
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,290
[contestant 2] Get out of there.

112
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,026
Once you're trapped, that's it.

113
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,294
He needs to press forward.

114
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:03,730
All right!

115
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:04,931
Strike up close!

116

-That's it.
-Ten seconds!

117

-Ten seconds!
-Ten seconds!

118
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,505
[contestant 2] The way he slips those
so easily shows how experienced he is.

119
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,607
[contestant] All right!

120

-That was great.

123
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,783
[contestant] Nice game.

124
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,485
That was something else.

125
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:29,222
But in the second round,
I'm curious to see how…

126
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,289
[Jongkook] We'll have to see.

127
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,425
[Dex] I wonder how they'll manage
their gas tanks.

128
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,560
[Jongkook] Lee Sanggeun's jab is
worth noting.

129
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,195
It's really sharp.

130
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,398
[Sanggeun] <i>My plan was working.</i>

131
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,768
Taesun was struggling to find his way in.

132
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,370
<i>I stuck to jabs,</i>
<i>countering when punches came in,</i>

133
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:47,707
<i>and firing combos</i>
<i>whenever I saw an opening.</i>

134
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,442
<i>That was my plan all along.</i>

135
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,746
My plan was to turn it up
in the second round anyway.

136
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:57,350
I kept it tight to tire him out,

137
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,820
<i>and then switch the fight to my rhythm.</i>

138
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,524
Coach is great at flicking those shots in.

139
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,958
He just pops them in.

140
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,295
But Taesun's swinging too wide.
He seems a little thrown off.

141
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,763
[Dongjin] His lead hand isn't landing.

142
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,399
Let's see if Kim Taesun commits here.

143
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,902
Let's go, guys!

144
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,303

-Let's go!

145
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,371

146
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,940
-[contestant 1] It's the last round.
-[bell dings]

147
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,241

-[all exclaim]
-Nice shot to the head!

152
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,924

[contestants exclaiming]

154
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,966
Coach is doing awesome.

155
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,170
[Taesun] <i>Once I lost my timing,</i>
<i>I just kept losing it.</i>

156
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:53,606
That's when I knew I had to reset.

157
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:58,077
<i>So I decided to aim for the body</i>
<i>as best as I could.</i>

158
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,646
Yeah, give one and take one!

159
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:01,914
Sounds weighty.

[contestant 1] Nice shot!

161
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,087
Good. Now aim for the body!

162
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,628

-[contestants gasping]
-[gasps]

164
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,535
His biggest flaw is
that he doesn't have a proper jab.

165
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:26,472
His defense is solid.

166
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,341
[contestant 3] Yes, use your range!

167
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,942
-Nice shot!
-He's got him trapped.

168
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,248
-He's trapped.
-He needs to stay out of the corner.

169
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,817
-This is crazy.
-Get out of there!

180

[Dex] For some reason,
Kim Taesun just can't get anything going.

181
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,550
It's the jabs, they're adding damage.

-Damage?
-It's bound to.

183
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,020
[Dex] Must be really adding up then.

184

-He hits hard.
-Yeah.

236
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,951
That's a Muay Thai punch right there.

237
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,487
[Dex] You can really feel the force
behind Kim Hyunjun's punches.

238
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,624

[Dex] Nice.

247
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,476
But it's risky.

248
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,511
You need to slip then throw,

249
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,581
but if you only slip,
you're eventually going to eat one.

250
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,251

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,639
[contestant 4] Man, he's really tall.

341
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,575
[contestant 5] That reach, though.

342
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:46,078
This is basically fencing.

343
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,314
[Hunsu] <i>Since I've got more reach,</i>

344
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,450
<i>I figured I should use it to my advantage.</i>

345
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,019
Look at Kim Hunsu go!

346
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,989
Kim Hunsu's punches
have real weight behind them.

347
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,123
They're intimidating.

348
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,394
[contestant] Gijun is looking
a bit stiff right now.

349
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,929
It's the height difference.

350
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,969
[Gijun] <i>I wasn't expecting the volleyball</i>
<i>guy to be that good of a boxer.</i>

351
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,138
He kept throwing punches.

352
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,606
I just couldn't settle in.

353
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:17,977
He's too big to get in on easily.

354
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,812
[contestant 2] No need
to close the distance!

355
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,015
[contestant 3] Go first!
Make the first move!

356
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,884
-[contestant 4] Keep him at range!
-[contestant 5] Just keep your guard up.

357
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,554
[Gijun] <i>I'm like,</i>
<i>"Screw it. I'm going in."</i>

358
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,790
[contestants exclaiming]

359
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,129
Keep going!

360
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,131
Boy, he got caught.

361
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,600
[Jongkook] Yes, that's how you go in.

362
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:42,668
[contestant 1] That's it.

363
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:44,603
Just swing!

364
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,109
-Nice!
-That's it!

365
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,977
[Juyeong] Keep your chin down, man!

366
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,946
[Dex] Kim Hunsu is coming at him hard.

367
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,582
But Lee Gijun's not giving ground.

368
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,351
[Minwoo] Gijun, pressure him!

369
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,421
Good, keep it up!

370
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,458
[contestant 1] All right!

371
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,826
[Juyeong] Chin down! Chin down!

372
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:08,994
[Dex] He's pressuring him hard!

373
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,563
-[Juyeong] Your chin!
-[Dex] One minute!

374
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,765
Tag out if you need to!

375
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,366
-Tag out, man!
-Switch players.

376
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,068
All right, you're up.

377
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,136
[referee] Stop!

378
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:19,905
-They're switching.
-All right.

379
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,607
RED CORNER SWITCH: LEE JUYEONG

380
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,008
You can continue if you want.

381
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,144
You good, Gijun? Okay.

382
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,614
-Looks like Gijun chose not to tag out.
-[Jongkook] He's holding up well.

383
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,382
[contestant] Wait, why didn't they switch?

384
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,584
Nah, I think he's still good.

385
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,254
[Gijun] <i>I wanted to save Minwoo's stamina,</i>

386
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,323
<i>and I still had some energy left,</i>

387
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,392
-<i>so I decided not to tag out.</i>
-[bell dings]

388
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,428
-Let's go, Gijun!
-Come this way, Gijun!

389
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,496
No, don't back up!

390
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,065
[contestant 2] Connect your jab!

391
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,132
[contestant 1] Don't back up!

392
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,467
[contestant 3] That's it!

393
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,036
[Gijun] <i>My goal was to keep Juyeong moving</i>

394
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:54,473
<i>and burn his stamina.</i>

395
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,508
Gijun, back up and breathe!

396
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,211
[contestant 2] Press him!

397
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,113
-Hound him!
-[contestant 3] Nice!

398
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,182
[contestants exclaiming]

399
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,151
Nice, Juyeong!

400
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,154
Nice, Juyeong!

401
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:13,692
Those shots are freaking loaded.

402
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:15,394
He's not tiring out.

403
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,296
[contestant 2] Gijun, get in there!

404
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:18,464
Ten seconds!

405
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,133
[contestant] Gijun, ease your way in.

406
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,568
All right.

407
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,869
Keep breathing, man.

408
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,472
Stay calm, stay calm.

409
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:27,940
Nice, nice, nice.

410
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,042
LEE JUYEONG X LEE GIJUN

411
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,477
-Stop!
-[Jongkook] Okay, time's up.

412
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,914
He did all four minutes alone.

413
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,282
Could be their strategy.

414
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,284
Both guys from red are out of gas.

415
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,355
This way,
Kim Minwoo got to save some energy.

416
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,458
Red will probably send in Lee Juyeong.

417
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,528
[contestant] Blue's definitely making
the switch now, right?

418
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,930
[announcer] <i>Fighters, step in.</i>

419
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,667
[Lee] Red's sending out Lee Juyeong.

420
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,269
[Jongkook] Continuing from the last round.

421
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,571
Whoa.

422
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,839
[exclaims]

423
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,207
He's going back in again?

424
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,645
-They haven't switched either.
-It's Lee Gijun again?

425
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:08,013
BLUE CORNER R2 LEE GIJUN

426
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,649
This is definitely a strategy call.

427
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,118
Looks like he's trying to run
until he's empty.

428
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,788
[Gijun] <i>First off,</i>
<i>I felt like I still had enough stamina,</i>

429
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,223
<i>so I stepped back in.</i>

430
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:22,361
[Minwoo] <i>The plan was to keep</i>
<i>one fighter fresh as long as we could.</i>

431
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,697
We figured managing our stamina smartly
could help us take the win,

432
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,200
<i>so we had Gijun start things off.</i>

433
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,502
LEE JUYEONG X LEE GIJUN

434
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,172
-[bell dings]
-They need to keep a cool head now.

435
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,340
-Need to fight smart from here.
-[contestant] All right.

436
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,808
Don't freeze up.

437
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,112
[contestants exclaiming]

438
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:42,915
That's a clean hit.

439
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,917
He tossed an uppercut like that?

440
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,953
-[Minwoo] Strike!
-[Hunsu] Notch it down a bit.

441
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,821
[contestants] This is it! Yes!

442
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,323
[exclaims]

443
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,525
[contestant 1] Counter… No!

444
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,060
[contestant 2] How is he so good?

445
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,461
[contestant 3] His stamina is crazy.

446
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,263
-Fix your stance!
-All right!

447
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,765
[contestant 7] Did you see that footwork?

448
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,468
He's moving really well.

449
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,804
Looks like Lee Gijun still has gas.

450
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,972
Hang tough, man!

451
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,677
[Juyeong] <i>I was like, "Wow, he's strong."</i>

452
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,579
<i>"He's stronger than I expected."</i>

453
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,814
[contestant] Remember, pace yourself.

454
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,618
-[Dex] Wait, I think he's bleeding a bit.
-[Jongkook] Yeah, he is.

455
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:24,623
[contestant 3] He's getting worked up.

456
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,159
Stay calm, stay calm.

457
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,896
BLUE CORNER SWITCH: KIM MINWOO

458
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:32,164
-[exclaiming]
-Tag out, tag out.

459
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,334
He's finally tagging out.

460
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,568
[contestant 3] Smart strategy.

461
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:38,337
[Hunsu] Relax, relax.

462
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:39,938
We're doing good.

463
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,510
[Juyeong] <i>When Minwoo came in,</i>
<i>I thought, "Let's settle this for good."</i>

464
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:48,914
All right, let's go.

465
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,649
[Juyeong] <i>I think I got a bit fired up.</i>

466
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,554
[Minwoo] <i>"Come on,</i>
<i>let's fight for real now."</i>

467
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:57,889
[referee] All right, let's go.

468
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,259
-Box!
-[contestant 1] Let's go!

469
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,562
LEE JUYEONG X KIM MINWOO

470
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:05,230
[contestant 2] See that opening, yeah?

471
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,366
[contestants exclaiming]

472
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,439
[Dex] Lee Juyeong's losing his cool a bit.

473
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,443
You know how it is,
people kind of snap when they smell blood.

474
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,449
[contestant] Oh, no. He's losing his cool.

475
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:28,053
Relax, man!

476
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,454
You have to stay calm!

477
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,829
[contestant 1] He's pissed.

478
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,665
[contestant 2] I think
they should switch him out.

479
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,767
-[contestant 1] He's getting greedy.
-Hey, tag out!

480
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,968
Tag out, Juyeong!

481
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,636
Tag out! Tag out!

482
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,905
-Juyeong, you need to tag out!
-Switch, switch!

483
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,608
[contestant 2] He's not letting
that happen.

484
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,712
He's not letting that happen.

485
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,647
[contestant 3] He won't let him tag out.

486
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,417
You could say this is a strategy move.

487
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,920
[contestant 4] Lee Juyeong can't switch
out now.

488
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,223
This has turned into
a pride thing for him.

489
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,926
-Get back in for the last round.
-You gotta win this.

490
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,027
Switch, switch!

491
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,496
[contestant 7] Tag out!

492
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,065
Use that rule to your advantage!

493
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,267
[Juyeong] <i>I think I got too worked up.</i>

494
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,404
<i>The fight just wasn't going my way.</i>

495
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,240
[contestant] Yes, that's it!

496
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,110
He's getting dragged.

497
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,978
[contestant 2] Juyeong, get out of there!

498
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,347
You have to tag out now!

499
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,848
[Jongkook] He needs to extend further.

500
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,050
-Further, extend further.
-[contestant 3] Upper to the body!

501
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:33,185
He's staying on him.

502
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,654
[contestants exclaim]

503
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,255
[exclaims]

504
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,557
Stay calm!

505
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:43,261
-All right! That's it!
-[contestant 1] Come, come, come!

506
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,463
[contestant 2] All right!

507
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,565
-[Dex] He blocked the tag!
-[Jongkook] No, he tagged out.

508
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:47,632
[Lee] All right!

509
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,401
-He blocked the tag!
-No, he tagged out.

510
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,103
[contestant 1] Let's go!

511
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,538
[contestant 2] Just endure this round.

512
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,607
[contestant 3] This should be fun.
The heavyweights.

513
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:57,943
[Jongkook] They have to go for it now.

514
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,544
They can't stall here.

515
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,179
-Not long now, man!
-[exclaiming]

516
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,414
[contestant 5] Yes, that's it!

517
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:03,582
-Nice move!
-Go in!

518
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,283
No, you have to keep going!

519
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,086
[Sungmin] Keep going!

520
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,256
[contestants] All right!

521
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,827
He's getting clipped
by those random swings.

522
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:17,863
All right, the head!

523
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,097
[contestant 4] Load it up!

524
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,532
-Hunsu, don't stop!
-Push forward!

525
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,601
[Jongkook] The height difference works.

526
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,668
[contestant 6] Get in there!

527
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,805
Kim Hunsu has the heart of a warrior,

528
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:28,240
although he may lack technique.

529
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,975
[contestant 1] Power through!

530
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,411
[contestants exclaiming]

531
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,745
[exclaims]

532
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,550
[Dex] Kim Hunsu's got
real animal instinct.

533
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,821
[contestant 2] As expected
from a heavyweight.

534
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,059
-Those wild shots are somehow landing.
-[bell dings]

535
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,928
-[referee] Stop!
-[contestant 1] Okay, round over.

536
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,597
[contestant 3] This tag match is fun.

537
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,399
[contestant 4] It really is. [chuckles]

538
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,668
This one's
seriously entertaining. [chuckles]

539
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:58,804
Wow. [chuckles]

540
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:01,440
-This is gonna be a tough call.
-[Dex] Right?

541
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,241
[Juyeong] Looks
like Kim Minwoo is spent now.

542
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:04,609
Gijun will probably step back in.

543
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,979
I got too worked up earlier.
I couldn't stick to my style.

544
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,381
Yeah. You go first.

545
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,184
I'll take the first half of this round.

546
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,819
Cool your head for now.

547
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,520
-Go slow and stay composed.
-Okay.

548
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,290
[announcer] <i>Fighters, step in.</i>

549
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,326
[Lee] Who's stepping in? Oh, I see.

550
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,763
[contestant] Let's go!

551
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,432
[Dex] Blue corner is letting
Gijun rest more.

552
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:32,270
RED CORNER R3 LEE JUYEONG

553
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:35,440
Man, this is intense.

554
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,310
-These two again?
-Toe-to-toe?

555
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:39,377
[chuckles]

556
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,746
He's already getting heated.

557
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,150
[contestant 2] Remember,
keep your head cool.

558
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:50,856
[Minwoo] <i>Lee Juyeong was staring</i>
<i>holes through me.</i>

559
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,390
<i>Guess he wanted to get right into it.</i>

560
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,558
[contestant] Stay calm!

561
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,094
-[Juyeong] <i>Bring it.</i>
-[bell dings]

562
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,629
[Juyeong] <i>I won't back off an inch.</i>

563
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,164
-Let's go!
-Let's go, Juyeong!

564
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,867
[Gijun] Remember, it's the last round.

565
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:02,934
-[bell dings]
-Last round!

566
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,536
-Box!
-[contestants] Last round!

567
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:05,871
[Jongkook] Yes, drive it in there.

568
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,973
-[contestant] All right!
-[Jongkook] That's it!

569
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,342
Stay calm! It's okay! Just stay calm!

570
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,577
[Jongkook] That's it! Smother him!

571
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:14,980
-All right!
-Juyeong, doing good!

572
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,648
-That's it!
-Stay calm!

573
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:18,750
[contestant 5] Don't get too heated.

574
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,852
[contestant 6] Just do
what you're thinking.

575
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:21,920
[contestant 7] Nice shot.

576
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,256
-[contestant 8] Relax, keep it cool!
-[contestants] Oh, whoa!

577
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,091
He's getting too worked up.

578
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,194
[contestant 9] You need insane stamina
to keep that up.

579
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:32,931
[Jongkook] Nice body shot.

580
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,132
Nice left punch.

581
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,433
[Hunsu] Stay calm!

582
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,536
-Nice! Yes, this is it!
-[contestants exclaiming]

583
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,938
Lee Juyeong's specialty is the left hook.

584
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,039
[Hunsu] Stay calm!

585
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,312
Careful, careful.

586
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,446
Tell me if you're tired.

587
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,720
[Dex] He's settling down now.

588
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,122
[contestant 1] Wow, he's taunting him.

589
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,899
[Dex laughs, exclaims]

590
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,569
Juyeong has a bit of crazy in him,
doesn't he? [chuckles]

591
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:11,636
He sure does.

592
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,139
"Oh, you hit me? Come here, you."

593
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:16,341
He's feeding off it to go even harder.

594
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,745
Take your shot, man!

595
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,952
[contestants exclaiming]

596
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,253
[contestant 1] He's real fiery.

597
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,456
[Dex] Unless someone gets knocked out
here, this is going to be tough to judge.

598
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,060
[contestant 2] This is scary.

599
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,828
[contestant 3] Go in further!

600
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,230
[Minwoo] <i>I was debating</i>
<i>whether to match his intensity</i>

601
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,433
<i>or stick to a smart</i>
<i>hit-and-switch strategy.</i>

602
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,804
Come, let's switch.

603
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:47,739
Come.

604
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,742
-[Lee] They're switching.
-[contestant 1] Smart move.

605
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,644
BLUE CORNER LAST FIGHTER:
LEE GIJUN

606
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,412
They're switching too.

607
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,482
RED CORNER LAST FIGHTER:
KIM HUNSU

608
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,985
[contestant 3 gasps] This is gonna be
the deciding moment.

609
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,319
All right, let's go!

610
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,922
Okay, box!

611
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,657
[contestant 1] Just do
what you've been doing.

612
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,725
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

613
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,094
[Lee] Gijun's coming in fresh now.

614
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,795
[Jongkook] He's back in with fresh legs.

615
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,400
[Dex] But Kim Hunsu is no joke either.
He's strong, and he's got a solid chin.

616
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,270
Gijun, try fighting closer now!

617
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,272
[contestant 2] You've got
to keep it calm! Relax!

618
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:22,340
[contestant 3] Slow down!

619
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,043
[contestant 4] Watch his lower hand.

620
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,312
[Jongkook] Guard up, guard up.

621
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,514
Kim Hunsu's guard is dropping way too low.

622
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,549
Watch his lower hand.

623
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,020
[Jongkook] He's gotta step
in and throw now.

624
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,221
But with this size gap…

625
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:37,589
Yeah, no way that reaches.

626
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,391
Throw one at a time.

627
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,559
[contestant 2] Okay, hit and move!

628
00:27:41,626 --> 00:27:43,795
[contestants exclaiming]

629
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,497
He caught him!

630
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,566
That was an overhand!

631
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:54,272
-Fake low, then throw the overhand up top.
-[cheers]

632
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,707
[Minuk] His overhand keeps landing.

633
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,442
Because the guard is down.

634
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,144
Yeah, it's completely down.

635
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,113
Just do what you did earlier.

636
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,482
Yes, just like that!

637
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,453
[contestant 1] Okay! Okay!

638
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,255
[exclaiming]

639
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,623
That shot did real damage!

640
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,991
He felt that one!

641
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:15,160
Hey, stay calm, stay calm!

642
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,129
-Deep breaths!
-[contestant 2] He's loosened up now.

643
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,330
You can't beat him now.

644
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,270
-[contestant 3] There you go!
-[contestant 4] How is he so good?

645
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:27,939
[grunting]

646
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:29,574
[contestant 3] All right!

647
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,444
All right, do everything you want!

648
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,845
Anything you want, Gijun!

649
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,280
[grunting continues]

650
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,347
Wait, that's too--

651
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:37,449
[contestant 4] There you go!

652
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,387
[contestant 5]
Give it everything you've got!

653
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,522
-Okay, last one!
-Ten seconds!

654
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,825
[contestant 6] One last time! Ten seconds!

655
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,893
Ten seconds!

656
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,395
Keep throwing!

657
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,330
-[contestant 1] Come on!
-[grunting, groaning]

658
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,265
[contestant 2] Okay, last one!

659
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,834
-[contestant 3] Let's go!
-Go for it!

660
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,068
-Stop!
-[contestant 4] All right!

661
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,136
[contestant cheering]

662
00:28:58,203 --> 00:28:59,604
-Wow.
-Man, that was good.

663
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,073
[Lee] Well fought.

664
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,742
[chattering]

665
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,110
Lee Gijun's real good.

666
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:07,712
I mean, what a fight! [chuckles]

667
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:10,815
Lee Gijun held his ground so well.

668
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,784
-That was amazing.
-Yeah, they were great.

669
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,886
[contestant 1] You two did great!

670
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:16,387
You guys were awesome!

671
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,690
[Lee] The winners of this match are…

672
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,994
[contestant 7] If he stayed a bit calmer,
he might've done even better.

673
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,463
[contestant 8] Blue takes this.

674
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:29,334
[Hunsu]
It's bittersweet, but I feel relieved too.

675
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,504
I think I showed everything I had.

676
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,441
[Minwoo] I thought we had this one.

677
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:42,647
[Lee] Lee Gijun and Kim Minwoo
from the blue corner.

678
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:44,516
-[contestant 1] Yeah!
-[contestant 2] That was sick!

679
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:46,417
-[contestant 3] Good game.
-[contestant 2] Well fought!

680
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:50,755
But honestly, Lee Juyeong,
the performance you put on in that ring…

681
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:54,359
I'm older than you, but man…
What you showed in there was impressive.

682
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,426
Thank you.

683
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,228
The truth is,

684
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,298
I haven't trained properly lately.

685
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,202
It's been maybe a month and a half.

686
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,273
I kind of…

687
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,508
Well, I hit a slump.

688
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,877
And I just started living alone in Seoul.

689
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:16,080
So my rent
is a bit overdue too. [chuckles]

690
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,415
[chuckles]

691
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,287
I need to make money,
but work's hard to find.

692
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,958
I've been going through
a major slump in boxing.

693
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,364
I probably sent over 50 part-time
job applications in a week.

694
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,501
No one wanted to hire me,
because I'm a middle school grad.

695
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,803
People keep telling me,

696
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:43,074
"It'd be a waste if you quit boxing."

697
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,110
But I still need to eat to survive.

698
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:52,016
So, I've really been debating
whether to continue or not…

699
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:55,820
[sighs]

700
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:56,988
But I want to keep going.

701
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:58,857
[breathing heavily]

702
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,094
[contestants, judges] Aw.

703
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,064
That's the spirit!

704
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,899
Man, I'm tearing up.

705
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:10,902
You're awesome.

706
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,140

-[contestant 3] Let's go, man!

711
00:31:28,686 --> 00:31:30,388
[cheering continues]

712
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,823
PARK YOUNGHO, SHIN DONGHYUN

713
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,124
[Dex] This team's a strong pair.

714
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,994
[Jongkook] Shin Donghyun is no joke.

715
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,829
He's signed with O*E Championship.

716
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,998
-Right, he's the first Korean to do it.
-[Jongkook] Mmm.

717
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,167
I'm sure he got signed for a reason.

718
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:46,838
-And Park Youngho's body is insane.
-[Jongkook] That's right.

719
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,907
[Lee]
He won the fitness model championship.

720
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,876
[contestant 1] Damn,
he's gonna be tough to break.

721
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,044

00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,418
You got this!

726
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:02,353
[contestant 2]
Show them how outboxing is done!

727
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,155
[Jihyeok] Know anything about that guy?

728
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:05,823
[Seongjun] Oh, you mean Ko Yohan?

729
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,759
Not a clue.

730
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,494
Is he a pro athlete?

731
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,630
[Lee] Kim Dongeon. An elite boxer.

732
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,565
A high school student and a bus driver.

733
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,334
KIM DONGEON, KO YOHAN

734
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,703
DURING THE TAG RING TEAM FORMATION

735
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,606
May I ask what sport you do?

736
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,107
I'm just a bus driver.

737
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:24,242
-Really?
-Yes.

738
00:32:24,842 --> 00:32:26,577
He said he was a bus driver.

739
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,681
So I was like, "This could be real bad."

740
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,886
There's a huge weight difference here.

741
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,455
TOTAL WEIGHT
RED: 147 KG, BLUE: 158 KG

742
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:38,890
This is not going to be easy.

743
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,460
[Shin Donghyun] I was thinking,

744
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,330
"We're basically getting a free win here."

745
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:47,031
"This round's gonna be an easy one."

746
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:50,168
Losing to these guys

747
00:32:50,234 --> 00:32:52,136
would make no sense at all.

748
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,172
Winning is a no-brainer.

749
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:56,941
I expect to finish them by KO.

750
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,243
Shin Donghyun from the blue corner,

751
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,946
care to share your thoughts
before the fight?

752
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,248
I'll finish them off for sure.

753
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,950
I hope there's an ambulance ready.

754
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,518

755

-Let's get it!

756
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,955
-Skrr, skrr.
-[contestant laughs]

757
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,726
I realized they were looking down on us.

758
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:19,330
I guess you're underestimating me
because I'm a high schooler.

759
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,898
Today, I'll show you instead.

760
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,234
-…I'll show you instead.

All right.

-One will hold the pace…
-[Dex] Yes.

773
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,104
…then the other will come in
with the technique.

774
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,206
[Lee] It's gonna be a slugfest.

775

[Youngho] Not sure we'll see boxing,

782
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,524
but a brawl is guaranteed.

783
00:34:20,258 --> 00:34:22,994
[Yohan] I won't back down no matter what.

784
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,595
Be confident! Throw a combo!

785
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:25,797
Straighten up and one-two!

the power gap is massive.

796
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,925
[contestant 6] Nice body shot.

803
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,973
I mean, it's not
your typical boxing match.

804
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,876
-It's basically a street fight.
-Looks like he's gonna gas out.

805
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,478
All right, keep brawling!

806
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:14,912

and you'll kill yourself out there.

[referee] Hurry up and switch!

821
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,881
Can you stay?
Let's switch after 30 seconds.

822
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,885
[Dex] Looks like Ko Yohan is staying in.

823
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:57,788
[Dongeon]
Since we had no data on the other team,

824
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,324
we had Ko Yohan go first

825
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,927
so I could read them

826
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,862
and figure out how to approach the match.

827
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,330
Okay, box!

828
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,833

829
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,203

-That body shot connected nicely.

00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,543
[grunting, groaning]

833
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,044
[contestant 4] His jabs are pretty clean.

834
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,613
[contestant 5] Nice shot!

835
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,483

I thought, "This is too easy."

836
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,251
Yohan, tag out!

837
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:28,586
Tag out already!

838
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:31,956
[Dex] Man, he won't let him!

839
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,791
No, Shin Donghyun!

840
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:34,959
He's blocking him!

841
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,428
[Dongeon] This is bad.

842
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,897
[contestant 6] Don't let him tag out!

843
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,033
[contestant 7] Yohan, tag out! This is it!

844
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,634
Tag out, tag out!

845
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,702
Come on, tag out!

846
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,472

I don't think he can get out of this.

00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,376
-He's blocking me!
-[contestant exclaiming]

849
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,080
[referee, in English] Okay, stop!

850
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,782
Stop! [in Korean] Okay, switch!

851
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,016
That was super close.

852
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,117
[exclaims]

853
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,519
[contestant 1] Okay, well done!

854
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,155
-Let's start right back up.
-[contestant 2] What is this, Tekken?

855
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,223
[in English] Box!

856
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,124
[in Korean] Dongeon, let's go!

857
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:08,392
[contestant 3] Be confident!

858
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:09,660
[Dongeon] I was confident.

859
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,063
[chattering]

860
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,265
[contestant 4] That's it!

861
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,566
-All right!
-[contestant 5] All right!

862
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,634
[contestant 3] Show them!

863
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,569
-There you go!
-[contestants exclaim]

864
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,538
He's not intimidated at all.

865
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,607
He's got real fighting spirit.

866
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,213
[contestant 1] Feels like straight-up
Tekken, right down to his footwork.

867
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:33,718
[grunting]

868
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,954
-All right!
-[cheering]

869
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,556
[contestant 2] He's gonna drop him.

870
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:42,159
-[contestant 3] All right!

871

00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:45,730
[laughing]

873
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,031
What the hell is going on?

874
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,633
-He's countering.
-[laughs]

875
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,201
[exclaims]

876
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,770
[Yohan] An elite boxer sure was different.

877
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:54,505
He wasn't backing down an inch,

878
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:57,108
while coming at me
completely aggressively.

879
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,043
-[contestant 1] Come on!
-[contestant 2] Let's go!

880
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,178
[contestants clamoring, laughing]

881
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,120
[contestant 3] Well, that's bold of him.

882
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,858
-[contestant 4] All right!
-[contestants exclaim]

883
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,662
-Slip, slip!
-[Jongkook] Slip, slip, slip!

884
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:18,729
-[Dex] Slip!
-Oh, he slipped.

885
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,231
-It's heating up.
-It's heating up!

886
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,866
-[contestants] All right!

887
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:23,167
KIM DONGEON X SHIN DONGHYUN

888
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,303
[cheering, laughing]

889
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,773
You're awesome, kid!

890
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,709
-What is this kid even? [laughs]
-[laughs]

891
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,577
This is fun.

892
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,413
High schoolers these days are scary.

893
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:36,947
Dongeon, you're awesome!

894
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,883
[contestant 1] He's not scared one bit.

895
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,653
[Jongkook]
Wow, this fight is insanely fun.

896
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,423
Both fighters have huge personalities.

897
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,490
[Lee] That's true.

898
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,259
-He's even doing things like this.
-Oh…

899
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,127
This is basically a firefly strategy.

900
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:51,862
He lures him in with this,

901
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:52,963
then fires right away.

902
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:54,398
"Look here!" and bam!

903
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,466
[Lee] That's right.

904
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,868
Draw him this way,
then pop him from the other side.

905
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,804
-It's his specialty.
-[Jongkook] Yeah, it's his thing.

906
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:03,240
[Daeyoung]
My breathing hasn't recovered yet.

907
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,812
-[Minuk] I don't think it's coming back.
-[Daeyoung laughs]

908
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:10,314
He's used like 95% of his gas tank.

909
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,883
What's your game plan
for the second round?

910
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,118
Who's fighting first?

911
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,586
Wanna go? Or I can go first.

912
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,921
-Yeah, you go.
-Okay.

913
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,457
I'll recover my breath out here.

914
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,862
I'll go first.

915
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,700
[Dongeon] I told Yohan to hold out

916
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,669
for one to two minutes,

917
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,372
promising him that I'd come in
for the last two minutes

918
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,407
to push the pace and score more points.

919
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,709
So I asked him to hang in there.

920
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:42,213

-All right, box!

928

929
00:39:58,763 --> 00:39:59,964
[contestant 5] Let's go, Yohan!

930
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,266
Keep it slow and steady.
Use the lead hand.

931
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,669
[contestants] All right!

932

-[contestant 6] All right!
-Slow down!

936
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,310
Don't rush! Keep it slow and steady!

[grunting, groaning]

938
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,648
[contestant 7]
Keep those hooks and counters coming!

939
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,518
[contestant 6] There you go!

940
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,719
Hey!

941
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,587
[contestant 8] Just do your thing, man!

942
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:28,092
[Shin Donghyun]
I seriously needed to drop him.

943
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:33,397
I was like, "If I can't drop him,
it'll scratch my pride big time."

-[cheering]

945
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,207
Yes, push forward!

946
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,609
So he can't tag out!

947
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,512
Pressure him! Let's lock him in!

948
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:51,549
[Dex] He's got him cornered,
so he can't go that way.

949
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,684
He keeps pushing him back.

950
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:56,987
[grunting, groaning continues]

951
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,191

Gosh, he's getting too many hits.

Can he make it through two minutes?

955
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,535
[contestant 2] No, no, no, he can't.

956
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,571
-He needs to tag out.
-[contestant 3] Tag out! Tag out!

00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,704
He sure knows how to play.

975
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:51,909

Tag out! You need to tag out now!

984
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:18,035
-You good?
-Yeah.

985
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,637
-[Jaehyuk] What?
-[Seungjun] Huh?

986
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,438

00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,174

00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:25,476
-You good?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,710
-Thanks.
-No problem.

990
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,147
-What? Why didn't he put his fist out?
-[laughs]

991
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,549
Why'd he pretend not to see it?

992
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:33,250
-All right!
-Nice, let's go!

993
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,853
[contestant 1] He still
hasn't caught his breath. [laughs]

994
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:40,024
He wanted out,
so I couldn't just ignore him.

995
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:43,928
So I figured I'd just finish strong.

996
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,530
Honestly, I was thinking,

997
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:48,999
"All boxing-related titles aside,
I can't possibly

998
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,702
lose to a high schooler.

999
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,238
I've got 20 years on this kid.

1000
00:42:54,305 --> 00:42:57,408
No way I'm taking shots
from a teen." [chuckles]

-[in English] Box!

1004
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:09,887
[Dex, in Korean] Look at him charge in
with his guard up!

1005
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,122
There's just no way around that!

1006
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:13,424
[Jongkook] Wow, look at that.

1007
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,059
-That's insane.
-[contestant 1] What's happening?

1008
00:43:15,125 --> 00:43:16,126
[contestant 2] Nice move!

1009
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,761
[contestant 3]
Just steamroll him, Youngho!

1010
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,533
[Jongkook] He looks rattled.

1011
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,968
He's panicking.

1012
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,404
[Dongeon] Because of the size
and strength difference,

1013
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:32,876
I was trying to figure out how to work
the fight the whole time I was in there.

1014
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,546
If I went up too close,
I'd get overpowered,

1015
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,449
so I tried to keep a distance
and pick him off clean.

1016
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,552
-[clamoring]
-[contestant 1] Stay calm! That's it!

1017
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,786
That's right!

1018
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,456
[contestant 2] All right!

1019
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:49,460
[Lee] Dongeon's managing
his distance fairly well.

1020
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,163
[Youngho] He was quick on his feet.

1021
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,700
I kept going though, thinking
one would land eventually. [chuckles]

1022
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,572
[contestant 3]
Damn, those shots are lethal.

1023
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,844
[Dex] Dongeon, pour it all out!

1024
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:08,612
You have to give it all!

1025
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,515
I'm like his mom now.
This is driving me nuts.

1026
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,187
[contestant 4] He's like a boulder.

1027
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,224
-He's not taking any damage at all.
-[grunting, groaning]

1028
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,060
-Okay, ten seconds, Dongeon!
-[contestants cheering]

1029
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,596
KIM DONGEON X PARK YOUNGHO

1030
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,398
-[Lee] He's panicking right now.
-[grunts]

1031
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:29,299
[Jongkook]
He's taking everything like nothing.

1032
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,268
-Stop!
-[bell rings]

1033
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,336
[contestant exclaims]

1034
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,972
-[contestant 5] Nice going!
-He's got guts, all right.

1035
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,775
[Dex] Damn, that power…

1036
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,878
Those two have
a 26-kilogram weight difference.

1037
00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:41,979
[chuckling] Damn.

1038
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:44,682
Park Youngho just needs to
charge forward like this.

1039
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,917
Then everything just bounces off him.

1040
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:49,053
He's double his size and age.

1041
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,454
-[Dex] Yeah, you're right.
-Yeah.

1042
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,390
[contestant laughs]

1043
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,229
I knew Kim Dongeon
wouldn't land on me easily,

1044
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,365
but I wasn't going to land
on him easily either.

1045
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,205
So, given the weight difference
between the two,

1046
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:13,744
the strategy was to have Youngho
stay on Dongeon and shut him out.

1047
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:18,515
Here's the game plan.

1048
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,318
Just hold out as much as you can.

1049
00:45:21,785 --> 00:45:22,920
I'll score the points.

1050
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:24,021
Got it.

1051
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,926
We can do this. We can do this.

1052
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,662
[narrator] <i>Fighters, step in.</i>

1053
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,198
Who will enter first?

1054
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,767
Just stall him and keep countering.

1055
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,838
[contestant 1] Yohan's going first again.

1056
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:42,673
Let's do this.

1057
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:44,942
Go give him a bus ride. [laughs]

1058
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:46,777
"Give him a bus ride."

1059
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:48,378
[Dex] It's Shin Donghyun from blue!

1060
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:51,081
BLUE CORNER R3 SHIN DONGHYUN

1061
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,117
[bell rings]

1062
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,119
KO YOHAN X SHIN DONGHYUN

1063
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:56,220
-Box!

1064
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:58,188
-[contestant 1] Let's go!
-[contestant 2] Last round!

1065
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,062
Let's get him on that ambulance!

1066
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,264
Remember, one-two hook!

1067
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,899
One-two hook!

1068
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,870
[contestant 3] He swung the other way!

1069
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,038
He did it the other way round.

1070
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:21,311
Shin Donghyun definitely
has that fighter instinct.

1071
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:22,679
[contestants] All right!

1072
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,014
[contestant 4] Match him!

1073
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,183
-[grunting, groaning]
-[contestants shouting]

1074
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:27,851
[contestant 4] Yes, that's it!

1075
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,853
-Nice!
-Drop him!

1076
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,921
Knock him down!

1077
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,490
[shouting continues]

1078
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:37,194
Let's go, Ko Yohan!

1079
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,262
Stay confident!

1080
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:39,963
Yohan, go! Strike first!

1081
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,732
Yohan, just strike first!

1082
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,469
[contestant 5] Jeez, he can't get in.

1083
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,438
His opponent's looking way too relaxed.

1084
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:50,974
[Shin Donghyun sighs]

1085
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,142
Chicken much?

1086
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,517

1088
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,389
Let's go, bus driver!

1089
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,658
I thought he'd drop right away,

1090
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,194
but he held out way better
than I expected.

1091
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,395
I'll give him that.

1092
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:16,867
[contestant 1] Wait, what's he up to?

1093
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,335
[contestant 2] Is he loading up or what?

1094
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:20,037
Watch out for the back hand.

1095
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,105
[Jongkook] He's gonna throw that left.

1096
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,707
-[contestant 3] Okay, go!
-[contestant 4] Strike!

1097
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,510
[contestant 5] He needs to tag out.

1098
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,779
-[contestant 6] Yohan, tag out!
-[contestant 7] Switch, switch!

1099
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:34,818
KO YOHAN X SHIN DONGHYUN

1100
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:36,186
He might get KO'd at this rate.

1101
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,821
Show him what you've got!

1102
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,423
Ready to get in that ambulance?

1103
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:40,791
[contestant laughs]

1104
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,292
[Dongeon] Last one! Keep going!

1105
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,394
[contestant 8] No, he has to switch.

1106
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:46,096
[referee, in English] Okay, stop!

1107
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:47,431
RED CORNER SWITCH: KIM DONGEON

1108
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:50,133
[Hyunjun, in Korean]
You're losing right now!

1109
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,535
You're losing! Go all out!

[chattering]

1111
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,607
[Dongeon]
I might have to finish this with a KO.

1112
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:58,675
[referee] All right, box!

1113

[contestant whoops]

1123
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,163
[Shin Donghyun]
I'd planned for Park Youngho

1124
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,666
to face Kim Dongeon from the start.

1125
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,204
-[Dex] Whoa, he's here.
-[Jongkook] He's back, all right.

1126
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:30,841
Do what you did earlier.

1127
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:32,509
Brace yourself.

1128
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,645
[contestant 1] He's being super strategic.

1129
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:37,247
[Youngho] It doesn't hurt.

1130
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:38,582
Just hit me all you want.

1131
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:44,254
[Dongeon] One of us is going down today,
so let's fight.

1132
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,591
[in English] Box!

1133

KIM DONGEON X PARK YOUNGHO

1134
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,560
[contestant 2, in Korean]
Go full throttle!

1135
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,096
[Jongkook] It's any minute now.

1136
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,365
[contestant 3] Okay, it's coming.

1137
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:57,234
He's charging in!

1138
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,336
He's charging in!

1139
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:01,571
[contestant 4] Push him back with force!

1140
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:02,940
[Jongkook] Wow, look at him go!

[grunting]

1143
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:09,413
[Jongkook] Wait,
he's not running. He should, though.

1144
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:10,480
[Lee] Circle out of there.

1145
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:12,015
[Jongkook] That's it.

1146
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:14,785
[contestant 5]
Dongeon, land one clean shot,

1147
00:49:14,851 --> 00:49:16,186
-then clinch or fall back.
-[exclaims]

1148
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:19,089
[contestant 6] Both hands on the stomach!

1149
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,391
His stomach is open!

1151
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:25,829
-[contestant 7] All right!
-[contestant 8] That's it!

1152
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:26,897
Yes, the stomach!

1153
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,533
That's it! There you go!

1154
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,337
-[Dex] All right!
-[Jongkook] That's it!

1155
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,039
[Lee] That's how you hit.
He's finally slowing down now.

1156
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:37,474
[Jongkook] That's right.

1157
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,977
-That did some damage.
-[clamoring]

1158
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:41,144
It's okay!

1159
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,380
Hold this out, and we win!

1160
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:44,514
Hold this out, and we win!

1161
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:45,582
[referee] Okay, careful now.

1162
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,685
[Youngho] All I really had was grit.

1163
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:52,122
It was my last shot,
so I went in ready to blow the tank.

1164

I mainly lift weights by profession.

I may seem a bit sloppy
compared to the experts here,

1193
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:11,334
but boxing is ultimately a fistfight.

1194
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:13,303
I just used my fists and brawled.

He's a bit on the older side, isn't he?

[contestant 2] He's 38, I think?

-Indeed.

I'm curious what kind of fight we'll see
with their feet in the water.

1290
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:06,069

he might not work as well in the water.

You can't judge true masters instantly.
You need to observe for a while.

1361
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:43,453
[Minuk] It's a hard setup

Plus, there's the water.

1364
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:51,361
So for the second round,
I decided to target Hong Sungmin's body.

1365
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,297

1367
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:58,868

[Sungmin]
Those body shots started landing.

1379

Minuk is seriously good, though.

1399
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:15,505
[Minuk]
I'd held back in rounds one and two

01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:09,959
Is it pride holding him up?

When Kim Minuk threw a right hook,

1457

I saw his right jaw open up,

01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:50,126
so I threw one there immediately.

01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:20,843
The winner is…

1515
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:24,547
[Minuk] I thought I deserved the win.

1516
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:26,782
[Sungmin] I was sure I had it.

1517
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,519
Hong Sungmin from the blue corner!

1518
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:31,687
[contestants cheering]

1519
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:34,223
Hong Sungmin from the blue corner!

01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,493
BLUE CORNER
HONG SUNGMIN SURVIVES

1521
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:44,667
I feel so small, man.

1522
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,937
Going last came with its own pressure.

1523
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:50,740
I'll take the weight
that comes with beating someone

1524
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:54,176
I respect as much as Minuk
and participate in <i>I Am Boxer</i>

1525
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:56,479
with even more hunger.

1526
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:04,387
It's been a while since I sparred
like it was an actual fight.

1527
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:06,022
I'm actually really relieved now.

1528
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:10,493
I'm glad I still got to show what I have.

1529
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:11,627
Moving forward,

1530
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:15,031
if boxing ever needs me,
just give me a call.

1531
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:17,500
I'll be there. Thank you.

1534
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,612
Here we go.

1535
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,148
What a big match.

1536
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:34,917
Are we seeing this now?

1537
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:36,318
-That's right.
-Goodness.

1538
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,687
-Oh, boy.
-[Jongkook] What do we do now?

1539
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:41,190
I'd totally forgotten.

1540
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,759
-Well, I'm tapping out.
-[Dex laughs] Same here.

1541
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,394

If you wish to challenge Kim Donghoe,

1550
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,921
please step forward.

1551
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:14,457
[Lee] Will anyone step forward?

1552

[Jongkook, Lee exclaim]

1553
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:20,529
I had an inkling.
He's actually stepping forward.

-We get to see this?
-Feels like the finals already.

1559
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,982
[Donghoe]
When Myung Hyunman challenged me,

1560
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:42,451
I thought, "Wow, this is perfect."

1561
01:08:43,018 --> 01:08:45,154
I'd always wanted to go up against him.

1562
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:47,223
I think we could make a hell of a fight.

1563
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,494
[Hyunman]
There's only one guy I'm wary of,

1564
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,661
Kim Donghoe.

1565
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:55,331
Our matchup came sooner than I expected.

1566
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:56,665
Fine, let's get this over with.

[announcer] <i>Blue corner, Myung Hyunman.</i>

All right!

Let's go!

1570
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:04,473
[contestant 1]
He's got real knockout power.

1571
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,076
[contestant 2]
This is terrifying. I'm scared already.

1572
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:10,846
[contestant 4]
They make the cage look small.

1573
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:13,883
[contestant 5] They're massive.
Looks like we're in for a ride. [laughs]

1574
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:15,551
[contestant 6]
There's a bit of a weight difference.

1575
01:09:15,618 --> 01:09:17,019
[contestant 7] Maybe 20 kilos?

1576
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,922
[gasps] I can't believe we're seeing this.

1577
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:21,657
The best versus the best.

1578
01:09:22,658 --> 01:09:27,129
It's an honor to have the chance
to face someone like Kim Donghoe.

1579
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:29,932
I'll do my best to show what I can do.

1580
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:35,571
I'll give it my all
and make this a great fight.

-[contestants applaud]

1582
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:39,942
Man, this one's impossible to predict.

[♪ tense music playing]

1585
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,183
[Jongkook]
Donghoe doesn't really fight close-range.

1586
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:48,250
Right.

1587
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:51,220
-I'm not sure how he'll do in there.
-Yeah.

1588
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:52,988
You need to dominate early.

1589
01:09:53,055 --> 01:09:54,456
Myung Hyunman's a beast.

1590
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:58,360
[contestant 1]
And he's insanely strong too.

1591
01:09:59,428 --> 01:10:00,996
He just drops all the heavyweights.

1592
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:03,999
[contestant 2] If that lands, it's over.

1593
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,671
-[Lee] Hyunman has the one-shot power.
-[Jongkook exclaims]

1594
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:12,508
In terms of pure boxing skill,
Kim Donghoe is on a higher level.

1595
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:14,009
But who knows?

1596
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,445
No one can know how this will go.

1597
01:10:17,947 --> 01:10:20,583
[Donghoe] The weight difference
didn't really matter to me.

1598
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:24,520
I was confident I could win.

1599
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:27,623
[Hyunman] I'm not easy work.

1600
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,726
I'm nothing like any opponent
he's faced before.

1601
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:31,860
Buckle up for this.

1602
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,496

[contestant 2] Don't get worked up. Go.

1613
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:55,084
[contestant 3] His feints are scary.

1614
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,952
[contestant 4]
Yeah, since he blitzes in right after.

1617
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,129
[contestant 5] That's scary.

1618
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,733
[Donghoe] When he hit my guard,
I thought, "Man, he's strong."

1619
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:12,067
"He's strong."

1620
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:13,135
That's what I felt.

1621
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:15,771
I thought, "One clean shot can finish me."

1622
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,940
"Let's keep the guard tight
and slip the shots."

1623
01:11:18,007 --> 01:11:19,375
[contestant 1] Nice! That landed!

1624
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:22,244
[contestant 2] Guard up!

1625
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:23,979
[contestant 1] One shot could drop him.

1626
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,282
[contestant 2]
They might break down the cage.

1627
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:27,950
[contestant 3] Nice cover!

1628
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,656
[contestant 4] It's crazy how clean
he throws when he's that loose.

1629
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,225
-[contestant 6] Relax!
-[contestant 7] The Ghost is here.

1630
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:41,363
Feels like a polar bear
and a brown bear fighting.

1631
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:43,265
[contestant 1] Get in there.

1632
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,736
[contestants exclaiming]

1633
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:52,308
[contestant 3] Whoa, that power…
He's basically flailing.

1634
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:56,979
[contestant 5] Move! Guard up!

1635
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,785
[Lee] He's trying to push him rough.

1636
01:12:02,851 --> 01:12:04,520
[Jongkook] I think you're right.

1637
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:06,021
He's going dirty boxing on him.

1638
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,091
So that's his game plan.

1639
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:12,261
[Hyunman]
Kim Donghoe's punches are really fast.

1640
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,862
In this cage setup,

1641
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:18,434
I figured I needed
to neutralize Kim Donghoe's main weapon.

1642
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,069
It's called "dirty boxing."

1643
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:21,704
You hit while staying in close.

1644
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:23,906
You grab the hands,

1645
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:25,507
and clinch pressure to shut him down.

1646
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:26,975
That's the technique I used.

1647
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:29,078
[in English] Break!

1648
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:30,646
Break.

1649
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:33,949
KIM DONGHOE X MYUNG HYUNMAN

1650
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:35,984
-[Lee, in Korean] He's clinching again.
-[Jongkook] Right.

1651
01:12:36,552 --> 01:12:38,120
[contestant]
Is that the strategy he came in with?

1652
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:42,291
If it comes down to straight punching,
Donghoe would clearly have the advantage.

1653
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,461
It could really go either way now.

1654
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:47,963
[contestant] Myung Hyunman came in
with a smart game plan.

1655
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,335
[Jongkook] He's ditching punches
and going full clinch.

1656
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:54,403
He's smothering him.

1657
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,038
That's what this feels like.

1658
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:58,841
That looks miserable to be stuck in.

1659
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:03,512
[Donghoe] I kept thinking,
"I need to get out of this clinch,"

1660
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,614
but he was just too strong.

1661
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:07,149
I couldn't shake him off.

1662
01:13:07,850 --> 01:13:09,852
Man, that looks suffocating.

1663
01:13:09,918 --> 01:13:11,620
He's completely shut him down.

1664
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:15,858
[Jongkook]
He's giving him a real hard time.

1665
01:13:16,558 --> 01:13:17,960
[contestant 1] Looks painfully stifling.

1666
01:13:21,363 --> 01:13:22,831
[contestants exclaiming]

1667
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:25,100
[contestant 4] He spun him back.

1668
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,269
[contestant 5]
This is Myung Hyunman's best bet.

1669
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:28,370
This is the way to win.

1670
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:29,805
-[referee, in English] Break!
-[bell rings]

1671
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,173
-Stop!
-[contestant 6, in Korean] All right!

1672
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:33,909
Man, I don't know.

1673
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:35,711
This could go either way.

1674
01:13:35,778 --> 01:13:37,913
This is the most viable strategy, though.

1675
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,783
The problem is,
Hyunman hasn't really landed anything.

1676
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,285
He barely threw actual strikes.

1677
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:46,555
If they trade in that clinch
and fight it out, it could go either way.

1678
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:49,691
[Donghoe]
I didn't do much in the first round.

1679

I knew I couldn't go on like this.

1680
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:54,363
So in the next round,
I knew I had to attack

1681

whenever I got him off me
and score some points.

I instantly knew he was no pushover.

Nice, he's blocking
and dodging everything.

"I've got to show something this round."

01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:02,824
There are around 10 kids,

1848
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,259
so 20 portions?

1849
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:07,863
-Okay.
-But first, you pick something out.

1850
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:11,399
-What are you getting?
-I've got a new favorite these days.

1851
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:15,704
The BBQ Rotisserie-Style Chicken,
and this one, marked as a popular item,

1852
01:21:15,770 --> 01:21:17,839
the "Anchang Beef."
It's real tasty, you know.

1853
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:20,108
All right, I love protein.

1854
01:21:20,175 --> 01:21:23,011
-Protein's crucial for aspiring athletes.
-Yes, of course.

1855
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:25,347
-[student 1] Thank you for the food.
-[student 2] Appreciate it.

1856
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:27,582
[Dex] Please enjoy.

1857
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:28,884
How does it taste?

1858
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,018
-Tasty.
-Delicious.

1859
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:31,519
Well, that's a relief.

1860
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:32,954
Help yourself.

1861
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:36,124
There's a lot of chicken breast in here.

1862
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:37,325
And it tastes good.

1863
01:21:38,927 --> 01:21:40,962
-[student 2] Gotta have that wow factor.
-[Lee] Exactly.

1864
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:42,530
[Dex] You're all good-looking.

1865
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,799
[Lee]
Boxers these days are really good-looking.

1866
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:47,469
Say they've been boxing for a long time,

1867
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:48,970
and they look like Dex.

1868
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:51,206
That probably means they're really good.

1869
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,341
Say they look like me.

1870
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:56,411
That means
they probably take a lot of shots.

1871
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:58,380
That means
they probably take a lot of shots.

1872
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:02,651
He kind of looks like Mike Tyson.

1873
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:04,719
-Let me get a closer look.
-[Dex] He looks like Tyson.

1874
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,155
-But he looks manly.
-Nice face.

1875
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:08,323
You have my kind of face.

1876
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:09,491
[student] I take a lot of hits.

1877
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:11,726
[Dex] Do you, really? [laughs]

1878
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:14,396
I don't know how much help this'll be,

1879
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:16,965
but we've brought some gloves
and punching bags over.

1880
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:20,035
-Use them, train hard, and keep it up.
-Keep up the good work.

1881
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:24,205
Your footwork's gonna improve in no time.

1882
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:28,944
Hey, Yonghyeok's girlfriend, Shin ***.

1883
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:31,212
-What's your name?
-Yonghyeok.

1884
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,448
Yonghyeok, you got this!

1885
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:34,950
-I got this!
-Great.

1886
01:22:35,016 --> 01:22:36,885
[students] Thank you.

1887
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,086
[students applauding]

1888
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:40,889
[Jongkook]
Today, Master Don here has invited

1889
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,324
a very special guest!

1890
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:45,360
[in English] My name is Dmitry Bivol.

1891
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:47,128
[Jongkook, in Korean]
Please welcome Dmitry Bivol!

1892
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,097
-[contestant 1] Whoa, that's really him!
-[contestants cheering]

1893
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,700
[Dex]
They're smelling his belt and everything.

1894
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:53,335
[contestant 2] How is this even real?

1895
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:55,270
I can't believe I'm seeing this right now.

1896
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:58,206
[Lee] You're about to witness
a fight more extreme

1897
01:22:58,273 --> 01:22:59,874
than anything you've ever seen.

1898
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:01,109
[in English] Box!

1899
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:03,144
-[contestant 1] They're both insane.
-[contestant 2] This is intense.

1900
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:04,713
He wants the KO finish.

1901
01:23:04,779 --> 01:23:06,581
[contestant 2]
Ten seconds left! Hang in there!

1902
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:07,882
[in English] Heavyweights.

1903
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:12,053
[Dex, in Korean]
I was hoping to see this matchup.

1904
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:15,623
[contestant 1] I was bleeding.

1905
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,492
[contestant 2] I knew I could still fight.

1906
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:18,693
[in English] He's a crazy guy.

1907
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,495
[contestant 1]
It didn't matter if I was bleeding.

1908
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:22,330
The survivor of this match is…

1909
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:23,431
no one.

1910
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:24,933
-[contestant 1 groans]
-[contestant 2] Everyone's eliminated?

1911
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,136
[contestant 1] It was a place
beyond anything we could've imagined.

1912
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:29,637
[contestant 2] So it's not over yet.

1913
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:31,272
[♪ tense music playing]

1914
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:33,842
[contestant 3] We fought to the death,
and now we're doing it again?

1915
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:36,044
[contestant 4]
Finally, the moment has come.

1916
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:40,148
[♪ upbeat music playing]
