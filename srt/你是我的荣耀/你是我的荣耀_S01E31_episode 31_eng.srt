1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,900


2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,400
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,200
♫  My heart is like the dust and 
couldn’t bear to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,800
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,600
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,400
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,800
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,500
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:08,300
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:16,000
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:29,600
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
   

14
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,420
   

16
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,800
I won't divorce my husband.

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,600
We just made a mistake. We were drunk.

18
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,900
Can't you just forget it?

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
If you expose this, how will it be beneficial to you?

20
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,200
Do you want our reputations ruined?

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,200
You're crazy!

22
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
Cut.

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
Good take.

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,300
- Let's eat. 
 - Okay, time to eat.

25
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,000
- Thank you, Director. 
 - Thank you, Director.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,500
- Let's shoot this scene after eating. 
 - Okay.

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,600
- Jingjing, thank you. 
 - It's fine.

28
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,800
Thank you for today, Director.

29
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,800
So do you feel in character for this role?

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
It's all right.

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
The male lead just isn't as handsome as my husband.

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,800
I don't feel quite immersed in it.

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
Immersed?

34
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
For a drama about adultery, do you want to be immersed in it?

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,200
Do you dare to tell your husband that?

36
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,600
No.

37
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,600
He's so funny.

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,300
After confirming this film, he didn't go to the base yet, right?

39
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,000
So he made time to read the entire script.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Did Teacher Yu provide any comments?

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,700
He provided a lot.

42
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,800
He said, "Jingjing. Don't you have experiential, methodist, and expressionist acting styles?"

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,900
"Which one do you belong to?"

44
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,500
He's quite professional.

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,200
Hey, Teacher Yu has been on a business trip for many months already, hasn't he?

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,200
It's quite a long time.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's really hard to be a family of aerospace workers.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,200
It's all right.

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,900
He's in the base so I can film in peace.

50
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,000
Filming will wrap up soon.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,600
If Teacher Yu doesn't return from the base yet,

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,400
do you want to accept another film?

53
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
I read a nice script.

54
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,100
Take a look.

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,200
Let me ask you a question.

56
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,900
How old am I?

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,100
I can really answer that?

58
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,400
Tell me.

59
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
- Thirty... 
 - All right, stop.

60
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,600
Just say 30s. The details aren't important.

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
This is my question.

62
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,400
I am in my 30s. I've been married for five years.

63
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Why are you letting me read a script about a college girl?

64
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,700
No. That's just the first few episodes.

65
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,000
You'll be working afterwards.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,700
Then she's just in her 20s.

67
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,000
And I've already filmed this kind of drama about career life.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,100
It's not challenging.

69
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,200
Can't you accept more challenging roles?

70
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,500
For example, scientific researcher and the like.

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,800
Do you know yourself?

72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,000
You don't look like a scientific researcher at all.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,900
Are you kidding me?

74
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,500
- My husband... 
 - Stop.

75
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,000
I know that your husband is the youngest chief engineer of the aerospace system.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
You don't need to keep finding opportunities to brag about that.

77
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,800
But that has nothing to do with you

78
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,400
looking like a scientific researcher at all.

79
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,800
It's useless even if you remain silent.

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you think any investor will ask you to portray that role?

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,200
Even if someone asks you to do that,

82
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,300
that would also be because of your popularity.

83
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,000
The script surely wouldn't be reliable.

84
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,700
We've been married for so long.

85
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Why wasn't I influenced by Teacher Yu's scientific researcher aura at all?

86
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Because we're always apart from each other.

87
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,400
This won't do. What if I don't accept any films in the next half of the year?

88
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,800
You said this yourself.

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,400
Your family won't affect your career.

90
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,000
You'll accept two film-shooting projects a year. Am I right?

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,800
Then let's check the script.

92
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Don't accept it if it doesn't suit me.

93
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,100
Forget about this one.

94
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,000
Okay. I'll check out others for you.

95
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,600
In the next half of the year, if you're not planning on accepting any films,

96
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,800
do you and Teacher Yu consider having a baby?

97
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,800
We're considering it. He wants a daughter.

98
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,400
Really?

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,600
Hello.

100
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,600
 I was just talking about you with Sister Ling. 

101
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,800
What were you saying about me?

102
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,600
She said you want a daughter.

103
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,500
I told her that when reading the script, you asked me

104
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,600
why the supporting male lead is set to be 25 years old.

105
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,400
Wait.

106
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,100
Teacher Yu, I'm sorry.

107
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,800
When I accept films for her in the future, I'll take note of that.

108
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't worry.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I was just kidding around with Jingjing.

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,800
 Teacher Yu, don't worry. 

111
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,600
The supporting male lead isn't as handsome as you.

112
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,600
But he's only 25.

113
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,800
Qiao Jingjing.

114
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,400
Okay, wait.

115
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,100
I was kidding.

116
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,400
Have you eaten?

117
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,600
Yes.

118
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,100
By the way, at the canteen earlier, something funny happened.

119
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,400
   
I heard two girls in front of me in the line from another office talking about me.

120
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,800
You have fans now?

121
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,100
Are you boasting in front of me?

122
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,200
 Why would I boast to you about having fans? 

123
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,800
I heard a girl say that she's disillusioned about me.

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,000
What did you do to make her disillusioned?

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
 This was what she said. 

126
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,600
 "Outside the conference room, I ran into Mr. Yu." 

127
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,600
 "I didn't expect that someone so academic" 

128
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,800
 "would have a female celebrity as his phone's home screen photo." 

129
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,700
Good thing she doesn't interact much with me.

130
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,000
Otherwise, she'll notice

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
that I change this female celebrity's photo once a week.

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,200
 I think these two girls were very serious in their studies before. 

133
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
 They don't pay attention to celebrity gossip at all. 

134
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,700
What happened later? Did you explain it to them?

135
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,200
 I didn't want to bother. 

136
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,400
 However, I thought that my image couldn't be damaged. 

137
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,800
After eating, I happened to run into them by the door.

138
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,700
So I told them,

139
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,900
"My phone's home screen photo is my wife."

140
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,400
Mr. Yu, why are you so childish?

141
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,200
But I don't think they believed me.

142
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,100
So do you want to help me prove it?

143
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,300
How do you want me to prove it? Make a post on Weibo?

144
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,000
That's not necessary.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,600
Perhaps you can visit me at work and watch the rocket launch.

146
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,000
Isn't filming wrapping up soon?

147
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,800
I...

148
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,000
Can I really go there?

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,400
In the past few months,

150
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,300
the base has been holding aerospace worker family visitation activities.

151
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,000
I applied every time.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,600
For the fifth time, I finally got picked.

153
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,000
Can I go?

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,300
Can I visit you at the launch center?

155
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:50,900
Mrs. Yu. Welcome to Haijiao Launch Center to visit the 38-year-old me.

156
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:11,900
   

157
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,300
   
 I'm in Hainan already. I just got off the plane. 

158
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,000
   

159
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 I'm in Hainan already. I'm sorry. I arrived two days late because of work. 

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,400
 It's not late. 

161
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,600
 My niece even called me this morning to ask if I got your autograph yet. 

162
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
 But you missed the rocket transport yesterday. Too bad. 

163
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,300
 Hi, Ms. Qiao. I'm Xiao Zhang who's in charge of the family visitation activity this time. 

164
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,600
 You really don't need us to pick you up at the airport? 

165
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
 There's no need. 

166
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,800
 Just please pick me up at the gate of the base. 

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,200
Will Teacher Yu come out to pick you up at the gate of the base later?

168
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,400
Forget it.

169
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,800
He hasn't even replied to my messages yet.

170
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,900
I think his phone is not with him again.

171
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,400
Teacher Yu must be very busy and nervous now.

172
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,300
After all, the entire nation is following this.

173
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,799
By the way, a while ago, a marketing account mentioned

174
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,800
that the chief engineer of God Searcher is your husband.

175
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,300
Why didn't I know that?

176
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,200
It was suppressed before it went viral.

177
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,400
You have no idea how supportive your fans are.

178
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,700
They said that you two have always kept it low-key.

179
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,700
They hope that there won't be gossip just to increase exposure at such a crucial time.

180
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,200
Non-fans also scolded them. Later on, this account deleted the post.

181
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,600
They're very supportive indeed.

182
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Did Teacher Yu reply to you?

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,300
 It's good that you arrived two days late. 

184
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,600
 It's boring here. It's like we're just here to help with laundry. 

185
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,800
No.

186
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,400
A family member in the chat group is the wife of Xiao Hu, Yu Tu's colleague.

187
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,800
I met her before.

188
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,600
She is speaking a bit strangely.

189
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,100
Could it be because her husband is too busy to spend time with her?

190
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,200
That's why she's mad?

191
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,000
I think you must be prepared as well.

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,300
I don't think Teacher Yu has time to spend with you either.

193
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,000
I came to watch the launch. I'm just visiting Mr. Yu at the same time.

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,500
Is he nicer to look at than the rocket?

195
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,000
Teacher Yu came out to pick you up.

196
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,000
Why are you here? Aren't you busy today?

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,200
I happened to have some time.

198
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,000
Xiao Zhu, thank you.

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I am Jingjing's road manager now.

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
It's part of my job.

201
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
And after a few days, I'll be going to Sanya.

202
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
It's on the way.

203
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,500
Jingjing will be reimbursing me. I must bring her here.

204
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,200
You speak as if I didn't reimburse you before.

205
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,400
Long live my boss!

206
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
May you two always be together.

207
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,700
Xiao Zhu, you're becoming more and more lively.

208
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll go ahead then.

209
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,200
Bye, go inside.

210
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Here.

211
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,600
Take care.

212
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,500
Bye.

213
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,800
Ms. Qiao. I'm Xiao Zhang from the group chat.

214
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,300
I'm in charge of the family visitation activities.

215
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,400
Hello.

216
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,200
I need to check your national ID.

217
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,100
And this is the registration record of visitors.

218
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll do it.

219
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,700
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

220
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,400
Since Mr. Yu came to pick you up, I'll go ahead later.

221
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,600
Thank you for taking the trouble.

222
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,500
Ms. Qiao. Actually, I've watched your dramas since I was a child.

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,700
Thank you.

224
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
Thank you for your support since you were little.

225
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
No worry.

226
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Okay. I'll bring her to the hotel at the base.

227
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,500
Okay.

228
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,600
Xiao Zhang is so silly.

229
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
How can he find a girlfriend in the future?

230
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,600
But someone so annoying like you could even find one.

231
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,400
I don't think it would be hard for him.

232
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,700
Girlfriend?

233
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,500
Are you looking down on me?

234
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,600
I have a wife already.

235
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,700
You're so outstanding.

236
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,600
Why did you get such a car to pick me up?

237
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,000
I just borrowed what I could.

238
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
Come on.

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Get in the car.

240
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,400
Okay.

241
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
This is for you to block the sun.

242
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,800
You must be the guy with the strongest learning ability in this world.

243
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,200
I have no choice.

244
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Drive, my tour guide.

245
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,800
You're such a bad tour guide.

246
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,400
You're not introducing the place to me.

247
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,800
The Haijiao Launch Center is one of the four major launch centers in our country.

248
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,400
It's also the only launch center with a low latitude.

249
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
I've already read that online.

250
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,600
The canteen's food is very delicious.

251
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,400
What else?

252
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,800
This is where I'll send God Searcher to space.

253
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,600
From now on, this will be my favorite launch center.

254
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,000
 Is that the service structure up ahead? 

255
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,700
 That's Long March 5's service structure. 

256
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,200
 What are those two very high white structures over there? 

257
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,100
 One is the rocket assembly test plant. 

258
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,000
 The shorter one is for satellite assembly. 

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Do you work in the satellite assembly plant? 

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes, until the satellite is transported to the rocket assembly.

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,500
I know. You keep testing it.

262
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,500
You transport the rocket assembly to the rocket fairing. Am I right?

263
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,200
You must be the female actress

264
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
with the most knowledge of aerospace in this world.

265
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,400
Thank you for the compliment. My husband taught me.

266
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,600
Do you have security cameras here?

267
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Why did you suddenly stop the car?

268
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,000
What are you doing?

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,800
You asked if there are security cameras.

270
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,600
Isn't this what you meant?

271
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,700
Maybe a little bit.

272
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,200
Why did you understand so quickly?

273
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,800
So do you have security cameras or not?

274
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,000
Of course, we do. This is a confidential unit.

275
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,700
It's a confidential unit anyway.

276
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,600
This is the room key.

277
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,400
This hotel is mainly for staff.

278
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,800
There are limited rooms with king-sized beds. That was why I gave it to my colleague.

279
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,100
Wait here and rest for a while.

280
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,400
I have to attend a meeting.

281
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,800
At night, I'll move the bed.

282
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,000
For what?

283
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,600
Won't that be too obvious?

284
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,000
There's a housekeeping service here, right?

285
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,800
If they come in tomorrow morning and see two beds together, that would be awkward.

286
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,600
Won't it be more awkward if the beds aren't together?

287
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,600
It would be awkward for you. It's all right for me.

288
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,800
Let's move it now then. There's still time.

289
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,000
Don't. Don't move it.

290
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm so slim.

291
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,800
One bed is enough.

292
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,900
Come.

293
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,400
I think this will do.

294
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,300
Stand up. Professor Zhao is inviting me to a gathering.

295
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,400
Where?

296
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,800
She messaged me the address.

297
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
   

298
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,600
Xiao Yu, you even personally brought her here.

299
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,800
Come. Let me introduce you to everyone.

300
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,200
This is Mr. Yu, Unit 158's Chief Engineer.

301
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,700
Hi, Mr. Yu.

302
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,600
I don't need to introduce her, right?

303
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,400
She just arrived today. They don't know her.

304
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,300
Jingjing, this is Professor Zhao,

305
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,200
the wife of our model's chief scientist, Director Xiao.

306
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,900
Hi, Professor Zhao.

307
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,300
We've messaged each other on WeChat.

308
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,100
I'll attend my meeting then. Professor, I'll leave her to you.

309
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,600
Don't worry.

310
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,000
Go.

311
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,800
- Bye. 
 - Bye.

312
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,000
Come.

313
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,600
Come, have a seat.

314
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,400
We are all here now.

315
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Do you want to introduce yourselves?

316
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,500
I'll go first.

317
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,700
Mr. Yu.

318
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,000
What time is it already? Why are you still eating bread here?

319
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Leave the probe to us. We're not that busy anymore.

320
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,700
I picked up my wife. I haven't eaten yet.

321
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,000
The big-shot celebrity is here.

322
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,600
My wife loves watching your wife's dramas.

323
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,800
Is that so?

324
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,000
- Come on. 
 - Okay, let's go.

325
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,000
 Most of the work at the launch area is already done. 

326
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,300
 Let's have a special coordination meeting today. 

327
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,700
Regarding transporting the probe and the base, what else do we need to coordinate?

328
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,000
Mr. Yu, you go first.

329
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,400
Work at the launch area is going very smoothly this time.

330
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,800
However, there's something that I want to discuss more with transport.

331
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
This time, our mission is deep space exploration.

332
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,400
The power supply's lifespan is very crucial.

333
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,200
Now, power is supplied through the transport's umbilical cable.

334
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,600
Fifteen minutes before the launch,

335
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
we'll disconnect the cable and switch to internal power.

336
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,400
Should we verify the launch procedure one more time?

337
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,800
Let's have another meeting tomorrow specifically for the launch procedure.

338
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,600
We'll reconfirm the steps when switching to internal power.

339
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,400
Regarding the probe's power supply,

340
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,700
Mr. Yu is really obsessed with the details.

341
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,400
Don't we want to go farther?

342
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,800
On land, let's just freeload the landlord's surplus.

343
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
All right. Base personnel will join that meeting too.

344
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Let's tabularize the pre-launch procedures

345
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,400
and get three parties' confirmation and signatures to ensure that nothing is missed.

346
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,800
Our plan is to launch at 7:10 p.m. on the 27th.

347
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,600
Meteorological Bureau, please report to us the weather conditions during that period.

348
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,800
Based on the analysis of the Meteorological Bureau's headquarters,

349
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,600
on the 27th, during the launch window between 7:10 pm to 7:30 pm,

350
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,000
 Visibility will be greater than 20km. 

351
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,400
 The ground temperature will be 29 degrees Celsius. 

352
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,800
 The humidity will be 39 percent. 

353
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,700
 Wind speed will be 2 meters per second. 

354
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,400
 Total cloud cover will be less than 20 percent. 

355
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
 Within the 40km range of the launch area, 

356
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,200
 ten hours before the launch and one hour after the launch, 

357
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
there won't be any thunderstorms or precipitation.

358
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,400
The weather conditions are good.

359
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
They satisfy the launch conditions.

360
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,200
How many meetings have you had? It's so late already.

361
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,500
There weren't that many meetings, but they lasted quite long.

362
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,900
It's reversed.

363
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,600
I'll do it myself. Don't become a hindrance instead.

364
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,300
Come on.

365
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,200
What did you do in the afternoon?

366
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,800
Did you just stay in the Long March Station?

367
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,600
They showed me around the base;

368
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,800
where to eat,

369
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
where to launder the clothes, etc.

370
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,400
Look at you. You didn't do your job.

371
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,700
At this phase, the workload on the probe's side is actually a lot less already.

372
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,700
However, there are still many review works and meetings.

373
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,100
To be honest, I still don't feel at ease right now.

374
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,100
I'm afraid of not handling an aspect well.

375
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,100
I keep tracking each segment.

376
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,500
Jingjing, I can't spend much time with you.

377
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,200
I was kidding.

378
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't need you to spend time with me.

379
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,700
I've been exhausted from filming every day.

380
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm planning to catch up on my sleep in the next few days.

381
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,600
Then I'll travel around with Professor Zhao and the others.

382
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,100
They're bored here anyway.

383
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,400
And I haven't traveled to Hainan for many years already.

384
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,000
Look at you.

385
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Once you arrived, you become the tour group's leader.

386
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,200
Of course.

387
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,600
My husband is the chief engineer. I must do my part.

388
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,900
Xiao Qiao, are you taking us out?

389
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,600
Yes. It's so boring to stay in the base.

390
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,700
Hainan is so beautiful. We must walk around.

391
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,500
And perhaps the Wenchang chicken outside

392
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,000
might taste different from the ones in the canteen.

393
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,300
- Right. 
 - Good idea.

394
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,800
During this period of time, my wife is so busy that I don't see her at all.

395
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,700
There's really nothing for us to do at the base.

396
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,000
My husband is the same. He's as busy as a bee.

397
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,200
Why didn't it occur to us to go outside before?

398
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,000
- Right. 
 - Yes.

399
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,200
If you don't have any objections, let's have fun starting today.

400
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,600
Sure.

401
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,400
I don't think we can do it today. We need to contact rides and stuff.

402
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,800
Actually, I've already contacted the tour guide and travel agency.

403
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
I was just waiting for you guys to say yes.

404
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,200
Xiao Qiao, you're making it so formal. You even got a tour guide.

405
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
- Am I right? 
 - Of course.

406
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,600
I'll be the tour group's leader then.

407
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,000
Thank you for taking the trouble.

408
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,400
It's no trouble. I want to have fun, too.

409
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,100
Besides, my husband doesn't have time for me either.

410
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,800
Later on, we must split the costs.

411
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,800
- Right. 
 - Yes.

412
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,200
There's not much cost. Don't worry about that.

413
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,000
This travel agency works with us.

414
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,800
I can just make a post on Weibo.

415
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
That's so nice.

416
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,000
- Let's take more photos. 
 - Yes.

417
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,600
Right. You can take photos as mementos.

418
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,200
Yes.

419
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,300
Go ahead. I'm not joining.

420
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,100
- Why? 
 - What's the matter?

421
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,200
Come on.

422
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I already gave the agency our headcount.

423
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,800
It will be embarrassing for me if one of you is missing.

424
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,600
Just think that you're accompanying me to go have fun.

425
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,000
- Let's go. 
 - Come on.

426
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
- Go. 
 - Let's go together.

427
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,800
- Come on. 
 - Xiao Li.

428
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,400
Let's go.

429
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,600
- This is great. 
 - Let's have fun then.

430
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Come on.

431
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,700
This is great!

432
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,600
Our main work is to check the probe's power-on self test.

433
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,300
Nothing is too trivial.

434
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,800
Let's go through every detail.

435
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,200
- Cheese. 
 - Cheese.

436
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,000
- Okay, come on. 
 - I'll take a photo for you.

437
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,400
Make us look nicer.

438
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,400
- Cheese. 
 - Cheese.

439
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,700
Xiao Yu, come here.

440
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,200
Sit here.

441
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,600
- We're all eating noodles? 
 - What are you eating? Noodles?

442
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,100
Director Zhang, are you here for noodles again?

443
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,200
This chef's noodles are amazing.

444
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,100
If I don't eat them for three days, I crave them.

445
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,300
Every time I come to the base, I always gain a few pounds.

446
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,300
Mr. Yu, you eat so voraciously.

447
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,100
Doesn't your wife mind?

448
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,400
Who says I eat voraciously?

449
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,600
I have a meeting later. I have to eat faster.

450
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,500
My wife doesn't mind at all. She doesn't eat much.

451
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,600
When I eat fast, it makes her crave food less.

452
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,600
Mr. Yu's marriage is a legend in the aerospace system.

453
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,200
He married a big shot celebrity.

454
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,600
Mr. Yu, how did you pursue her back then?

455
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,600
She was my senior high classmate.

456
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
We met again ten years after graduation.

457
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,600
We were both single, so we just made do with each other.

458
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,000
You all understood that, right?

459
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,200
Those doing system design must be good at bluffing.

460
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,300
That's a false accusation.

461
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,800
That was the standard answer my wife told my colleagues a few years ago.

462
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,600
I just memorized it.

463
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,000
Xiao Yu's wife is quite nice.

464
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,300
She's just a bit mischievous.

465
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,600
Since she arrived,

466
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,200
my wife, Professor Zhao, never complains about being bored anymore.

467
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,200
She's always out there having fun.

468
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,700
But when she returns at night,

469
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,700
she'd want me to look at the photos with her.

470
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,400
Speaking of photos,

471
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,600
I have a minor comment.

472
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Should we inform Xiao Qiao?

473
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,100
For example, in the same place,

474
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,300
why must she take ten consecutive photos of my wife?

475
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,800
I... I can't see clearly.

476
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
I really can't tell which one looks better.

477
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,200
Am I right? I mean, ten photos.

478
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,400
Speaking of which, Mr. Yu, I have a minor comment too.

479
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,100
Whenever I go home before,

480
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,800
my wife cooks soup for me using the rice cooker.

481
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,500
Once your wife arrived, she only brought late-night snacks from outside.

482
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,200
Now, she doesn't even bring that anymore.

483
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,000
She said that Mr. Yu's wife is so thin.

484
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,200
She's frustrated. She wants to go on a diet.

485
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,000
In the future, she won't make late-night snacks anymore.

486
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,000
Your wife even made late-night snacks for you everyday?

487
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,600
Of course.

488
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,000
Before your wife came, the last one was braised pork knuckles.

489
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
That's so nice, Mr. Zhang.

490
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,300
After my wife and I got together, I never eat late-night snacks anymore.

491
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,500
Then I'm luckier than you.

492
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,400
You can't say that.

493
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,800
My wife has a lot of good points.

494
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,000
She's very likable.

495
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,100
Listen to him.

496
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:24,300
However, I'll inform her immediately about your comments.

497
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,800
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

498
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,400
This one's nice.

499
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,200
This one looks really delicious.

500
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,000
This is a local specialty. Wenchang chicken. Try it.

501
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
- Come on. 
 - It's quite good.

502
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,200
 Where are you? 

503
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,300
   

504
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,200
   

505
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,900
- This is quite fun. 
 - The shrimp is nice.

506
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,000
- Hello. 
  - Why did you go so far away? 

507
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,900
There's something that I must seriously discuss with you.

508
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,200
My colleague is complaining that you lured his family away.

509
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,700
Is that true?

510
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,400
No way. Are you sure that he wasn't complimenting me?

511
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,300
It wasn't a compliment. It was a complaint.

512
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,000
 That's impossible. Who is that insensible person? 

513
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Only if we're having fun can you work without any worries. Am I right?

514
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,300
Otherwise, you'll surely worry that you have no time to spend with us. You'd feel so stressed.

515
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,700
I'm working so hard to take everyone out to have fun,

516
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,200
and someone's complaining?

517
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,000
This won't do. Let's put each other on speaker.

518
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,400
She has something to tell you.

519
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,800
Here.

520
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,600
 My friends in the tour group. 

521
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,400
 A mysterious family member is complaining that I've lured you away. 

522
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,400
 Come on. Let's hear whose family that person is from. 

523
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,800
 That's not true. 

524
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,600
 Jingjing is taking such good care of us. 

525
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,400
 You're all busy with work, and we have nothing to do. 

526
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,000
Good thing Jingjing is bringing us around.

527
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,200
 - Yes. 
 - That's right. 

528
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,400
 We've been so happy in the past couple of days, am I right? 

529
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,600
Otherwise, we'd just watch television at the hotel daily.

530
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,800
- Right. 
 - I'm sure it's not my wife.

531
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,300
 My wife wired 2,000 Yuan to me yesterday to buy everyone a meal. 

532
00:30:11,274 --> 00:30:13,759
All right. No one is complaining anymore.

533
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,639
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

534
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:17,140
Enjoy.

535
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,140
 Okay, I got it. 

536
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,660
- You... 
 - You're welcome.

537
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,082
You don't need to thank me.

538
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,340
This married couple is mischievous fellows.

539
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,920
That's how they call them in Shanghainese, mischievous fellows.

540
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,021
- Let's eat. 
 - Let's eat.

541
00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:02,651
Are you exhausted?

542
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:04,990
We walked quite a lot today.

543
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,940
I'll do it.

544
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,741
Where are you going tomorrow?

545
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:16,799
We won't go out tomorrow.

546
00:31:16,801 --> 00:31:18,922
The launch will be the day after tomorrow, the 27th.

547
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:22,705
We're staying at the base for the next couple of days to give you our love.

548
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,400
Then I can provide an explanation to my colleagues.

549
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,902
Okay, they're not sore anymore.

550
00:31:28,902 --> 00:31:30,742
Get some rest.

551
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,154
Do you feel nervous?

552
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:06,550
Yes.

553
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,761
The nation invested billions.

554
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:15,601
Over 10,000 people invested ten years of their youth.

555
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,740
You'll surely succeed.

556
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:28,527
Jingjing, after the launch on the 27th,

557
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:33,995
early morning on the 28th, I need to fly to the Aerospace Control Center in Beijing.

558
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:36,400
That will take me a few months again.

559
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,881
I know.

560
00:32:38,883 --> 00:32:40,992
It's not your first time at the base.

561
00:32:40,994 --> 00:32:43,814
I've prepared myself already.

562
00:32:43,814 --> 00:32:46,939
That's why I was thinking

563
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:50,681
if I should go to Beijing to spend time with you.

564
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,398
Yes.

565
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:54,489
All right then.

566
00:32:54,491 --> 00:32:59,650
Since you want it so much, I'll fulfill your wish and agree.

567
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,081
I have a lot of work in Beijing too.

568
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,703
By the way, Yu Tu, I want to ask you something.

569
00:33:11,703 --> 00:33:13,260
What is it?

570
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,348
The past few days, everyone's been having fun.

571
00:33:16,348 --> 00:33:19,359
 Only Xiao Li seemed unhappy. 

572
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,679
 I don't know what's the matter with her. Did something happen between her and Xiao Hu? 

573
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:27,700
 Xiao Li got sick and was hospitalized last month. 

574
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,200
 Xiao Hu wasn't able to go home. 

575
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,557
We were so busy during those days.

576
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,500
What should I do then?

577
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,557
But it seems like nothing I say would be appropriate.

578
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,645
There's no need.

579
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,360
It's hard to be in the family of an aerospace worker indeed.

580
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,499
If Xiao Li thinks that it takes too much sacrifice to be with Xiao Hu,

581
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:56,512
and she feels unhappy,

582
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,123
we can't convince her to make sacrifices.

583
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,220
Good thing I'm also very busy.

584
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,480
Otherwise, perhaps I'd blame you too.

585
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,580
   

586
00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:05,050


587
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:13,580
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

588
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:20,900
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

589
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:27,960
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

590
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:35,640
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

591
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,120
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

592
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:42,340
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

593
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:49,500
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

594
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:56,660
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

595
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:03,800
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

596
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:12,600
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

597
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:46,860
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

598
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:54,000
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

599
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,080
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

600
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:08,560
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

601
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,340
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

602
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:15,340
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

603
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:22,700
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

604
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:29,700
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

605
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:37,000
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

606
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:47,840
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
