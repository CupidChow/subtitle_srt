1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:18,000


2
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,250
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,210
♫  My heart is like the dust and 
couldn’t bear to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,750
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,750
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,630
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:07,930
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:28,990
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:40,050
   

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,478
We've changed the curtains too.

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,660
 That is a nice color. 

17
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,959
I know, right?

18
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,719
This color is very hard to get.

19
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,460
I waited for a month for these before they arrived.

20
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,460
The ones before looked too stuffy.

21
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,540
Yu Tu said that those didn't easily look dirty.

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,779
 That's how he is. 

23
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:11,258
 Aside from wearing dark blue, he wears black. 

24
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:14,080
I didn't touch the book shelves. I didn't tidy them up either.

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,520
He knows where he places his books.

26
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,959
He'll be annoyed if he can't find them because I move them.

27
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,439
 That's how he's been since he was little. 

28
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,419
 He'd get angry if you cleaned them up for him. 

29
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:24,320
Right. That was why I didn't bother and just let him do it himself.

30
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,819
The one on the sofa is a prize from his unit.

31
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,740
Mrs. Yu, I bought new tableware. I'll show it to you.

32
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,319
Let's ignore him today.

33
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,437
He said that he had to write a thesis today and told me to go and have fun by myself.

34
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,980
 Yu Tu, it's Sunday. 

35
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,840
 I don't comment when you usually work overtime. 

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,099
 But today, you must spend time with Jingjing. 

37
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,579
She said that she was going to read her script this afternoon and told me to find something to do.

38
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,879
Mom, why do you still believe her?

39
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,057
Have you forgotten? When you first met, she already lied to you.

40
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:57,239
Go away. Write your thesis.

41
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,920
Aunty, let's check the tableware.

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,319
I'm so sleepy.

43
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:22,539
I can't do it anymore. Even the power of love can't sustain me.

44
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:25,159
I'll read the script with you later.

45
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,300
I'll answer the phone. Let me go.

46
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,800
During your last film-shooting, they said that your boyfriend went to visit you,

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,479
and Zhou Xiaoqi was so furious. Is that true?

48
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,259
It's been over a month since filming wrapped up. Where did you hear that?

49
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:44,599
 I just heard about it. 

50
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,159
 It's true. I laughed so hard. 

51
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,059
 That feels so good. 

52
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:50,279
 When will you let me meet your boyfriend? 

53
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,479
 He's talented. 

54
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,440
You've been together for so long, and you won't let me meet him.

55
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,059
That's not appropriate.

56
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:58,711
You speak as if we see each other very often.

57
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:00,041
Let's have dinner when we have time.

58
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,580
 How about tonight? I don't have work today. 

59
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,999
I'll tell someone to bring hairy crabs over.

60
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:07,939
The type that weighs 300g each.

61
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:09,920
That should be fine. Let me ask him.

62
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,240
 "It should be fine"? Do you still need to ask him? 

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,959
Qiao Jingjing, do you know who I am?

64
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,600
I'm Chen Xue. I'm very famous.

65
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,439
 I'm very hard to meet. 

66
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,100
 I'm inviting him, and he's not coming? 

67
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,180
His girlfriend is also very famous, okay? Do you think you're all that?

68
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,300
The Dynamic Solution Method of Low Thrust Orbit Design.

69
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,240
Chen Xue wants to invite us for dinner at her house tonight.

70
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,097
Do you still remember her?

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,439
Can I forget her?

72
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,109
She said that I sounded like a scumbag.

73
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:43,679
Why do you like holding grudges so much? That was two years ago.

74
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:45,419
Can you do it tonight?

75
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,019
Yes.

76
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,640
Do dinner.

77
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,400
Thank you.

78
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,639
Hello?

79
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,240
 I'll invite Duan Wu and Mr. Zhou later, too. 

80
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,519
 - That's fine, right? 
 - Sure. 

81
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,639
 We all know each other well. Are they in Shanghai, too? 

82
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,759
Yes. My next film is with them.

83
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,859
 I asked, and they're still around. 

84
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:13,279
This way, after we have dinner, we can play mahjong.

85
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,680
No, I won't play that. I don't know how to play that.

86
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,639
You only want to win my money.

87
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,179
Listen. I just earned some money in the desert. Was that easy for me?

88
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,959
 Come on. 

89
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,639
No.

90
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,320
My boyfriend needs to write a thesis when he comes back.

91
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,959
Isn't he working already? Why is he writing a thesis?

92
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,099
Don't you know how scientific research works?

93
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,517
Yes. He does scientific research.

94
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:40,680
Right. We can't play mahjong.

95
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,779
That makes us seem like we don't do decent work.

96
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,058
Don't worry. Let me handle it.

97
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:51,800
I'll surely make you look good.

98
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,980
- Ms. Qiao. You're here. 
 - Aunty.

99
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,360
Xiao Xue is waiting for you.

100
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,140
I'll get you some slippers.

101
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,439
No. I must save them.

102
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,437
With what?

103
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,199
Those dilapidated starships in the Star Port?

104
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,639
 Don't worry. 

105
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,539
 We'll surely look very professional and academic. 

106
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,720
 Is this what she was referring to? 

107
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,240
 Can they stop it? 

108
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,399
You're finally here.

109
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,779
Jingjing.

110
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,239
Ms. Qiao, I haven't seen you in a while.

111
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:42,399
It's been a while.

112
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,439
I brought my boyfriend over for a free dinner.

113
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,820
I know you're here for the free dinner.

114
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,199
Introduce him to us.

115
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,879
This is my boyfriend, Yu Tu.

116
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,319
This is Mr. Zhou, the Film Emperor.

117
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,460
Hello.

118
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,319
I've worked with him before. This is Duan Wu.

119
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,481
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Nice to meet you.

120
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,519
This is my bestie, Chen Xue.

121
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,179
I've heard a lot about you.

122
00:06:59,179 --> 00:07:02,039
What are you doing?

123
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,480
Next month, we'll be filming a movie together.

124
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,920
While we're all here, we're going through the script to get some ideas.

125
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,519
This is a group scene. We happen to need one more person.

126
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,860
Can you help us out, Ms. Qiao?

127
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,080
Help you out?

128
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:24,079
Do you mind lending us Ms. Qiao for a while?

129
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,779
Of course not.

130
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Come on.

131
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,859
 What does your movie have to do with me? 

132
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:50,480
 Aren't we here for dinner? 

133
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,639
 You tricked me into coming here for work. 

134
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,179
 Come on, stop dilly-dallying. 

135
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:55,639
 Your boyfriend is watching. 

136
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,879
 Look academic. 

137
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:02,199
Okay. Let's do it.

138
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,339
This is an interstellar theme movie.

139
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:10,120
This scene is mainly about the argument between the faction seeking peace and the one seeking war.

140
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,139
Ms. Qiao, you're the leader of the peace-seeking faction.

141
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,639
The leader?

142
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,420
Is he an old man?

143
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,199
You can do it.

144
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,161
Right. I can do it.

145
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:27,439
A professional old man voice.

146
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,019
Give me five minutes. Let me memorize the lines.

147
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,598
Please have some water.

148
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,100
Thank you.

149
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,939
Okay, let's start.

150
00:08:46,939 --> 00:08:48,080
Did you memorize it so quickly?

151
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,380
Come on.

152
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,420
No. I must save them.

153
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,340
With what?

154
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,719
Those dilapidated starships in the Star Port?

155
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,459
Major, have you forgotten?

156
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:10,020
The one you're calling a hero took away all the elites in the Federation.

157
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,200
Should we just be at the mercy of others and be swallowed up little by little?

158
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,939
That's enough, Major.

159
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:17,939
Calm down.

160
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,279
The nation can't experience another war.

161
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,640
Besides, this is a war we're bound to lose.

162
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,200
I understand how a warrior thirsts for battle.

163
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,800
But please also consider those ordinary citizens.

164
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,599
Sir. It's not like we have no chance of winning.

165
00:09:38,599 --> 00:09:42,840
The science institute's latest weapon can be installed in the starship.

166
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,659
We need to discuss how we'll do this part of the scene more.

167
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,419
For example, these.

168
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,827
What do you think?

169
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,380
Don't we seem professional and literary?

170
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,579
We were playing Fight the Landlord earlier. 
  (T/N: a card game in the genre of shedding and gambling) 

171
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:09,520
When you arrived, we immediately put the cards away and started going through the scenes.

172
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,740
Right. We quickly got into character so professionally.

173
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,599
Let me ask you.

174
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:18,699
Doesn't this have an academic vibe?

175
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:22,059
Isn't this artsy?

176
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:27,159
We're completely on par with scientists, aren't we?

177
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,460
Please. When we're eating later, stop how you're acting now.

178
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,419
Continue that academic vibe earlier.

179
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:38,159
- Please. Thank you. 
 - Of course.

180
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,539
We can maintain this image during the meal.

181
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:43,220
How about another scene?

182
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,699
There's no need. If we continue, the academic vibe will be too forced.

183
00:10:46,699 --> 00:10:49,420
Just have enough of it. Just enough of it.

184
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,399
What do you think? Was I good at portraying an old man?

185
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,640
Yes.

186
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,880
However, your lines earlier involved the performance parameters of a new weapon.

187
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,859
In an interstellar era, it's a bit too conservative.

188
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,340
 Thank you. I'm confident now. I'll revise it immediately. 

189
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,380
 Afterward, can you help me take a look? 

190
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,740
No problem.

191
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,817
 Let's exchange WeChat contacts. 

192
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,000
Sure. I'll ask Jingjing to send it.

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,200
 Okay. Another question. 

194
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,879
 When I was writing it, I already had doubts. 

195
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,799
 There's a plot regarding a wormhole. I also want to discuss it with you. 

196
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,120
This scriptwriter is a big shot.

197
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,020
When have you seen him being so humble?

198
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,579
Your boyfriend is incredible. And he's so handsome.

199
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,980
If I say that he's handsome, he really is.

200
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,120
And he's so knowledgeable.

201
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,180
No wonder he suppressed that heir boyfriend of Zhou Xiaoqi.

202
00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:00,100
I finally know why you chose him.

203
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,479
I would want him too.

204
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:03,699
Say that again.

205
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:08,239
I'm just expressing my admiration for my bestie's boyfriend.

206
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:10,140
How can I want him?

207
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,419
That's more like it.

208
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:13,620
You're so petty.

209
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,319
Okay.

210
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,659
Actually, some people in the circle are bitter about your relationship.

211
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:41,057
They said that you chose a government worker among all of them.

212
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:46,520
I didn't quite understand before. Why didn't you choose Mr. Su?

213
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,939
Actually, Su Ye is a good catch.

214
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:52,436
He just has minor shortcomings.

215
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:57,519
But men who are handsome and rich are all arrogant.

216
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,020
However, come to think of it now, aside from satisfying our vanity, there's nothing good about him.

217
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,657
We have money ourselves.

218
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,840
Let's choose someone we like.

219
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,260
It doesn't matter how much he earns.

220
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,120
I didn't choose that at all.

221
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,419
I know.

222
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,910
However, Jingjing, if you're not an actress,

223
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,160
and you don't earn that much money,

224
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,770
will you still choose your boyfriend now?

225
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,440
I'm so beautiful, and I work so hard. How can I not earn any money?

226
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,940
Even if I'm a live streamer, I'll become rich too, okay?

227
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:45,900
What if you were unlucky, and you couldn't earn money?

228
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
Are you stupid?

229
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,059
If that really happens, I must hold onto him tightly all the more.

230
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,874
It's a bit bitter.

231
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,140
Why are you so happy?

232
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,579
Because a famous scriptwriter consulted you?

233
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,319
No.

234
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:26,279
I'm happy because my girlfriend is super smart. She's so logical.

235
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,359
Now, you know.

236
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,999
How exactly did you figure that out?

237
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:43,018
For example, you brought all their uncooked crabs home.

238
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:01,139
Dr. Yu.

239
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,860
Yu Tu.

240
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:07,539
Tonight is the basketball semi-final in the institute.

241
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,939
Someone's leg got injured, and he can't play.

242
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:11,759
Can you play?

243
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,219
I said that I'd have dinner at home.

244
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,799
Don't we have new graduates in the unit?

245
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,939
They're quite tall.

246
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:25,299
Being tall doesn't mean they can play basketball.

247
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,059
Xiao Hu is an example.

248
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:29,859
Besides, they just joined us. We haven't played with them yet.

249
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:31,639
You do it.

250
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,899
Okay. I'll inform the one waiting for me at home.

251
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:39,860
The one waiting for you?

252
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,270
I'm curious.

253
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,419
A while ago, Big Meng mysteriously said that you got a girlfriend,

254
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:49,480
and she was very, very beautiful.

255
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,120
Is she who you were referring to?

256
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,819
- That was what he said? 
 - Yes.

257
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:57,619
His facial expression made me want to beat him up. I don't know why he's being so mysterious.

258
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:59,620
It's my girlfriend.

259
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,059
Big Meng is right, too. She's very beautiful indeed.

260
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:07,540
My heart can't take this. Love is in the air.

261
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,359
Fine, I'll go ahead.

262
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,216
See you at the basketball court.

263
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:24,350
Hello?

264
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,640
 Jingjing, I won't be home for dinner. 

265
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,220
 There's a basketball game in the institute. 

266
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,699
 Why didn't you tell me sooner? I marinated the steak already. 

267
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:33,340
I was originally not part of the semi-final.

268
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,739
Someone suddenly got injured, and he can't play.

269
00:16:36,739 --> 00:16:40,140
Do you play basketball so badly? Are you just a substitute?

270
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,819
In senior high, I remember you being the main force on the varsity team.

271
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:48,939
Ms. Qiao. I'm old.

272
00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:52,140
Right. Mr. Yu, you're already 32 years old.

273
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,290
 In high-intensity sports like basketball, 

274
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,740
 your stamina surely can't compare to those young, fresh graduates. 

275
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,419
What about you?

276
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,279
I think we're the same age.

277
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,040
No. No, I'm not.

278
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,161
 Listen. A while ago, a marketing account even said that I looked like a young girl. 

279
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:10,340
Before, I was the one who voluntarily left the team.

280
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,259
Look at them. They ask me to be the substitute once they need someone.

281
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:17,880
 Doesn't that prove that my stamina and standard are stronger than other youngsters in the unit? 

282
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,800
Fine.

283
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,960
If you don't believe me, you can come and confirm it yourself, and cheer for me as well.

284
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,379
   

285
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,079
- Did you bring your ID? 
 - Of course.

286
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,040
There's no time to eat at the canteen. I bought corn juice.

287
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,419
- Okay. 
 - Let's go.

288
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,580
Hello. I'm an employee of Unit 158.

289
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,599
This is my girlfriend. She's here to watch the basketball game.

290
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,220
Here. Register your information.

291
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,900
You need to fill out the information of the visitor and the person they're visiting.

292
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,360
   

293
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,200
I'm sorry. I'm used to wearing this.

294
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:18,019
Are you from Unit 158?

295
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:19,519
Yes.

296
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:24,039
Is your girlfriend here to watch the basketball game?

297
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,879
Yes.

298
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,799
When you come out, exchange this for your ID.

299
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,480
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

300
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:46,880
Aren't you hungry? How can you drink corn juice while wearing a mask?

301
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,620
Big Meng kept telling people that my girlfriend is very beautiful.

302
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,279
I want to officially show you off.

303
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,618
Okay. I'll grant your wish then.

304
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,039
You should have told me that you want to show off.

305
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,599
I just applied make-up base today.

306
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,419
And I didn't wash my hair.

307
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:10,940
It seems like I just look half as beautiful as I can be.

308
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,499
Is that so?

309
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:14,199
Let me see.

310
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,340
How can it just be half?

311
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,240
It's at least two-thirds. That's enough.

312
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,019
Yu Tu!

313
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,699
I'll hit you!

314
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:35,424
Yu Tu, where have you gone? The game is about to start.

315
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,580
I'll be right there.

316
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,480
I picked up Jingjing by the gate.

317
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,799
Who?

318
00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:41,599
Jingjing.

319
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,080
My goodness. This is going to be exciting.

320
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,340
   

321
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,800
Xiao Yin. I just called Yu Tu.

322
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:56,359
And he told me that he went to the gate to pick up that person.

323
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:57,640
Who?

324
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,820
Speak clearly.

325
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,280
His girlfriend.

326
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,000
Really? No way.

327
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,119
Is she the beautiful girlfriend Big Meng kept telling us about?

328
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,279
That's great.

329
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,160
I'm so curious because of what Big Meng said.

330
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,900
I really want to see how beautiful his girlfriend is.

331
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,980
- Hi, Yu Tu. 
 - Hey, Yu Tu. You're here.

332
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,531
Here they come.

333
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,880
Yu Tu. Over here.

334
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:31,238
Why does Yu Tu's girlfriend look so familiar?

335
00:20:31,238 --> 00:20:33,459
Qiao Jingjing.

336
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:35,660
That's Qiao Jingjing, isn't it?

337
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,880
What's going on?

338
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,079
Did we invite a female celebrity to cheer for our basketball game?

339
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,580
No.

340
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,140
Yu Tu is holding her hand.

341
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,140
Xiao Yin.

342
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,120
His girlfriend is Qiao Jingjing.

343
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,160
- Why didn't you tell us? 
 - Oh my god.

344
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,599
You're so tight-lipped.

345
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:53,599
- Xiao Yin. 
 - I'm here.

346
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,340
- Mr. Yu, what can I do for you? 
 - Take care of Jingjing.

347
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,039
I promise to take good care of her.

348
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,279
Hello. I came to watch Yu Tu's basketball game.

349
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,879
Go ahead.

350
00:21:02,879 --> 00:21:04,499
- Go get changed. 
 - Come on.

351
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:06,399
I'll go get changed.

352
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,200
Come on, move over there a bit.

353
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,320
- Jingjing, sit here.  
 - Okay.

354
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,998
Let me introduce you.

355
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:17,400
Jingjing, they are our colleagues.

356
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,920
And this is Yu Tu's girlfriend.

357
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,720
I don't need to tell you her name, do I?

358
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,360
- There's no need. 
 - Who doesn't know her?

359
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,680
- Right. This is unbelievable. 
 - Right.

360
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,079
Who could have thought that Qiao Jingjing is the girlfriend of our colleague?

361
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,720
Actually, it's not that unbelievable. Yu Tu and I were classmates in senior high.

362
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,699
So you've been dating since senior high?

363
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:38,480
I'm sorry. I'm not being nosy. You don't need to answer.

364
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,961
No. We studied hard during senior high. We weren't dating.

365
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:44,319
After many years, we found out that we were both still single,

366
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,560
so we just made do with each other.

367
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,760
Love is in the air.

368
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,359
We don't believe that.

369
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,620
The game is about to begin. Why are you here?

370
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,140
I feel quite pressured.

371
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,939
I feel like it would be bad if we didn't win today.

372
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,839
I believe in you. All the best.

373
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:14,200
Believe in yourself. You're old but vigorous.

374
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,740
Old but vigorous.

375
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,119
Oh my god.

376
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,019
Jingjing.

377
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,480
 You can do it! 

378
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,400
 Go! 

379
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,939
 Hurry! 

380
00:22:38,939 --> 00:22:42,119
 You can do it! 

381
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,799
 - Go! 
 - Go! 

382
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,439
 Go for it! 

383
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,940
 - Go! 
 - Go! 

384
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,658
 - Go for it! 
 - You can do it! 

385
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:39,459
 - Go! 
 - Go! 

386
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,879
 - Go for it! 
 - You can do it! 

387
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,340
   

388
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,340
That last three-point shot was way too cool!

389
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,720
Am I comparable to youngsters?

390
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,240
It's not comparable to yourself when you were younger.

391
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,860
In senior high, when you played basketball,

392
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,820
you obviously made more direct attacks.

393
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,240
Now, you just make three-point shots.

394
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,740
That's obviously because your stamina...

395
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,319
You obviously won through technique.

396
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,440
Can't you say something nice?

397
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:27,564
You're so cool.

398
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:36,839
I like it so much.

399
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:45,619
Let's go home.

400
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:54,079
What do you think? Is my ID photo very beautiful?

401
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:59,699
Let me see if yours is really as handsome as you say it is.

402
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:03,240
Let me compare which one is nicer.

403
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,940
   

404
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:15,398
How can you compare them?

405
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:19,457
If we want to compare them, shouldn't we take one under the same exact conditions,

406
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:25,339
the same lighting, the same photographer, and the same venue

407
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:27,700
before we can reach a conclusion?

408
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:31,059
Should we be so strict about this?

409
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,781
Yes.

410
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:41,299
So when will we take our certificate photo together?

411
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:30,939
Was that a marriage proposal?

412
00:27:30,939 --> 00:27:33,979
Of course. It's so obvious already.

413
00:27:33,979 --> 00:27:38,141
Let me ask you. How is that obvious?

414
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:40,739
So you just agreed so easily?

415
00:27:43,818 --> 00:27:45,538
Don't tell me you have already registered your marriage.

416
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:47,519
How is that possible?

417
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,300
That's good.

418
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,939
I knew it.

419
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:54,040
Teacher Yu isn't an unreliable person.

420
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,759
We're planning to meet our families next weekend.

421
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,679
That's considered our engagement.

422
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,280
Should I start planning your wedding?

423
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,840
I guess so.

424
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,559
This matter must be planned carefully.

425
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,840
The venue, guests, wedding dress, and gifts.

426
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,280
Oh my god. I'm so overwhelmed just thinking about it.

427
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,499
Do you have any thoughts about it?

428
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:17,079
What kind of wedding do you want?

429
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:19,649
When do you want to hold it?

430
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:21,620
Actually, we haven't thought about all those things.

431
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,980
In terms of the date, after my next film is done?

432
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,540
Your next drama is only 12 episodes.

433
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,620
You'll finish filming in over a month.

434
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,659
Do you want to plan a wedding in just over one month?

435
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:36,539
Have you gotten married before?

436
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,879
Take a look.

437
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,959
Hainan is so nice.

438
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:52,780
I think it's also good to hold the wedding in Hainan.

439
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,341
The confidentiality factor will be high. Right?

440
00:28:55,341 --> 00:28:58,019
But so many people will be going to Hainan.

441
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:00,419
It would be very fussy about mobilizing everyone. That's very troublesome.

442
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:03,440
Aunty, don't worry. Sister Ling will make arrangements.

443
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,119
We'll organize it.

444
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,920
We guarantee that we'll make proper arrangements

445
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,899
for your relatives and friends.

446
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:12,540
We can also hold the wedding in Shanghai.

447
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:16,379
However, the confidentiality factor will be low. Am I right?

448
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,900
What about our hometown?

449
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,359
In-laws, what are your thoughts?

450
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,759
We... We don't have any thoughts.

451
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:24,640
We'll just do what Yu Tu and Jingjing want.

452
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,980
- Yes, we'll listen to them. 
 - Let's do what Jingjing wants.

453
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,300
Then we won't get the matter settled if we listen to her.

454
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,180
She's so fickle.

455
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:34,380
Xiao Zhu. When other celebrities get married,

456
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,559
once there is a mistake, they will become trending at once.

457
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,481
"It's too formal." "It's too simple." Some would comment that way.

458
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:43,860
They'll also comment about the gifts given. We must be careful.

459
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,359
You must manage the guests and stuff.

460
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,200
Auntie, don't worry.

461
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,720
Xiao Zhu. You always call Yu Tu Teacher Yu. Why is that?

462
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,500
Because a few years ago, when Teacher Yu taught Jingjing how to play games, that was what we called him.

463
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,880
We're used to it.

464
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,901
That was how Teacher Yu tricked Jingjing into being his girlfriend.

465
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:07,037
Didn't she tell you?

466
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,039
Son, you were that good?

467
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,539
Teacher Yu.

468
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:13,759
Your daughter can't be tricked that easily in the future.

469
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:15,699
Aunty, that won't happen.

470
00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:18,660
He must go through me, her dad, first.

471
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:21,540
At that time, you'll be a 50 or 60-year-old man.

472
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,620
How can you fight a youngster?

473
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,200
At 80 years old, I can still make a Penta kill, don't you think?

474
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,799
Continue bluffing.

475
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:31,480
Teacher Yu.

476
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:37,060
I have to drive Jingjing back to the film set.

477
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,559
I'll get something in Shanghai first.

478
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,060
Then I'll meet up with you in Hengdian.

479
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,960
Okay.

480
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,680
Look. It's almost New Year, and you still accepted a film-shooting project.

481
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,519
After getting married, you must take care of your household.

482
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,820
It's fine, Jingjing. You can do your work.

483
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,480
At home, Yu Tu can take good care of himself.

484
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,000
Accept film-shooting works if you want.

485
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,720
If not, just rest at home.

486
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,520
You don't need to mind him. It's true. You don't need to mind him.

487
00:30:58,939 --> 00:31:02,679
Mom, that wasn't what you told me before.

488
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,900
What did I tell you before?

489
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,860
No. Your mom told me about it.

490
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,960
Look. Let's just see what Jingjing wants to do.

491
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,839
Jingjing, you call the shots.

492
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,417
So your mom's requirement was for her daughter-in-law to take good care of you?

493
00:31:29,417 --> 00:31:31,119
But when she saw you,

494
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:33,039
she forgot what she originally wanted.

495
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,419
She's not firm at all.

496
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:39,059
But what kind of son-in-law do your parents require?

497
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:41,640
Just being handsome is enough.

498
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:46,559
I fulfilled that once I was born then.

499
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,100
I'm ignoring you.

500
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,560
There's another successful rocket launch at the Taiyuan Launch Center.

501
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,959
A few days ago, it seemed a rocket also successfully launched in Jiuquan.

502
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:04,820
Right. I think Science 20 was the one that launched today.

503
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,380
How do you know it so well?

504
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,540
Because I'm following a lot of your industry's official accounts.

505
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,599
Like CATC,

506
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,599
Shanghai Aerospace,

507
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,480
and also your unit's official account.

508
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,979
Aren't I a very qualified family member of an aerospace worker?

509
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,079
You follow a lot more accounts than me.

510
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:22,797
Of course, you are.

511
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,960
Do you follow any official accounts in the entertainment circle?

512
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,480
I'm sorry. I didn't do my job well.

513
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,739
Here. I'll follow them now.

514
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,739
I don't want you to follow them when you're told.

515
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,699
And lately, I have a romance drama coming up.

516
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:48,880
Forget it.

517
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,620
If some official accounts have some photos of sweet interactions with the male lead,

518
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,198
someone might be unhappy if he sees them.

519
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,520
Is that considered a romance drama?

520
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,317
You break up at the beginning.

521
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,672
Isn't the story afterwards about the female lead's career?

522
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:05,079
Right. I forgot you read the script.

523
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:07,079
You were hasty.

524
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:16,300
But Jingjing, when accepting film-shooting works, you don't need to consider me.

525
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,379
It's true. I'm fine.

526
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:20,419
All right.

527
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:22,740
I won't intentionally avoid sweet scenes and stuff.

528
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,607
It will depend on the script.

529
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,020
One may say that he doesn't mind,

530
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,560
but I wonder who takes the script and studies it carefully every single time.

531
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,340
Yu Tu. I just discovered this from the official account of your unit.

532
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,380
I want my wedding to be done this way too.

533
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:59,920


534
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:13,730
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

535
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:20,950
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

536
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:28,010
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

537
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:35,790
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

538
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,270
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

539
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,390
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

540
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:49,550
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

541
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:56,760
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

542
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,850
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

543
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:12,950
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

544
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:46,910
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

545
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:54,050
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

546
00:35:54,050 --> 00:36:01,230
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

547
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:08,810
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

548
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:11,290
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

549
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:15,490
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

550
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:22,750
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

551
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:29,850
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

552
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:37,050
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

553
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:48,660
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
