00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,080
 Distinguished experts and leaders, that's all for our presentation. 

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,510
We welcome any comments or questions.

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,099

12
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,640
After the discussion,

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,840
the panel of experts has ﻿agreed unanimously that 
    
   

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,040
Proposal SK-1 is both innovative and refreshing.

15
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,459
However, aerospace is part of Systems Engineering.

16
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,200
The prerequisite to continuing your proposal is

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,180
an engine with high specific impulse.

18
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,359
   

19
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,500
   

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,260
   

21
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:40,940
Why are you so quiet today?

22
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,419
Feeling down? Is it that bad?

23
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,599
I'm not a chatty person, to begin with.

24
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:50,639
But during the defense just now, you were so eloquent.

25
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:54,699
And now, you look moody. Why? Are you discouraged?

26
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:57,199
Didn't we already anticipate this?

27
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:59,760
It is a huge research project on a new model.

28
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,480
Rome wasn't built in one day.

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,200
It's not that.

30
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,319
You're right. You've been brooding for several months.

31
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,119
Dr. Guan, I was looking for you.

32
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:18,060
I have a question for you.

33
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,160
We'll talk later.

34
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:42,360
   

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,570
   

36
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,479
 Due to a cold front, please expect 
   

37
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,639
 a drop in tonight's temperature in Shanghai. 

38
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,279
 Welcome to the navigation interface. 
   

39
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:41,459
 Traffic jam anticipated. Please leave earlier. 

40
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,380
   

41
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,240
 Hi, everyone. 

42
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,559
 I'm currently in the Shanghai Exhibition and Convention Center. 

43
00:03:58,559 --> 00:04:02,119
 The anniversary event of Penguin TV will begin soon. 

44
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:05,600
 A resplendent night awaits us here. 

45
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,559
 Let me hear 

46
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,559
 your applause and your passion. 
   

47
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:10,279
We are here, live.

48
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:12,919
Our fans have all gathered here.

49
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,559
One more hour until the opening ceremony,

50
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:18,720
but everyone has already arrived at the scene.

51
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,279
It will be a resplendent night.

52
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,939
 Due to a cold front, 

53
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:26,939
 please expect a drop in tonight's temperature in Shanghai. 

54
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,179
 Traffic jam anticipated. Please leave earlier. 

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,160
Jingjing, there will be heavy traffic. We should leave earlier.

56
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,000
It will be cold tonight, so bring a jacket with you.

57
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,080
   

58
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,020
   

59
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,810
   

60
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,920
   

61
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,180
   

62
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,600
   

63
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,440
 The Best Actress for this year is 

64
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,620
 Qiao Jingjing! 

65
00:05:53,380 --> 00:06:00,500
   

66
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,260
   

67
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,660
Look at this!

68
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,400
Your high school classmate said that

69
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,000
you were humiliated and rejected by a guy you were pursuing in high school.

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,660
Do you have an anti-fan among your high school classmates?

71
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,480
 Reporter, I have explosive news. 

72
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,800
 I went to the high school in "Y" city. 

73
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,440
 A very popular female celebrity was my classmate. 

74
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,019
 Let's call her "Q", for now. 

75
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:33,079
 In high school, Q wasn't pretty at all. She looked so different. 

76
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,320
 Plastic surgery, I bet. 

77
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,920
 Back then, she wasn't the "school flower." It was another top student beauty. 
 (T/N: prettiest girl at school) 

78
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,600
 There was a "scholar-god" in our class at that time. 

79
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,200
 He was quite handsome, too. So Q confessed to him, 

80
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,640
 but she was rejected mercilessly. 

81
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,679
 He said that he had "IQ" requirements. 
 (T/N: He wanted someone smart) 

82
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:49,339
 In the end, the scholar-god went to Tsinghua University with the top student beauty. 

83
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:52,979
 They became a couple. That's what I call a match made in heaven. 

84
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,580
This is crossing the line! Why is this person spouting nonsense?

85
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,160
All right. Calm down.

86
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,479
The fans are already speaking up in the discussion.

87
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:00,640
 If that is true, 

88
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,399
 thank you for telling everyone that our Qiao was in the elite class for high school, 

89
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,440
 and she graduated from a university of Project 211. 
 (T/N: high-level comprehensive universities and colleges; regarded as tier 1 universities) 

90
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,160
 She did poorly in school? Impossible! 

91
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,359
I would just like to ask the victim in question,

92
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:18,880
is this real or fake?

93
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:22,679
Some are real, some are fake.

94
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,910
That one about me being ugly was fake.

95
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:28,140
I've always looked this good, okay?

96
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,299
Also, he rejected me, yes, but it wasn't that mean.

97
00:07:31,299 --> 00:07:33,399
He was really polite.

98
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:38,880
So you admit that you confessed to him but got rejected?

99
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,019
Yes.

100
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,720
That guy...

101
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,899
 Yu Tu, 

102
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,380
was really handsome and really smart.

103
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,480
Did he really think that you were dumb,

104
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,440
so he chose the other girl over you?

105
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,760
You're dumb.

106
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,520
I graduated from a university of Project 211, okay?

107
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,079
Jingjing.

108
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,560
 Check out the screenshot I sent you. 

109
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:29,519
 Which jerk said that? You have always been pretty. 

110
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:32,499
 At most, you were just a bit unpolished. 

111
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,500
 By the way, I heard from Li Ming a while ago, 

112
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,760
 that Yu Tu and Xia Qing broke up when they were in their fourth year of university. 

113
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,479
 They were together for about a year. 

114
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:49,280
 You still remember Li Ming, our high school classmate? 

115
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,359
 He lived in the same community as Yu Tu. Their parents know each other. 

116
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:55,159
 I heard Yu Tu is now in Shanghai, too. 

117
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,159
   

118
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,679
 Jingjing, say, 

119
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,920
 do you think Yu Tu regrets rejecting you? 

120
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,119
 Don't be this childish. 

121
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,320
 Yu Tu. 

122
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,039
 Do you have a moment? I have a question. 

123
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,960
 Sure, go ahead. 

124
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,479
 Yu Tu, do you not have a girlfriend right now? 

125
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,799
 If so, what do you think of me? 

126
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,200
 Sorry. 

127
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,880
 I want someone who can work hard together with me. 

128
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,880
 But the one you found didn't work hard with you until the end. 

129
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,080
It's already 10 p.m.

130
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,000
Should we return to Shanghai?

131
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We'll leave tomorrow morning and arrive at Hengdian in the afternoon.

132
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,939
I'll ask them to postpone your scenes.

133
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:15,840
No, I have ten scenes tomorrow.

134
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,740
Let's go to Hengdian now. Ask the driver to drive slowly.

135
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,540
Look how tired you are.

136
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,059
- Mr. Wang, Hengdian it is. 
 - No problem.

137
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,559
Thank you.

138
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,740
   

139
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,519
 An exam? 

140
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,200
 How many calories does a strawberry have? 

141
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,239
 That's tough. 

142
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:26,140
 Even a scholar-god wouldn't know the answer. 

143
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,820
   

144
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,820
   

145
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,800
 Jingjing. Jingjing. 

146
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,080
Wake up!

147
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,719
Did you play Honor of Kings?

148
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,040
 Xiao Qiao, you have to become stronger. 

149
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,100
 Enemy Legendary! 

150
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,700
 Enemy Unstoppable! 

151
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,900
 Executed. You've been slain. 

152
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,300
   

153
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,579
This Xiao Qiao is you?

154
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,300
Congratulations. You're famous on Weibo now.

155
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,559
Look. First in trending, "Qiao Jingjing, gamer persona shattered,

156
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,100
sending ripples through the entertainment and the esports industry."

157
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,119
When did you start playing this game?

158
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,320
When I was filming earlier this year.

159
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,520
I played it on and off and didn't play it for long.

160
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,240
In Honor of Kings, there's a function to be a spectator

161
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,810
and watch people fight, even record it.

162
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:39,119
Didn't you know?

163
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,500
Such a function exists?

164
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,840
If you didn't know anything, why did you even play the game?

165
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,919
I'm the spokesperson, and you guys keep saying I'm a pro gamer.

166
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,400
Of course I felt guilty, so I had to practice.

167
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,779
I knew you were like this.

168
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:55,799
Just one or two compliments are enough to make you think you're good at something.

169
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,400
It's serious, you know.

170
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,579
Do you have any idea how popular this game is?

171
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:04,540
How many people are lining up to be the spokesperson?

172
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,210
Some will even do it for free!

173
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,520
Honor of Kings was supposed to renew the contract with us,

174
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,280
but with the current drama, I guess it's gone.

175
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:16,339
Of course, this is not the most important.

176
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:19,459
You're an actress. Being a spokesperson is just a side job.

177
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:23,100
What's more important is the leading actress role in Director Li's latest movie.

178
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,300
Do you know what this new movie will be called?

179
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,359
It's called "Authenticity."

180
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:34,440
You're saying that someone stirred this up to get the role in Director Li's movie?

181
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,360
   

182
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,799
A call from Honor of Kings.

183
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,700
- Hello? 
 - Ms. Qiu, I'm Alex.

184
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,959
- How are you? 
 - What's with the trending topic today?

185
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,660
 Does that user ID belong to Jingjing? 

186
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,210
 Was she practicing some heroes? 
 (T/N: characters in the game) 

187
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:54,900
Yes.

188
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,039
She was using her alternative user ID to practice with heroes she was not familiar with.

189
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,679
That's why it was like this.

190
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:02,080
In this case, you should clarify on Weibo. 
    

191
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,119
Or else, you'll put us in an awkward position.

192
00:14:04,119 --> 00:14:07,119
You're right. We'll do it right away.

193
00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:09,800
 By the way, Ms. Qiu, we have discussed this internally, and we believe that 

194
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,400
a clarification on Weibo might not be enough.

195
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,790
We will have an event soon, and it is very suitable to

196
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,400
turn this crisis into opportunity.

197
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,060
What event?

198
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,000
So the World Champion Cup will end in a month.

199
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
In the end, we'll hold an award ceremony.

200
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,960
 In this ceremony, we would love to invite Jingjing to play a casual match. 

201
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,719
 We will randomly select five lucky players from Weibo. 

202
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:37,540
Together with Jingjing, the six of them will be divided into two teams.

203
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,599
Each team can select two professional players as their teammates.

204
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,100
But this is not stipulated in our contract.

205
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,600
The contract also doesn't say that a video like this would be leaked.

206
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,159
 It's just a casual match. 

207
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:52,699
 Don't worry. 

208
00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:54,059
 Unless Jingjing is... 

209
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,379
It's not about her playing skills. It's that in our...

210
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,599
It's okay. I'll do it.

211
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,019
 Ms. Qiu. 

212
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,600
- Hello? 
 - That voice just now was...

213
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,800
It was Jingjing.

214
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,900
As you know, she's an avid fan of your game.

215
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,000
 - Then we can...  
 - Since Jingjing already said yes,

216
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,380
I see no point in refusing you.

217
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,960
Let's discuss more in detail.

218
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,700
Qiao Jingjing updated her Weibo.

219
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,039
 This score is actually not that bad. 

220
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,699
 We both have Qiao in our name, so why can't I use her well? 
 (T/N: Xiao Qiao is a character's name in the game) 

221
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,500
The comments and reactions from the netizens seem good.

222
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,150
Many have bought her explanation.

223
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,300
However, some still remain skeptical.

224
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,740
Post the message we said just now.

225
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:42,060
 In this year's award ceremony, 

226
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,939
 the spokesperson of Honor of Kings, Qiao Jingjing, 

227
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:46,320
 will have a casual match with some lucky winners. 

228
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,540
 Are you excited about Ms. Qiao Jingjing's Xiao Qiao? 

229
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,540
 Apply now. 

230
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,159
   
   

231
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,440
After announcing that Qiao Jingjing will play in a casual match, the tide has turned.

232
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,760
Everyone is looking forward to it now.

233
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,699
   

234
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:04,659
In fact, everyone thinks that it's normal to be unable to play well with certain heroes.

235
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:08,000
Look. Some players came to her defense, too.

236
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,300
However, how good is she?

237
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,800
If she's as bad as she was in the video,

238
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,239
then that would be disastrous.

239
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,339
We will look bad.

240
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,860
When that happens, we'll remove her as our spokesperson.

241
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,700
The dissenting voice has gone down temporarily,

242
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,300
but the casual match will begin in around a month.

243
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,700
Your level is not good enough for a match.

244
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,339
We already have the excuse that you were practicing the hero.

245
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:45,699
You really don't have to take part in this match.

246
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:49,239
Jingjing, you were too reckless this time.

247
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,600
Jingjing?

248
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,999
Sister Ling, I don't usually accept a stranger's friend request on WeChat.

249
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,960
Don't worry. I'll definitely find out who's behind all this.

250
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,080
No need for that. It's my fault.

251
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,599
Don't be angry.

252
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,800
I'm not angry.

253
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,120
The culprit will suffer my wrath soon.

254
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,739
Try to get me the role from Director Li.

255
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:27,079
As for the game, find someone reliable to coach me.

256
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,160
This show will finish shooting in a few days.

257
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,900
Keep the current schedule, but don't add other things.

258
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,920
I was planning to give you a 2-week break,

259
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,600
but now that the casual match is in a month,

260
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,290
you plan to spend this period practicing the game?

261
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,839
Look. In the comments, my fans voiced their support. 
    

262
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:49,100
If I lose in the match that will take place in a month, 
    

263
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,979
not only will I be mocked, but my fans will be too.

264
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,639
I see. I'll arrange for it then.

265
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,580
It's my fault this time. Thank you.

266
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,500
Oh, please. No need to thank me.

267
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,780
I still have one month. I can do this.

268
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,699
In no way is this harder than abs training.

269
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,839
Of course. You can do this.

270
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,339
All right. It's 2 a.m. now.

271
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:18,599
- You still have to shoot all day tomorrow. Sleep early. 
 - All right.

272
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,400
Jingjing.

273
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,939
Even though I agree that abs training is harder than gaming,

274
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:35,699
your abs are nowhere to be seen despite the weight loss.

275
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,519
Good night.

276
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,140
You can't see them?

277
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,359
Ms. Qiao, congratulations on completing the shooting. 
    

278
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,820
Great!

279
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,700
   

280
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,880
Come, let's take a group photo.

281
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,179
Look at this camera. Three, two, one. Good.

282
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:10,260
Thank you. Thanks, everyone. Goodbye.

283
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,219
Take care.

284
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:13,920
Thank you, everyone. Good job.

285
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,260
Goodbye.

286
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,539
 Since you've decided to play in this casual match, 

287
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:29,980
then we have to prepare thoroughly.

288
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,359
There's only one goal in mind, don't let anyone know that you're a rookie.

289
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,400
Once you're back in Shanghai, you'll need to start training.

290
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,539
Got it.

291
00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:40,120
Take this. You'll use this model of phone for the casual match.

292
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,579
Use it for your practice so that you can get used to it.

293
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:46,380
Your account has been created. No one will know it's you.

294
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,780
I also found a professional coach for you.

295
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,800
Who?

296
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,100
A professional player?

297
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,000
I can't wait.

298
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,700
Here.

299
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,000
My husband.

300
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,800
Are you really a professional?

301
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,000
A'Guo is a King Player, okay?

302
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,500
   

303
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,600
I decided to ask you to be the spokesperson of Honor of Kings

304
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,600
because I was inspired by how engrossed he was in the game.

305
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,700
He's a veteran, and is more than qualified to be your coach.

306
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,810
Also, with our current situation,

307
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,800
I don't dare to find an outsider to coach you.

308
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,000
What if he or she shares this with everyone?

309
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,900
Fine then.

310
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,300
Train hard.

311
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,600
If you have half the skills of A'Guo,

312
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,800
then your performance should be satisfactory.

313
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,000
I still have work to do.

314
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,900
This meeting room will be your classroom from now onwards.

315
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,000
Start whenever.

316
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,300
- Train hard too, Xiao Zhu, so you can be her partner. 
 - Okay.

317
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,200
I'll leave her to you, Darling.

318
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,600
Go finish your things.

319
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,300
Go.

320
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,600
I'll be in your care then.

321
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,000
No need to be so formal.

322
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,600
We're almost like a family now.

323
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,800
A'Ling has told me about the general situation.

324
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,000
Don't worry.

325
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,500
This game is simple.

326
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,600
It definitely won't be a problem for you to be good at several heroes in a month.

327
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,800
Calm yourself down.

328
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,000
Okay.

329
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
- Then let's start from the basics. 
 - Okay.

330
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,200
Let's go to the tutorial.

331
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,100
 Welcome to Honor of Kings. 

332
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
From the blue side's perspective,

333
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,600
this is the middle path, this is the confrontational path,

334
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,200
and this is the developmental path.

335
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,000
Since you're new, you'll be Support.

336
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,800
Just follow the Marksman.

337
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,200
Okay.

338
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,200
By the way,

339
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,000
A'Ling told me about the match rules.

340
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,200
You'll have two random players

341
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
and two pro players as your teammates.

342
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,400
Honestly, you can never outperform

343
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,200
a professional player anyway.

344
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,600
Professional players will want to be the core positions.

345
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,400
There are core positions in this game?

346
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes.

347
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,800
There are five positions in total.

348
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,000
Mid, Jungle, Marksman, Tank, and Support.

349
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,600
The first three are the core positions.

350
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,400
Can I be a core, then?

351
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,000
- Do you want to win? 
 - Yes.

352
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,600
Then play Support.

353
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,200
Do you know why?

354
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
First, Support is easier to learn.

355
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Secondly, it's not the most pivotal role.

356
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
You can definitely be Support.

357
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,800
Let me teach you some common supportive skills.

358
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,700
Look. Let's start with Zhang Fei.

359
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,800
His abilities are quite simple.

360
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,000
Five Tiger Generals, at your service.

361
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
   

362
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,800
Just like that.

363
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,600
Now, let's matchmake and practice.

364
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,200
 Welcome to Honor of Kings. 

365
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,000
Just follow me, Hou Yi.

366
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,800
Use your Skill 1 once you're out.

367
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,700
 - Get Ready. Prepare to engage.  
 - Okay.

368
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,600
Your Skill 2 is a shield. Use it on me.

369
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,900
Good. If you can use it at the right time, it will be even better.

370
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,800
Okay. You're level 4 now. You can use your ultimate skill.

371
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,400
Use it to blow him away.

372
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,400
 Follow my march! 

373
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Yikes!

374
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,000
 Thank you. 

375
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,000
He was about to die. Why did you blow him away?

376
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,800
I just wanted to see how it looks like.

377
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,000
It's okay. Let's continue.

378
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,400
Gao Jianli is after me now.

379
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,600
Hurry and blow him away with your ultimate skill.

380
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,300
 First Blood! 

381
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,100
I don't have much HP left. Why did you blow him towards me?

382
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It's okay. Let's continue.

383
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,800
Don't sweat it.

384
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,200
You can do this. Come.

385
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,100
 You have been slain. 

386
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,000
 Enemy unstoppable! 

387
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,900
 Defeat. 

388
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,600
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

389
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,100
This hero is not suitable for you,

390
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,400
so let's use another hero.

391
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,700
Let's use Sun Bin.

392
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,300
He's quite good.

393
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,200
 Defeat. 

394
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,100
Try Niumo.

395
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,600
 Defeat. 

396
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,200
Zhuang Zhou.

397
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,100
 Defeat. 

398
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,200
Today is still a fruitful day.

399
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,600
We have found several heroes that don't suit your play style.

400
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,200
Let's not give up and do this again tomorrow.

401
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,000
We'll definitely find your true calling.

402
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,400
Okay.

403
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,130
   

404
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
How's the training?

405
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,600
Well, full of surprises.

406
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,200
 Defeat. 

407
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,800
You worked hard.

408
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,000
Your arms must be tired.

409
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,900
How's the practice?

410
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,800
Not bad.

411
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,800
We've tried out all the Support heroes.

412
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,100
Really? Did she find a hero that she's good at, then?

413
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,200
Cai Wenji.

414
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,000
Zhuang Zhou and Yao are not bad either, right?

415
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,300
Wait, even though you're not in your best form yet,

416
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,400
the random players selected won't

417
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,700
necessarily be King players either, right?

418
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,400
So let's not practice tomorrow. Have a break.

419
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,900
I will revise a new coaching plan based on Jingjing's capability.

420
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,600
Okay. She has to shoot an ad tomorrow anyway.

421
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,200
She won't be able to practice.

422
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,600
Jingjing, go back now and sleep early.

423
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,200
I'll practice on my phone tomorrow.

424
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,600
I'm not used to this phone.

425
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,400
Don't. Don't. If people record your game again,

426
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,600
we'll be in deep trouble.

427
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,700
One, I can disable spectating.

428
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,800
Two, I can use an alternative user ID.

429
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,200
Disable spectating?

430
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,000
Of course... I've learned a lot these days, you know.

431
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Exactly. This is progress.

432
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,500
Which account should I use for the registration...?

433
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,300
   

434
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Thank goodness I have an alternative user ID.

435
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,230
   

436
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,600
   

437
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,100
   

438
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,700
I knew no one would use a weird nickname.

439
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,400
   

440
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,200
   

441
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,500
   

442
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,000
   

443
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,800
   

444
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,600
   

445
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,000
   

446
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
   

447
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:17,600
   

448
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,600
 Why won't you teach me math? 

449
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,200
 Let me create an alternative user ID. 

450
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,600
   

451
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,500
   

452
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,400
   

453
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,700
   

454
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:01,040
 Let's go! Let's go! 

455
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,600
   

456
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 In the class group, he was chatting and is online. 

457
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,600
 Why didn't he accept my request? 

458
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,600
   

459
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,000
   

460
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,800
   

461
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
   

462
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,900
   

463
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,000
   

464
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,100
   

465
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,100
 Galaxy. 

466
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,300
   

467
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,200
 I'm a forum user from Space Fans. 

468
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,800
   

469
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,000
   

470
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,600
   

471
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,800
 That was quick. 

472
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,000
 What should I say? 

473
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,700
   

474
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,700
I almost forgot about that.

475
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,100
   

476
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,400
   

477
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,800
Yu Tu invited me?

478
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,100
   

479
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,800
   

480
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,600
 Yu Tu, did you add this person? Who are they? 

481
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,200
 Wrong button. A friend on QQ. 

482
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,200
 They're new. Unranked. 

483
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,800
Wrong invitation, indeed. But I won't leave.

484
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,800
You still cause me trouble after a decade.

485
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,200
I'll screw up your game to make it fair.

486
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,000
 - Let's start, then. 
 - Go! 

487
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,000
 What will you play? 

488
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,700
 I'm flexible. 

489
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,800
 You're new. 

490
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,600
 Let's start with Support. Just follow the Marksman. 

491
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,900
So you're Marksman.

492
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,400
Don't blame me if I screw you over.

493
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,400

501

I did my best.

502
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,300
 - You've been slain.  
 - If you die then...

503
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
 Are you ready? 

504
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,200
 I lost... 

505
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,800
 None shall resist my bullet and my good looks. 

506
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,400
 Triple Kill! 

507
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,800
Is Yu Tu good at this game?

508
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,400
 Double Kill! 

509
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,000
Another victory?

510
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
It's barely ten minutes!

511
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:25,260
Victory! 
    

512
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,800
 Will it be too shameless of me to join back into their lobby? 

513
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,100
 They invited me by mistake, to begin with. 

514
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,000
   

515
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,500
School's About to Start So Panicky. He's a nice guy.

516
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,700
 Marksman is good in this patch. 

517
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,600
 I will play Marksman this round. 

518
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
 Welcome to Honor of Kings. 

519
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,900
 Prepare to engage. 

520
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,000
 First Blood. 

521
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,200
 Cai Wenji? 

522
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,200
 Sorry, I'm not very good. I just started playing. 

523
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,600
 Use voice chat. Let me guide you. 

524
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,400
Voice chat?

525
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
   

526
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
 I finally knew why Yu Tu, always the Marksman, 

527
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,000
 was willing to give up the position of Marksman. 

528
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,700
 This Cai Wenji is a troll! 

529
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,800
 You're overthinking. 

530
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,000
 I just want to show you how to play Zhuge Liang properly. 

531
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,100
 You've been slain. 

532
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,100
 Oh, no. They won't invite me for the next round. 

533
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,000
 I thought of everything. 

534
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,500
 Double Kill! 

535
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,900
 Eat this. 

536
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,400
 You walked into my trap. 

537
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
 Triple Kill. 

538
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,100
 Quadra Kill! 

539
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,800
 Unbelievable. 

540
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,200
 Yu Tu, you kill stealer! 

541
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,410
 Your Zhuge Liang is not bad, Yu Tu. 

542
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,200
 I have never seen you play him. 

543
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,000
 Zhai Liang always picked Mage, so he couldn't pick it. 

544
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,400
Easy.

545
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:57,960

♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

552
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:45,800
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

559
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:05,100
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

560
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,600
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

561

♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

563
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:26,100
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

564
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:33,400
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:43,000
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
