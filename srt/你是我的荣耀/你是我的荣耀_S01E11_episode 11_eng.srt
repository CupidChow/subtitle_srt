2
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,300
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,160
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,900
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,600
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,500
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,940
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:00,580
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:08,180
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:15,940
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:29,000
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:40,200
   

14
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,980
   

15
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,180
   

16
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,740
Are you still angry?

17
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,120
You never replied to my message

18
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,738
so I came to ask

19
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:26,579
if you still need my guidance.

20
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,579
I said something wrong the other day. Please tell your professor that I'm sorry.

21
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,239
I already did.

22
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,539
A few days ago, Mrs. Zhang texted me and asked

23
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:48,360
if my classmate, Jingjing, was the celebrity, Qiao Jingjing.

24
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,779
When I wasn't here,

25
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:55,779
you did well in the games.

26
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:57,819
How did you know?

27
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,959
I saw your stats.

28
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,239
So...

29
00:04:06,118 --> 00:04:08,118
Do you still need me?

30
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,339
Those strange-looking machine parts that you bought are already here.

31
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:24,199
My address was written on it, but the phone number was yours.

32
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,780
Good thing management helped to receive them.

33
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,540
Are you just going to leave them at my place?

34
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:31,919
Of course not.

35
00:04:35,158 --> 00:04:37,278
Come up and eat something then.

36
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,259
Did you prepare food for me?

37
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:48,060
I'll come again tomorrow.

38
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,919
I took the night train. I stink too much right now.

39
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,238
You took a night train,

40
00:04:55,238 --> 00:04:57,959
and you still came here to play games?

41
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,978
I'm glad I brought a power bank, or else I would run out of battery.

42
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,150
I'll ask my driver to send you home.

43
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,860
You can't refuse.

44
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,800
I don't want you to suffocate people with your stench in the subway.

45
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,799
All right.

46
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:34,480
You have to keep your word.

47
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,738
For this whole year, you will stay in Shanghai. No more business trips.

48
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:42,638
If you break your promise again, I will teach you a lesson.

49
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,040
You always go back on your word.

50
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,238
We talked about this last year.

51
00:05:47,238 --> 00:05:50,319
But your overtime work and business trips all went over the limit.

52
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,659
I have been keeping records.

53
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,678
Are you going to cook all of these? Isn't this too much?

54
00:05:56,678 --> 00:06:00,480
Of course I'm cooking them. There is no way you ate well while on your business trip.

55
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,060
Come here. Give me a hand.

56
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,460
Okay.

57
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,079
When our son gets back today and sees these dishes, he will be so happy.

58
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,400
He's going to ask if it's a special occasion.

59
00:06:23,638 --> 00:06:27,078
Dear, how about you cook some dishes, too?

60
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:31,959
Never mind.

61
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,859
I don't want you to waste my ingredients.

62
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:54,219
Dear, I have something to tell you.

63
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,640
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,438
We...

65
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,498
I... I have a problem.

66
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,319
But I don't think it's anything serious.

67
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,938
It will get better eventually.

68
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,959
I'm sure of it.

69
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,759
Don't worry.

70
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,980
   

71
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,180
Teacher Yu, you live quite far away.

72
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,879
I've been driving for an hour.

73
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,000
If you usually take the train to meet Ms. Qiao,

74
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,278
it probably takes you two hours, right?

75
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:00,979
Not really. About one hour and a half.

76
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:03,479
So it takes you three hours for a round trip.

77
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,278
Mr. Wang, don't tell Ms. Qiao.

78
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:11,438
Sure. Don't worry.

79
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:42,879
When did you get back? I didn't even know.

80
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,918
Just a while ago.

81
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:49,520
You didn't tell me that you were back. Or else, I'd have made you one of these too.

82
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,199
It's fine.

83
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,199
Why did you pack your stuff again? You're leaving again?

84
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:02,358
I'll be staying somewhere else for now.

85
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:05,299
Please continue to look after the house for me.

86
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,058
Is your work still not done yet?

87
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:09,740
I thought you resigned.

88
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,499
Are they still using you before you go?

89
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,600
Hello?

90
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,219
Xiao Yu, it's me, Shen Jing. 
  (T/N: Xiao as in little; used as a nickname) 

91
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:43,979
 I know. 

92
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,640
Guan Zai and I are at the hospital.

93
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:57,759
 Thank you for what you did in Xi'an. 

94
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:03,080
 Thank you for taking care of him for so many days. 

95
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,300
It's what I should've done.

96
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,440
I was going to call you.

97
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,738
I'll stay with him at night.

98
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,179
I'll cut to the chase then.

99
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:19,038
I'll probably still need your help for a while.

100
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:22,658
We don't have any relatives in Shanghai.

101
00:11:22,658 --> 00:11:26,658
 During the day, my son can stay at my friend's house. 

102
00:11:26,658 --> 00:11:29,240
 But at night, I'll have to pick him up. 

103
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,440
No problem.

104
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,440
I'll pack my stuff and be there right away.

105
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,278
 No rush. 

106
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,940
 I just have to go there and pick him up at 7 p.m. 

107
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,460
Okay.

108
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,780
What's his ward room number?

109
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,140
 I'll send it to you. 

110
00:11:48,478 --> 00:11:50,178
All right.

111
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,680
What's wrong?

112
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:59,419
Is your colleague sick?

113
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,560
Do you still have noodles?

114
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:11,178
I'm starving.

115
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:14,340
I just had one bite.

116
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:22,979
I'll go and make another one.

117
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:41,780
   

118
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,400
Sister-in-law.

119
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,480
I'm sorry for troubling you again.

120
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,158
How is Guan Zai?

121
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:16,219
He did a checkup this afternoon, so he's not feeling well.

122
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:17,999
He just fell asleep.

123
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:22,859
Inside the thermos is the porridge I bought for him from the hospital cafeteria.

124
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:24,259
He hasn't eaten it.

125
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:26,499
When he wakes up,

126
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:28,918
ask if he has the appetite to eat it.

127
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:30,100
Okay.

128
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,818
These are the toiletries that I bought at the grocery store downstairs.

129
00:13:33,818 --> 00:13:35,279
See if you need anything else.

130
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,660
Okay. It's enough. I brought some myself as well.

131
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,179
I'll go and pick up my son then.

132
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:49,798
- I'll come before the doctor makes rounds tomorrow. 
 - I'll see you off.

133
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:52,458
- It's fine. 
 - It's okay.

134
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:05,659
I think they are making rounds at eight in the morning.

135
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:08,598
I will come and take over before 8 a.m.

136
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:12,900
Guan Zai's younger brother is a photographer. His work is more flexible.

137
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,539
But the day before yesterday, he went overseas for work.

138
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:20,179
He can only come back after his work is done.

139
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,859
Director Hu introduced us to a doctor. We contacted him,

140
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:28,900
but it's not within his specialty.

141
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,220
Still, he helped to contact the doctor we are seeing now.

142
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,278
Please thank Director Hu for me.

143
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:40,779
Director Hu has work in Taiyuan. He'll come here right after he's done.

144
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:45,000
All right. He actually doesn't need to.

145
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,299
Oh, right. Did he ask for leave from the research institute?

146
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:53,599
Director Hu told them, but not many people know for now.

147
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:57,239
Guan Zai said he doesn't want too many visitors.

148
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,499
That's right. Right.

149
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,759
We shouldn't trouble them so much.

150
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:06,139
Tomorrow morning, he has a few checkups to do.

151
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:11,238
The results are only out on Friday or Saturday.

152
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,058
So...

153
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,920
I'm fine.

154
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:27,459
I'm sorry. You should head back.

155
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,358
I want to sit here by myself for a while.

156
00:15:54,938 --> 00:15:59,798
I asked the doctor from Xi'an and did some research.

157
00:15:59,798 --> 00:16:02,040
The recovery rate is high.

158
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,298
Besides, Guan Zai is still young.

159
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,559
He's very likely to recover.

160
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,940
I know.

161
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:19,619
I just...

162
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:23,379
I have to think of a reason

163
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:29,800
to tell my son why his father is not home again.

164
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,220
If I say his father has gone on a business trip again,

165
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,558
he'll definitely buy it.

166
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:49,359
After all, he never keeps his word.

167
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:53,219
He always lies to me.

168
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,998
Do you still feel uncomfortable?

169
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:37,720
I feel much better.

170
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,639
Do you feel like eating?

171
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,899
Drink some water?

172
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:48,159
Here.

173
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,039
Where's your sister-in-law?

174
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,760
She went to pick up your son. She is probably home now.

175
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,620
She didn't cry, did she?

176
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,418
Where is my phone?

177
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:30,559
 Are you home? 

178
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,398
 I just woke up. 

179
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:36,399
I have a math question here. I'll send you the question.

180
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:39,119
Think of a few more solutions.

181
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:44,498
Your son's homework?

182
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:45,998
Yes.

183
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:49,540
I can't think straight right now.

184
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,339
I can only think of three solutions.

185
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,879
After you're done, I'll take a picture and send it to him.

186
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,220
If he finds out that it's not your handwriting,

187
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,739
your status as his hero might be challenged.

188
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:41,999
I say you should come here less often.

189
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,119
Tomorrow, I'll ask your sister-in-law to hire a caregiver.

190
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,839
I can manage on my own too.

191
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,538
It's not easy to find a reliable caregiver.

192
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:55,039
Stop making it difficult for her.

193
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:59,800
Honestly, the recovery rate is high.

194
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,720
You have to keep reminding her of that.

195
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,820
She gets anxious easily,

196
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,539
but she listens to people.

197
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,740
She'll believe it if you keep telling her that.

198
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,179
She will feel less anxious.

199
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:34,180
   
   

200
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,118
Careful, it's hot.

201
00:21:45,118 --> 00:21:47,418
Xiao Yu, I made porridge this morning.

202
00:21:47,418 --> 00:21:49,659
If you don't mind, eat some.

203
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:51,978
This bowl here is new.

204
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:56,619
- Thank you. 
 - Stop being so courteous.

205
00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:00,480
Or Guan Zai and I are going to feel so bad.

206
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:04,538
Be careful. It's hot.

207
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:14,280
What time did you wake up?

208
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,939
You don't have to bring me any food in the future. The hospital provides meals.

209
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:22,580
I was making breakfast for our son, so I cooked up some dishes too.

210
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,780
Xiao Yu is here to take care of you at night. I have enough time.

211
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,930
Don't worry.

212
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,000
Come here.

213
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,739
All right, all right.

214
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:36,559
We'll see how is the hospital meal is today.

215
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,319
Then, we'll decide. All right?

216
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:57,540
You look much better than yesterday. I'm glad you have an appetite.

217
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:03,339
Yesterday night, I went home and looked up your illness.

218
00:23:03,339 --> 00:23:07,260
This illness of yours sounds terrifying,

219
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,778
but the recovery rate is considerably high.

220
00:23:09,778 --> 00:23:11,839
You need to be confident.

221
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:19,199
Really? Did you look it up online?

222
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:22,398
Yes, I did. I even asked the doctor.

223
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:24,199
He said the same thing, too.

224
00:23:24,199 --> 00:23:26,778
It's because you are still young,

225
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:28,598
and you have no other illness.

226
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:31,818
So you have to listen to the doctor and follow the treatment.

227
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:35,498
I'll take it that you are taking a break to stay home with me.

228
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,540
Otherwise, you spend almost half of the year outside working.

229
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,218
Now you can't.

230
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:42,858
Okay.

231
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:45,878
I feel assured now.

232
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,599
Xiao Yu, the porridge isn't filling.

233
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,018
Here, I bought two meat buns.

234
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:00,859
They are from the stall in our neighborhood. It's very good. Try it.

235
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:02,800
I'll bring them with me.

236
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,600
Here you go.

237
00:24:37,939 --> 00:24:40,519
Look. I lost ten stars.

238
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,220
   

239
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:52,339
- And you are feeling proud? 
 - There will be wins and losses.

240
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:55,279
Besides, in five of the losses, I was still the MVP.

241
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,218
 Welcome back, Yu... 

242
00:24:59,218 --> 00:25:01,079
What's with this round?

243
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,580
Shouyue. 16% damage output.

244
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,380
 Drillmaster Yu. 

245
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,759
That's the problem of the Support.

246
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,980
Look at this round. The mid kept wandering around somewhere else.

247
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,640
Our middle tower was destroyed soon after.

248
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,598
And in this round, the jungler was unpredictable.

249
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:20,918
He couldn't catch the other side's Marksman at all, and allowed the Marksman to farm.

250
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:24,899
Do we go solo or duo matchmaking?

251
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,439
I'll carry you.

252
00:25:26,439 --> 00:25:28,100
Did something good happen during your business trip?

253
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,820
I can't believe you are willing to carry me. You're so kind.

254
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,799
Where did you go for your business trip? It was so sudden.

255
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,800
Did something serious happen?

256
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:41,379
Xi'an, I can't tell you the rest. It's confidential.

257
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:43,199
You can't even tell your family?

258
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:47,739
I don't mean me.

259
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,320
I can't.

260
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:55,839
That's boring. There's no topic to talk about then.

261
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,320
Probably.

262
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,380
Let's begin.

263
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,219
I'll have breakfast first.

264
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:05,359
Did you buy meat buns for me?

265
00:26:08,439 --> 00:26:11,099
I'm raising the temperature for the floor heating.

266
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,910
 Shut down. 

267
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,799
Why are you not moving in the Base?

268
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:12,159
I didn't mean to abandon you.

269
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,418
Trust. I know.

270
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,039
 Victory! 

271
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,199
Your gaming style changed after you came back.

272
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:23,598
You are being so aggressive.

273
00:27:23,598 --> 00:27:25,559
You're not using your usual hero, either.

274
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,220
I'm changing my style. You should get used to it.

275
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,300
 Unstoppable. 

276
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,480
 An enemy has been slain. 

277
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,150
 Double kill. 

278
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,250
 Nice! 

279
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,830
 Triple Kill. 

280
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,650
 Nice! 

281
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,440
 Victory. 

282
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:52,539
We reached ten consecutive wins faster than yesterday.

283
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:58,459
You carry on. I'll go and fix the projector.

284
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,459
   

285
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:11,400
 Look. These are the stars that I've earned for you. 

286
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,120
 Try playing on your own. Don't worry about losing them. 

287
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,179
How much longer until you fix it?

288
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,660
Soon.

289
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:38,000
If it's still not fixed,

290
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,140
let's sneak into the venue to watch the final match in a few days.

291
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,400
Do you actually want to go?

292
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,220
That depends on your performance.

293
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,539
Don't drag me down.

294
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,999
I'll go matchmaking solo.

295
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:08,639
I'm getting stunned again.

296
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:10,119
Help...

297
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,030
 You have been slain. 

298
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,102
Try harder.

299
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,879
 That Luna, ran out of mana. 

300
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:24,799
 Luna, you're so weak. Let's start the next round. Hurry up. 

301
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,918
Teach that Su Lie a lesson. He keeps laughing at me.

302
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,400
We don't have enough money.

303
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:39,779
We can't teach him a lesson right now.

304
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:50,220
But we can tease him.

305
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,540
   

306
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,199
Did he think he could kill you?

307
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:05,879
But we just teased him instead.

308
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:14,759
 Money is very important. 

309
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:17,299
 Don't waste your time on unnecessary stuff. 

310
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,778
 If it was before, he wouldn't have entertained these requests. 

311
00:30:22,778 --> 00:30:25,099
 He might even have given me a lecture. 

312
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,918
 He seems different after the business trip. 

313
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:39,859
Yu Tu, can I use your phone to play these few days?

314
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,920
On the day of the match, I have to use a specific phone model.

315
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Your phone is the same model.

316
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,019
I'm thinking that I can get some practice first.

317
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:59,179
The passcode is 0424. Go and get it from the living room.

♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

326
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:09,660
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

327
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:17,000
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
 that we failed to treasure  ♫

328
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,900
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

329
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:59,960
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

330
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:07,100
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

331
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:14,180
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

332
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:21,860
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

333
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,440
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

334
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,540
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

335
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:35,800
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

336
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:42,900
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

337
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:50,100
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
 in the passing time  ♫

338
00:33:50,100 --> 00:34:00,020
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
