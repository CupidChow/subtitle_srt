1
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:15,960


2
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,350
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,210
♫  My heart is like the dust and 
couldn’t bear to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,650
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,530
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,330
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:24,990
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:40,050
   

14
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,439
Remember to take good care of yourself.

16
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,180
I don't want you to go, but you have to work, don't you?

17
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,640
Well, we have internet now...

18
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:08,080
 I am back! 

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,540
 Guys, I have explosive news. 

20
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,757
 It's about a funny story between two A-listers. 

21
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,240
 I'm in the showbiz. 

22
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,879
 We have a project at the moment with two female leads, A and B. 

23
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,319
 They never like each other, 

24
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,520
 but they have to work together because our director is famous. 

25
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,680
 Earlier on, B's boyfriend came to visit her. 

26
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,240
 He brought a huge team with him. 

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,960
 Like chefs for barbecue, for hotpot, and for wok food. 

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,118
 Even a mobile bar! Can you imagine? 

29
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,879
 And today, A's boyfriend came to visit her too. 

30
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,159
 Very low profile. 

31
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,039
 He came with an old jeep. There's no food or drinks whatsoever. 

32
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,080
 However! 

33
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,539
 Allow me to emphasize this with 80 thousand exclamation marks. 

34
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,800
 He gave us internet signals!!!!! 

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,039
 Like I said previously, 

36
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,080
 where we're shooting is so remote that the reception is horrible. 

37
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,080
 You can't even have a call properly, let alone surf the internet. 

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,479
 A's boyfriend brought a thing. I can't understand what it is anyway. 

39
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:00,199
 After a while, our signal bar became full! 

40
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,319
 I heard their team shed grateful tears. 

41
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,479
- Let me stop them. 
 - Go.

42
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,319
Hurry.

43
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,819
Jingjing!

44
00:03:07,597 --> 00:03:08,978
Jingjing!

45
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:12,773
The director asked me to bring you food for your trip back.

46
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:15,378
Thanks, Director, but I have to refuse.

47
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:17,434
Jingjing already took care of it.

48
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:18,860
Jingjing's food is her food.

49
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,980
This is from us. It's simply a token of gratitude. Take it.

50
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,258
When people come to visit, they bring food and drinks.

51
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:26,398
When my boyfriend comes to visit, he takes away food and drinks.

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,760
If this gets out...

53
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,070
Just take it, please.

54
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,055
You flatter me.

55
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:32,742
Just keep it.

56
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:35,238
All right then. Thank you.

57
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,400
Safe travel!

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,659
 And when he's about to leave, the director even gave him food for his journey. 

59
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,879
 LOL! 

60
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,360
 Do you know what this shows? 

61
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,240
 Knowledge is power. 

62
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,779
 OP, you made it way too obvious. 

63
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,219
 It's Qiao Jingjing and Zhou Xiaoqi. 

64
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:51,539
 I laughed for three minutes. What a plot development! 

65
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,057
 Zhou Xiaoqi must be fuming now. 

66
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:56,140
 Is Qiao Jingjing's boyfriend that guy from Aerospace Research Institute? 

67
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,237
 He is a gem. 

68
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,219
 ROFL! 

69
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,039
 People usually come with food and drinks. He came with internet signals. 

70
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:04,980
 Personally, I can live without barbecue and hotpot, 

71
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,447
 but I can't live without internet signals. 

72
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,580
Drive safe.

73
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,693
See you!

74
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:39,919
Jingjing.

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,426
I'm on standby now. And you?

76
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:13,146
 I'm on the bus now. 

77
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,620
- Bus? 
  - Yes. 

78
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,660
 The company organized a few buses to different destinations to send us home. 

79
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,278
You have an amazing logistics department.

80
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:26,460
By the way, you're talking to me now,

81
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,820
will your colleagues beside you think it's weird?

82
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,976
I'm in the last row.

83
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:33,260
My colleague is asleep beside me.

84
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,800
 I just want to check on the signal from your side. 

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,140
 I put my phone on low volume too. 

86
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,020
The signal is good here.

87
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,460
 It's buggy this afternoon because everyone was using the internet 

88
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,319
 but now, it's better. 

89
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,910
 What are you looking at? 

90
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,720
 That's all for today's live broadcast. 

91
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,939
 I believe you now know how to put on makeup in ancient style. 

92
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,619
Sweet dreams!

93
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,580
 Good night! 

94
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,060
Do you follow celebrity's live broadcasts?

95
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,800
About makeup?

96
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,252
Never stop learning.

97
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,160
 I don't think your colleague believed it. 

98
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,093
 He did. 

99
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,680
 Is he that guy from earlier on who believed I was a WeChat Mini Program? 

100
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:43,119
 Yes. 

101
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:49,739
 I shall inquire you about makeup tips once I get home. 

102
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:53,980
 I missed a few tricks just now. 

103
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,703
 Sure. 

104
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:31,258
 When you're back, it'll be autumn in Shanghai. 

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,883
 I'm starting to miss you again. 

106
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,500
   

107
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,939
   

108
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:46,559
Is this the engine you keep talking about?

109
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,191
Thanks to this, we got the fund from the institute.

110
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,598
Yes.

111
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,593
It's hard to explain some of the data to you on the phone.

112
00:08:53,593 --> 00:08:56,977
Here. The data is here. Have a look.

113
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,140
3,800s for specific impulse.

114
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,583
In total, 100,000 newton-second.

115
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,303
I didn't expect this from Northwestern Polytechnical University.

116
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,238
It is of excellent quality.

117
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,020
We will be more likely to succeed if we bid with it.

118
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,859
However, it only looks good on paper.

119
00:09:16,859 --> 00:09:19,299
Can we test it in real life?

120
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:23,221
We have done the experiment many times already.

121
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:30,660
Here. Check this out.

122
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,490
Okay.

123
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,900
This is the experiment regarding

124
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,380
the calibration of the propeller's igniter in a vacuum.

125
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,940
We can replay the relevant data.

126
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,677
Is there a problem?

127
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:54,308
No. Not at all.

128
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,439
These two years, you performed better than I expected.

129
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,421
Let's not pat ourselves on the back.

130
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,715
You should get off work now.

131
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:11,479
We'll discuss in detail tomorrow

132
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,040
the communication problem of the deep space probe.

133
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,558
You make a very good get-off-work alarm.

134
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,840
I promised your wife to look after you.

135
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,504
No overtime for you these two years.

136
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,104
I will leave with you today.

137
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:30,494
You, a workaholic, will get off work together with me?

138
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,865
Your "Dear Princess" must be in Shanghai now.

139
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:36,822
She finished shooting.

140
00:10:36,822 --> 00:10:39,155
Someone won't be lonely any longer.

141
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:41,660
When you're free, bring your Dear Princess to dine with us.

142
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,939
My wife misses her a lot.

143
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:46,840
Sure. She should be free this time.

144
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,439
Just a reminder.

145
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:53,703
Dear Princess doesn't like to be called a princess.

146
00:10:53,703 --> 00:10:57,105
If you do that, she'll be angry.

147
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:59,560
I'm not afraid of her.

148
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,759
She'll be angry at me!

149
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,060
Don't assume you're safe.

150
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,159
She will complain to your wife, too.

151
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,039
How old are you two again?

152
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,021
I don't miss him at all.

153
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,519
Come on. Don't lie.

154
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,459
Teacher Yu can't skip work to see you.

155
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,118
But I bet he sure wants to!

156
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:37,520
I highly doubt it.

157
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,419
His best friend is now back in the office. I bet he's having the time of his life now.

158
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:43,308
Why would he miss me?

159
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:46,979
So where should we go then?

160
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,459
To his place.

161
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,300
I worked overnight to finish shooting. I'm exhausted.

162
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,740
I also have an early flight tomorrow.

163
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,221
I want somewhere close to the airport so that I can catch some sleep.

164
00:11:57,221 --> 00:12:00,500
No need to explain so much. I totally understand.

165
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,213
Traffic matters.

166
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:18,039
When you're in a relationship, you actually look like a person.

167
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,849
Right now it's because she likes it.

168
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:24,486
We'll see in the future.

169
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:27,220
Are you saying that you'll get married first,

170
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,240
then show your true self?

171
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,140
That's called lying.

172
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,842
You're exaggerating.

173
00:12:32,842 --> 00:12:34,021
She's a celebrity.

174
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:38,018
She spent in total one month and ten days in Shanghai this year.

175
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,740
Who's lying to who now?

176
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,240
It's open to debate.

177
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,081
More kisses, please.

178
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,600
Let me get changed, and I'll be with you.

179
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,919
I didn't sleep well yesterday so I want to catch some sleep.

180
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,369
What are you staring at?

181
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,040
I haven't seen you take off your clothes in a long time.

182
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,740
Didn't you say you wanted to catch some sleep?

183
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,059
You're a busy guy. Where does the muscle come from?

184
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:58,720
Working in a lab is hard labor.

185
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,378
How long is your break?

186
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,439
I'll leave when you leave for work tomorrow.

187
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:47,479
Didn't you say your break would be more than two months long?

188
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,120
The shooting has been extended.

189
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,180
And then, I suddenly have several jobs that I can't say no to.

190
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:53,159
Sister Ling. It's me.

191
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:04,679
My body clock is a mess now.

192
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,089
You woke up.

193
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,725
I made you dinner.

194
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,898
How do you know I want to have rice porridge?

195
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:41,517
Are you not eating?

196
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,159
I already ate.

197
00:17:56,713 --> 00:17:59,600
 Why is he so cold? 

198
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,700
 Usually, if I have to leave the next day, 

199
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,739
 he will spend as much time as possible with me, 

200
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:07,597
 or prepare to spend as much time as possible with me. 

201
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,120
 Is he angry? 

202
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,557
 Seriously? 

203
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,440
 He stood me up before too. 

204
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:34,640
Is it because I'm too disheveled?

205
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,837
I brushed my teeth and washed my face. You can go now.

206
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,699
I already did them in the bathroom outside.

207
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,459
Are you going to sleep now then?

208
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:05,820
I was working overtime earlier on. I want to sleep early.

209
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,740
You should sleep early too and fix your body clock.

210
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:36,279
 Is he really angry at me? 

211
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,060
When you were sleeping, Sister Ling called you.

212
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,740
I answered it.

213
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,491
Don't you owe me an explanation?

214
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,900
I... You know, there's something called couple pranks.

215
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,319
Also, it's not a lie.

216
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,260
I said I had to leave in the morning, but I didn't say I wouldn't come back at night.

217
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,590
I had a really busy day.

218
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,840
I wanted to get something from Lujiazui to decorate this place and give you a surprise.

219
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,520
I...

220
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:46,379
Whatever.

221
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,820
I don't want to nag you.

222
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,760
I'm sorry. I really wanted to give you a surprise.

223
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,847
Was I surprised then?

224
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,680
Yu Tu!

225
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,238
No, you weren't surprised.

226
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,498
Exactly how long is your break?

227
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:18,379
Two months.

228
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:20,540
Are you telling the truth?

229
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,240
Yes.

230
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,740
When you came back, did you notice some changes in the house?

231
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,438
No.

232
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,999
When I came back, I went to sleep straight away.

233
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:42,359
I redid the storage room.

234
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,262
I'll show you tomorrow morning.

235
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,519
I want to see it now.

236
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,039
When you told me you had a two-month break,

237
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:13,799
I thought you'd most probably live with me here.

238
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,797
But knowing my dear Jingjing, who likes to dress up,

239
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,240
I need a space for your clothes and shoes.

240
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,139
So you made your storage room into a wardrobe.

241
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,195
The control panel is here.

242
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,336
I shouldn't have played a prank on you.

243
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,850
Thank you for this gift.

244
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,319
This is not a gift.

245
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,739
At most, this is...

246
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,084
Love nest building.

247
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:13,119
Don't sleep during the day. Fix your sleep schedule.

248
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,021
But you won't let me sleep properly at night.

249
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,640
You're not wrong.

250
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,179
Catch some sleep during the day then.

251
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:24,859
Is this how it is then?

252
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:28,640
You want to sacrifice my body clock for the sake of your happiness?

253
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:30,960
Are you sure it's just mine?

254
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,219
You're late. Go now!

255
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,039
   

256
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,908
 Teacher Yu redid his place for me. 

257
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,056
 Do you girls want to see it? 

258
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,340
   
 My boyfriend redid his place for me. 

259
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,523
 Do you want to see it? 

260
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,759
   
 Sure, I need to bring you clothes too. 

261
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,981
 - I already packed them up. 
 - Great, I need to talk to you too. 

262
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:25,680
 Go away! I have tons of shooting to do. 

263
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:45,100
   

264
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,120
Miss Qiao. I'm still in the area.

265
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,640
Don't you think you're a bit too clingy?

266
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,799
 Yes, I am. I miss you already. 

267
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,878
 Hurry up and come back. 

268
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,198
The Chinese aerospace needs me.

269
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,357
Please bear with it for another few hours.

270
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,340
Then ten hours maximum.

271
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,042
That's long.

272
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,920
However, I can't stand without you for this long.

273
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,759
 I won't work overtime today. 

274
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,079
Come on. It's my first day back in Shanghai. No overtime?

275
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,279
 Don't lie to me. I know you too well. 

276
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,659
 What colors do you like? 

277
00:25:29,659 --> 00:25:32,818
Blue? Green? Or perhaps a warm palette?

278
00:25:32,818 --> 00:25:34,000
 I have enough clothes. 

279
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,759
And green is unorthodox at best.

280
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,780
 I didn't say it was for clothes. 

281
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,441
Also, if I ever buy clothes for you, I won't consult your opinion.

282
00:25:41,441 --> 00:25:43,869
 You're overthinking this. 

283
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:45,120
You're right.

284
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,325
The interior design of your house is so dark.

285
00:25:48,325 --> 00:25:53,920
And so, I want to buy some pillows or vases to decorate it a bit.

286
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,800
You'll build the nest and I'll decorate it.

287
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,220
My house?

288
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,701
Our house.

289
00:26:02,703 --> 00:26:04,076
 Whatever floats your boat. 

290
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:05,758
 I do have pillows. 

291
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,359
 They are in the guest room. Go have a look. 

292
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,661
So... Wait for me to come home.

293
00:26:12,661 --> 00:26:14,500
 Okay. I'll wait for you. 

294
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,962
And now, I'm in front of my office.

295
00:26:35,964 --> 00:26:37,079
Don't flatter yourself, please.

296
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:38,840
I just want to know why

297
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,900
you put all your trophies and certificates in boxes.

298
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:44,140
 Most of them are from when you were still a student. 

299
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,955
 You brought them to Shanghai? 

300
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,760
My mom sent them to Shanghai.

301
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,120
 They are old. No need to display them. 

302
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,275
 What if we have guests and they think they're our kid's? 

303
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:58,060
You have quite the imagination.

304
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,720
 Also, if we have kids, we can't show them that. 

305
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,999
 I don't want to stress my kids. 

306
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,239
How do you know?

307
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:08,720
What if our kid is smarter than you?

308
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,119
He might even surpass you.

309
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,505
We have to work hard then.

310
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:16,427
Curb your imagination.

311
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:20,080
So I will randomly pick a certificate you got after you started working

312
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,130
and put it next to my Best Actress trophy.

313
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:24,160
I'm honored.

314
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,358
 All right. Go work. 

315
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,181
 I promise that I won't call you again today to bother you. 

316
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,600
 Bye! 

317
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:42,360
   

318
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,660
Yu Tu.

319
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,090
Come to my office.

320
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,520
I need your input for something.

321
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:18,440
 - Jingjing! Open the door, please. 
 - Jingjing! Hurry! 

322
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,479
Welcome!

323
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:23,559
Stop playing games. Where should I put this? It's heavy.

324
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,962
By the entrance. The wardrobe is too small for these boxes.

325
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:31,060
We have two more boxes. I'll take care of them.

326
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,384
- I'll go now. 
 - Okay.

327
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,399
The last time I came here, Teacher Yu's collection of books scared me.

328
00:28:42,196 --> 00:28:45,840
I was wondering. Teacher Yu has so many books here.

329
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,958
When you guys are together, is he also buried in books and just neglects you?

330
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,440
Don't look down on him.

331
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,338
He has to write his thesis, find references... etc. He uses his computer too.

332
00:28:58,338 --> 00:29:01,920
You're saying that he looks at his computer and not you.

333
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,979
Stop nitpicking!

334
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:07,098
Will he be back for lunch?

335
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:08,539
No.

336
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,198
He works from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

337
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,360
His lunch break is very short. It's not worth the effort.

338
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,117
So if you work in the aerospace,

339
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:19,479
without overtime, you finish your work quite early.

340
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:22,437
But Mr. Yu only gets a few days without overtime per year.

341
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,600
- That's rough. 
 - Where should I put this?

342
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,680
- Here, beside them. 
 - I'll put it here.

343
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,359
Thank you.

344
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,560
If there's nothing else, I'll leave then.

345
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,212
- Thank you. 
 - Okay. Thank you.

346
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,879
Anyway, Teacher Yu already has a lot of books.

347
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:40,559
You asked Xiao Zhu to pack up so many clothes.

348
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,576
There's not enough space.

349
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,000
Check out the wardrobe Mr. Yu made for me.

350
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,984
I'll have a look then.

351
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,759
So pretty!

352
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:57,150
A black closet with a glass door.

353
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,483
I love it.

354
00:29:58,485 --> 00:30:01,072
The appearance doesn't matter. It's the function that counts.

355
00:30:01,074 --> 00:30:02,630
Teacher Yu worried that it was not big enough for my clothes,

356
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,600
so he made me a double-layer rotating closet.

357
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,320
Check it out. 
     

358
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,919
   

359
00:30:14,699 --> 00:30:16,599
This is interesting.

360
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:19,960
But isn't this the same as your closet in Lujiazui?

361
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,121
It's not the same!

362
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:24,979
The one Jingjing has is heavy and noisy.

363
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:26,720
This one is so quiet.

364
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,790
Also, it's quite fast.

365
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,540
Now that you mentioned it, I see it now.

366
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,401
Where did Teacher Yu order this from?

367
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:38,939
Give me the number so that I can modify my own closet too.

368
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:40,739
The closet itself is made to order. I can give you the number.

369
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:42,621
However, there's no number for the rotating system.

370
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:44,399
Teacher Yu installed it himself.

371
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,668
For real?

372
00:30:46,668 --> 00:30:48,161
Does he know how to design a system like that?

373
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:50,399
It's not that difficult, right?

374
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,614
He and his team design spacecraft.

375
00:30:52,614 --> 00:30:55,599
He wanted to buy a closet like this, but when he checked the market,

376
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:59,319
closets with this kind of function were so expensive and heavy.

377
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:01,359
So he came back and drew a blueprint.

378
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,599
To be able to design this alone is impressive.

379
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,798
But to design it because the current product is too expensive

380
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,918
and telling you that as if it were like child's play,

381
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,822
I have no words for Teacher Yu.

382
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,020
Aren't you supposed to praise me instead?

383
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,130
He did this because of me.

384
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,860
Yes, yes.

385
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,317
You even brought your coats.

386
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,160
Are you going to stay here these two months?

387
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,381
Yes.

388
00:31:31,381 --> 00:31:33,124
It's more convenient for his work.

389
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:35,886
I don't go out anyway. I don't mind living anywhere.

390
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:39,359
Honestly, Teacher Yu's place is quite cozy.

391
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,114
It's not huge, but the layout is good.

392
00:31:41,114 --> 00:31:42,392
So spacious.

393
00:31:42,392 --> 00:31:45,119
If he doesn't marry you, then it will be big enough.

394
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,840
It will be big enough for us two, okay?

395
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:50,839
How much does this house cost?

396
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,718
It's beyond the Outer Ring Expressway. 40 to 50 thousand yuan perhaps?

397
00:31:53,718 --> 00:31:56,823
He bought it early. It was around 20 thousand yuan.

398
00:31:56,823 --> 00:31:59,946
He borrowed some money from his parents but he has now paid them back.

399
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:01,236
He took a mortgage loan?

400
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:04,198
Back then, he just started working. He had no money.

401
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,339
He still has 20-something years for his mortgage.

402
00:32:06,339 --> 00:32:08,018
Every month, he pays around ten thousand yuan.

403
00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:11,352
However, he eats at this office canteen and he doesn't need to commute.

404
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,438
Other than books, he doesn't spend his money.

405
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,399
As long as he's healthy, there's not much financial pressure.

406
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,483
Why are you staring at me like this?

407
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:24,958
I've just gotten a bit sentimental.

408
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,241
Our celebrity who used to splurge on jewelry and luxurious goods as if they cost nothing.

409
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:33,220
And today, you're folding clothes while telling me

410
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,170
he pays around ten thousand yuan per month for his mortgage.

411
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:39,480
You know what? I did the laundry this morning too.

412
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:46,200
Somehow, I feel reassured.

413
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,739
You're getting old.

414
00:32:48,739 --> 00:32:52,180
Even my mom isn't as sentimental as you.

415
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,918
Hang this up.

416
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:57,191
I hate you.

417
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:26,430


418
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:33,530
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

419
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:40,650
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

420
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:47,810
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

421
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:55,490
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

422
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,970
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

423
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,190
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

424
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:09,250
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

425
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:16,410
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

426
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:23,650
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

427
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:31,250
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

428
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:06,510
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

429
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:13,850
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

430
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:20,830
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

431
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:28,510
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

432
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:31,190
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

433
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,190
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

434
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:42,450
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

435
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:49,550
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

436
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:56,750
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

437
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:06,890
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
