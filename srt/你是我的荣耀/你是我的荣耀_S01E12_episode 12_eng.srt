1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:17,050


2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,300
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,260
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:36,900
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,600
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,500
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,940
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:00,580
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:08,180
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:15,940
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:28,200
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:40,100
   

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,980
   

15
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:54,599
 Well... Yu Tu, 

16
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:58,319
can I use your phone to play these few days?

17
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,620
On the day of the match, I have to use a specific phone model.

18
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,760
Your phone is the same model.

19
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,279
I'm thinking that I can get some practice first.

20
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,000
The passcode is 0424.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,920
Go and get it from the living room.

22
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,659
Yu Tu, did you join our high school classmates' group chat?

23
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,159
Yes.

24
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,119
I didn't.

25
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:42,559
I'm very curious about what our classmates are doing.

26
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:46,800
Can I use your WeChat to check their Moments?

27
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,420
Moments are for friends to see.

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,860
You're their classmate, too.

29
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,199
I'll use your WeChat.

30
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:57,319
Sure.

31
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,700
   

32
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,999
   

33
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,620
   

34
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,639
All our classmates?

35
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:51,699
Yes.

36
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,579
 He doesn't get my point at all. 

37
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:58,539
 Forget it. It's good if he doesn't get it, either. 

38
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,539
I won.

39
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:06,299
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I haven't even mocked the opponent's Su Lie yet.

40
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,819
I'll give a thumbs up to my team.

41
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,919
I played so badly earlier, and they didn't complain about me.

42
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:27,600
All right.

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,519
Courtesy demands reciprocity. I'll help you win one round, too.

44
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,859
I think you should just check WeChat Moments.

45
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,440
I was joking. I don't want to check it.

46
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,599
What's the matter? Don't you believe that I can win?

47
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:43,760
Do whatever you want.

48
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,639
I'll do that and help you win.

49
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:54,679
Xiao Zhu is calling you.

50
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:57,139
Help me answer it.

51
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,979
 Hey, Jingjing. 

52
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,359
 A brand sent you a birthday gift and three big boxes. 

53
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:05,180
 I'll tell the driver to bring them up. 

54
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,879
Wait.

55
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,899
It's not convenient for the driver to come up. Can you help me bring them up?

56
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,780
Thank you, Teacher Yu.

57
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,179
Which brand sent me a birthday gift so far in advance?

58
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:22,079
The one you're endorsing. They send them to you in advance each year.

59
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,160
All of these?

60
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,299
These three boxes aren't from them.

61
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:27,920
These are the clothes, bags, shoes, and stuff that you bought last time.

62
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,020
They arrived at the same time.

63
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:34,239
You can mix and match them for the match.

64
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,100
Didn't you tell me that a brand gave me a gift?

65
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,700
It's this one.

66
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,119
I'll do it. It's a bit heavy.

67
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you.

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,119
It's so heavy.

69
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,399
Jingjing, do you want to see what the brand gave you?

70
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,720
Just leave it there.

71
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,860
I'll place it in the closet then.

72
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,639
Should I move these to the closet?

73
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,320
No, there's no need. My closet is very messy.

74
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Actually, I don't usually buy so many clothes.

75
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,519
Jingjing.

76
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,399
There are too many clothes in your closet.

77
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,160
I'll take out and organize all the clothes that aren't suitable for you anymore.

78
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,320
Many of them still have the tags on.

79
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,980
Just like before, I'll distribute it to everyone. I'll give some to Sister Peipei.

80
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,440
 Who taught you such an exaggerated acting technique? 

81
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:48,719
That's quite good.

82
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:55,099
Do you mean it?

83
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,360
Yes.

84
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,640
I still have some work these days. I must leave around 6 p.m.

85
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,340
What time is it now?

86
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,319
Do you have to leave now?

87
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,079
What about dinner? Won't you eat anymore?

88
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,339
Xiao Zhu already brought the food.

89
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,540
I'll take the food today.

90
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,759
Starting tomorrow, you don't need to bring me dinner anymore.

91
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:27,559
Then you won't finish watching Saturday's final match?

92
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:31,160
The official match starts at around 5 p.m.

93
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:38,459
I'll let them know first, and I'll finish watching it before leaving.

94
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,640
But I might arrive later in the morning.

95
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,739
Okay. See you tomorrow then.

96
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:46,339
See you tomorrow.

97
00:07:49,299 --> 00:07:52,399
But tomorrow, don't bring me meat buns.

98
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,200
Xiao Zhu.

99
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Can your EQ be any lower?

100
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,300
If you say those things, and Teacher Yu misunderstands me

101
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,900
as a spoiled girl who doesn't spend money wisely, what should I do?

102
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,800
I think that's not a misunderstanding.

103
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,000
How am I that way? I work so hard.

104
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,600
I work until so late at night and even hang on wires.

105
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,700
How am I spoiled?

106
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,800
Besides, didn't I buy these clothes, bags, and shoes for work?

107
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,200
Even if I don't wear them, I give them away.

108
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
I didn't let them go to waste.

109
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,600
However,

110
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,400
Teacher Yu said that it was quite good.

111
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,000
Through my beautiful and dazzling performance,

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
he must have seen my beautiful, dazzling, and simple heart.

113
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,000
Right. Teacher Yu must know that you have a simple heart.

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
I think so, too.

115
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
This one is nice.

116
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,800
I can wear this during the match, right?

117
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,500
Try it on.

118
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,000
And this one is really nice too.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,400
No. This one. This one.

120
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,600
This one's nice.

121
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,800
That one's nice too. Take a look.

122
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,200
 You're right, this one's nice. 

123
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,400
   

124
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,400
How would I dare to fool you? I really told Yu Tu already.

125
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,000
He's here. Ask him if he has a girlfriend already.

126
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,800
Who says that I didn't work hard to recommend your junior? 
  (T/N: recommend as in marketing/selling something) 

127
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,300
Not to recommend, it's to introduce.

128
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,600
It has only been a while since you went to my house for a meal.

129
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,000
Do you have a girlfriend already?

130
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,400
Yes, I do.

131
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,700
Is that so? What does she look like?

132
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,600
Do you have a photo?

133
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,000
A photo.

134
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,400
It's fine if you don't have one. It's fine if you don't like my junior.

135
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,800
Why can't you just be open about it?

136
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,400
Look at you. Your joke went too far.

137
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,200
You even said that she liked you.

138
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,000
But you can't even show us a photo.

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,800
I don't have time for you two.

140
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm going to pick up our kid.

141
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
I'll see her off.

142
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,000
I was intentionally joking with Guan Zai just now.

143
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,100
Don't take it to heart.

144
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,600
He's not feeling well today.

145
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,900
I wanted to distract him.

146
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,600
On the other hand,

147
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,100
I didn't want to let him feel that I'm under a lot of pressure.

148
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,800
I wanted him to relax a bit.

149
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,300
I understand.

150
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,400
Actually, I won't introduce my junior to you.

151
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,600
What if she ends up hating me later on?

152
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,200
You and Guan Zai are the same.

153
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,900
I don't see him all day.

154
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,000
He just keeps working and working.

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,100
I remember the longest he wasn't home was for half a year.

156
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,600
For the remaining half, he was working overtime every day.

157
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,200
He didn't have time for family at all.

158
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,000
You should go back to the ward.

159
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'll see you off.

160
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,700
No need. Go on.

161
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,700
Senior brother. I'm really sorry.

162
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,400
I hope I didn't waste your time.

163
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,600
 It's fine. 

164
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,400
 There are always many people who want to work in our industry. 

165
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,800
 It's good as long as you've thought about it carefully. 

166
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,400
 However, have you resolved the reason 

167
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,600
 of why you wanted to resign before? 

168
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,000
What are you looking at?

169
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,400
For the work that can be handled over the phone, I must provide instructions.

170
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
It's not convenient if my wife is around.

171
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,300
Keep this a secret for me.

172
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,100
- Fifteen minutes. 
 - That's enough.

173
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,500
There actually isn't a lot that can be handled over the phone.

174
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,800
That's enough.

175
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,300
I'll heat up some food.

176
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,400
What did you have for dinner?

177
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,800
I had some porridge.

178
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,600
Do you bring your own food now?

179
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,000
   

180
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,800
 Where did you go for your business trip? It was so sudden. 

181
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,200
 Xi'an, I can't tell you anything else. It's confidential. 

182
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
 Can't you even tell your family? 

183
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,800
 I can't. 

184
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,700
 How boring. There's no topic to talk about then. 

185
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,400
 You and Guan Zai are the same. 

186
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,200
 I don't see him all day. 

187
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,200
 He just keeps working and working. 

188
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,300
 He doesn't have time for family at all. 

189
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,000
 You're only thinking about your ambition. 

190
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,900
 You shouldn't delay people. 

191
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,800
Xiao Yu, your colleague suddenly vomited.

192
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,200
He suddenly vomited.

193
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,200
Here. Slowly.

194
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Go, ring the bell. Ring the bell.

195
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,400
   

196
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,600
 Based on his condition, 

197
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,200
the patient's stomach has obvious changes. 
    

198
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,400
We can confirm that it's cancer.

199
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,800
But it was discovered early, and it hasn't metastasized to other organs.

200
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
He kept feeling dizzy before.

201
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,600
Is it related to the cancer?

202
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,200
Dizziness has nothing to do with stomach cancer.

203
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,800
And his brain exam results don't indicate any illness.

204
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,200
His dizziness should be related to

205
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,600
over exhaustion and too much stress.

206
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,600
But we should be thankful for his dizziness.

207
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,400
Because of it, the patient was able to discover this cancer early.

208
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,600
After he becomes stable,

209
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,400
undergo surgery as soon as possible.

210
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,400
I'm fine.

211
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,800
Back in Xi'an, I kept thinking if the hospital misdiagnosed him.

212
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,600
Now that it's confirmed, I'm not thinking much about it anymore.

213
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,000
Just treat the illness.

214
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Didn't the doctor also say that it was discovered early?

215
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
Just treat the illness.

216
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,560
Director Hu. Mrs. Hu.

217
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,159
In the past couple of days, he has been lethargic.

218
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:40,400
How about you go home first?

219
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,499
After he wakes up, I'll tell him that you came by.

220
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,970
Okay. We won't disturb you then.

221
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,910
We'll come by during the weekend.

222
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,479
Before coming, I'll call you.

223
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:53,280
There's no need to go through such trouble. You need to travel far to come here as well.

224
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,279
How can it be troublesome?

225
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,280
We must go out anyway.

226
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:02,420
On the weekend, I'll make him some clear soup and bring it over.

227
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,679
Thank you, Mrs. Hu.

228
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,360
We'll go ahead then.

229
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,280
- I'll see you off. 
 - There's no need.

230
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,359
Stay with him.

231
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,400
Xiao Yu. Go home, too.

232
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,280
You weren't able to rest well in the past couple of days.

233
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,900
Guan Zhu called me saying that he'd be back soon.

234
00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:22,930
   

235
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,880
It's hard on Xiao Shen too.

236
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,119
She's alone, and she has to take care of her child, and she must take care of Guan Zai.

237
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,280
Before, she was such a beautiful and neat girl.

238
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,979
Now, she looks so haggard.

239
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,819
I remember how we were back then.

240
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:44,880
You didn't have time for family as well.

241
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,579
When I gave birth, you almost didn't make it home.

242
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:52,680
Telephones weren't so common back then.

243
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,519
All right. I'll stop.

244
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,420
It's all in the past now.

245
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:06,160
Xiao Yu. If Xiao Shen needs any help, you must tell me.

246
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,040
Guan Zai doesn't want to tell others.

247
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,320
Otherwise, our office could have made some arrangements.

248
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:20,119
The two of them aren't willing to trouble others.

249
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,259
Tell me. Guan Zai is such a nice person.

250
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:30,219
How can he get this kind of illness?

251
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,859
He'll recover.

252
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,360
Xiao Yu.

253
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,640
We need to hide this from Director Zhang.

254
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,359
His health is not in a good condition.

255
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:45,480
You and Guan Zai are the students he cares about the most.

256
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,740
Guan Zai is sick now. I'm afraid that he won't be able to handle it.

257
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:56,319
Director Hu, I want to apply for an extended vacation.

258
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,559
An extended vacation?

259
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,199
Yes.

260
00:19:01,199 --> 00:19:03,520
I've accumulated a lot of vacation leave before.

261
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,580
I don't know if they can be used.

262
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,280
You mean...

263
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:11,640
Regarding the investment bank...

264
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,920
I've already turned down their offer.

265
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,300
We must still carefully consider certain things.

266
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,359
Your professor and Guan Zai aren't your responsibility.

267
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:27,960
So don't keep feeling responsible for a lot of things.

268
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,680
And don't change your decisions because of others.

269
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,899
It has nothing to do with others.

270
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:38,220
When I went to Xi'an to save JX, I thought that I should stay here.

271
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,460
That's good. I'll handle the extended vacation.

272
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,820
For how long?

273
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,739
One week.

274
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:56,839
Aside from Guan Zai, there are other things I need to do as well.

275
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:02,479
I promised a friend that I'd do something, and I haven't completed it yet.

276
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:30,240
I worked so hard to get this vote. Who should I vote for?

277
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,000
Who did you vote for?

278
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,560
I haven't voted yet.

279
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,600
Help me vote for Luo Shen.

280
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:44,499
You really want to vote for Luo Shen?

281
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:48,400
Luo Shen was the champion for the spring season. He has a lot of experience too.

282
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,700
But Snow's condition is very good too.

283
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,400
If you want to win, vote for Luo Shen. The chances are higher.

284
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,520
If you want to support your idol, vote for Heavenly Palace.

285
00:21:00,019 --> 00:21:02,180
What if we make a bet?

286
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,319
Whoever bets on the losing team will agree to one request.

287
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,859
This will make it more fun.

288
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,040
Sure.

289
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:17,540
I think the match has begun. Get your own juice.

290
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:23,640
 Right. Heavenly Palace is in very good condition now. And Cai Wenji too. 

291
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,680
 - They can't be guarded against. 
 - And once the soldiers come in... 

292
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,619
 12 minutes and 22 seconds. A tank can hold off well in a head-on battle. 

293
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:30,199
 Guard the nexus. Bring the soldiers in. 

294
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:32,119
 - They're in. 
 - Twelve minutes and 25 seconds. 

295
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,439
 - Congratulations, Luo Shen! 
 - Luo Shen! 

296
00:21:33,439 --> 00:21:35,860
 He won at 1:0. 

297
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,780
Just now, Luo Shen's nexus was almost destroyed.

298
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,839
 Just circle around the back. 

299
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,599
 - Ghost Valley Kings are in. 
 - Get three. 

300
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,359
 Push back. Got the fourth one. 

301
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:52,079
 This team fight is so good. 

302
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,279
 Instant kill. 

303
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,300
He's catching up. Twelve minutes.

304
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,760
Look. I told you. Heavenly Palace's Team is incredible.

305
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,960
Their rhythm in this round is very good.

306
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,180
Snow is really amazing.

307
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,340
I would have died 100 times already if it were me.

308
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,199
 You can't kill him head-on. 

309
00:22:25,199 --> 00:22:26,880
 He got him. 

310
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,960
 Snow got killed. 

311
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,840
Luo Shen is still very stable.

312
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,640
What do you...

313
00:22:55,739 --> 00:23:00,399
Why does a guy have such nice eyelashes?

314
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,300
What have you been busy with lately?

315
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,239
Didn't you say that you were resigning from the Research Institute?

316
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,739
You have such dark circles under your eyes.

317
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,820
You can even fall asleep while watching such an intense game.

318
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,200
It's not easy to edit the photo from this angle.

319
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,959
 He didn't wake up from that? 

320
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:38,280
 I'm that light after all. 

321
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:42,880
 Quietly. Quietly get up. 

322
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,319
I...

323
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,500
What were you trying to reach?

324
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:26,839
An orange?

325
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:46,219
Who won?

326
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,460
Take a guess.

327
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:59,859
I'm guessing that you lost.

328
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:03,419
Yes, I lost.

329
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,660
Make a request then.

330
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:23,860
Your birthday is at the end of the month. What gift do you want?

331
00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:29,180
You're the one who should make a request. That was our bet.

332
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,199
The request for our bet is to tell me what gift you want.

333
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,180
I won't be shy then.

334
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,080
Don't be shy.

335
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:50,219
This is too sudden. I'll tell you after I think about it.

336
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,839
 Teacher Yu is such a dense guy. 

337
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,880
 Who asks people what gift they want? 

338
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,159
 Shouldn't he suddenly take it out as a surprise? 

339
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:05,859
The final match is over.

340
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:08,879
The awarding ceremony will be in a few days.

341
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,379
Have you decided which professional players you'll choose as your teammates?

342
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,339
I'm still thinking about the gift.

343
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:19,519
Any suggestions?

344
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,200
First choice, Heavenly Palace, Zhou Yin.

345
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,619
Heavenly Palace may have lost to Luo Shen in the final match,

346
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:33,399
but as a team leader, he's a rare all-around player in the match.

347
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:35,800
I thought you'd recommend Luo Shen's team.

348
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:41,140
Luo Shen may be very competent, but their strongest point is in their overall coordination.

349
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,580
Okay. I quite like Zhou Yin too.

350
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,479
Zhou Yin is quite handsome.

351
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:50,099
He's only 19 years old.

352
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:52,219
Do you even know his age?

353
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,420
Pay attention to Zhou Yin's way of playing.

354
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:00,239
Do you see anything?

355
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:02,719
What?

356
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,020
While training with you in the past few days, I've been imitating Zhou Yin.

357
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,560
The heroes he often uses, his habit in playing, his behavior.

358
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,340
During the match, you'll be more familiar and more easily coordinate with him.

359
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:24,100
You were imitating him to familiarize me with his way of playing and practice coordinating with him?

360
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:28,199
I even imitated Snow.

361
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:29,999
You didn't notice?

362
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,720
I know what I want for my birthday gift now.

363
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:49,400
Give me a Penta Kill.

364
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,560
Until now, I haven't gotten a Penta Kill yet.

365
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,160
But I want you to give it to me, not them.

366
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,199
So you don't need to imitate their way of playing.

367
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:59,040
Because I like coordinating with you more.

368
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,019
Why are you laughing?

369
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:05,779
Nothing.

370
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:08,720
I just think that it's hard work.

371
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,160
Don't think I can't tell that you're laughing at me.

372
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,219
I was just unlucky. That's why until now, I haven't gotten a Penta Kill yet.

373
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:18,480
Let's begin then.

374
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,099
Play alone first. Drop 30 stars.

375
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,379
Your level is too high now.

376
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:31,899
I can't afford a 50-star Penta Kill.

377
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:33,720
I don't care.

378
00:29:37,379 --> 00:29:38,879
Oh, right.

379
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,480
These are the tickets to the awarding ceremony.

380
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,540
Bring So Panicky with you.

381
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,979
But please get a good sleep first.

382
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:53,559
Don't fall asleep again halfway through the ceremony.

383
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:00,719
Bring So Panicky?

384
00:30:00,719 --> 00:30:05,040
Then you can tell him that the most competent...

385
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,739
The most beautiful person on stage is Hand-picked Cotton.

386
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:37,060
   

387
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:46,239
 I promised a friend that I'd do something, and I haven't completed it yet. 

388
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,659
 Then you can keep teaching me until the match. 

389
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:52,339
 Yes. 

390
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:23,970


391
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:33,180
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

392
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:40,400
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

393
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:47,460
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

394
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:55,140
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

395
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,620
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

396
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,800
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

397
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:09,000
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

398
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,060
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

399
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:23,400
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
 that we failed to treasure  ♫

400
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:31,700
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

401
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:06,360
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

402
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:13,500
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

403
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:20,580
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

404
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:28,260
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

405
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,840
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

406
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,840
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

407
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:42,100
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

408
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:49,300
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

409
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:56,500
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and 
 autumn in the passing time  ♫

410
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:07,120
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
