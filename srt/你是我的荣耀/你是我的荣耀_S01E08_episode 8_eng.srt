1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,000


2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,400
♫  You crossed the sea of stars, bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,200
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,800
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,700
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,500
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,800
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,600
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:16,000
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:28,600
♫  I’ve fallen for you, but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:40,100
   

14
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,980
   

15
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
- Hello? 
  - Jingjing, 

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,200
 I texted you on WeChat about Director Li changing his itinerary. 

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,800
 He'll return to Beijing in the evening. 

18
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,000
 So we'll meet this afternoon instead. Have you read it? 

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No, I haven't. What time is it again?

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,200
 Half past three. 

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,600
 I, the makeup artist, and the stylist are downstairs. We're coming right up. 

22
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,800
Did you bring the make-up artist and stylist, too?

23
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,200
 We don't have much time. It will be faster if they help you. 

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,600
 We happened to be at the office this afternoon discussing some work, 

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,800
 so I brought them over. 

26
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,400
 I forgot. Is Teacher Yu with you? 

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,200
Of course he is.

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,600
You knew, and you brought so many people over.

29
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,820
 Figure something out. 

30
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,400
 We're already in the elevator. 

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Tell them that I'm here to fix appliances.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,200
Aren't you too handsome for that?

33
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,400
That's true.

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,700
What if you close the door after you go out?

35
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Well... The make-up artist and stylist are from a team we outsourced.

36
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
So...

37
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,000
Actually, Sister Ling has long wanted to meet you.

38
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,600
- Go. 
 - Okay.

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,200
I'm coming.

40
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,800
We're coming in.

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,600
Come in.

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,600
Should we do it in the living room?

43
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,000
No. Let's do it... Let's do it on the balcony.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
The natural lighting would be better.

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Okay, go in first and set things up.

46
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,500
Okay.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
Where did you hide Teacher Yu?

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
I'm very curious now.

49
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,100
Exactly how handsome is he?

50
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,000
Xiao Zhu is full of compliments for him.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,400
How about this?

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll go in and say hi in secret.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,600
Don't do it in secret. He'll feel shy.

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,000
   

55
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,400
 Come on. We will be late. 

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,800
 I'll get going. Wait for me to come back. 

57
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,300
 Okay. 

58
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,700
Slowly.

59
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,000
Sister Sha said that they asked Duan Wu and his manager to come along.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,400
Don't be nervous later.

61
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,800
Director Li usually doesn't give out scripts. He just wants to chat.

62
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,200
A big-shot director has his own way of checking out people.

63
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,400
I heard about that.

64
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,500
If he's willing to meet you,

65
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,900
that means he feels you have something in you that's suitable for the role.

66
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,100
Anyway, just act natural.

67
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,600
- A'Ling. 
 - Sister Sha.

68
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,000
Here, let me introduce you. This is Jingjing.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,400
This is Sister Sha. She's the big-shot producer and administrator

70
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,200
that Director Li always works with.

71
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,400
Hi, Sister Sha.

72
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,800
Jingjing is more beautiful in person than on-screen.

73
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,200
Being beautiful is secondary. The important thing is that she acts well.

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,400
Is that so?

75
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,200
Let's go inside.

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,400
Duan Wu and his manager just arrived.

77
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,200
- Let's go. 
 - Come on.

78
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,600
What are you busy with lately?

79
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,400
I just finished a reality show.

80
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,800
I was out in the sun for twelve days. Look, I've gotten a tan.

81
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,600
That makes you look more real.

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,800
It's all right. I think it looks quite natural, too.

83
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,000
- Right. 
 - Director.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,100
Jingjing and her manager are here.

85
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,200
Hi, Director.

86
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
Welcome.

87
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
We meet again, Director.

88
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,600
Hello.

89
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,500
Did Jingjing meet with Director before?

90
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,000
I think it was one or two years ago.

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,700
We met at a film festival.

92
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,000
- Right. 
 - Am I right?

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,200
Ms. Qiao, we haven't met for two years already.

94
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,800
Do you know each other?

95
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,000
We guested together at a variety show before.

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,500
But I had only just made my debut back then.

97
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,000
I didn't know anything. It's a good thing Ms. Qiao took care of me.

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,600
No. You're being too kind, Mr. Duan.

99
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,000
Come on, sit down.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,500
Sit down.

101
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:05,200
I have some urgent matters to attend to.

102
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,000
I must go to Beijing tonight.

103
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,300
So at the last minute, I gathered everyone here.

104
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,800
You all don't mind, right?

105
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,600
No. I don't feel as pressured when there are more people.

106
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,800
Don't feel pressured.

107
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,200
We're just having a casual chat. Come on, have some tea.

108
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
- Have some tea. 
 - Thank you.

109
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,800
- Here, Jingjing. 
 - Okay.

110
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Try Director's tea.

111
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,000
   

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,400
   

113
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,000
 I'm back! Where are you? 

114
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,000
 Guarding the house. 

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,400
 Guarding the house? I don't see you! 

116
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,800
She actually feels at ease leaving me all alone here.

117
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,800
I must keep this movie's material confidential until the last moment.

118
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,400
I'm sure that it's completely different from all the movies I've filmed.

119
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Perhaps it's even cooler and more imaginative.

120
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,000
Director Li. When I entered your home just now,

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,800
I saw two game machines by the wall.

122
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,000
I was wondering if your movie could be related to a game.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Based on what you said, I think that's even more likely.

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,600
Xiao Duan, you're so perceptive.

125
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,200
No wonder they say online

126
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,000
that the temporary title of your movie is called "Authenticity."

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,400
I can understand it now.

128
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,000
Game and reality.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,400
Authentic and fake.

130
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,799
It's not a simple representation.

131
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,400
The structure is more complicated.

132
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,000
For example...

133
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,800
Stop fishing for information from me. I might let things slip.

134
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,400
Director, you're so secretive.

135
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,200
Then we'll stop making blind guesses.

136
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,600
We're looking forward to being surprised.

137
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,000
 Yu Tu, let me tell you some good news. 

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,600
Did you get the role?

139
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,000
 I think so. 

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,600
 But the most important thing 

141
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,000
 is that Director Li said I was too thin. 

142
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
 You're still in my house, right? 

143
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,000
 Come downstairs. Let's have a free dinner. 

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,400
 It's Sister Ling's husband's birthday. She went ahead. 

145
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,000
 I'll bring you to her house for a free dinner to give her a surprise. 

146
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,300
Are you sure that it will be a surprise?

147
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,700
What's the matter?

148
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,400
When I think that I'll get to eat food that my wife cooks,

149
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
I... I feel so happy.

150
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,600
What does that mean?

151
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Are you saying I'm busy with work and have no time to care for our household?

152
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,200
No. That's definitely not what I meant.

153
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,400
I'm taking care of the household.

154
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,300
Cut the crap. Try how my soup tastes.

155
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Be careful. It's hot.

156
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,600
What do you think?

157
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,900
You can open a restaurant now.

158
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,000
Go and open the door. The cake I ordered has arrived.

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,700
I'm coming.

160
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
Brother A'Guo, happy birthday. We're here for a free dinner.

161
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
- Brother A'Guo. 
 - You're so well-informed.

162
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,900
- This is for Huihui. 
 - You don't need to buy anything.

163
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,200
No. Leave.

164
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,400
Today, you can't be our third wheel. This is our quality time together.

165
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,200
- Our daughter is here. 
 - What the heck?

166
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,600
We're just having a simple dinner.

167
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,200
If you don't mind, come in.

168
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,800
Come in. Come inside. Xiao Zhu, come in.

169
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,600
Sit anywhere you like. I'll pour you some tea.

170
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,840
This is the legendary Chief Coach of 80 Heroes, Teacher Yu, right?

171
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,719
Hi, Sister Ling. Just call me Yu Tu.

172
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:16,000
Come on, come inside.

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,679
I came here empty-handed. I'm sorry.

174
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:21,879
Why are you so shy? You don't need to prepare anything. Just come.

175
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,900
In the past, Jingjing wouldn't let me go to meet you.

176
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,000
Sit down.

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,100
He's so handsome. Come on, sit down.

178
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,400
Come on.

179
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:36,619
It's been a while since I received jewelry for my birthday.

180
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:38,740
I feel so moved.

181
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,479
Ms. Qiao, it's my birthday.

182
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,719
What are you saying?

183
00:10:57,719 --> 00:10:59,720
It's your birthday, and I bought a gift for your wife.

184
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,590
Am I not helping you save money?

185
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,239
So it's like a gift for you.

186
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:06,400
If you don't like it, go to the store and exchange it for something you can use.

187
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,239
Yes, you can exchange it.

188
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,959
What are you talking about?

189
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:11,599
How can I exchange this?

190
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:14,180
If I do, I must add more money and exchange it for something more expensive for you.

191
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,280
- I must personally help you put it on. 
 - That's enough. Cut it out.

192
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,200
Go and get Huihui. Tell her that Jingjing is here. Hurry.

193
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,280
Yes, she'll definitely be so happy.

194
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,979
Thank you.

195
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:25,919
Give me another gift on my lunar calendar birthday.

196
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:34,880
- What are you looking at? 
 - What do you mean?

197
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,760
Teacher Yu. Well... I want to talk to you.

198
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,099
Do you think you have an interest in joining the entertainment circle?

199
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,479
I don't have any talent in that area.

200
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:48,819
Move.

201
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:52,520
Why do you need talent? Your face is your talent.

202
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,719
Your IQ is so high. Your comprehension must be very strong.

203
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:58,640
How will you know that you don't have any talent in acting if you don't try?

204
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,920
Our circle lacks your age group and your kind of aura the most.

205
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,520
Let me tell you, it's not too late to make your debut now.

206
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,060
I'm very confident that in half a year, I can surely make you famous.

207
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,400
I'm sorry.

208
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,300
No. Don't be sorry, think about it carefully first.

209
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,719
- Huihui, look who's here. 
 - Here she comes.

210
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,080
- Huihui. 
 - Come on.

211
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,059
Look who's here.

212
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:19,699
- Huihui, come on. 
 - Come here.

213
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:22,360
Hurry, Auntie Jingjing is here. Come on, give her a hug.

214
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,840
Did you miss me?

215
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,180
- Yes. 
 - You did? Good girl.

216
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,119
Think about it carefully again, really. You don't need to answer me today.

217
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:32,760
Go home, and think about it carefully. You can do it.

218
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,980
There's no need to think about it.

219
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,760
Brother A'Guo. Look. It's your birthday, and your wife is staring at a handsome guy.

220
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,159
Aren't you sad? Aren't you angry?

221
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:43,239
I'm not sad. I'm not angry. She stares at handsome guys every day.

222
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:45,440
What are you talking about?

223
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,080
Jingjing, don't try to sow discord between us.

224
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,880
I'm working, okay?

225
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,760
Besides, I haven't even commented about you.

226
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,520
You didn't even call to say that you were coming to eat.

227
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,180
We didn't make enough food.

228
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,820
It doesn't matter. It's not a big deal.

229
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,550
We can order hot pot.

230
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,799
I want to have hot pot.

231
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,359
- Right, there's no problem no matter how many people come. 
 - All right then. Xiao Zhu, make a call.

232
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,559
Call Dandan and the others over to join in the fun.

233
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,719
- All right. 
 - Right.

234
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,359
- I'll call the people in the office. 
 - Call everyone who can come.

235
00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:10,019
 We're having hot pot. 

236
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,060
 Excuse me, don't burn yourself. 

237
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,440
It smells so good.

238
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,799
This is rare. Look.

239
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,119
Here comes the braised ribbonfish.

240
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:23,799
- Thank you, Sister Ling. 
 - Thank you.

241
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,299
Eat more.

242
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,900
Who's that?

243
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,120
Mind your images.

244
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:38,840
It's fine, Sister Ling.

245
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,999
From junior to senior high, Teacher Yu has already faced this kind of situation. He's used to it.

246
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,159
Junior high?

247
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,320
We went to the same junior high.

248
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,259
Our schools merged. You were in Class 1, and I was in Class 9.

249
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:05,020
Jingjing, does your school divide you into classes according to grades?

250
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,320
I think you've watched too many idol dramas.

251
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,960
When I was in junior high, I got very good grades.

252
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,680
- Otherwise, how could I get into the same senior high as Teacher Yu? 
 - Right.

253
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,150
It was just that in senior high,

254
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:17,450
I was suppressed by annoying people with the kind of IQ like Teacher Yu.

255
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,080
Eat less. You might get fat.

256
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,360
It's fine. Let her eat. Director Li requested it.

257
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,320
Did Jingjing get the role?

258
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,300
Pretty much. We're just waiting to sign the contract.

259
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,479
That's great.

260
00:14:34,479 --> 00:14:35,599
But let me tell you.

261
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:39,559
Today, when we went to meet Director, we encountered a very weird thing.

262
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,320
- What happened? 
 - What was it?

263
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,559
Duan Wu's manager was giving us a hard time face-to-face.

264
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,990
After being in the entertainment circle for so many years,

265
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,150
I've never encountered such a thing.

266
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:51,879
Wait, what happened?

267
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,000
 Stop fishing for information. I might let things slip. 

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,660
 Then we'll stop making blind guesses. 

269
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,960
 We're looking forward to be surprised. 

270
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,560
 Okay. 

271
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,040
 But speaking of games, among us, Jingjing should be the best player, right? 

272
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,000
 Honor of Kings, which Jingjing endorses, is the national game. 

273
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,159
 We all love playing it. We just couldn't get our ranks up. 

274
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:17,539
 When will you have the time to carry me? 

275
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:22,679
 What is your rank? 

276
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,279
 Platinum. 

277
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,599
 My rank is higher than yours. 

278
00:15:25,599 --> 00:15:27,699
 If I carry you, it might increase the difficulty. 

279
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:30,459
 Give me your mobile phone. I'll help you play one game. 

280
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:31,920
 Sure. 

281
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,459
- Wasn't she intentionally giving you a hard time? 
 - I know, right?

282
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:42,280
What did she mean by that?

283
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,220
Don't they want to work with us anymore?

284
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,640
Duan Wu just became popular last year, and he's so arrogant already this year?

285
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,039
That has nothing to do with him.

286
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:52,360
Later on, he explained it to me via WeChat.

287
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,960
He said that their company wanted to replace his manager.

288
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,119
I think she heard some news about it, so she did that on purpose.

289
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,239
She was trying to give both of us a hard time.

290
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:01,679
I'm sure that Director Li didn't have a good impression of Duan Wu.

291
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,159
So that's the reason.

292
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,599
What did you do then?

293
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:09,580
I got her phone and won Most Valuable Player.

294
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,760
- Well done. 
 - What do you think, Teacher Yu?

295
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,780
I didn't embarrass you, right?

296
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,019
Good job.

297
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,640
Jingjing, are you so good right now?

298
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,020
Her rank is just Platinum.

299
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,320
Look at how pleased she is.

300
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,620
Right.

301
00:16:24,239 --> 00:16:26,080
Eat up.

302
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,280
Jingjing.

303
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,399
I'm considered the one who initiated you into this game, right?

304
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,250
How can you easily...

305
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,410
switch to another teacher?

306
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,859
He's jealous.

307
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,979
Teacher Yu.

308
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:45,900
Do you want to have a solo game?

309
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,919
- A solo? 
 - Do a solo game!

310
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,340
- Solo! 
 - Solo!

311
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,340
You can't go easy on him just because it's his birthday.

312
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,400
Well... Let's eat first.

313
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,799
We'll play. You guys eat. We'll play while eating.

314
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,280
- Let's have a solo. 
 - Come on.

315
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,740
Hurry.

316
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,520
   

317
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,120
   

318
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,540
   

319
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,680
   

320
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,020
 Prepare to engage. 

321
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,980
 This person who is passing by... 

322
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
   

323
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,420
   

324
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,580
   

325
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,619
Nice.

326
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:51,699
My hero isn't good. I'll use another one. Let's play one more round.

327
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:53,119
- Sure. 
 - Are you playing again?

328
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:54,600
Come on, hurry.

329
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,300
Yes, he's good. He can do it.

330
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,730
   

331
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,359
Brother A'Guo, you can do it.

332
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,760
All the best.

333
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,560
Why do I feel like Brother A'Guo is going to lose again?

334
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,179
You're a crow's beak. 
  (T/N: someone who makes an inauspicious remark) 

335
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,310
 You have been slain. 

336
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,200
 Victory, Defeat. 

337
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,880
This... This is what we'll do. Let's use the same hero.

338
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,800
- Last round. 
 - Sure.

339
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,059
- Come on. 
 - Brother A'Guo, I'll give you some motivation. All the best.

340
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:31,160
   

341
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,270
   

342
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,430
 First Blood. 

343
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,040
 You have been slain. 

344
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,230
 Enemy killing spree. 

345
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:47,780
He lost again.

346
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,719
Forget it.

347
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:52,800
I know what happened.

348
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,920
I didn't have lunch today.

349
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,439
- Right. 
 - I feel dizzy, so...

350
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:57,959
- Come on. 
 - We understand.

351
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,620
- Have some beef. 
 - Eat more.

352
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,900
- This is cooked, right? 
 - Here, have some beef.

353
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,239
Besides, well... Friendship is the priority, competition comes second.

354
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:07,500
- Right? 
 - Right.

355
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,759
Right. Here, Teacher Yu. This beef of friendship smells so good.

356
00:19:12,599 --> 00:19:14,099
Don't say that.

357
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,459
Don't be so naughty.

358
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:18,159
All right.

359
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,559
Teacher Yu, you're the only one who can deal with her now.

360
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,000
She's jealous.

361
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,520
You insist on letting everyone be jealous of me.

362
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,279
Here, Brother A'Guo. Happy birthday.

363
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,319
- Come on. 
 - Brother A'Guo,

364
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,999
- happy birthday. 
 - Happy birthday.

365
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,419
My goodness. This is too exaggerated.

366
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,560
Do you want it?

367
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,040
- What's the matter? 
 - It must be five, six, seven, eight, nine.

368
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,840
- Right, five, six, seven, eight, nine. 
 - Listen, don't be so arrogant.

369
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:53,560
Right. That's indeed the case.

370
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,800
But you don't need to consider my opinion too much.

371
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,560
I haven't paid attention to it for many years already.

372
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,359
I've only checked the situation lately.

373
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,439
No, I think what you said makes sense.

374
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:04,599
I should definitely reduce my holdings accordingly.

375
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,900
Teacher Yu. Look,

376
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,600
you're handsome and talented.

377
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,400
 When you just arrived, I... I really thought 

378
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,200
 that you were from the entertainment circle. 

379
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,600
 After we played games, 

380
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,000
you're definitely a professional.

381
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm curious. What... What exactly is your job?

382
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,400
Next month,

383
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
I'll be working at an investment bank.

384
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,600
 An investment bank? 

385
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,600
 No wonder. You're incredible. 

386
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,200
Not everyone can work in an investment bank.

387
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,600
 A'Guo! 

388
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,000
 Come here. I'm having such bad luck. 

389
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,200
- Does anyone want this? 
 - When was your luck good?

390
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,800
- She can't survive without me. 
  - Hurry. 

391
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,500
Make yourself at home.

392
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,600
Okay, I'm coming.

393
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,700
 - I need one more card. 
 - One more card. I need one more card. 

394
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,000
 Does anyone want this card? 

395
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,100
 No, we don't want it. 

396
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,200
It's so refreshing here.

397
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,800
Yes.

398
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,300
Are you really planning on working at an investment bank?

399
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,900
Actually, in senior high, I always admired you

400
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,900
because you always got a perfect score in Math and Physics.

401
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,000
Back then, I thought

402
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,900
that you'd probably become a very incredible scientist.

403
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,300
That way,

404
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:24,600
I'd probably feel very honored too, as your classmate.

405
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,400
I'll probably disappoint you.

406
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,800
No.

407
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,200
It's good to work at an investment bank, too.

408
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,000
I think that no matter what you do, you'll be very incredible.

409
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,800
Someone once said that I was very selfish.

410
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,600
I'm capable of giving my family a better life,

411
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,500
yet I'm being selfish by letting my family sacrifice

412
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,800
for my so-called dream.

413
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,000
Then you should tell that person, "I'm sorry.

414
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,400
This is the only thing I'm capable of."

415
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Think about it.

416
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,800
If you can't do everything as well as you do now,

417
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,600
and you can only do one thing well,

418
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,000
based on people's standards, you're actually very outstanding already, right?

419
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,400
Will anyone say that you're selfish?

420
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,200
I'm sure the person said that you were selfish

421
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,200
because you have too many types of outstanding capabilities.

422
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,400
How can they blame you because you're outstanding?

423
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,000
I think I have good logic.

424
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,600
Am I wrong?

425
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,800
You're right.

426
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,200
You're so smart. Everything you say is right.

427
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,100
Of course.

428
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,500
I didn't expect us to talk about these things one day.

429
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,800
Yes.

430
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Compared to this, what's even weirder is

431
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,700
that I taught you how to play games one day.

432
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,900
Weren't you tricked into it?

433
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,400
By the way,

434
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,800
why is it Chief Coach of 80 Heroes?

435
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,200
Doesn't Honor of Kings have over 100 heroes?

436
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,400
Do you have OCD? You insist on making me explain.

437
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,500
Because I'm not worthy of practicing the remaining 20 heroes.

438
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,300
For example, Li Bai, Wan'er, Sima Yi, Zhuge Liang.

439
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,600
I won't count them anymore. It hurts my pride to count them one by one.

440
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,400
That's true.

441
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,700
Ms. Qiao, you just don't have time to practice them.

442
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Of course.

443
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
That's the reason.

444
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,700
You said you'd work at the investment bank next month. When exactly is it?

445
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,000
Around the middle of the month.

446
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,600
Then you can keep teaching me until the match.

447
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,300
Yes.

448
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,600
We're friends now, right?

449
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,400
Of course.

450
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,200
Weight Gain and Ace Plan begins. 
    

451
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,600
Our goal is

452
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,200
to reach Ace rank within ten days. 
    

453
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,900
Within 30 days, gain 3kg in weight.

454
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,700
Don't be so agitated.

455
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,000
My plan just had a minor problem.

456
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I executed it too fully.

457
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,400
I think you're the one who's too full.

458
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,300
Didn't you say you'd gradually increase your weight in 30 days?

459
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,400
 Why did you gain 3 kg in one week? 

460
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,050
Can I control my weight?

461
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,400
Doesn't it have a mind and spirit of its own?

462
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,600
Control yourself, okay?

463
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,700
Don't gain 9 kg in 30 days.

464
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,600
That blogger will bash you again later on.

465
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,500
Don't worry. I checked using an alternate account.

466
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,900
Someone took a photo of her on the streets. She gained at least 6 kg.

467
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,800
Her face is so big. Does she even dare to comment about me?

468
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,900
 Your weight gain plan is a success. What about the plan to raise your ranking? 

469
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,200
It's even more successful. I'm already in Diamond 1 rank.

470
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,600
I'll reach Ace rank soon.

471
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,200
That's fast.

472
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,600
Teacher Yu is carrying you, right?

473
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,800
How is that possible? I've been playing alone.

474
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,400
Teacher Yu is so cold.

475
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,000
I encountered teammates that set me up consecutively,

476
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
lost ten times in a row, and he still wouldn't carry me.

477
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,700
Tonight, after my last big meal, I'll start to control myself.

478
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,400
- I'm hanging up. 
 - No, I...

479
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,900
That brat.

480
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,600
When playing alone, you'll encounter all sorts of situations and teammates.

481
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,400
It's beneficial in training your personal capability.

482
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,300
And during the match, you'll have two teammates whom you don't know.

483
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,400
You don't know their competence.

484
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,400
So you must plan for the worst.

485
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,800
Also, you were the one who set others up in the previous round,

486
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,600
not the other way around.

487
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,000
For two team fights, you engaged in the team fight when your teammates hadn't caught up yet.

488
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,200
You were too impatient.

489
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,800
I recorded them. Come over and take a look.

490
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Wait. I'll weigh myself again.

491
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,700
The figure earlier was before I had breakfast.

492
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,800
 After having lunch, I'm already 57.6 kg. 

493
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,200
 Even though it would usually go down in the morning, 

494
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,000
 if I continue having a big meal tonight, 

495
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,400
 perhaps I'll have an inflated weight of 58.2 kg. 

496
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,200
 Should I still eat at the place we reserved then? 

497
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,400
 I haven't gone out for a meal in a long time. 

498
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,900
 But as a female celebrity, how can I weigh 58.2 kg? 

499
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,100
- Earlier, I was a bit too strict. 
 - This is what we'll do.

500
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,900
Before 5:30 p.m., if I can reach Ace rank, let's still go out to eat.

501
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,200
But starting tomorrow, we can't do that anymore.

502
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,600
Come and watch the video from the last round.

503
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,400
Hurry.

504
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,100
Your future child will surely be very pitiful.

505
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,000
Hurry up.

506
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,600
How would I know where they are then?

507
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,160
Last time, I told you some jungle battle concepts and key positions.

508
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,640
I forget when I'm playing.

509
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:10,959
After being caught a few more times, you'll remember.

510
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,280
Let's continue watching.

511
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,680
Do you understand now?

512
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:19,839
Yes.

513
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,079
How can you find so many problems?

514
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,960
When you're in the match, thousands of viewers will watch more carefully than I am.

515
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,500
Okay. I'll begin then.

516
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,640
You still need four stars to reach Ace rank.

517
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,799
You still have one and a half hours before 5:30 PM.

518
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:40,280
Basically, winning is the only option. You can't lose.

519
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,880
Begin, I'll watch.

520
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,840
Timi. Considering that I am your spokesperson.

521
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,119
 The enemy's army will arrive at the battlefield in five seconds. 

522
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,960
 Please get ready. 

523
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,479
Why is someone away from the keyboard now?

524
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,640
Our Jungler is amazing. I can't believe he got five kills already.

525
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,119
   

526
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,519
Continue playing.

527
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,560
 Victory. 

528
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,519
Look. I'm Most Valuable Player. Thirty-three percent damage.

529
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,620
Don't be too proud.

530
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,280
There's one more round.

531
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,150
I think their Mid and Jungle players are fighting.

532
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,210
They just stood there for me to kill.

533
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,540
 Victory. 
   

534
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,220
   

535
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:47,359
What happened?

536
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,839
Wasn't it supposed to be difficult to advance to the next rank?

537
00:31:52,719 --> 00:31:56,219
It seems like Timi wants their spokesperson to eat more.

538
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,500
Where are we eating?

539
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,240
   

540
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,900
   

541
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,880
Why is there such a long line?

542
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,079
I remember that this restaurant wasn't that popular before.

543
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:26,359
I think they got on the Michelin guide a while ago.

544
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:28,439
But we made a reservation. We don't need to wait.

545
00:32:28,439 --> 00:32:30,560
Jingjing. Teacher Yu. Go inside first.

546
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,019
I'll return some stuff to the brand. I'll come to find you later.

547
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,419
Okay.

548
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,819
You go ahead.

549
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:39,160
That's what I was thinking, too,

550
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,580
so you won't get photographed because of me.

551
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,620
- Hello. 
 - Reservation for Ms. Zhu.

552
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,680
- Please come inside. 
 - Thank you.

553
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:01,319
This is the room Ms. Zhu booked.

554
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,610
   

555
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,199
Let's order a few more dishes.

556
00:33:25,199 --> 00:33:27,040
If we can't finish them, you can bring them back to So Panicky.

557
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,820
I want to try a few dishes.

558
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,820
Jingjing, I want to ask a favor.

559
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:51,040


560
00:33:53,080 --> 00:34:00,180
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

561
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:07,400
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

562
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:14,560
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

563
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:22,240
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

564
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,720
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

565
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,800
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

566
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:36,100
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

567
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:43,160
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

568
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:50,300
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
 that we failed to treasure  ♫

569
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:58,300
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

570
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:33,260
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

571
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:40,500
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

572
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:47,580
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

573
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:55,260
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

574
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,840
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

575
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:01,940
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

576
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:09,200
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

577
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,300
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

578
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:23,500
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
 in the passing time  ♫

579
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:33,720
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
