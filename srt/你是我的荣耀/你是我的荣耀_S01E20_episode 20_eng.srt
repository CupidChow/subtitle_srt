1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:17,930


2
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,250
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,110
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,750
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,630
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:08,330
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:28,990
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:40,060
   

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,840
So my answers truly don't matter anymore?

16
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,898
Why did you write those letters to me?

17
00:02:18,898 --> 00:02:22,040
Why did you answer my questions?

18
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:24,038
Do you regret it?

19
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,239
Because I was so stupid, and you were touched?

20
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,080
I don't want this, Yu Tu.

21
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,479
Did I do something stupid?

22
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,041
These days, I've been writing until late every day.

23
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,145
But I never felt tired. I got smug.

24
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:02,198
My expectations ran high.

25
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,880
I thought you would be pleased to read them.

26
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,220
Jingjing, to think like this,

27
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,522
has my IQ level fallen into a negative?

28
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,867
All the stupid things I did in my life

29
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,241
are because of you.

30
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,176
I couldn't think of another way.

31
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,448
It's not because I regretted it after reading the chat history.

32
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,061
I've regretted it a long time ago.

33
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,351
I just dared not admit it.

34
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:44,858
Then I went on a business trip.

35
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:48,020
I spent over a month in the desert.

36
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,436
I thought I was still struggling.

37
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,560
But one day I realized,

38
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,340
I spent too little time struggling.

39
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,081
Most of the time, I was thinking

40
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,092
of how to get back what I lost.

41
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,467
I even

42
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,461
started blaming you.

43
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:45,593
I blamed you for asking me too soon.

44
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:48,034
If you had given me a little more time,

45
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,960
I would've surrendered to myself.

46
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,865
It would be better

47
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,256
if I had asked you instead.

48
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,779
Ask what?

49
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,960
Ask...

50
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,460
Would you like to be with me?

51
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,526
Jingjing,

52
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:29,200
would you like to be with me?

53
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:39,138
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

54
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:45,120
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

55
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,240
I guess I would.

56
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,200
But if I say that, I would feel a bit unhappy.

57
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,540
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

58
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,580
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

59
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,261
♫  I loved your eyes  ♫

60
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:07,820
♫  Quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

61
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:13,260
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

62
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,520
♫  Time does not stop,  ♫

63
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,859
♫  Remembering the time that we failed to treasure  ♫

64
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:22,620
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,179
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,650
I don't want to like someone

67
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,340
more than he likes me.

68
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,558
That's not true.

69
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,200
I don't like you less than you like me.

70
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:43,118
Yes, you do.

71
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,990
You said we are not suitable for each other.

72
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,420
That was because... I considered a few lame excuses.

73
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,846
Such as my income.

74
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,216
And what I could give you,

75
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,559
and if I would have time to take good care of you.

76
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,540
I also don't have time to take care of you.

77
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,179
When you truly like someone, you'll be reckless.

78
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:22,120
You won't hesitate or struggle.

79
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,612
You won't overthink.

80
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:27,254
I'm probably different from you.

81
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,035
I think too much.

82
00:07:35,382 --> 00:07:37,916
I've been thinking about the rest of my life.

83
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,319
But you thought less than me.

84
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,859
How about this?

85
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:53,140
You give me a calculation method,

86
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,839
show me how you calculate,

87
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,877
then I will make it up to you.

88
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,519
You can't even tell me your formula?

89
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,160
Formula?

90
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,378
You're bullying me again.

91
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,100
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

92
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,618
I was wrong.

93
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,319
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

94
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,684
I haven't agreed to be with you.

95
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,240
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

96
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,940
I know.

97
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,501
I'm getting cold.

98
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,155
Let's get in the car.

99
00:08:38,157 --> 00:08:40,850
But you sit in the front seat, okay?

100
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,398
You'll be my navigator.

101
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,720
I really don't know

102
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,890
the way home.

103
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,380
♫  Which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

104
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,780
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

105
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,180
♫  Time does not hold back,  ♫

106
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:05,801
 I need to get gas. 

107
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,900
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom  ♫

108
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:18,900
♫  As I listen to the tenderness of time  ♫

109
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,240
Jingjing, where do you live?

110
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,200
Jingjing?

111
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:48,160
 Ready to go. 

112
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,039
 Eighty-two kilometers. 

113
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,720
 ETA in one hour and thirty-one minutes. 

114
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,040
Jingjing, I...

115
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,315
I'm home. Thanks for the ride.

116
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,979
I'm going inside.

117
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,300
When will you go back to Shanghai?

118
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,440
Xiao Zhu said you're returning to Shanghai on the fourth day of the lunar year

119
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,630
and then you'll travel for filming on the fifth.

120
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,271
Is that right?

121
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,560
Pretty much.

122
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,200
I got it.

123
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,959
Happy Lunar New Year to you.

124
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,679
Happy Lunar New Year.

125
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,177
How will you go home?

126
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:11,998
I'll walk.

127
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,160
My place isn't far from here.

128
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,879
Then when you get...

129
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,327
Okay.

130
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,479
I won't reply to you.

131
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,279
Okay.

132
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,880
Good night.

133
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,939
Older Sister! 
  (T/N: an endearing term that cousins also use) 

134
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:57,200
Didn't I hear it right?

135
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,160
- She's home! 
 - You're home.

136
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,659
- I'll help you with your suitcase. 
 - You're home at last.

137
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:04,299
It's about time.

138
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:06,100
Be careful.

139
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,960
You're such a child. Why didn't you call us as soon as you got home?

140
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,000
You didn't even ring the doorbell.

141
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,079
You even had to drag that big suitcase by yourself?

142
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,039
Where is your driver?

143
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,198
Let's go.

144
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,800
Come on, Mom. I'm hungry.

145
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,118
I've left you some food.

146
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,960
Here she is!

147
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,140
You guys play while I get you dinner.

148
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,860
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

149
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,779
West wind.

150
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,400
It's your turn.

151
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,818
- Here. 
 - I win!

152
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,120
You again!

153
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,998
West wind.

154
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,240
No, no.

155
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,940
Come on.

156
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,221
- Don't you... 
 - Is that another discard?

157
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:59,260
Don't discard this! Aren't you waiting for the tile?

158
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,260
- What? 
 - Discard this.

159
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,677
Hurry up!

160
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,960
- Let me... 
 - This one.

161
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,440
One character.

162
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,740
Good.

163
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,198
Another character.

164
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:14,960
 I am home. 

165
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,820
Draw a tile.

166
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,856
What?

167
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:22,000
Dad, you play.

168
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,420
You play, you play.

169
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,720
Take it from her. Go ahead.

170
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,079
What a squanderer she is.

171
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,300
For me, it's a nine.

172
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,089
Are you not playing anymore?

173
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,639
 It took him half an hour to get home. 

174
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,519
 I wonder if he still lives there, in the old town. 

175
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,020
   

176
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,080
Sister!

177
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,899
New Year is not a time to spend on your phone.

178
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:55,980
Let's play another round.

179
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,780
Play what?

180
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,819
A round of mahjong, of course.

181
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:01,419
Just for a little while. We don't mind you playing badly.

182
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:02,518
- Come on, Sister. 
 - Just a little while.

183
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,279
Come on. Let's go.

184
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,078
Okay, but just once.

185
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:08,059
Clear the table!

186
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,239
Hurry up, Sister.

187
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,440
   

188
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,640
I'm coming.

189
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,799
Come on, let's play.

190
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,460
   

191
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,640
I knew I heard something by the door.

192
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,136
Why didn't you come in?

193
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:14,665
I told you not to wait for me.

194
00:16:14,665 --> 00:16:15,838
It's New Year's Day.

195
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,179
We would be worried sick if you were not home by now.

196
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,260
Where did you go? Are you all right?

197
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,460
I'm fine.

198
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,840
Mom. Really, I'm fine.

199
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,519
Go to sleep.

200
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,567
He's asleep.

201
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,620
You should go rest too.

202
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,657
- Wake up. 
 - What?

203
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:56,679
- Yu Tu is home. 
 - Is he?

204
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,679
- Then I'm going to bed. 
 - Oh no, you don't.

205
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:00,720
- What? 
 - We have to talk.

206
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,777
Yes, what is it?

207
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,000
Last time, he came to tell me that he liked a girl.

208
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,720
She's kind of pretty, but she's no caretaker.

209
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:13,400
I thought there aren't many young women who can take care of their partners nowadays.

210
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,900
Yeah.

211
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,660
Caring women like you are increasingly rare.

212
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,860
Don't interrupt. This is serious.

213
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,300
Look at our son. He hardly confides in us.

214
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,900
I think he surely really likes her.

215
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,369
It's not that important if she can take care of him or not. Right?

216
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:32,440
The thing is, what's gotten into him today.

217
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,200
I feel a little down seeing him.

218
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,139
What's making you down?

219
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,220
You should've seen him, looking all preoccupied when he got here.

220
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,680
I have no idea what she did to him.

221
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,160
Ever since he was a kid,

222
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,680
our Yu Tu had heaps of girls going after him.

223
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,160
He didn't have to pursue them.

224
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,759
She had him go out all New Year's Day and he spent the day out till so late.

225
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:58,757
Do you know what this means? It's insensibility.

226
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,160
It's fine if she's no caretaker,

227
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,120
but if she's insensible, how will they get along in the future?

228
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,659
You dozed off again.

229
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:06,379
No, I'm listening.

230
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:08,419
What did you listen to? Don't bluff me!

231
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:09,799
Yu Tu's girlfriend, right?

232
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:10,899
What do you know?

233
00:18:10,899 --> 00:18:12,219
Hey, you.

234
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:15,519
Don't waste your breath, okay?

235
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:18,600
I'm his mother. It has to concern me.

236
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,498
What if she's not fond of him to begin with?

237
00:18:21,498 --> 00:18:23,039
Our relatives are coming over tomorrow.

238
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,119
I have to get some rest.

239
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,559
Stupid Old Man, you're his father, okay?

240
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,380
 Big Brother! 

241
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,599
 You're early. 

242
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:36,901
 - Come on in. 
 - Sister-in-law. 

243
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:38,440
You've brought so many gifts.

244
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,079
Happy Lunar New Year, Aunty!

245
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,440
Happy New Year.

246
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,079
Yu Tu, have you wished them?

247
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,440
Uncle, Happy New Year.

248
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,438
Happy New Year.

249
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,619
- Here, have some. 
 - Thank you.

250
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,419
It's okay. I can do it myself.

251
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,094
How's it going?

252
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,979
 Are you awake? 

253
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,460
   

254
00:19:41,443 --> 00:19:44,840
 There's a popular tofu store in my neighborhood. 

255
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,817
 Would you like some? 

256
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,498
 Jingjing, are you awake? 

257
00:20:01,498 --> 00:20:04,639
 We're going to grandma's house in a moment. 

258
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,040
I'm awake!

259
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:14,559
Sit down.

260
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,939
Put it here.

261
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:17,559
What a sumptuous breakfast today.

262
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:19,420
- There's so much. 
 - Have some greens.

263
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,340
- Come on, let's have a toast. 
 - Sure!

264
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,899
- Cheers. 
 - Happy New Year!

265
00:20:25,899 --> 00:20:27,939
Wait up, will you? This one's delicious.

266
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:29,340
It comes in many flavors.

267
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,180
- Brother, do you want the original or white peach oats? 
 - This one.

268
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,699
- It's best to dine at home, you know. 
 - Yeah.

269
00:20:35,699 --> 00:20:38,559
- Come. Please, enjoy. 
 - Tell me if I'm getting better at this.

270
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,580
Try this.

271
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,860
Sister-in-law, you are good at cooking this dish.

272
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,584
It's well fried.

273
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:45,119
- Would you like some more? 
 - Here, take more.

274
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,000
Here, try this. Eat more.

275
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,499
- You too. 
 - Don't just greet.

276
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:53,819
- Eat up. 
 - Okay.

277
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,299
Don't just drink.

278
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,860
Eat. It's so well-cooked.

279
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,119
Brother, are you in a relationship?

280
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,979
You've been checking the phone all morning. Look at you.

281
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:08,699
Looks like she's giving you the cold shoulder.

282
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:12,480
You're so uncool. You wasted our genes.

283
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,459
If I send a text to a girl now,

284
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:16,619
it only takes seconds for her to reply to me.

285
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,580
You don't believe me?

286
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,180
I'll show you.

287
00:21:22,137 --> 00:21:23,319
Here, here.

288
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,683
- Come on, cheers. 
 - Sister-in-law.

289
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:28,257
- Have a great year ahead. 
 - Thanks.

290
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,640
It's just a warm-up.

291
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,120
   
   
   

292
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,319
Aunty.

293
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:42,760
How did Xiao Liu do in his exams?

294
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:45,179
Don't mention it.

295
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,020
His English and literature are so-so.

296
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,659
As for science and math, he's shown no improvement.

297
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,687
If you're free, you should help him with his studies.

298
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:58,059
Aunty, you see, when it comes to math,

299
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:00,179
you must practice with a lot of questions.

300
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:01,839
Exactly. More quizzes for you.

301
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,380
I was too lenient with you.

302
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,620
Not to worry, Aunty. Science runs deep in our family.

303
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,699
Work on more questions and it'll surely rise up.

304
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:10,900
Exactly!

305
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,420
Yeah. Listen to your cousin.

306
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,880
Xiao Liu, don't waste our genes.

307
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,659
Keep it up.

308
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:21,000
All right.

309
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,858
- You can do better, Xiao Liu. 
 - Keep it up!

310
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:25,860
Do your best, Xiao Liu.

311
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,760
   

312
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,999
Sister, it's for you.

313
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:18,240
Hello? Hi there.

314
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,820
My sister is digging bamboo shoots.

315
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,879
 Just hang on, I'll give her the phone. 

316
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:24,319
All right, thanks.

317
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
Who is it?

318
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,560
Hello?

319
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,980
It's me. Yu Tu.

320
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:05,199
Are you digging bamboo shoots?

321
00:24:05,939 --> 00:24:07,899
 Did you go to the mountains? 

322
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:11,459
I was about to ask you

323
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:14,520
if you cared to go on a stroll with me this afternoon.

324
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,210
Yixing has changed a lot in the past two years.

325
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,560
The Dongjiu Lakeside is beautiful.

326
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:22,499
I'm at my grandma's in Hufu.

327
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:24,179
Tomorrow, I'll be at my grandpa's in the mountains.

328
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:25,692
 I don't have time. 

329
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:30,420
Okay then. Have fun.

330
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:36,839
On the fourth day, I will take you back to Shanghai.

331
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:42,040
We'll catch up then. Bye.

332
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:05,579
Sister.

333
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:08,620
As an actress, you even had to act when picking up the phone?

334
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,060
You already knew who called, yet you had to ask me about it.

335
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,240
You even made me answer it.

336
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,659
He persisted in calling so I had you pick it up instead.

337
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:20,040
Couldn't you say I was not here?

338
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,400
Hurry up and dig.

339
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,100
I want fried winter bamboo shoots with pickles for dinner tonight.

340
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,599
Dig up! Stop fooling around.

341
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,400
I think there are some here.

342
00:25:31,459 --> 00:25:33,559
You're the big sister. Anything you say.

343
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,100
Mom, I'm going for a walk.

344
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,179
- Where are you going? 
 - A scenic spot.

345
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:48,520
Brother, I'm coming with you!

346
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,438
Get home early, okay?

347
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:55,259
Whose turn is it?

348
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:58,720
 The girl whose photo you posted, have you found her a boyfriend? 

349
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,200
No, thanks.

350
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,780
Another six-dots.

351
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,939
Make that two six-dots.

352
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:07,939
 Not yet. I haven't even seen her mother lately. 

353
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:09,580
 I haven't had time to tell you. 

354
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,019
 Stop recommending her to others for now. 

355
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:14,083
 Tomorrow night, you'll recommend her to Yu Tu over dinner. 

356
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,020
Brother, we've been walking all afternoon. Can we take a break?

357
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:35,540
   

358
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,280
It's already over 15,000 steps!

359
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:41,939
That's it.

360
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:43,903
I'm stopping here.

361
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,380
If I knew it was like this,

362
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:04,480
I might as well stay at home and chat with my girls.

363
00:27:05,427 --> 00:27:10,127
   

364
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,480
But no one chats with me.

365
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,700
How about I teach you a few tricks for tuition fee?

366
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,400
Let's go home.

367
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:26,769
Can't you even take a break?

368
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,480
Wait for me!

369
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,380
We're on our way.

370
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,497
We'll be in Taihua in about half an hour.

371
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:40,779
Yes, we'll spend the night.

372
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:44,979
Jingjing misses you too.

373
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:46,800
Okay, bye.

374
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,880
   

375
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,820
Surprised to see me, Grandma?

376
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,359
My granddaughter's so big now!

377
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:04,300
Did you sleep well?

378
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,340
- All right, let's get us some breakfast. 
 - Sure.

379
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,019
- I made it just for you. 
 - Don't eat too much.

380
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:11,739
Once your aunt gets here in a moment, we're starting the main meal.

381
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:14,380
- Okay. 
 - I made you your favorites.

382
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,220
That's enough, Grandma.

383
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,510
Have some more. Ignore your mother and eat more.

384
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,960
My granddaughter loves zongzi so much.

385
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,300
Let me peel it for you.

386
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,739
Careful, it's hot. 
    

387
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:29,380
I'm fine. 
    

388
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,580
This is your favorite.

389
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,740
- It's made of purple rice. 
 - Mom?

390
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:40,100
Why did you prepare so many dishes again?

391
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,780
I have to hurry back in the afternoon.

392
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,259
Says who?

393
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:44,639
You won't leave before dinner.

394
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:46,140
It's not like you visit us often.

395
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,280
You people are always on the go.

396
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,669
I have a date this afternoon. A mahjong date.

397
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:55,699
You know what? How about you and dad come with us to our place?

398
00:29:55,699 --> 00:29:58,760
No! I get carsick.

399
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,864
You and your mahjong all day long.

400
00:30:01,557 --> 00:30:06,200
You know what? It's up to my granddaughter when you can go.

401
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,580
Jingjing, tell him.

402
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,459
Of course, we may leave only after dinner.

403
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:20,259
See? I have to keep company to my grandparents.

404
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:24,580
You are so old, yet you lack Jingjing's sensibilities.

405
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,740
Jingjing. I'll take you to harvest bamboo shoots later.

406
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:31,319
Your maternal grandma's bamboo shoots aren't as sweet as ours.

407
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:33,547
We're not going back there.

408
00:30:35,939 --> 00:30:38,300
See how clever our granddaughter is.

409
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,279
You've got us a bumper harvest.

410
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:46,277
That's a lot of shoots. Okay, Jingjing.

411
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,179
Your sister has arrived at our house. They're waiting for us.

412
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:52,219
See, your daughter harvested all of these.

413
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:56,780
I'm thinking let's split them into fair portions so our guests won't scrap over them.

414
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,280
You're right.

415
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,140
You know what? Keep some for dad to dry.

416
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,900
What? Drying the winter bamboo shoots?

417
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,219
It's not worth it.

418
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:08,519
Take them all and distribute them.

419
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:11,580
Tell them, my granddaughter harvested these shoots.

420
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,860
To eat them is a blessing.

421
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,019
Yeah.

422
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:15,460
What are you doing here? Get down to work.

423
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,640
Hurry up.

424
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,739
- Help us to pack these shoots. 
 - Yeah.

425
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:26,319
Jingjing, you must eat well. Do you hear me?

426
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,659
Get some good rest.

427
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:29,327
It's so heavy.

428
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,780
Drop by often when you're free.

429
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,900
Take care, Grandma.

430
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,660
- Dad, mom, we're going. 
 - Bye.

431
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,258
- Go to bed early. 
 - Bye, Grandpa.

432
00:31:44,258 --> 00:31:45,940
- Remember to call us once you get there. 
 - Okay.

433
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,820
Hurry along now.

434
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,820
Easy there.

435
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,140
Grandpa, Grandma, go in now. It's freezing out here.

436
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,240
Drive slowly.

437
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,900
- Mom, go in. 
 - Drive slowly.

438
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,000
Okay.

439
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,980
 Jingjing, I'm back in Yixing. See you soon. 

440
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,679
 I'm on my way back. Perhaps you can arrive a little later. 

441
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,940
It's your turn.

442
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,238
Hurry up.

443
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,758
Nope.

444
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,660
A pair of jacks.

445
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,319
Pair of two.

446
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,100
Uncle is back.

447
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,119
Welcome back, Uncle!

448
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:44,079
Look at me.

449
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,277
What time is it now?

450
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,440
How's the game?

451
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,140
Jingjing!

452
00:32:53,898 --> 00:32:57,478
What the hell? My MVP!

453
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,339
So nice!

454
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,119
It's really troublesome that my in-laws are in another place.

455
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,480
Luckily, they're in Changzhou.

456
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,760
Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to hang out with you today.

457
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,539
That'd be a huge loss for me.

458
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:16,360
Thanks a lot!

459
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,872
You're so nice, Jingjing.

460
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,160
As a token of gratitude, let's go hang out somewhere. Drink's on me.

461
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,136
No, thanks. It's seven o'clock.

462
00:33:25,136 --> 00:33:27,939
It's only seven o'clock. That's still early, right?

463
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:31,360
Come on. We can go to Dongjiu.

464
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,939
It's been two years, and Dongjiu has spruced up a lot.

465
00:33:33,939 --> 00:33:35,639
Dongjiu?

466
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,599
 I was about to ask you if you cared to go on a stroll with me this afternoon. 

467
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,140
 Yixing has changed a lot in the past two years. 

468
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:42,100
 The Dongjiu Lakeside is beautiful. 

469
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,599
There are so many very romantic, feel-good cafés over there.

470
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,922
They come with private rooms.

471
00:33:47,922 --> 00:33:49,860
Okay then, let's go.

472
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,739
Let's take a lot of photos, enough to post on WeChat Moments.

473
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:53,819
All right, let's go!

474
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,820
Jingjing, I'll drive.

475
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,779
Okay.

476
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:12,200
Jingjing, why on earth did you leave your driver's license at the back?

477
00:34:14,695 --> 00:34:16,655
Give it to me! Give it to me!

478
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:19,260
Give it to me! 
    

479
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:36,850


480
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:48,030
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

481
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:55,250
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

482
00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:02,410
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

483
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:10,090
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

484
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:12,670
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

485
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,690
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

486
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:23,950
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

487
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:31,010
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

488
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:38,150
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

489
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:46,150
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

490
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:21,210
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

491
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:28,350
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

492
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:35,530
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

493
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:43,110
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

494
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,790
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

495
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,790
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

496
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:57,050
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

497
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:04,250
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

498
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:11,350
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

499
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:20,390
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
