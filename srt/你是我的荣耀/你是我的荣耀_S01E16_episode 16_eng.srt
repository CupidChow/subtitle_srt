1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,400
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,200
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,800
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,600
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,400
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,800
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,500
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:08,200
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:15,800
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:28,400
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
   

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,100
   

15
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,240
Last night, I checked the detailed design reports and blueprints of every subsystem.

16
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,400
Dr. Zhao, what's the difference between the currents on flats and slopes?

17
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
It's five times the number.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,600
   

19
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,000
That's the problem.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,200
The most likely cause of this issue is electromagnetic interference.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,200
This is the power line of the electric machine.

22
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,300
If the current is I,

23
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,000
and this is the hysteresis loop of the Hall effect sensor,

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,600
the distance between these two lines is 1.6 mm in standard design.

25
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,500
As for our design, the distance is also 1.6 mm.

26
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,100
There is no room for error.

27
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,800
When the current exceeds the set point,

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,800
it's possible the electric machine's Hall effect sensor will experience interference.

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,200
It's entirely possible.

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,400
How do we recreate the situation?

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,600
We can prove it with a wheel loading test.

32
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,199
The command for slope climbing is sent.

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,000
Pay attention to the waveforms and telemetry signals.

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,200
The wheel speed is inconsistent.

35
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,800
At the same time, the Hall effect sensor is showing spikes.

36
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,400
The electric machine is in PWM mode.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,000
The chopper frequency alone is over tens of thousand Hz.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,400
I just checked.

39
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,800
When we added the weight, the current was over 1000 mA.

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,000
The Hall effect sensor and the three-phase line are too close to each other.

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,400
That's the reason our Hall effect sensor is showing so many spikes.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,800
The next step is to separate the signal line

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,600
and the power line in two different directions.

44
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,800
The command for slope climbing is sent.

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Pay attention to the waveforms and the telemetry signals.

46
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,000
The wheel is operating normally.

47
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,600
The waveform from the Hall effect sensor is not showing spikes.

48
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,300
This is it. Prepare for the slope-climbing test.

49
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,600
The command for slope climbing is sent. Please observe the telemetry signals.

50
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,800
The wheel is functioning normally.

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,000
We've found the cause.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,400
Well done, everyone. We should run more tests to make sure it's fine.

53
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,300
- Okay. 
 - Sure.

54
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,800
Mr. Zhang, you should clock out early.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,400
Isn't today your girlfriend's birthday?

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,400
All right. Everyone worked hard today.

57
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,800
I'll make up for the work tomorrow.

58
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,000
It wasn't a major problem,

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but he handled it with composure.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
His work was efficient.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,800
He's undoubtedly an outstanding beginner.

62
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,500
Not bad.

63
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,600
He needs to hone his skills.

64
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
Hurry up!

65
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Director Zhang. Director Hu.

66
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,200
Fellow workers,

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,000
the rover project is a collaborative effort with researchers from Beijing.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,700
You must inform them firsthand when there is an issue.

69
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,600
The field test will be conducted next month.

70
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,800
Guan Zai was supposed to lead the team,

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,200
but he can't make it.

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,200
While he's not available,

73
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,600
Yu Tu,

74
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,000
I need you to take over some of their tasks.

75
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,900
Also, take over Research Project "One."

76
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,800
As for the follow-up work, we'll reconsider our options.

77
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,300
Understood.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yu Tu, come with me.

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,400
Guan Zai won't even make it back next month.

80
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,700
What's happened to him?

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,600
Are you keeping something from me?

82
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,400
Most importantly, Guan Zai doesn't want us to be worried.

83
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,400
But people will find out sooner or later.

84
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
He'll have surgery in two days.

85
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,200
Surgery?

86
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,600
   

87
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,600
- Xiao Shen. 
 - Director Zhang.

88
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,000
- Okay. Please sit. 
 - Director Hu.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,300
Sit down.

90
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,300
Slowly. Have a seat.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,400
   

92
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,000
   

93
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,700
Dr. Huang.

94
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Don't worry, the surgery was a success.

95
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,000
- Thank you. 
 - Thanks, doctor.

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,400
- Thank you. 
 - Don't mention it. This is our job.

97
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
When can we see him?

98
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,600
After the anesthetic wears off and he's come to, then you can see him.

99
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,300
The family should visit a few days after the surgery.

100
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,400
The patient needs to rest. Okay?

101
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay. We'll leave after we see him.

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,400
Okay. I'll leave you be.

103
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,000
- Yes, thank you. 
 - Thank you, Doctor.

104
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,200
   

105
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,900
I'll get everyone some drinks.

106
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,800
- Guan Zai. 
 - Older Brother.

107
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,860
   

108
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,400
   

109
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,000
Twelfth drive cycle, sixth round, complete.

110
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,600
That's all. Let's call it a day.

111
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,400
You didn't talk much today.

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,800
I'm in a bad mood.

113
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
Is it because of Old Guan?

114
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,800
Let's focus on doing our jobs first.

115
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,200
Don't make him worry while bedridden.

116
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,899
Now that Old Guan is in the hospital, would someone take over Research Project "One"?

117
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,600
You're here. He just fell asleep.

118
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,400
Are you awake?

119
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,800
Why are you here?

120
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,200
Where is Guan Zhu?

121
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,000
He left to buy some food.

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,500
Have some water.

123
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,300
Just one sip will do.

124
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,400
That day you were here with Director Hu.

125
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
Are you working at the institute again?

126
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,600
Yes.

127
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,600
Not resigning anymore?

128
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,300
I'm not resigning.

129
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Are you doing this for me?

130
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,200
Don't be so dense.

131
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Right.

132
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,700
I have the plans for One's modifications. Have you checked them?

133
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,800
What do you think?

134
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,700
Before I left for Xi'an, you already sent me the plans.

135
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,200
Were you so certain I would be back?

136
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,400
If you didn't come back,

137
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,600
then I'd consider my effort going down the drain.

138
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,800
I read it.

139
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Some of the modifications are viable.

140
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,900
They don't affect performance.

141
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,200
However, there are some unrealistic goals

142
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,500
that I want to realize.

143
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,800
I knew you would say that.

144
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,300
You're the most stubborn one.

145
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,000
You have my support.

146
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,700
But I'm sick.

147
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,800
It's hard to tell.

148
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,300
I can no longer be in charge of the project.

149
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,600
You lack experience.

150
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,600
You're not up for the job.

151
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
Yes.

152
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,600
I considered the options.

153
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,400
The person who's most likely to take over your job is Tong Bo.

154
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,400
Tong Bo is a kind person.

155
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,600
He's a professional.

156
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,800
I talked to him about this matter.

157
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
There's no one else here.

158
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,000
So I'll be frank with you.

159
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,200
I think his mindset is too conventional.

160
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,800
He lacks imagination for the future.

161
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,800
His work might not have a good prospect internationally in a few years.

162
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
Big Meng, Xiao Hu, and I discussed it.

163
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,800
We wish to carry on with the current plan.

164
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,200
We aren't very experienced in this field.

165
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,100
The best solution is for our professor to lead us.

166
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,200
But this solution requires his consent on the matter.

167
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,600
As for Tong Bo, it's a little over a month from the launch.

168
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,200
Xi'an Control will take over the satellite after two months.

169
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,100
During that period of time,

170
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,400
we'll try again and persuade him to take the job.

171
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,200
Okay.

172
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,300
You've only been here for a few days,

173
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,500
but you've been attentive to every aspect.

174
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,600
I'll try my best while following order.

175
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Don't shout some slogan.

176
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,400
Give project "One" a name.

177
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,900
A name?

178
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,200
That seems unnecessary.

179
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,700
We should stop calling it One.

180
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Give it a proper name.

181
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,100
Me?

182
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Yes. You get to decide.

183
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,100
 In the seemingly endless cosmos, 

184
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,300
 we search for the truth of human and Earth's origins. 

185
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,000
 In this infinite time and space, 

186
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,300
 we search for the existence of another God's miraculous work. 

187
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Its duty is to prove that humans are not alone in this world.

188
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,300
We'll call it... the "God Searcher."

189
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,100
Great.

190
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,400
Don't visit me too often.

191
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
One...

192
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,000
No.

193
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,600
I leave "God Searcher" and the rest of the project in your care.

194
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,600
I won't let you down.

195
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,800
 Are you always so well-coordinated? 

196
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,900
 He used Zhuge Liang while you used Shouyue. 

197
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,200
 Not really. He can perform well with any position. 

198
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,300
 He does well with any hero. 

199
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,500
 So he's been coaching me. 

200
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,300
Why did you ask me out in the middle of the night?

201
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,400
Is this about Yu Tu again?

202
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,000
I watched the video in the group chat.

203
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,200
Every time the bunch of us from college had a gathering,

204
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,600
you always found a way to pry information about Yu Tu out of us.

205
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,800
Is that so?

206
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,000
You told us he was childish, selfish, and a perfectionist,

207
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,200
that you never regretted breaking up with him.

208
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,800
Why is it so hard to move on?

209
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,600
Was I wrong?

210
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,700
Wasn't he selfish?

211
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,500
He gave up a handsome salary for his dream to be an aerospace engineer.

212
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,800
Had I not broken up with him back then,

213
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,300
I would have to provide for our family by myself.

214
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,800
Look at the housing prices. Life in Beijing only gets more costly.

215
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,800
It costs a fortune to pay for a kid's education.

216
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,000
Why should I take on the burdens all by myself?

217
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,200
Everyone has their own pursuit.

218
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,400
And most importantly,

219
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,000
both you and Yu Tu are the self-centered type.

220
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,600
When you run into an argument,

221
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,800
neither of you will make any compromise.

222
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,700
It was a subtle breakup.

223
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,200
It's been years since you broke up.

224
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
You dated after that too.

225
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Why do you care so much about his new relationship?

226
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,000
He broke up with you.

227
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,800
It's not like you still own his heart.

228
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,400
He can date anyone.

229
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,800
Anyone but Qiao Jingjing.

230
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,900
 Up next. Let's welcome the gold medalist of the National Mathematics Championship, 
   

231
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,740
 Yu Tu from Class 5, Third Year, to give his speech. 

232
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,000
 Let's welcome him. 

233
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,200
 Yu Tu is amazing. He won again. 

234
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,000
 I heard that Qiao Jingjing has a crush on him. 

235
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 You sound so surprised. 

236
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,600
 There are plenty of girls who like him. 

237
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,600
 Do you think Yu Tu would fall for Qiao Jingjing? She is very pretty. 

238
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,700
 I think... he might. 

239
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,000
Is that what bothers you?

240
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,800
I wouldn't be bothered.

241
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,100
Her grades were mediocre in high school.

242
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,100
She confessed to Yu Tu, but he turned her down.

243
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,200
Yu Tu was never interested in her.

244
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,000
But now...

245
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,400
I must say, fame sure does come in handy.

246
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,960
I'm leaving for Shanghai.

247
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,100
   

248
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,720
Hello?

249
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,119
 Yu Tu, Xia Qing is in Shanghai. 

250
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:29,960
 She wants to make it up to us for last time and treat us to dinner. 

251
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,480
 She asked me to invite you. 

252
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,039
 Tonight or tomorrow night are okay. 

253
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm busy. Tell her I won't be joining.

254
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,559
 Okay, I was just asking. It's better that you don't go. 

255
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:40,540
 Otherwise Qu Ming will get under your skin again. 

256
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
   

257
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,619
 Yu Tu. 

258
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,099
Ms. Qiao... Who is she?

259
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,459
It's Jingjing, of course.

260
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:53,399
Ever since you went back to work,

261
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,720
you've barely been at home.

262
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,279
Seeing you in person is more difficult than winning ten matches in a row.

263
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,979
Be realistic.

264
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:01,939
Ten-game win streak in solo matchmaking.

265
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,440
Fine.

266
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,940
You don't carry me anymore, and you haven't been playing.

267
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,119
Xia Qing came to Shanghai and asked me out for a drink.

268
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,579
You know what that means and what she wants.

269
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,039
It's the weekend tomorrow.

270
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:25,539
- If you have the time... 
 - I'm busy. I don't see the point either.

271
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,040
Fine.

272
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,800
Don't eat too much.

273
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,119
 Yu Tu is quite busy. 

274
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:01,599
 You know about them aerospace people. The team is always working overtime. 

275
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:03,480
 He is too busy to hang out. 

276
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,420
 He lives in the suburbs. A round trip takes three hours. 

277
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,380
 Send me the address of his workplace. 

278
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,700
She is very persistent.

279
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,200
   
 Zhai Liang told me you were working overtime. 

280
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,040
 Do you have time to grab a tea later? 

281
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,200
   

282
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,580
That's all for our plans for the field test.

283
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,700
Are there any questions?

284
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,779
Very well. Dismissed.

285
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:12,159
It's the weekend, go home and rest well.

286
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,640
 I'm waiting at the coffee shop next to your workplace. 

287
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,279
We got off work at 8 p.m. We can bear hardship,

288
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,200
we have no fear of overtime work.

289
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,580
Let's go. Let's have hot pot together.

290
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,359
Go on without me. I have things to do.

291
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,679
See you.

292
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,680
Miss, do you need more water?

293
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,839
Never mind.

294
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,039
Very well.

295
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,860
 Yu Tu. 

296
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:17,339
 Have you decided on what I told you earlier? 

297
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,299
 If you have no plans for our future, 

298
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,100
 then we might as well break up. 

299
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,780
 Fine. I have no problems with it. 

300
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,399
 If I could win his heart back then, I can win it again. 

301
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,579
 They were just playing games. What's the big deal? 

302
00:25:48,579 --> 00:25:50,960
 Don't be so obsessed with him. 

303
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,019
 Tons of people are wooing you, but you want to get him back? 

304
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:57,759
 Yu Tu is still working in the institute. 

305
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,399
 He's still getting that meager salary. That doesn't bother you now? 

306
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:04,560
 I don't care about his salary now. 

307
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:08,350
 He has a Ph.D., and works in the institute. 

308
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,730
 At least his social status is high. 

309
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,980
 Not to mention... 

310
00:26:14,499 --> 00:26:16,240
 I can't move on. 

311
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,260
 I just can't move on. 

312
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,400
Your workplace is quite a distance from downtown.

313
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,519
Zhai Liang told me your phone often has no reception.

314
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:51,240
He was right.

315
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,039
Is it for confidentiality? Can't you have phones inside the lab?

316
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,779
Why did you want to see me?

317
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
I've been waiting for over two hours.

318
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,919
Do you expect me to leave after just a few words?

319
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:06,079
Did you have dinner? Should we order some food?

320
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,579
I've had dinner.

321
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:11,359
Sir, may I take your order?

322
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,480
Okay. No, thanks.

323
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,959
Sure.

324
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,140
Zhai Liang and I sat here for a while.

325
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,359
I heard you started working at the institute again.

326
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,659
Yes.

327
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:30,380
He is worried about you.

328
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,659
He knew you were stressed. But he didn't want to pry.

329
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,259
Is there some issue with the investment bank?

330
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,079
No.

331
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:41,000
I'm more suited for the institute.

332
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,399
A person's mindset can change.

333
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:53,019
I think you're a man of focus. The job at the institute suits you.

334
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,559
We were talking about it last night at the gathering.

335
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:01,639
I even joked that your brilliant mind should best be used for contributions to science.

336
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,340
I even argued with you over this matter in the past.

337
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,659
I was too young and silly.

338
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,399
I thought I was right.

339
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,040
By the way, how did you end up playing games with Qiao Jingjing?

340
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,799
We were discussing it during the gathering last night.

341
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,639
Some blamed us for not telling people we studied in the same high school as her.

342
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,680
It's hard to tell people about it.

343
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,040
We barely know her. Did you two also drink together?

344
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,959
I pondered on it, but that seemed unlikely.

345
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,579
So as soon as they left,

346
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,119
I came by to confirm it with you.

347
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,600
So it really was her.

348
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,600
We were high school classmates.

349
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,660
It's normal that we stayed in touch.

350
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,340
Indeed.

351
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,960
But she was never in the class group chat.

352
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,040
I thought she didn't like hanging out with her old classmates.

353
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,499
Perhaps... she is the most successful from our class.

354
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,600
We, on the other hand, haven't achieved anything.

355
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,900
The moment we step into society, grades won't do us any merit.

356
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,919
It comes down to our EQ.

357
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,060
She graduated from a key university.

358
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:58,459
Is that so?

359
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:02,759
I didn't pay much attention to her back then.

360
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:05,900
But I do find her achievement impressive.

361
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,680
Entertainment is a complicated industry.

362
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,079
There are bad people in the business.

363
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:14,499
She has managed to find success and become famous,

364
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:16,760
she must have sacrificed a lot.

365
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,760
Xia Qing.

366
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,640
I think... I owe you an apology.

367
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,039
I agreed to date you back then because you were capable and independent.

368
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:42,399
But it never occurred to me that I should return your love.

369
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,819
It turned out that I was not an ideal choice for you.

370
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:53,120
But you were always smart. You put an end to our relationship in time.

371
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,919
Is this supposed to be your generosity?

372
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:26,317
It's been too long since we last talked.

373
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,120
This is uncalled for.

374
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,719
I see now why you chose to return to the institute.

375
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:40,240
After all, worldly possessions no longer concern you.

376
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,420
Hold on to your precious chance.

377
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,279
♪  Happy Birthday to you!  ♪

378
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,420
 Jingjing, blow out the candles! 

379
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,700
 Happy Birthday! 

380
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,199
I...

381
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,259
I sent Xia Qing the address of your workplace. I hope you're not offended.

382
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:45,920
It's all right.

383
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,619
It was mostly because she seemed a little persistent this time around.

384
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,879
I doubt she would contact me again.

385
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,900
A heart of stone.

386
00:33:58,039 --> 00:33:59,959
I forgot to remind you.

387
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:02,339
Did you tell them Jingjing and I...

388
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,680
were playing games together?

389
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,280
Of course not. You told me not to tell anyone.

390
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,880
I just pretended I didn't know her.

391
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,620
I won't tell others how bad she was at the game.

392
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:21,300
So... in your heart, she's...

393
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,559
Cotton is pretty adorable.

394
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:34,760
She is energetic and cute. She's like a little girl.

395
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:40,400
You two studied in the same high school, but the distance... is a little too far.

396
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,419
I'm not saying she's beyond your league.

397
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,700
I think...

398
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,639
We played games with her for almost two months,

399
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:57,040
and she disappeared without a word.

400
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,720
A superstar should always keep her distance from us.

401
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,760
Did you

402
00:35:11,516 --> 00:35:13,376
see her go online again?

403
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:15,920
I checked the game history.

404
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,580
It's stopped on the day of your match.

405
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,410
The last two matches were impressive.

406
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:30,699
She gave me two tickets and invited both of us.

407
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:33,139
But I didn't tell you.

408
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,560
What?

409
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,259
Did she give me a ticket, too?

410
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,860
It's on the bookshelves.

411
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,321
Zhai Liang.

412
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,140
I made her upset. That's why she's gone.

413
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,460
Don't misunderstand her.

414
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:47,610


415
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:59,630
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

416
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:06,750
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

417
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:13,910
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

418
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:21,590
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

419
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:23,970
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

420
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:28,250
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

421
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:35,450
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

422
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:42,510
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

423
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:49,750
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
 that we failed to treasure  ♫

424
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:57,750
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

425
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:32,710
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

426
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:39,850
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

427
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:47,030
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

428
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:54,710
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

429
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,290
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

430
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:01,290
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

431
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:08,450
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

432
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:15,650
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

433
00:39:15,650 --> 00:39:22,850
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
 in the passing time  ♫

434
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:32,670
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
