1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:18,060


2
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,450
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,210
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,650
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,530
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,330
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:29,090
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:40,150
   

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,480
 It's been a long time since I last saw scholar-god. 

16
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,360
He's still as handsome as before.

17
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,199
Tell me. Why is his driver's license in the back seat of your car?

18
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,759
What did you two do in the car?

19
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,356
We didn't do anything.

20
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:23,159
I don't believe you.

21
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,639
I saw you playing at the Honor of Kings match together.

22
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,560
I asked you about that too. What did you tell me?

23
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,639
You said you met coincidentally him in the game,

24
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,260
so you invited him to watch the match together.

25
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,440
Look at what happened.

26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,200
His driving license was in the back seat of your car.

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,939
How did you get in touch?

28
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:43,800
I met him in the game.

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,597
He played well,

30
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,960
so I asked him to teach me.

31
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,820
Then you met each other in real life too.

32
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,635
Something like that.

33
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:57,120
Because back then, I couldn't play well.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,260
So he came over to my house to teach me how to play.

35
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,880
So were you two alone?

36
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,039
There were Zhao Yun, Li Bai, and Zhuge Liang. 
  (T/N: heroes in the game) 

37
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,558
Those Junglers don't count. 
  (T/N: literally wild men) 

38
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:14,520
Zhuge Liang is the Mid.

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,219
Qiao Jingjing, even if you're telling me all the lame jokes,

40
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:22,039
you can't stop me from being curious.

41
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,640
Then what happened?

42
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,680
Are you dating?

43
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,300
Why didn't you tell me about that?

44
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,780
Think about it. If I'm really dating him,

45
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,650
would I be here having a drink with you?

46
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,360
That makes sense.

47
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,200
For you, it's always dates before mates.

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,120
But you can't say it as if it were the right thing to do.

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,559
What I was saying is,

50
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,520
if I were really dating him,

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,200
I wouldn't come here alone. I would surely bring along my plus-one.

52
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,039
You're right.

53
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:56,998
Oh, no. Jingjing.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,400
It seemed like someone took a photo of us. 
    

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,919
They uploaded it to their Moments. 
    

56
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:03,159
The photo has been circulating and even spread to our classmates chatroom.

57
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,659
Look at this.

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,760
When did they take this photo? 
    

59
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,999
They are so good at this.

60
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,162
I'll just play dead.

61
00:04:17,379 --> 00:04:21,260
But then again, why did you start playing Honor of Kings?

62
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,439
I saw you playing and thought it was interesting.

63
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,720
So I started playing.

64
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,419
Jingjing, what account are you using?

65
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:31,440
My main account is my QQ account.

66
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,100
I was busy last month so I didn't get to play.

67
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,240
If you want to play, I'll use my WeChat account to play with you.

68
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,640
Okay.

69
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,040
All right.

70
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,020
Since you're willing to coach me,

71
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,260
I won't interrogate you anymore.

72
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,759
You're so secretive. You won't tell me anything.

73
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,000
I know what you were trying to do. You were trying to change the subject.

74
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:52,418
You're so mean.

75
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:53,920
This was really unexpected.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,399
So many years have passed,

77
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,839
and you were still able to get in touch with Yu Tu.

78
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,339
It must be fate.

79
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:09,845
I didn't expect that either.

80
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,779
- Okay. Don't worry. 
 - You do the talking.

81
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,060
This is hot.

82
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,979
Yu Tu, sit here.

83
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,519
I have something to tell you.

84
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,820
The young girl I mentioned during the meal,

85
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,600
don't you want to consider meeting her?

86
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,879
You haven't even seen her photos.

87
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,120
Take a look.

88
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,499
You should meet her.

89
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:41,800
Give yourself a chance.

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,380
It won't waste much of your time.

91
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,199
Aunt, there's no need for that.

92
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,020
I don't want to waste her time.

93
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,796
You guys carry on.

94
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,820
   

95
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,620
   

96
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,399
Yu Tu sent you so many messages,

97
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,560
and you didn't reply at all.

98
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,460
- There aren't many messages. 
 - That's a lot.

99
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,120
What are you doing? Concentrate on your game.

100
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,600
I'm updating the app.

101
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,680
Jingjing, you're so great.

102
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,800
You... Can I have a look?

103
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
When I was dating my husband,

104
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,760
I took hundreds of screenshots of our conversations and sent them to you.

105
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,399
Did I ask you to do that?

106
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:06,099
You sent it to me and took up my phone's storage.

107
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:08,839
You're so mean.

108
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,400
But, anyway, I feel rather pleased.

109
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,120
Have you ever seen the scholar-god behaving like this?

110
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,639
Jing, how do you really feel about him?

111
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,639
If you have feelings for him, don't keep him waiting.

112
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,199
The scholar-god is a proud man.

113
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,399
I'm not keeping him waiting.

114
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,317
Jing, can you lend me your Honor of Kings' account?

115
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:48,839
I want to try playing as a high-level player.

116
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,959
Are you trying to set a trap for others?

117
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,439
I'm not.

118
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,399
I play quite well too.

119
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,979
Unfortunately, I haven't got any ranking.

120
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,820
Please.

121
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,720
No. I'll get reported for that.

122
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:09,079
I really want to play as a high-level player.

123
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,420
All right. Here.

124
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,120
Pass it back if you're losing.

125
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,920
Okay. Got it. You're the best.

126
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,038
 Can I defeat anyone? 

127
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,119
 Pass it to me if you're losing. 

128
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,260
You have a cute nickname.

129
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,299
Hand-picked Cotton.

130
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:35,000
You...

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,800
You have such a high win rate. 
    

132
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,559
You even have two Penta Kills.

133
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,879
That's so amazing.

134
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,479
What?

135
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,960
Two Penta Kills.

136
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,900
Did you forget your own achievement?

137
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,440
   

138
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,039
 What do you want for your birthday? 
   

139
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,579
 Give me a Penta Kill. 

140
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,740
 So far, I haven't gotten a Penta Kill. 

141
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,260
 Ms. Qiao, you're invited to present the Best Toplaner Award. 

142
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,039
 - Okay. I'll go now. 
 - You go ahead. 

143
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,757
 I'll go now. 

144
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,360
 - Thank you. 
 - Jingjing, you've worked hard. 

145
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,700
Jingjing.

146
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,700
Jingjing.

147
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,620
What's wrong?

148
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,320
Peipei,

149
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,498
if a person bid you goodbye,

150
00:09:54,498 --> 00:09:58,040
but later prepared a birthday present for you in secret,

151
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,100
what do you think that would imply?

152
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,279
That...

153
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,660
Perhaps, he has his own reasons.

154
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,240
 I don't want to like someone more than he likes me. 

155
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,199
 This is not a valid reason. 

156
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,159
 I don't like you less than you like me. 

157
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,931
 Yes, you do. 

158
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,771
 You said that we were not suitable for each other. 

159
00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:32,839
 When you truly like someone, you'll be reckless. 

160
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,838
 You won't hesitate or struggle. You won't overthink. 

161
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,526
 I'm probably different from you. 

162
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,940
 I think too much. 

163
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,240
 I've even thought about the rest of my life. 

164
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,700
Jingjing, what's wrong with you?

165
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm just a little sad.

166
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:28,540
Are our classmates gathering at the karaoke?

167
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,780
   

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,160
- Hey. 
  - Hello, Yu Tu. 

169
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,059
 It's our high school reunion today. We're gathering at the karaoke. 

170
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:39,900
 Do you want to join us? 

171
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,539
You have fun. I'll skip.

172
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:44,760
 I knew it. 

173
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,039
 But if you are free, come join us. 

174
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,378
 Even Qiao Jingjing is coming. 

175
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:50,459
What did you say?

176
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,459
 Qiao Jingjing. The superstar. 

177
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,157
 She said she would be joining the reunion. 

178
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:58,128
I'm going out. Don't wait for me.

179
00:11:58,128 --> 00:12:00,108
Where are you going?

180
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,620
I shouldn't have asked him.

181
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,280
The beautiful girl must have asked him out again.

182
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,481
Jingjing, our Class Monitor said that they moved to a bigger room.

183
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:16,059
It's at B11 of Zone B.

184
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:17,759
It's here.

185
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:21,159
Is it that room?

186
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,279
We're here.

187
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,639
Let's go.

188
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,039
Peipei.

189
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,519
Superstar!

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,240
Keep it down.

191
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,960
What are you doing?

192
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,560
Friends.

193
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,838
Jingjing, let's drink.

194
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,639
Jingjing, since we graduated from high school, we haven't seen each other.

195
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:46,579
I was so surprised when I saw you on TV.

196
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:49,639
I didn't expect my classmate to become a superstar.

197
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,258
Isn't she pretty?

198
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:54,399
Jingjing, my daughter is a fan of yours.

199
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,958
You are a mother now.

200
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,120
She was the first one to get married among our classmates.

201
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,679
Her husband is right there.

202
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,039
Qiao Jingjing, it's been a while.

203
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,293
So you guys resolved your issues?

204
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,480
I'm going to pick a song.

205
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,240
You go pick the songs. I'll say a few words.

206
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,600
This year's reunion is one of the rare chances to have so many of us gathering together.

207
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,039
- Am I right? 
 - Yes.

208
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,557
Thanks to who?

209
00:13:33,557 --> 00:13:35,159
Jingjing.

210
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,599
Thanks to Jingjing.

211
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:38,960
Let's see who's absent.

212
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,259
The two smart students are not here, right?

213
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,721
I asked Xia Qing.

214
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:47,977
She went back to her hometown to attend her family gathering.

215
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,797
What about Yu Tu? He is not here either.

216
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,039
I called Yu Tu.

217
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,100
He didn't check the chatroom. I'm not sure if he'll come.

218
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,500
Then...

219
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,000
Jingjing, aren't you and Yu Tu close?

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,800
Yes. We saw the video of you two playing games together.

221
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,238
He'll listen to you.

222
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,600
I'm sure he will.

223
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,759
We haven't contacted each other since that game.

224
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,819
Exactly. They didn't stay in touch.

225
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:13,799
Why don't I sing a song?

226
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,080
Sure.

227
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,616
Good.

228
00:14:16,616 --> 00:14:18,358
Let me remind you.

229
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,280
We are all classmates and good friends.

230
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,080
After we take pictures, don't upload them to Moments.

231
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,279
That's for sure. Don't worry.

232
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,080
Qiao Jingjing, which song do you want to sing?

233
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,519
This one is good.

234
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,019
Okay.

235
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:50,050

Nice song, Jingjing.

254
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,200
- One more song. 
 - You sing so well.

255
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,840
That's too much.

256
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,961
- I'll sing a song for you. 
 - Nice.

257
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:33,039
Yu Tu is here.

258
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,800
Yu Tu.

259
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,960
Qiao Jingjing is here. Yu Tu is here, too.

260
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,880
You're late. Drink as penalty.

261
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,680
- Yes, you should. 
 - Top student, long time no see.

262
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,257
What have you been up to?

263
00:17:43,257 --> 00:17:45,640
Yu Tu, why are you still so handsome?

264
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,340
I'm bald already.

265
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:49,120
Let me have a look.

266
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,879
Yu Tu is still so popular.

267
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:53,541
Reminds me of our high school years.

268
00:17:53,543 --> 00:17:55,659
Back then, our class was doing so well.

269
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,520
Not only did we get first place in exams...

270
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,641
It's been a while.

271
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:00,319
We also had the most handsome guy in school.

272
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,132
Every time I spoke of our class, I felt so proud.

273
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:06,790
Too bad Xia Qing isn't here today.

274
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,530
Otherwise...

275
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,680
Jingjing, how do you usually take care of your skin?

276
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,519
Why do you look younger and younger?

277
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,680
Yes.

278
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,559
Everyone looks pretty young too.

279
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,880
Lately, I've started using a new skincare product.

280
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,100
It's a very nice product.

281
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,880
But it's difficult to pronounce its name. Let me see.

282
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,780
What are you doing?

283
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,757
You're playing with your phones again. Aren't we here to sing?

284
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:30,200
Let's drink, Brothers.

285
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,680
Come.

286
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,380
Let's drink. Get Yu Tu some drinks.

287
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,280
Wait a minute.

288
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,319
I have something to do.

289
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,459
You go ahead.

290
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:40,459
Sure.

291
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,683
Are you here because of me?

292
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,480
I forgive you.

293
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,399
Thank you.

294
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,439
Let's go.

295
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,419
Yu Tu.

296
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,490
What are you saying?

297
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,219
Why don't you find yourself a seat?

298
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,180
Let's go.

299
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,319
Sorry. We need to go.

300
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,019
You guys have fun.

301
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,019
Friends.

302
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,660
Was I hallucinating?

303
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,519
So the two of them resolved their issues too?

304
00:21:07,317 --> 00:21:11,317
Friends, let's create a chatroom for everyone present today.

305
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:12,880
I'll send everyone Red Packets.

306
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,039
Sure!

307
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,739
I'll pay the bill. I'll pay the bill.

308
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:55,240
You...You...

309
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,140
Why?

310
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,398
On the day of the match,

311
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,797
when I was on stage presenting the award,

312
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,359
you took my phone and got me two Penta Kills.

313
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:39,659
Didn't you say that you wouldn't get me a present?

314
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,639
Why did you do that?

315
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,858
I didn't play with you.

316
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:46,679
I didn't think it counted.

317
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,937
Is it because of that?

318
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,460
No.

319
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,643
I'm just wondering

320
00:23:08,281 --> 00:23:11,160
how you knew the password to my phone?

321
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,219
I saw it accidentally.

322
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:17,557
You played two rounds,

323
00:23:17,557 --> 00:23:19,557
and won two Penta Kills.

324
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,119
My rank wasn't that low.

325
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,417
I told my teammates,

326
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:28,219
"Give me the money. I'll carry you."

327
00:23:28,219 --> 00:23:31,718
Someone in the second game asked, "Why should I?"

328
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,300
Then I answered,

329
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,355
"My girlfriend is watching."

330
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:38,460
"Brother, please do me a favor."

331
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:49,420
That is not like you.

332
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,241
I'm not like me now too.

333
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,279
Can we stop talking about the game?

334
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,880
Then what should we talk about?

335
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,680
Does it mean that you've said yes?

336
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:18,160
I remember, at that time, I asked you other questions too.

337
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,238
Yes.

338
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,251
About immigration to Mars.

339
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,000
You have to keep writing.

340
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,200
- Sure. 
 - But, you don't have to stay up late.

341
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,462
I'm not in a hurry.

342
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:40,905
All right.

343
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,319
The elevator is cramped. We might as well take the stairs.

344
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,519
They're having a date at the fire escape stairs.

345
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,160
I think there's a story behind them.

346
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,538
The guy is so good-looking.

347
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:00,998
He has a girlfriend.

348
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:02,640
Look at how thin his girlfriend is.

349
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,438
She must be pretty too.

350
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,858
I'll start my diet plan after the New Year.

351
00:25:06,858 --> 00:25:09,200
Teacher Yu is so handsome.

352
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,357
When I'm with you,

353
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,340
even the fire escape stairs have become a dangerous place.

354
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,680
Then you have to get used to it as soon as possible.

355
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,582
I've already gotten used to this.

356
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:23,438
Let's go somewhere else.

357
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,580
Where can we go? It's crowded everywhere.

358
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:31,440
I'm sure there's a place that is empty.

359
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,960
   

360
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,120
- You can go in now. 
 - Thank you. Okay.

361
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,000
- Thank you, Sir. 
 - You may go in.

362
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,459
It's so late now. Why did he allow us to come in?

363
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:14,640
I told him that I was a student here.

364
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,160
I wanted to show my school to my girlfriend.

365
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,437
He said he still remembered me.

366
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:22,740
Scholar-God Yu Tu. Of course, he remembers.

367
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:27,279
Unfortunately, it's not convenient for my girlfriend to show her face.

368
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,219
Otherwise, we could enter the school even more easily.

369
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:31,819
You're right.

370
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:39,000
In fact, I was here in the morning. He didn't notice me.

371
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,950
Were you here this morning?

372
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,037
What happened to the field?

373
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,198
I guess they are expanding.

374
00:27:01,198 --> 00:27:02,880
Oh, yes.

375
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,179
Did you once pick flowers with some other female students

376
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:09,303
and got reprimanded by our class teacher?

377
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:13,772
Can't you remember something good about me?

378
00:27:18,699 --> 00:27:20,199
Let's go.

379
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,640
Back then, after I finished eating at the canteen.

380
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,720
I would take this way to go back to the classroom.

381
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,240
At that time, I thought our school was the most beautiful place.

382
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,317
I think you rarely came here.

383
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,918
I was usually at the field,

384
00:27:51,918 --> 00:27:53,878
so I seldom ran into you.

385
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,398
Once, I ran into you...

386
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:57,759
There.

387
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,759
Do you remember that incident?

388
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,840
 Yu Tu, are you free? 

389
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,797
 I have a question for you. 

390
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,760
 Sure. Go ahead. 

391
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,040
 Yu Tu, do you not have a girlfriend right now? 

392
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,300
 If so, what do you think of me? 

393
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:27,119
When we were on our way,

394
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:29,240
I was thinking about something.

395
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,940
What is it?

396
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,905
What should I do if you bring up the past?

397
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,640
Not today.

398
00:28:43,728 --> 00:28:45,828
But I might in the future.

399
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,794
I'm looking forward to it.

400
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,660
We've arrived.

401
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,491
I can't see anything.

402
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:47,259
Look. They have changed all the desks and chairs.

403
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:51,479
That's for sure. It's been more than ten years.

404
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:53,799
Your seat was in the last row.

405
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:57,180
Do you remember where my seat was?

406
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,180
In the third row.

407
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:04,860
Do you remember everyone's seats?

408
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,140
I don't believe you cared about where I sat.

409
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,680
Lately, I've been trying to recall what happened in high school.

410
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,441
Then what have you recalled?

411
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,740
I recalled how you bribed me with fried chicken to teach you math.

412
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,820
Why do you only recall the bad things?

413
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,119
I can bring up the past too.

414
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,400
At that time, I had a goal

415
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,779
that I failed to achieve.

416
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,559
You wanted to go to the same university as me.

417
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,280
How do you know?

418
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:55,560
I read the conversation in the Space Fans chatroom.

419
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,993
You even found the chatroom.

420
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,600
I believe that you've really been trying to recall everything.

421
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:11,459
In fact, I was pretty depressed during that time.

422
00:31:11,459 --> 00:31:14,040
I got good grades in junior high school.

423
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,318
I was very confident.

424
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,378
But when I started high school,

425
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,518
my results were not as good as before.

426
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:24,987
I always thought that as long as I worked hard enough,

427
00:31:24,987 --> 00:31:27,567
I would get a better score.

428
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:31,259
I only found out later

429
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:36,240
that hard work doesn't always pay off.

430
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,007
I should have taught you.

431
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,808
Would you have the patience?

432
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,199
I would.

433
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:57,079
What if I had been really stupid and understood nothing?

434
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,060
You would have understood it well

435
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,117
because I was really smart.

436
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,618
Can you not take this chance to compliment yourself?

437
00:32:05,618 --> 00:32:12,000
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

438
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:20,500
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

439
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:27,500
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

440
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:34,100
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy  ♫

441
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,340
♫  Of the future you want  ♫

442
00:32:53,010 --> 00:33:02,970


443
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:13,680
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

444
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:20,880
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

445
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,790
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

446
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:35,540
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

448
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,200
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

449
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:49,460
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

450
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,860
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

451
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:03,560
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

452
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:11,400
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

453
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:46,600
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

454
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:53,940
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

455
00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:01,160
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

456
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:08,760
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

457
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,240
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

458
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,540
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

459
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:22,600
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

460
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:28,000
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

461
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:36,840
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

462
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:47,740
