1
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:15,020


2
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,350
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,210
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,450
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,750
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,530
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,330
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:29,390
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,050
   

14
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,260
   

16
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,700
   

17
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,280
   

18
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,159
 Today, we will launch God Searcher. 

19
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,678
I wish you all great success.

20
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,840
We'll do the roll call now, starting with scheduling staff.

21
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,520
- Electrical logging instructor. 
 - Here.

22
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,120
- Electrical logging operator. 
 - Here.

23
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,760
- Integrated electronics engineer. 
 - Here.

24
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,919
- Payload test conductor. 
 - Here.

25
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,720
- Attitude and orbit control engineer. 
 - Here.

26
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,520
   

27
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,800
We will now conduct a launch status check for God Searcher.

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,520
Electrical logging instructor, please give the command.

29
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,759
Noted.

30
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,240
Operator, power up the integrator of the space probe.

31
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,740
Noted.

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,540
   

33
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:38,358
The integrator has been powered up successfully.

34
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,860
Noted.

35
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,227
The measurement and control system has entered self-assessment.

36
00:03:42,227 --> 00:03:43,727
Understood.

37
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,080
The measurement and control system has completed the self-assessment.

38
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,240
Everything is normal.

39
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,940
Understood.

40
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,600
   

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,281
Tourists from Qingdao, Shandong. This way. Hop on the bus.

42
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:04,120
We'll set off soon. Hurry up.

43
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,960
- Get on the bus. 
 - Bus to Wenchang for the rocket launch.

44
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
We have three seats left. Over here.

45
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,640
We'll send you directly to the best observation point.

46
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,860
Today, our nation's first Solar System Boundary Explorer, God Searcher, will be launched.

47
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,040
I'm currently at Haikou Meilan International Airport.

48
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,640
Today, people from all over the world will gather here.

49
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,180
They all have the same destination, the Haijiao Launch Center.

50
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,639
 Hi, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning. 

51
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,239
 We have just arrived at Wenchang, and are on our way to Tonggu Mountain. 

52
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:35,759
Everyone, say hi to the viewers.

53
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:42,359
Our destination is one of the best observation points in Wenchang to watch the rocket launch.

54
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:47,480
 It is said that the bridge we just crossed will be officially closed at 5 p.m. later. 

55
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,900
 If you are planning to watch the rocket launch live, please come early. 

56
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,539
He canceled my alarm.

57
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,759
- Hello. 
  - Did you just get up? 

58
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,220
He canceled my alarm.

59
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,439
 No way. 

60
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,439
 Haven't you been waiting for this day to come to send Mr. Yu off for his expedition? 

61
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,020
It's okay.

62
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,620
I can send him off wherever I am.

63
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,881
I need to go. I am meeting other family members. We're going to try the steamed buns.

64
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,620
 Steamed buns? 

65
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,839
The famous steamed buns sold at the launch center.

66
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,840
The bun of success.

67
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,710
   

68
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,260
   

69
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:03,360
   

70
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,860
Mr. Wang.

71
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,800
Mr. Yu.

72
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,720
We are done with the launch status check.

73
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,240
How's your progress?

74
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,720
We have already fueled the rocket.

75
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,179
All the indicators have met the launch requirements, and are good to go.

76
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:20,300
- Let's cross-check all the indicators again. 
 - Sure.

77
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,100
   

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,959
He was already gone when I woke up in the morning.

79
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,040
I set an alarm and planned to send him off in the morning.

80
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,579
I didn't expect him to cancel my alarm.

81
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:51,179
My wife did the same thing too.

82
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,361
Everyone's here. Let's go.

83
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:55,161
- All right. Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

84
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,799
- Professor Zhao, let's go. 
 - This way.

85
00:06:57,799 --> 00:06:59,718
I'm so happy today.

86
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,620
Yes.

87
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,959
   

88
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,160
This is the command and control center.

89
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,319
Later, you can watch the launch of the rocket here.

90
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,759
This is the closest observation point to the rocket in the entire Wenchang.

91
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,515
Let's go to the command and control hall on the tenth floor.

92
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:23,720
Is this the place we always see on television?

93
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
Yes. It is.

94
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,680
When we get there, please don't make noise.

95
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,319
We must not disturb the staff.

96
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,561
- All right? 
 - Okay.

97
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:31,879
- Don't worry. 
 - Let's go.

98
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,180
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

99
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,720
Find yourselves a seat at the front rows.

100
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:57,306
Please go first.

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,450
   

102
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,680
When will they arrive?

103
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,678
One hour before launch, I think.

104
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,121
Jingjing's answer is really professional.

105
00:08:11,121 --> 00:08:13,040
It's obvious that she's family to an aerospace engineer.

106
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,839
She has been imbued with aerospace knowledge.

107
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,040
I am a curious person. So, I asked a lot of questions.

108
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,000
They are probably at the measurement and control hall now.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,639
But, don't ask me what is the difference between these two halls.

110
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,559
I don't know the answer. I'm only an actress.

111
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,140
In this hall, from the space probe team,

112
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,480
only the chief engineer and the deputy chief engineer will be here.

113
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,799
So, in a while, Xiao Yu And Xiao Hu will be here.

114
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:41,340
They will also announce their success here.

115
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,360
Of course, Professor Zhao has more experience in this.

116
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,241
Right.

117
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:47,900
Back then I went to the Jiuquan Launch Site.

118
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,200
It was more than ten years ago.

119
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,320
The facilities there weren't as good as what Wenchang has.

120
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,360
Being an aerospace engineer is not an easy job.

121
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,399
They stayed there for a few months every time.

122
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,919
At that time, we didn't have a developed communication system.

123
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,800
We could only speak on the phone no more than a few times in one month.

124
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,279
Yu Tu stayed in Hainan for more than half a year too.

125
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,159
Yes.

126
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,519
They are doing this to contribute to the national aerospace development.

127
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,480
Fortunately, things have gotten better now.

128
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,399
Otherwise, I need to work harder

129
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,200
so that I can work together with my wife, and go on work trips together.

130
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,320
I don't think I can take it if I am only allowed to call her a few times a month.

131
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,480
Xiao Zhang, does it mean that we can't see the launch of the rocket from here?

132
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,600
You can watch it from here.

133
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,059
You can either watch it on the screen here or go downstairs to watch it from the launch site.

134
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:36,559
Such a tough decision to make.

135
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,039
I get to see my wife here.

136
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:41,037
But if I go downstairs, I get to see the rocket launch live.

137
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,399
Of course, we have to leave them here and go watch the rocket launch.

138
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,399
Yes.

139
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,400
They're here.

140
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,960
They must be really nervous now.

141
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,677
Of course, they are nervous.

142
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,000
Even I felt nervous when I saw the rocket on the way here.

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,519
This time, they are receiving a lot of attention.

144
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,240
This is our country's first Solar System Boundary Explorer.

145
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,160
It's receiving a lot of global attention too.

146
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,040
Exactly.

147
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,619
Family members. We are very sorry to inform you that, due to some issues,

148
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:12,679
we might not be able to watch the rocket launch here.

149
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,920
We will arrange for you to go downstairs to witness the rocket launch. Is that okay?

150
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,120
Sure.

151
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,320
Okay. Thanks. This way.

152
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,360
This is not a bad thing.

153
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,059
At least, we don't have to decide whether to stay here or go downstairs.

154
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,480
Let's go to find a good spot.

155
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
- Let's go. 
 - Okay. Let's go.

156
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,580
Let's go.

157
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,399
This is good.

158
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,480
 When I'm finally ready, they may have already built the moon base. 

159
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,579
 Then the moon will be my starting point, as I conquer Mars and escape the Solar System. 

160
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,259
 Keep dreaming. 

161
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:11,260
 You don't need fuel to dream. 

162
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,400
 Peipei, what do you want to do when you grow up? 

163
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,840
 I don't know. How about you? 

164
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,340
 I don't know either. I have too many ideas. 

165
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,600
 But, I believe Yu Tu will definitely become an excellent aerospace engineer. 

166
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,339
 Why? 

167
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:30,860
 Because he likes it. 

168
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,400
 We don't need another 40 years to catch up with 40 years of effort. 

169
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,520
 This is one of the reasons why my colleagues and I work so hard. 

170
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,420
   

171
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,320
It's almost 7 p.m.

172
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:42,599
It's about time to start the countdown.

173
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:50,120
T minus 30 minutes.

174
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,400
 T minus 20 minutes. 
   

175
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,840
   

176
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,800
Ten more minutes.

177
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,420
   

178
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,420
   

179
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,420
   

180
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,760
T minus one minute.

181
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,759
50 seconds.

182
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,800
40 seconds.

183
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,340
30 seconds.

184
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:16,959
20 seconds.

185
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,560
Ten.

186
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,878
Nine.

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,200

Great.

237
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:36,558
Great.

238
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:39,200
We have accomplished our mission.

239
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,600
Good luck with the space probe.

240
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,900
Thanks for your hard work. The rocket was launched really nicely.

241
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,801
This has set off to a good start.

242
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:50,279
I can finally have a good night's sleep tonight.

243
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:51,881
Well done!

244
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:01,280
I don't understand this.

245
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,981
So have they succeeded?

246
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:05,441
Yes, they have successfully launched the rocket.

247
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:07,800
But God Searcher hasn't yet.

248
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,458
Nonetheless, it has set off to a good start.

252
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:57,617
Great.

253
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:13,207
Our honorable leaders, experts, and colleagues.

254
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,682
   

255
00:20:14,682 --> 00:20:20,020
According to the bulletin from Aerospace Control Center in Beijing,

256
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,841
Long March 5 Launch Vehicle is flying normally.

257
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:30,399
 God Searcher Space Probe has been positioned in the orbit. 

258
00:20:30,401 --> 00:20:34,221
 The nuclear reactor has been deployed successfully. 

259
00:20:34,221 --> 00:20:40,859
 I hereby announce that the launching of God Searcher is a complete success. 

260
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:42,322
- Great. 
 - That's great.

261
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:44,121
Great.

262
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:50,242
   

263
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:55,599
On behalf of Haijiao Launch Center,

264
00:20:55,601 --> 00:21:01,601
I wish to express my sincerest congratulations to all the departments and researchers

265
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:04,081
that are involved in this project.

266
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:07,841
The rocket launch event will end here.

267
00:21:07,841 --> 00:21:08,881
Thanks, everyone.

268
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:12,722
Great.

269
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:40,629
   

270
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:55,681
Do we look silly?

271
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,001
We're too happy.

272
00:21:57,001 --> 00:21:58,801
Precisely.

273
00:21:59,481 --> 00:22:01,321
Everyone else has left.

274
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:03,922
We should get going too.

275
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,621
Wait a minute. There will be an interview later.

276
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:07,902
Let's stay for that.

277
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,762
At this moment, the hall is filled with a totally jubilant atmosphere.

278
00:22:18,762 --> 00:22:22,321
Everyone is celebrating the successful launch of God Searcher.

279
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:26,002
We are also very honored to be able to interview the deputy chief engineer of God Searcher.

280
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:27,361
It's Xiao Hu.

281
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:29,502
- Xiao Hu. 
 - Xiao Li, take a look. It's Xiao Hu.

282
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:30,681
 I'm overwhelmed. 

283
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:35,081
 After ten years of hard work, God Searcher has finally embarked on its expedition. 

284
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:37,521
 The rocket launch was also flawless. 

285
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:39,081
 The navigation of the space probe was highly accurate. 

286
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:43,078
 This has ensured an ideal environment for our space probe to carry out its following job. 

287
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:45,682
 I notice that you mentioned expedition. 

288
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:48,281
 You kept emphasizing this during the live-stream too. 

289
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:52,192
 So God Searcher's work will only start after the launch, right? 

290
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:57,842
Exactly. For a Solar System Boundary Explorer, a successful launch is only the beginning of God Searcher's work.

291
00:22:57,842 --> 00:22:59,542
It still has a long way to go.

292
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:01,142
We will have many challenges in the future.

293
00:23:01,142 --> 00:23:04,969
God Searcher has the farthest destination compared to our nation's other space probes.

294
00:23:04,969 --> 00:23:07,273
What's so special about it?

295
00:23:07,273 --> 00:23:10,162
God Searcher is set to explore the boundary of the Solar System.

296
00:23:10,162 --> 00:23:13,842
Compared to the exploration of the moon and Mars, it has to go further.

297
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:16,361
Hence, it will be in a more complex environment.

298
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:21,142
When we were developing it, we were faced with more challenging technical issues.

299
00:23:21,142 --> 00:23:24,081
Has God Searcher experienced any technological breakthrough?

300
00:23:24,081 --> 00:23:26,921
Can you briefly tell us about it?

301
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:30,041
For example, for the propulsion system of God Searcher,

302
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:33,102
we spent two years researching key technologies

303
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:37,602
and eventually developed the nuclear reactor which later replaced the conventional solar panel.

304
00:23:37,602 --> 00:23:39,402
  
Thanks for your time. 

305
00:23:39,402 --> 00:23:44,801
 Let us also wish that God Searcher can bring humankind's dream to a further place. 

306
00:23:44,801 --> 00:23:46,962
Mr. Hu is much more handsome than usual.

307
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:50,561
This is probably the charm that comes with his profession.

308
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:54,742
Jingjing, why didn't Mr. Yu take any interviews?

309
00:23:54,742 --> 00:23:58,202
I guess the reporter only interviewed the person she found good-looking.

310
00:23:58,202 --> 00:23:59,582
No one can beat Mr. Yu.

311
00:23:59,582 --> 00:24:01,182
Exactly.

312
00:24:02,622 --> 00:24:05,682
Why don't we wait for them, so that we can leave together?

313
00:24:05,682 --> 00:24:06,722
Sure.

314
00:24:06,722 --> 00:24:08,541
When are they coming out?

315
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:11,081
I don't know. I'll have to wait for her anyway.

316
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:12,481
Can you sleep tonight?

317
00:24:12,481 --> 00:24:13,880
No, I can't.

318
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,702
We should stay here and keep each other company.

319
00:24:15,702 --> 00:24:17,302
Exactly.

320
00:24:17,302 --> 00:24:19,161
Mr. Zhang, can we wait here?

321
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:22,002
Sure. But please don't go anywhere else.

322
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,602
- We won't. 
 - We won't.

323
00:24:23,602 --> 00:24:25,041
 Good. 

324
00:24:30,361 --> 00:24:31,801
They're here.

325
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:34,262
They must be from the launch vehicle team.

326
00:24:34,262 --> 00:24:37,062
The space probe team will leave later.

327
00:24:40,002 --> 00:24:41,902
My wife is here. Everyone, I'll get going.

328
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:43,561
Bye.

329
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,260
Here.

330
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,161
Bye.

331
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,999
Director Xiao.

332
00:24:58,001 --> 00:24:59,202
You...

333
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:02,102
Why are you still here?

334
00:25:02,722 --> 00:25:05,481
Xiao Qiao, this must be your idea, right?

335
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:07,061
Yes.

336
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:09,561
You and your husband are the same.

337
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:13,922
You are not only creative but also quick-witted.

338
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:16,962
Yu Tu will take a while more.

339
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:20,701
But the rocket launch was flawless so he won't stay too late.

340
00:25:20,722 --> 00:25:22,922
- I'll wait for him. 
 - Okay.

341
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:25,822
- Then, we'll get going. 
 - Sure.

342
00:25:25,822 --> 00:25:27,022
Okay. Bye.

343
00:25:27,022 --> 00:25:28,122
Bye, Director Xiao.

344
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:30,182
- Bye. 
 - Bye, Director Xiao.

345
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:32,163
I will send Director Xiao off. I've to go.

346
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,782
Thanks for the hospitality.

347
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:38,763
My husband is here. My husband is here too.

348
00:25:38,763 --> 00:25:41,121
Bye!

349
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,120
My husband is here. I've got to go.

350
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:47,486
- Sure. 
 - Bye.

351
00:25:47,486 --> 00:25:50,681
My husband is here too. We'll get going. Bye.

352
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:56,457
There are only two of us left.

353
00:25:58,981 --> 00:26:02,002
- Xiao Hu, over here. 
 - Your wife is there.

354
00:26:02,002 --> 00:26:03,322
- Well done. 
 - You too.

355
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:04,941
- Take a good rest. 
 - I've got to go.

356
00:26:04,941 --> 00:26:06,661
Don't worry.

357
00:26:06,661 --> 00:26:08,261
Come on.

358
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,296
Are you waiting for me?

359
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,421
If not you, who else?

360
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:24,360
Where's Yu Tu? Why is he not here yet?

361
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,521
We left together.

362
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,741
Someone stopped him on the way. I think he'll be here soon.

363
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,081
We'll keep you company as you wait for him.

364
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:40,841
Please don't. Don't interrupt Mr. Yu and me.

365
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:52,121
Xiao Hu, Yu Tu told me that you had done several drafts of your apology letter.

366
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:54,181
Are you done yet?

367
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:01,281
You don't have to apologize.

368
00:27:02,561 --> 00:27:04,541
It was neither of our faults.

369
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,820
Give me some more time to think about it.

370
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,701
We'll talk at home.

371
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,081
Okay.

372
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,400
I think Yu Tu is here.

373
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,362
You go ahead. Don't be the third wheel.

374
00:27:39,362 --> 00:27:40,841
Quickly.

375
00:27:40,841 --> 00:27:42,960
Go.

376
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,660
Is he going to call me?

377
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:32,020
He's so mean.

378
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,340
He was not calling me.

379
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:45,721
There will be a lot of challenges for God Searcher in the future.

380
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,321
But up till now,

381
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,940
I've lived up to your expectations.

382
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,960
   

383
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,508
   

384
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
   

385
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:22,021
Did you see it?

386
00:29:24,288 --> 00:29:26,107
Yes, I saw it.

387
00:29:27,721 --> 00:29:30,900
Congratulations on the launch.

388
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,017
Jingjing, when they announced that the launch was a success, everyone else was applauding.

389
00:29:44,017 --> 00:29:48,140
At that time, I recalled what you told me a long time ago.

390
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,920
You said you are already a rabbit that has seen the most stars.

391
00:29:56,281 --> 00:30:02,281
Today, I can finally see more stars.

392
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:06,401
 Thank you. 

393
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,939
Turn around. I'm right behind you.

394
00:30:27,981 --> 00:30:31,581
You're a grown woman. Yet you're so mischievous.

395
00:30:34,268 --> 00:30:38,228
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

396
00:30:38,228 --> 00:30:42,188
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

397
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:49,868
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

398
00:30:49,868 --> 00:30:53,500
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

399
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,348
Thanks.

400
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:59,488
I'm sorry for the past few years.

401
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:04,288
I've neglected my family.

402
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,680
It's okay.

403
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,775
I am proud of you,

404
00:31:18,721 --> 00:31:21,341
all of you.

405
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:28,928
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

406
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:41,888
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

407
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:46,741
Let's go. We'll celebrate.

408
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:48,421
Is there a celebration?

409
00:31:48,421 --> 00:31:49,780
Yes.

410
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:55,321
To be precise, it's an after-party held by the Academy of Launch Vehicle and the launch center.

411
00:31:55,321 --> 00:31:59,060
By the way, where is God Searcher now?

412
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,916
God Searcher?

413
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:03,158
It's just embarked on its expedition.

414
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,192
It still has a long way to go.

415
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,990

♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

432
