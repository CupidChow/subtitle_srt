1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:16,000


2
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,300
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,260
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:36,900
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,700
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,500
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,840
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:00,580
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:08,080
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:15,940
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:29,000
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:40,060
   

14
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,080
   

15
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,320
 Yu Tu, you "kill stealer"! 

16
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,830
 Your Zhuge Liang is not bad, Yu Tu. 

17
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,730
 I have never seen you pick him. 

18
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:12,879
 Zhai Liang always picked Mage, so he didn't have a chance. 

19
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,759
 Easy. 

20
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,440
Do you have to say that?

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,839
   

22
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:23,240
I think from now on, Mage belongs to Yu Tu.

23
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,260
Zhai Liang, don't fight for it anymore.

24
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,399
   

25
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:28,759
I disagree.

26
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,520
Zhai Liang is a bad Marksman. At least, he's a mediocre Mage.

27
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,279
   

28
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:37,360
Go away. I'm still farming.

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,799
Cai Wenji, when you enter the bush later, give me a good view.

30
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,580
- I'm going to take my time farming. 
 - Which bush?

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,900
- A girl? 
 - Is she a girl?

32
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,600
 Could Yu Tu have recognized my voice? 

33
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,000
 Miss. 

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,720
Yes, 40% of the players of this game are female.

35
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,520
I've memorized...

36
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,620
I saw the data before.

37
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,700
But Yu Tu, the ladies repellent, invited you here.

38
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Yu Tu, do you really not know this miss?

39
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,080
 Please don't remember me. 

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,579
Isn't she the one on QQ? Do you add strangers on your QQ?

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,919
That... The bush you were talking about. Is it the bush up there?

42
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes, that one.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,520
Why should I hide there?

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,180
 You can see if our enemy is surrounding us. 

45
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,720
 If you see them, give us a heads up. 

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,220
Okay.

47
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,140
 As expected, he didn't recognize my voice. 

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,359
 Cai Wenji, what are you doing? 

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,720
Cai Wenji, you'd better follow the Mage.

50
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,740
 I'll farm on my own for now. 

51
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,260
 Yu Tu, the one who invited her should be the one responsible for her too. 

52
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,520
Sure.

53
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,099
A terrible Marksman like you isn't worth being protected.

54
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,820
 Unstoppable! 

55
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,920
 Double Kill. 

56
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,100
 Only when you have the situation well in hand, can you gain a decisive victory a thousand miles away. 

57
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,660
 This is God's will. 

58
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,180
  Triple Kill. 
   

59
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Go, go, go.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,800
We won another round.

61
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,540
 Victory. 

62
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,880
 Who is sending me love letters again? 
   

63
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:14,560
Zhuge Liang got 18 kills.

64
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,540
I played quite well, too.

65
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,179
 Look at how I used Cai Wenji and got two kills. 

66
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,200
Qiao Jingjing, why are you still awake?

67
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,320
 Do you still want to take care of your skin? 

68
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,679
 I'm going to sleep now. 

69
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,519
   

70
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:06,299
Jingjing.

71
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,120
Jingjing.

72
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:13,480
Jingjing.

73
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,320
Purchase all the heroes and skins for me.

74
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,359
Okay.

75
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,859
Wait a minute.

76
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,420
Forget it. Only buy the good-looking ones.

77
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,520
- Sure. 
 - Okay. Nice. Nice. That's great.

78
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,440
Nice.

79
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,859
Okay.

80
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,179
Jingjing, let's take a break and get ready for the next scene.

81
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:36,579
Okay.

82
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:41,440
Have you bought them already?

83
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,160
Yes, I have. I've bought all the nice skins.

84
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,359
I can guarantee that, from now on, you'll be the most handsome one in the valley.

85
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:52,299
Even if you die in the Valley of Kings, you'll die in your most beautiful costumes.

86
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:53,999
That's right.

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,979
By the way, Jingjing. Three people accepted your friend request.

88
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:02,799
It's only been one night, and so many people have become your friends.

89
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,340
Each one of them will get two skins.

90
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,079
   

91
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,739
Then they'll feel embarrassed if they don't invite me.

92
00:07:08,739 --> 00:07:12,580
   
   

93
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:15,019
Not you.

94
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:20,119
Do you not want me to stay?

95
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:22,200
It's okay. Go spend time with your mom.

96
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,579
Okay.

97
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:24,900
I'm leaving.

98
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,000
Take a good rest. Sleep early.

99
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,300
   

100
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,119
The skin tactic is a success.

101
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:41,959
   

102
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,380
Miss, you gave me two skins.

103
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,160
Don't get too excited. I received two too!

104
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,280
Me too.

105
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,880
 Heroes, please carry me. 

106
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,979
Of course.

107
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:01,779
I have never received skins from anyone before, let alone from a girl.

108
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:02,940
Miss, don't worry.

109
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,139
Brother Dragon King will carry you.

110
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:07,179
Let's start.

111
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,419
Yu Tu, why didn't you put on the skin she gave you?

112
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,059
I didn't get any.

113
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:22,159
Yu Tu, I didn't expect you to get to the bottom of a girl's list.

114
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,530
 First Blood. 

115
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,819
Yu Tu, were you betraying me?

116
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:30,620
Be smart and retreat.

117
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,840
Don't worry. I've gotten the blue buff.

118
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,620
We won't lose anything this round.

119
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:39,039
 You're still as annoying as always. 

120
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,360
Yu Tu, I invited a friend to join us.

121
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,319
Together with the four of us, let's do 5v5 ranked match. Are you joining us?

122
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:46,600
Sure.

123
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,140
Miss, after this round, we're playing the ranked match.

124
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,310
 We'll play with you tomorrow. 

125
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,879
Can't I join you?

126
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,619
You won't get any ranking.

127
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:58,259
You don't have a rank yet, right?

128
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,760
Yes. I have not played a ranked match before.

129
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,460
 Victory! 

130
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,180
I got left behind again.

131
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,459
I bought six skins for nothing.

132
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,730
Does she know that if she doesn't exit the room after the game,

133
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,300
we can hear her speak?

134
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,790
Why don't you carry her?

135
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,250
I'll invite another person into the ranked match.

136
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:30,620
After all, you never like playing the ranked match.

137
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,339
I'm not the one who received her skins.

138
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,200
What about this?

139
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,200
If you win a match, then I'll...

140
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,859
No. If you win two matches, I'll handle all the chores today.

141
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,621
   

142
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,310
   

143
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:05,980
Yu Tu is actually carrying me on his own.

144
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,710
 The opponents have five seconds before arriving at the battlefield. 

145
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,910
 Please get ready. 

146
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:16,120
 I can defeat you. 

147
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,510
 Showdown. 

148
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,550
 Unstoppable. 

149
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,130
 Double Kill. 

150
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:25,180
 - Triple Kill! 
 - Show time! 

151
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,390
 - Triple Kill! 
 - Show time! 

152
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,190
 Legendary! 

153
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,520
 Quadra kill! 

154
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,710
 Victory. 

155
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,370
 Showdown. 

156
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,740
 Legendary. 

157
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,090
 Quadra kill. 

158
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,840
 Penta kill! 

159
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,740
He looks so handsome.

160
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
 Victory. 

161
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,299
Look at this.

162
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,810
   

163
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,479
You're such a brute.

164
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:05,660
I just got my four stars, and you have won a dozen matches.

165
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,680
You'll handle the household chores for a week.

166
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,360
 Killing spree. 

167
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,840
 Qiao Jingjing, what's wrong with you? 

168
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,340
 You're turning 30 years old soon, 

169
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,320
 yet you adore a person just because he's good at playing games. 

170
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:41,840
 He might be bald or obese. 

171
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,100
 What is there to get excited about? 

172
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,339
 But he's really handsome when he plays. 

173
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:13,640
How's it going?

174
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,139
- Has she made a lot of progress in the past two days? 
 - Of course.

175
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:18,239
Really?

176
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:20,840
But, frankly,

177
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,059
Jingjing doesn't have much talent in playing games.

178
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:27,060
But she has extraordinary willpower.

179
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,060
No matter how badly she's defeated, she only needs to have a good night's sleep,

180
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,980
and she will regain all her enthusiasm on the next day.

181
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,880
 Defeat. 

182
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,379
 To be fair, not everyone can be a celebrity. 

183
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:41,560
You need to have the tenacity.

184
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,219
That's enough.

185
00:12:43,219 --> 00:12:45,959
Let's cut to the chase. How's her performance?

186
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,319
 It improved a lot. 

187
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,420
   

188
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:53,359
When she's at home...

189
00:12:53,359 --> 00:12:55,259
Oh, my God.

190
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,919
- What's wrong? 
 - I'm going home.

191
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,100
What time is it?

192
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,799
Why are you leaving earlier and earlier? Practice a little more, please.

193
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,139
I'm going back to train my abs.

194
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:15,659
 Jingjing, are you going back to play with the friends you made the other day? 

195
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,080
Then why didn't you tell Sister Ling?

196
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,119
It's more impressive if I can turn into a peerless master overnight.

197
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,479
   

198
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:34,019
Why did he go offline so soon?

199
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,039
 Junior Brother. Junior Brother! 
 (T/N: common terms for those who attended the same school) 

200
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,000
Sorry, sorry.

201
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,599
It took me a long time to deal with the customer before I finally sent him away.

202
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:07,500
I'm sorry. Here. Let me take a good look at you.

203
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,760
Nice. You're still so handsome.

204
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,019
You're not bald yet.

205
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,120
It seems like you people who do scientific research are not working as hard as those in the financial industry.

206
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,719
Am I right?

207
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:21,400
Come. Have a seat. Don't just stand there.

208
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,819
Why are you drinking plain water?

209
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:25,010
I have some nice tea. I'll make tea for you.

210
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,580
Wait a minute.

211
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,059
Guess who I met in Wuhan two days ago.

212
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:34,039
Sandbag.

213
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,599
He told me that you are planning to resign from the institute.

214
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,259
Is it true?

215
00:14:39,259 --> 00:14:42,320
That's my plan, but nothing is final yet.

216
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,179
I'm quite surprised.

217
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,300
Back then, you were determined to join the Aerospace Research Institute.

218
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,100
You have been working there for so many years.

219
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,340
Why are you resigning now?

220
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,159
Due to personal issues.

221
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,780
All right.

222
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,080
Then I won't press on.

223
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,820
However, often, you need to experience it yourself before you know if it really suits you.

224
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,980
After you truly understand it,

225
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,620
you'll realize that a lot of things are different from what you expected.

226
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:21,960
I guess you already know why I want to meet you today.

227
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,240
I want to let you know that,

228
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,440
if you eventually decide to resign from the institute,

229
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,140
you're welcome to join me.

230
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,480
 - Hello? 
 - Hey. Yu Tu, have you met Ren Wang? 

231
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,400
I just met him.

232
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,860
 When Senior Brother Ren visited Wuhan a few days ago, I bought him a meal. 

233
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,619
 I accidentally let it slip. 

234
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:07,239
 Will you blame me for being nosy? 

235
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:08,599
Of course not.

236
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:10,100
I've been sending out resumes anyway.

237
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,760
 Zhai Liang told me that you received an offer letter from DF Capital. 

238
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,960
Yes,

239
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,100
but they want me to work at the headquarters in Beijing.

240
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,020
That's great.

241
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,520
Because you haven't set foot in this industry ever since you graduated from university,

242
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,440
I thought it'd be difficult for you to land a good job.

243
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,799
 Apparently, I underestimated you. 

244
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:30,119
 Let me tell you. Both investment banking and venture capital financing have their pros and cons. 

245
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,080
 Think twice about it. 

246
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,280
Don't worry. I know what to do.

247
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,799
Okay. Then I'm going home. I'll see you in the valley tonight.

248
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,239
You have been a bit devoted recently.

249
00:16:39,239 --> 00:16:44,479
Why? Is a humble white-collar worker like me not allowed to have my own hobby?

250
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:49,860
Besides, ever since Zhai Liang brought you in, I'm more and more pumped up.

251
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,960
I didn't expect you to play so well.

252
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,039
You are quite a good teammate. I was tricked by Zhai Liang.

253
00:16:57,039 --> 00:16:59,200
You and Zhai Liang work really well together.

254
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,400
You share the same opinion on your teammates too.

255
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,840
He's just trash.

256
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,299
I'm hanging up. See you tonight.

257
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,580
   

258
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,179
 Yu Tu, look at our high school chatroom. 

259
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,720
 Someone uploaded a post about you and Qiao Jingjing. 

260
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:23,140
   

261
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,579
He's still not online yet.

262
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:51,439
Hey, Peipei.

263
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,520
Let me tell you.

264
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,760
They started spreading rumors in our high school chatroom.

265
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,000
 Everyone is scolding the bastard who spread the rumors now. 

266
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,760
Guess what happened next.

267
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,660
 What happened? 

268
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,839
 Yu Tu spoke up. You definitely didn't expect this. 

269
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,160
 Let me tell you. 

270
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,970
Besides scolding the person who spread the rumors,

271
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,750
 there were also a few others who left insensitive remarks. 

272
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,539
 Eventually, Yu Tu spoke up. 

273
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:17,059
 He said that he had never said anything like that, giving all of them a slap in their faces. 

274
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:18,719
 Immediately, those people went quiet. 

275
00:18:18,719 --> 00:18:20,419
 Isn't he great? 

276
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,680
 Yu Tu, are you free now? I'd like to ask you something. 

277
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,359
 Sure. Go ahead. 

278
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:31,020
 Yu Tu, do you not have a girlfriend right now? 

279
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,300
 If so, what do you think of me? 

280
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:43,700
 I'm sorry. I don't want a girlfriend for the time being. 

281
00:18:45,199 --> 00:18:47,860
 Why? Are you worried that it will affect your studies? 

282
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,280
 You do sports and read books outside of assignments every day, but your studies have never been affected. 

283
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,159
 - That's not the reason. 
 - Then why? There's nothing wrong with me. 

284
00:18:57,939 --> 00:18:59,439
 Sorry. 

285
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,179
 Wait. 

286
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,399
 You have to tell me why, right? 

287
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,579
 Sorry. 

288
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:16,399
 I want someone who can work hard together with me. 

289
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:32,219
Take a screenshot of the conversation and send it to me.

290
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:35,220
Okay. I'll do it now. Wait.

291
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,719
 I haven't said anything like that. 

292
00:19:40,719 --> 00:19:44,619
 If any of you is still in touch with Qiao Jingjing, send my apologies to her. 

293
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:47,540
 If there's anything that requires further explanation, I'll do it. 

294
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:51,459
Apologize to me? How will you apologize to me?

295
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:53,820
Even provide an explanation too?

296
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:57,959
How? Are you going to post it on Weibo?

297
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,819
You know nothing about the entertainment industry.

298
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:02,959
If you have time to spare, why don't you play with me?

299
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:05,299
Why waste your time in the chatroom?

300
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,420
   

301
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,420
   

302
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,120
I brought all the remaining items here.

303
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,760
I have also terminated the rental contract for my apartment.

304
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,099
I'll stay here for a while.

305
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:15,599
Your house is quite far from the downtown area.

306
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,499
The traffic was smooth the last time I came here.

307
00:21:17,499 --> 00:21:19,999
This time, I was stuck in a traffic jam,

308
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:22,080
and it took me one and a half hours.

309
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,040
It's near my workplace.

310
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,600
I visit downtown no more than a few times a year.

311
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,620
If you're going to work at Lujiazui, 
  (T/N: Shanghai’s glitzy financial district) 

312
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,080
will you sell this house?

313
00:21:39,379 --> 00:21:41,279
We'll see how it goes.

314
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,619
When are you going to Shenzhen to start work?

315
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:48,299
I will officially start working after the New Year.

316
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,279
Don't you want to go home and visit?

317
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,519
Later.

318
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,039
For now, I'll enjoy my free time here.

319
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,839
If I go home, they will definitely pressure me to get married.

320
00:21:57,839 --> 00:21:59,439
They will arrange blind dates for me.

321
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:01,760
Also, I haven't told them about my resignation.

322
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,180
They will be furious if they find out.

323
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,680
Didn't you go home a few days ago?

324
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,659
How did you break the news of resigning to your parents?

325
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,459
I haven't told them anything.

326
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:14,040
So that's why you only stayed there for two days.

327
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,980
What?

328
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,020
Why are you hesitating?

329
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:25,880
It's between a job that pays you a million yuan a year

330
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,360
and a taxing job that pays you only a quarter of that.

331
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,720
Yet, you can't make up your mind? Is it that difficult?

332
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,640
Where is my a million yuan a year?

333
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,259
How is it not?

334
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:40,280
When you got your Bachelor's degree, you received so many offer letters.

335
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,819
If you had accepted either one of those offers,

336
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,419
you'd now be earning millions of yuan annually.

337
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:48,179
You're silly to have chosen to work in aerospace.

338
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,880
Even if you've earned yourself a doctor's degree,

339
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,080
and been burning yourself out, you're still earning so little.

340
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,540
If you hadn't done the research and earned yourself some award money,

341
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,500
how could you have afforded to pay your mortgage loan?

342
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,560
Living your life like this.

343
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,000
You've wasted your intelligence.

344
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,560
At least...

345
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,560
At the very least, you wouldn't have broken up with Xia Qing.

346
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,040
How long ago was it? Why are you still talking about it?

347
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,959
You will regret it sooner or later.

348
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:18,760
Where can you find such a beautiful and smart wife in the future?

349
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:21,780
It's easier for me compared to you.

350
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,480
I spit on that!

351
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,719
You are lucky you have good looks.

352
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:34,220
You can't live on your dreams and sentiment.

353
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:38,039
I have different goals from you.

354
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:41,719
I worked hard to earn my degrees.

355
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:45,439
Now, I want to make as much money as I can and live the best life I can afford.

356
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,560
In today's society,

357
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,500
a celebrity and a live-stream seller can earn up to millions of yuan every minute.

358
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,340
Look at you.

359
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,060
You've launched satellites into orbit.

360
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,780
You can ask around. No one knows who you are.

361
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,320
You've sold your soul for your work, but is only making so little.

362
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:14,339
Aren't these days

363
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,120
probably the idlest days in your life?

364
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,479
You only play games at home.

365
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:24,039
How about this?

366
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:28,599
You should visit Beijing and meet up with your old classmates.

367
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,280
I heard that Xia Qing is still single now.

368
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:38,399
Perhaps, both of you will rekindle your romance or something.

369
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:41,700
You've been single for so long.

370
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,039
- Is it because... 
 - No.

371
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,100
I'll never understand you.

372
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:18,959
 For the past two years, 

373
00:25:18,959 --> 00:25:22,220
 you've never taken a day off for vacation. 

374
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,820
 Let's talk after you take your annual leave. 

375
00:25:29,959 --> 00:25:33,039
 After that, 

376
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,819
 if after considering everything, you still want to leave, 

377
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I will agree to it. 

378
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,060
   

379
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,860
   

380
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,019
It's so difficult to handle Zhuge Liang.

381
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:57,900
How did Yu Tu do it? He comes and goes as he pleases.

382
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,970
 You have been slain. 

383
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,950
 Defeat. 

384
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,140
   

385
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,020
   

386
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,440
   

387
00:27:14,739 --> 00:27:17,119
Why is he still not inviting me?

388
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,760
Did my hefty investment go down the drain?

389
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,579
Or did you not see the skin I sent you?

390
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,800
 You don't need to send me a skin. 

391
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,060
   

392
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,400
Hello?

393
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,679
 Hello, Jingjing. 

394
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,160
 You left in such a hurry. I forgot to tell you that 

395
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,059
 we will have a family activity tomorrow. 

396
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:48,820
 You don't have to practice at the studio tomorrow. 

397
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,680
Oh. Okay. Then, I'll practice on my own.

398
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,679
 Do a good job. A'Guo said you made significant progress these days. 

399
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:56,479
 That's all. 

400
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,300
   

401
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:20,560
 Can you be my coach? 

402
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,940
 Yu Tu is so good at playing games. 

403
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,339
 If he can coach me, I can definitely make greater progress. 

404
00:28:38,199 --> 00:28:42,960
 But, how can I persuade him to be my coach when I'm basically a stranger to him? 

405
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,819
Back then, he even rejected a beautiful girl like me.

406
00:28:58,139 --> 00:29:02,600
Xiao Zhu, tell Dandan to draw a graphic for me.

407
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,080
   

408
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,840
 My company is organizing an Honor of Kings match. 

409
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,919
 I want a nice victory so it'll help me in my career later. 

410
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,720
 Does your workplace not organize any events? 

411
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,920
 Does a recital contest count? 

412
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,859
 Where does he actually work? 

413
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,859
 Didn't he have a degree in finance? 

414
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:42,660
 Do investment banks these days organize recital contests? 

415
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,900
 That's so unique. 

416
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,499
 I signed up for the contest, but I don't know how to play, 

417
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:53,160
 and I can't let my colleagues find out that I actually know nothing. 

418
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,359
 I think it'll be better if you find someone else. 

419
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,940
 I might quit this game at any time. 

420
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,839
 Why? 

421
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,520
 I'm on leave, but my vacation can end at any time. 

422
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,560
 Besides, I only started playing not long ago. 

423
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,480
And you already play so well?

424
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:23,539
There's still hope for me.

425
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,500
 Can you guide me a bit when we normally play? 

426
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,499
 You can point out my mistakes, and how I should fix them. 

427
00:30:29,499 --> 00:30:30,640
 Is that all right? 

428
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,620
 If you quit, I'll find someone else. 

429
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:37,860
 Jade Rabbit God, please. 

430
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,480
   

431
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:57,970


432
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:10,780
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

433
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:18,000
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

434
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,060
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

435
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:32,740
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

436
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,320
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

437
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,400
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

438
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:46,600
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

439
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:53,760
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

440
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,000
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

441
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,500
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

442
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:43,860
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

443
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:51,100
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

444
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:58,180
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

445
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:05,860
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

446
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,440
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

447
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,640
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

448
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:19,800
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

449
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:27,000
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

450
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,200
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

451
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:43,020
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
