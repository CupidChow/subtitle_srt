1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:17,200


2
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,350
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,210
♫  My heart is like the dust and 
couldn’t bear to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,650
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,530
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,230
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:23,890
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,050
   

14
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,510
 My age is catching up to me. 

16
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,150
 I only organized clothes, and now my back is aching so badly. 

17
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:01,776
- You've worked hard. 
 - Thanks.

18
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:04,291
I fully support Ms. Qiao Jingjing's decision to stay here.

19
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,381
If you live in Lujiazui, then I'm no longer your guest.

20
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:08,999
You won't show me such great hospitality.

21
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:10,819
You don't have to take care of me for the coming two months.

22
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:14,328
You can travel with your mom. I'll claim the expenses on your behalf.

23
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:20,139
Wait a minute. Two months? What do you mean?

24
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,637
Are you not going to do anything for the coming two months?

25
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,300
Do you remember the variety show I told you about? Have you thought it over?

26
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,939
It won't take you more than twenty days.

27
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,739
I won't do it.

28
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:35,357
I gave Teacher Yu my word. Two months. Not even a day less.

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,619
So this is how one acts when they are in love.

30
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,239
That was a joke. It has nothing to do with Teacher Yu.

31
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,780
Look. Have I ever rejected any good offer for the past two years?

32
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,612
I won't sacrifice my career for love.

33
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:53,960
But from now on, I won't take up as many offers other than acting jobs.

34
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,659
And you said this had nothing to do with Teacher Yu.

35
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:59,239
It's true.

36
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,080
To be honest, he influenced me.

37
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
After all, I'm an actress. Variety shows and commercials

38
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,619
can only bring me short-lived fame and attention.

39
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:16,219
Over time, all of these will fade away.

40
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:21,994
Ultimately, people will only care about the roles I've played, and the work I've produced.

41
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:25,020
I have always known these.

42
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,860
But I thought I was still young and was able to hustle.

43
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,519
There were regrets, too.

44
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,598
My age is catching up to me.

45
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,280
I don't want to have a race against time and rush into creating a new image.

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,520
Being in this field, if we ever panic, it'll show through our work.

47
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,840
Then, our reputation will be more or less affected too.

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,700
Of course, I'll still get casted.

49
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,000
But, they will be the same boring female lead roles that are no different from one another.

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,620
I don't want to end up like that.

51
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,944
That will be meaningless, and I will lose my value.

52
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:02,560
Teacher Yu is an ambitious man. I am, too.

53
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,259
Teacher Yu will keep increasing his value. Hence, I don't want my career to go downhill.

54
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,099
From now on, I will keep myself in good shape,

55
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,348
so that I can put more effort into producing good works.

56
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,300
Of course, this will also make my fame last.

57
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,420
I think you're just trying to justify your vacation.

58
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,059
This is for recuperation.

59
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,780
All right. Let me think about it.

60
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,439
Let's eat. You should reduce your rice intake.

61
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,317
I ordered this for you.

62
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,073
Today is my day off. Just one more bite.

63
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:48,078
 Remember. There's no need for soy sauce. 

64
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,612
No need for soy sauce. All right.

65
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:52,088
 Do you always cook at home? 

66
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:55,192
I'm preparing the food. He'll cook it later.

67
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:58,580
Mr. Yu has completely no talent for cooking.

68
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,500
This has thoroughly brought down his self-esteem.

69
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,540
 Guan Zai is not any better. 

70
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,518
I think he's back.

71
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,380
He's not working overtime.

72
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,100
We agreed on this. On my first day here, he doesn't work overtime.

73
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,160
He has to put his family first.

74
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,942
Thanks. I've got to go.

75
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,319
I called Sister Jing to ask her for the recipe for crab roe chicken wings.

76
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,900
I suddenly crave it.

77
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,260
But let's agree on this first. I'll prepare the materials, and you will cook them.

78
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,339
My fans will be sad if I get burned.

79
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:33,160
She also wanted to know when we would pay her a visit.

80
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,579
If it's not too troublesome, she will make braised stinky tofu which I like and Guan Zai hates.

81
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,620
We should go over today.

82
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,776
Leave my face out of the frame.

83
00:05:48,776 --> 00:05:52,038
It doesn't matter even if you're in the frame. You're so pretty.

84
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,000
Besides, I won't show this to others. This is only a cooking tutorial for Yu Tu.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,660
Do you want him to cook this?

86
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,215
Didn't you say that he was a bad cook?

87
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,518
I'm a worse cook.

88
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,639
Look at how self-righteous you are.

89
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,900
He makes some dishes quite well.

90
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,790
But, there are also dishes that he's terrible with.

91
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,450
For example, braised tofu is one of them.

92
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:14,039
Every time he tried to make it, it turned out either crushed or burnt.

93
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,060
He didn't control the heat properly. Here.

94
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,403
Blow on it. This might be a little hot.

95
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,770
Be careful.

96
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:26,859
How is it?

97
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:28,856
- It's delicious. 
 - Really?

98
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:30,379
That's great.

99
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:33,000
Over here, Sister Jing, Say this to the camera.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,519
This is a very simple dish.

101
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,839
Yu Tu, you'll be a fool if you can't master this.

102
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,392
That means Guan Zai has always been a fool.

103
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,040
This is a very simple dish.

104
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,219
Yu Tu, Jingjing said you'd be a fool if you couldn't master this.

105
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,136
There are so many dishes.

106
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,260
Try this. This is delicious.

107
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,101
You're taking credit for someone else's work.

108
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:02,964
You weren't the cook.

109
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,262
I made this. I just learned how to make this.

110
00:07:06,262 --> 00:07:10,060
Really? I have to give it a try then.

111
00:07:14,515 --> 00:07:16,678
Your cooking skills are lacking. You need to practice more.

112
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,638
I knew you'd say that.

113
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,280
Sister Jing, he said that your cooking skills were lacking.

114
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,360
Don't try to trick me.

115
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,519
Sister Jing made this. I only added some vinegar before we served it.

116
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,238
You see. This is what affects its quality.

117
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,880
You added the vinegar. That's gilding the lily.

118
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,017
You made the tofu tough.

119
00:07:35,017 --> 00:07:36,638
Sister-in-law, thanks for the food.

120
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,960
You're welcome.

121
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,081
Both of you should keep eating.

122
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:45,178
I don't think the tofu is tough. It tastes better after she added the vinegar.

123
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:50,420
Right? I knew that this would suit the kids' palate better.

124
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,747
She bought you over with just a few autographs.

125
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:55,012
Many of my classmates are Aunt Jingjing's fans.

126
00:07:55,014 --> 00:07:57,450
They are envious of me after they've found out that I know Aunt Jingjing.

127
00:07:57,473 --> 00:08:02,300
They also asked me if the rumor about Aunt Jingjing's boyfriend was true.

128
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,142
You didn't tell them anything, right?

129
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:11,759
Of course not, but there was a very smart girl.

130
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,530
She asked me in secret,

131
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:19,237
if I knew Aunt Jingjing because dad and Aunt Jingjing's boyfriend were colleagues.

132
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:23,160
It's not a surprise that she knows your dad is an aerospace engineer.

133
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,281
How did she find out that Jingjing's boyfriend is an aerospace engineer too?

134
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:29,953
She told me there was an online post that explained all these.

135
00:08:29,953 --> 00:08:33,780
Someone took a photo of Aunt Jingjing and Uncle Yu somewhere near dad's office.

136
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,522
Some time ago, they participated in a match together.

137
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:39,179
She also said that their photographs never become the top search.

138
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,319
So it must be true.

139
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:43,439
You kids are acting like adults.

140
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,079
You know more than we do.

141
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,344
Only a few people in our department know about your relationship.

142
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:50,147
I guess only you and professor know about this.

143
00:08:50,147 --> 00:08:52,081
No one has asked me about it before.

144
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:55,060
Judging from how often Yu Tu works overtime,

145
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,240
no one will suspect that you have a girlfriend.

146
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,055
It's only natural that the others haven't found out about it yet.

147
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:04,019
Don't blame it on Yu Tu. She is always away.

148
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:06,100
What else can he do if he doesn't work overtime?

149
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,340
I didn't spend half a year at the launch site.

150
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,514
Sister Jing, was Guan Zai like this too?

151
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:16,519
Stop right there. We are at a disadvantage for this topic.

152
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,980
- Let's eat. 
 - Let's eat.

153
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,559
Jingjing is on such a long hiatus.

154
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,900
And she'll be staying in Tianyu City the whole time.

155
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,700
I think this won't stay secret for long.

156
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,090
We aren't trying to hide it.

157
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,559
We'll be celebrating Guan Zai's homecoming this weekend.

158
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,301
- I plan to bring Jingjing along. 
 - Okay.

159
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:39,023
You can't do that. She will steal the limelight.

160
00:09:39,023 --> 00:09:41,079
No. You can't do that. You should do it some other time.

161
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:43,380
Sister Jing, he's bullying me again.

162
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,940
Ignore him.

163
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:46,770
Eat up.

164
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,420
Eat.

165
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,097
I have to scold you.

166
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,303
Why do you always argue with Jingjing?

167
00:10:01,303 --> 00:10:02,780
How old are you?

168
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,460
You should be more considerate of her.

169
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,250
She's not a young girl either.

170
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,450
Sorry. It's my fault. I did that deliberately.

171
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:15,400
You may not remember this.

172
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,898
When I got my medical report, one of the readings is not optimal.

173
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:23,560
You cried behind my back, not wanting me to find out about it.

174
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,222
How could I not know about that?

175
00:10:26,222 --> 00:10:29,900
So I did it on purpose to distract you,

176
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,810
and to cheer you up.

177
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,320
Qiao Jingjing is as quick-witted as Yu Tu.

178
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,659
She saw what happened at a glance.

179
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:42,780
But somehow, it has become a habit.

180
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:51,390
Is Yu Tu still struggling to accept it?

181
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,700
He looked distracted just now.

182
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,930
He will get through this. He is a big-hearted man.

183
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,520
 I visited the office a while ago. 

184
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,310
 I went through all the reports. 

185
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,583
 I see a significant improvement in the overall design proposal 

186
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,940
 compared to that of two years ago. 

187
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,018
 Yu Tu. You did very well. 

188
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:37,500
 You far exceeded my expectation. 

189
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,880
 Then why do you have to leave? 

190
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,982
 You were the one who led us at the beginning of the project. 

191
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:45,480
 You named it God Searcher. 

192
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,639
 I've been waiting for your return, 

193
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,060
 so that you can keep leading us. 

194
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:56,830
 God Searcher doesn't need me anymore. 

195
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:02,379
 My presence will not contribute to the success of the model. 

196
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,300
 To be fair, you know my health status. 

197
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,820
 I can no longer take up any demanding job. 

198
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,220
 Before the auction, 

199
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,075
 there must be a period when we have to work day and night. 

200
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:25,421
 It doesn't make sense for the leader to go home earlier than everyone else. 

201
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:28,160
 - No one will mind. 
 - I mind. 

202
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,720
 I'd better handle other jobs, 

203
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,659
 so that I don't have to overtire myself for the time being. 

204
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:39,100
 You've got no idea about this. My mind hasn't been resting for the past two years, 

205
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
 even though I've been sick. 

206
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,747
 I have a lot of ideas. 

207
00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:45,120
 I'll take this opportunity to organize them. 

208
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,680
 When I'm done, you'll definitely be impressed. 

209
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,559
 Whenever God Searcher needs me, 

210
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:55,670
 I'll be right there, but only as a consultant. 

211
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,020
Is something bothering you?

212
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,440
Does it have something to do with Guan Zai?

213
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,540
Jingjing.

214
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,710
I don't feel well.

215
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,419
What happened? Did Guan Zai bully you?

216
00:13:59,419 --> 00:14:01,390
I'll hit him for you.

217
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,430
Then Sister-in-law won't take your side anymore.

218
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,500
I told you I was assigned to Guan Zai's group

219
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,839
when I first enrolled at the institute.

220
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,880
He guided me in the development of a few models,

221
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,560
including the current prototype.

222
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,900
A few years ago, he fell ill.

223
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,460
So he entrusted the project to me.

224
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,979
Now that he has recovered,

225
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,730
I thought we would get to work together again.

226
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,260
But he requested

227
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,170
to leave the God Searcher project.

228
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,230
Why?

229
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,360
He said it was no longer challenging for him.

230
00:15:01,261 --> 00:15:03,600
His health is one of the factors too.

231
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,559
So you're sad because

232
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:13,320
you won't get to work with Guan Zai anymore, right?

233
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:23,160
If I were in his shoes, I'd probably do the same too.

234
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,537
But this is such a regret.

235
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:29,190
We should've been able to accomplish this together.

236
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,134
Many of my colleagues are working hard together.

237
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:38,230
But it's different when Guan Zai's around.

238
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:45,638
I remember you once told me about

239
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,758
the meaning behind your deep space expedition.

240
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,030
You want to explore the origins of the Earth and humankind.

241
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,318
You want to prove the existence of other beings.

242
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,800
You want to find a new source of energy and even a new home planet,

243
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,999
to increase the likelihood of the survival of human civilization. Am I right?

244
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,577
You're right.

245
00:16:06,577 --> 00:16:10,437
So whatever happens in the future, or whatever Guan Zai will be doing,

246
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:13,320
you will always be working toward the same goal.

247
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,860
Although you no longer work together,

248
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,520
you'll always move forward alongside each other.

249
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,640
Just like you and I.

250
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,100
Although we are working in different industries,

251
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,017
we are moving forward alongside each other too, right?

252
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,438
Yes.

253
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,438
So it shouldn't be a regret.

254
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,320
Feeling like that won't help anyway.

255
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,280
Guan Zai will not change his mind.

256
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,260
You're always arguing with Guan Zai.

257
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,580
Yet, you know him very well.

258
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,278
Let's go home.

259
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:14,680
Jingjing, I thought I could take a break when Guan Zai was back.

260
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,081
But it seems like I have to work even harder now.

261
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:21,920
This is such a coincidence.

262
00:17:21,921 --> 00:17:27,459
Today, I told Sister Ling that I would work harder to become a better actress.

263
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:30,478
Didn't you already win the best actress award last year?

264
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,117
That shouldn't stop me from improving myself.

265
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,813
You won't stop at one star, right?

266
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:36,739
I want to win more awards.

267
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:39,459
I've aspired to improve myself since I saw how many trophies you have.

268
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:43,140
What if someone gets curious about Mr. Yu's next-of-kin,

269
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,339
and later finds out that she's just a pretty woman with no other achievements.

270
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,860
That's so embarrassing.

271
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,459
Jingjing, you're getting better and better at praising yourself.

272
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,900
All right.

273
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:25,170
 I agree with you. I will think about how to manage your prospective jobs. 

274
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,530
 You have been dating Teacher Yu for two years, 

275
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,140
 but you haven't spent much time with each other. 

276
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,480
 As the saying goes, it's easy to fall in love, but it's difficult to stay together. 

277
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,179
 You'll only know if you are suited for one another after you stay together. 

278
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,060
 Initially, I was worried about you. But now, I'm not worried anymore. 

279
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,820
 You're now a grown-up. 

280
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,699
 I've never thought about it. 

281
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:46,380
 After hearing what you said, I've now realized this issue. 

282
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,460
Yu Tu. I have a question.

283
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,480
What is it?

284
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,459
This time, we will be staying together for a longer time.

285
00:19:03,459 --> 00:19:06,788
What if we suddenly realize that we are not suited for each other?

286
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,639
When I was teaching you how to play games,

287
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:14,438
we spent a lot of time together too.

288
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,799
From 9 AM to 9 PM.

289
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,042
Every day, I had to wake up at 6 AM, and was only back home at 11 PM.

290
00:19:22,042 --> 00:19:26,837
Do you not remember how you took up all my time?

291
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,971
It was different back then.

292
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,802
Of course, it was.

293
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,398
We were only together during the day.

294
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,895
Now that I have a job, we will spend more time together at night.

295
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:53,580
Jingjing, we don't have time to fight at night.

296
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,899
I can't accept this cruel fact.

297
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,119
What's wrong?

298
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:18,499
I've got no idea. It's too early for a fit now.

299
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:20,299
It's you!

300
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:23,533
Yu Tu, guess what. He is seeing someone.

301
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:28,220
I told him that we should visit the famous restaurant together if we get off work early.

302
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,082
Then, he told me he would be visiting the place with his girlfriend.

303
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,039
I never expected that

304
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:42,679
Xiao Hu would be the first person in our office to leave singlehood.

305
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:45,359
The first person?

306
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:47,860
Who says that he's the first one?

307
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,800
I'll treat everyone to a meal this coming weekend.

308
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,799
Guan Zai is back. Let's celebrate his homecoming.

309
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:53,659
That's great.

310
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:58,600
I'll also take this chance to introduce my girlfriend to you all.

311
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,400
Girlfriend?

312
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,839
I'm still single.

313
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:13,450
But not long ago, a senior brother confessed his feelings to me.

314
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,590
I'm still considering.

315
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,740
I'm done for.

316
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,059
Big Meng. Good luck.

317
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,080
Big Meng.

318
00:21:28,979 --> 00:21:31,542
You are the best.

319
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,701
You have to be there.

320
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,640
Jingjing, it's time to go.

321
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,459
Give me another ten minutes. I'm almost done.

322
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,570
You are the prettiest when your face is bare.

323
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,230
That's impossible. The household chores have been keeping me busy.

324
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,170
I've aged quite a bit.

325
00:22:11,179 --> 00:22:14,640
I am the one who sweeps, mops, and does the dishes.

326
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,139
I prepare the food, cook, do the laundry and dust the other areas.

327
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:21,170
We do the cooking together.

328
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,680
How did you get into Tsinghua?

329
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,019
You can run an experiment, earn a Penta Kill, but you can't cook.

330
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:31,119
This proves that cooking belongs to the arts field. So, you should work harder.

331
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,699
I can survive by eating only greens. Can you?

332
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,999
It's a quarter past five now.

333
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,200
Coming.

334
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:54,519
How do I look? Don't I look very natural as though I wasn't wearing any make-up?

335
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:58,280
This is a beguiling make-up. This requires a lot of effort, and you kept rushing me.

336
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,350
I am against the light. Come closer.

337
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,340
When you lied to me and brought me to your place to fix the purifier,

338
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,920
you were wearing similar make-up too.

339
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,719
No. I only applied 5 catty of face powder.

340
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:19,682
Didn't that make you 100 catty then? Didn't Sister Ling scold you for that?

341
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:22,734
At that time, I weighed less than 95 catty.

342
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:27,979
But, I like it.

343
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:31,380
You ruined my lipstick. I'm running late.

344
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,682
The color of the lipstick is too bright and makes the make-up look less beguiling.

345
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:36,825
Is it?

346
00:23:36,825 --> 00:23:40,594
Well. Then, kiss me some more.

347
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,823
This is table number two. Is this okay?

348
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:51,022
Sure. Thanks.

349
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,675
Indeed, the single man always arrives first.

350
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:15,100
 Yu Tu, where are you? What is taking you so long? 

351
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,959
I'm stuck in a traffic jam. I'll be there in another 15 minutes.

352
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,399
 Sure. There's no rush. 

353
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:22,109
Old Guan is not here yet either.

354
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:25,301
Oh, yes. I asked the staff here. There is a minimum spending applied to the private room upstairs.

355
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:27,750
 I saw a few empty tables in the main hall. Let's do it in the main hall then. 

356
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,020
 Table number two. 

357
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,470
Take the private room.

358
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,340
 There's no need for such formality. 

359
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,110
 Although you're paying the bill, we can't spend unnecessarily too, right? 

360
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,500
It's like this. I'm doing it because my girlfriend is a delicate girl.

361
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,599
 All right. 

362
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:50,944
It's not nice to say that in front of her, right?

363
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,924
I'm only telling the truth.

364
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,649
 Okay. I've got to go. 

365
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,119
Drive safe. You're driving too fast. I'm getting carsick.

366
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:23,500
You're driving too slow now.

367
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,225
It's making me sick too.

368
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,119
All right. You are not a delicate girl.

369
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,260
When did you all get attached?

370
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,900
Why didn't you inform me?

371
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:00,140
I didn't know if the relationship would work.

372
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,240
So I kept this from you.

373
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,159
Xiao Hu announced it immediately after the relationship was determined.

374
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,504
He was exhilarated.

375
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,161
Xiao Hu has been working with Yu Tu for such a long time.

376
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,640
Why is he still not as quick-witted as Yu Tu?

377
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,759
Perhaps, the lady likes Xiao Hu for his innocence.

378
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,340
Understood. He should date a person of his own kind.

379
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,320
To tame a hyper-intelligent person like Yu Tu,

380
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,600
we need a quirky person like Qiao Jingjing.

381
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:41,240
When did Yu Tu get himself a girlfriend?

382
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,699
I think it was when he tricked you about the WeChat Mini Program.

383
00:26:44,699 --> 00:26:47,350
That was a long time ago.

384
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,799
But how did you know about this incident?

385
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,580
You were complaining about it non-stop. Have you forgotten about it?

386
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,557
But I didn't tell Old Guan about it.

387
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,259
Your IQ should be as high as your EQ.

388
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:02,339
You should learn from Yu Tu.

389
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:04,580
He doesn't have a high EQ either.

390
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,940
He called his girlfriend delicate in front of her,

391
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,050
and said that she insisted on taking a private room.

392
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:13,499
You are indeed a single man. That's called flirting.

393
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,259
- Old Guan, I... 
 - Don't listen to Yu Tu.

394
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,760
He was just showing off.

395
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,260
I hope you understand.

396
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,490
It really isn't appropriate for his girlfriend to stay in the main hall.

397
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:26,961
Why?

398
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:30,119
Actually, I saw an online post.

399
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,559
But, I was too shy to ask.

400
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:35,257
Wait a minute. What does this have to do with anything online?

401
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:37,299
There was a post...

402
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:40,400
Ms. Qiao, this is the private room.

403
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,680
Sorry, we're late.

404
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,480
Hi.

405
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,180
   
   

406
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,179
 Old Guan, please delete the photo. I'll get on my knees. 

407
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:09,860
 It's too hideous. Please delete it. 

408
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,720
 I'll buy you ten days' worth of breakfast and lunch. 

409
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,187
 It's all Yu Tu's fault. 

410
00:28:13,187 --> 00:28:15,297
 Yu Tu, show yourself. 

411
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,160
   

412
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:24,499
 I didn't take the photo. 

413
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:27,760
 You really showed yourself. I didn't want to say anything during the meal. 

414
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,340
 Do you call yourself a good friend? 

415
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,920
 You kept this from us for so long. Are you from the State Secrecy Bureau? 

416
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,780
 Wait. You were high school classmates. 

417
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,240
 Have you been dating each other for more than ten years? 

418
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,659
 That's possible. 

419
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:46,459
 Until today, I've learned that Yu Tu is such a scheming person. 

420
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:49,520
Look at what your colleagues think of you now.

421
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,740
You shouldn't deceive them ever again.

422
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,501
But, if we had gotten together back in high school, how would it have turned out?

423
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,977
Forget it. It'd be better that we didn't get together then.

424
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:04,380
Otherwise, I wouldn't have become who I am now.

425
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,839
I wouldn't have turned out to be as pretty and interesting as I am now either.

426
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:09,060
Forget about it.

427
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,960
Although we got together ten years later,

428
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,010
you have a pretty and adorable girlfriend now.

429
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,880
Aren't you happy about that?

430
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,520
Can I prove it with action?

431
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,507
 Why are you all not replying? 

432
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,944
 Where did you all go? 

433
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,533
 I don't want to know the answer anymore. 

434
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,040
♫  That anticipated and sweet moment  ♫

435
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:01,000

♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

472
00:32:53,010 --> 00:33:00,150
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

473
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:08,150
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

474
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:43,110
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

475
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:50,350
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

476
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:57,430
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

477
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:05,110
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

478
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,690
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

479
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,790
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

480
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:18,950
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

481
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:26,150
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

482
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:33,350
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

483
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:41,390
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
