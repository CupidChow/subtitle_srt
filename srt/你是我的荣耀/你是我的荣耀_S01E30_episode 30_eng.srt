1
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:18,010


2
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,250
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,210
♫  My heart is like the dust and 
couldn’t bear to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,650
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,630
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:08,230
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:28,090
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:40,150
   

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:01:57,779 --> 00:01:59,319
 Why haven't you signed up yet? 

16
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,900
 - There are only twelve spots. It'll be too late if you delay more.  
 - Stop kidding around.

17
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,159
I'm not kidding. I'm being serious.

18
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,719
If we participate in this group wedding,

19
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,360
then we'll be able to put all our troubles behind us.

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,739
 First of all, we don't have to worry about what everyone thinks of us. 

21
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:16,879
We don't even have to book the banquet ourselves.

22
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,800
Besides, we'll only need to invite those closest to us as guests.

23
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,399
 If this isn't a dream wedding, then what will be? 

24
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm so considerate that even Sister Ling would be driven to tears.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,600
 Jingjing, roll call! 

26
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,159
Coming!

27
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,879
That's it for now. Hurry and sign up. I have a filming session.

28
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,099
Okay. I'll go check it out. Good luck with your shoot.

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,120
What was that about?

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,679
Our wedding.

31
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,558
What's it going to be?

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,680
I've never been to a celebrity wedding.

33
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,819
Is it going to be grandiose? Do I need to wear a suit?

34
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:54,739
She told me to reserve a spot at the group wedding organized by our unit.

35
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,340
What?

36
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,860
Your girlfriend is a celebrity, and that's what she could come up with?

37
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,219
But then again, it really suits you.

38
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:09,519
Didn't you say to keep it simple when you took part in our colleague's wedding?

39
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,560
When did I say that?

40
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,260
Years ago.

41
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,400
Well? Are you going to sign up?

42
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,998
No way.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,817
She'll change her mind in a few days.

44
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:28,439
After all, Ms Qiao's plan took us from the beach to the grass,

45
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:32,659
to the hotel, and to the beach again.

46
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,880
 Are you off-duty? Have you signed up? 

47
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,360
- Are you serious? 
 - Of course. You haven't signed up yet, have you?

48
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,637
There are only twelve spots. Hurry and sign up.

49
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,319
You can't change your mind after you sign up.

50
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,390
Otherwise, you'll waste spots for others.

51
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,480
Are you sure that you won't change your mind?

52
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,040
Of course not.

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,639
I was a little impulsive that day.

54
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,839
But now the more I think about it, the more appropriate it is.

55
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,659
 Before we talk about appropriateness, 

56
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:27,959
 have you even taken your parents and also Sister Ling into consideration? 

57
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,977
Will they agree?

58
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:31,517
Never mind about Sister Ling.

59
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,160
As for Mom and Dad, I'll take care of it.

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,140
 If they agree, then you'll sign up? 

61
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,160
Yes.

62
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,115
I'll go ask them now.

63
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,070
   

64
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:58,279
The bid will be in half a year's time.

65
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:02,060
I'm already nervous about it.

66
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,240
Somehow I didn't even notice.

67
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,740
Come on.

68
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,060
   

69
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,660
   

70
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,200
 - Yu Tu.  
 - Auntie, I was in the lab.

71
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,720
 Jingjing called us. 

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,000
 She said she wanted to join the group wedding organized by your unit. 

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,215
 Are you aware of this? 

74
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,358
Yes, she told me.

75
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,423
But I don't think it's appropriate.

76
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,059
 I see. Jingjing made several calls to tell me this. 

77
00:05:41,059 --> 00:05:43,800
 At first, I firmly disapproved of it. 

78
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,059
 But somehow, she won me over. 

79
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:49,839
Haven't you two come to an agreement?

80
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,079
I thought you wouldn't agree.

81
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,160
We and Jingjing's parents sat down for a meal just to talk about this.

82
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,040
 And then, she won over her parents, too. 

83
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,098
 They were kind of pleased. 

84
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,319
Son, if you have any reservations about this,

85
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,839
you can talk it over with her.

86
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,579
Yes, Mom.

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,680
Yu Tu, aren't you joining us for dinner? We need to work overtime.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,980
You guys go ahead. I'm going home.

89
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,959
That workaholic is ditching overtime today.

90
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,703
The big star is filming right now, isn't she? Why is he going home so early?

91
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:12,598
 Mr. Yu, you've been through a really rough day. 

92
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,757
 Life needs a sense of ritual. 

93
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:16,199
 I'm a pragmatist. 

94
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,760
 Well I'm here. Your pragmatism has to go. 

95
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,800
 See, isn't it much better? 

96
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,619
   

97
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:58,800
 Jingjing, if you're getting married, what kind of wedding do you want? 

98
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,020
 My dream wedding should be a very, very romantic one. 

99
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,299
 I'll have the ground littered with flowers, invite lots and lots of friends, 

100
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:12,900
 and we'll all sing and dance together. 

101
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,879
 I'll wear a white wedding dress, and gradually walk towards the groom, 

102
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:18,180
 Then he'll hold my hand and put a ring on me, 

103
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,759
 and we'll recite our vows. 

104
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,079
 To me, that's love at its best. 

105
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,539
 If there are stars in the sky, then it should be quite romantic. 

106
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:34,559
 This is my very ideal romantic wedding. 

107
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,740
   

108
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:45,637
 Who's there? 

109
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,139
It's me.

110
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,179
What brought you here?

111
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,679
Tomorrow is the weekend?

112
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,320
Come in quick.

113
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,920
Come on.

114
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:04,210
Why do we have to attend a group wedding?

115
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,459
Did you drive over 200 kilometers just to ask me this question?

116
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:12,900
You said it.

117
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,159
You've dreamed of a very romantic wedding littered with flowers.

118
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,380
And lots and lots of friends will be invited.

119
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,659
Wait. When did I say that?

120
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,159
Two years ago.

121
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,510
When you were interviewed as a jewelry spokeswoman.

122
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:29,120
Did you believe it?

123
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,520
When they asked me during the interview, I had to make up an answer on the spot.

124
00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:39,320
Then what kind of wedding do you want?

125
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:49,679
Yu Tu, do you think that I'm concerned about your finances,

126
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,360
so I came up with the group wedding?

127
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,000
Jingjing.

128
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,670
I also want to do the best I can.

129
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:11,839
Thank you.

130
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,660
I'm about to marry you.

131
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,370
Of course, you have to do your best.

132
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:20,959
But this time, all I really need is just a simple wedding.

133
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,820
You know that I'm at the center of attention.

134
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,699
You must consider many things if you want to get married.

135
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:31,598
You want to keep it secret, but it's hard to get it done.

136
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,450
I want to invite only a few close friends.

137
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:37,879
But someone will resent it.

138
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:41,677
So in the end, our wedding may be a social gathering.

139
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,059
We have to keep socializing, toasting, and taking photos.

140
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:49,979
There may be a tiny hitch that might end up trending.

141
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:54,299
But if we participate in your unit's wedding, such problems will no longer exist.

142
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,479
By then, we'll simply be a pair of newlyweds,

143
00:10:57,479 --> 00:11:00,599
albeit with many more newlyweds. So what?

144
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:03,420
There're so many people getting married every day.

145
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,930
We are just an ordinary couple amongst them all.

146
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:10,139
A young couple.

147
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,939
But I think that belongs to both of us.

148
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:18,190
Just you and I. No disturbance. No social media.

149
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,299
A wedding is between two people.

150
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:29,090
From you to me, and from me to you.

151
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:36,030
I hope you don't mind having such a wedding.

152
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,020
Jingjing.

153
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,410
I suddenly felt that my previous proposal wasn't very formal.

154
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,450
It was a bit rash.

155
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,020
I want to do it again. To propose to you formally.

156
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,540
I didn't think so, but... All right.

157
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,660
Student Qiao Jingjing.

158
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,350
We have known each other for almost 16 years.

159
00:12:35,986 --> 00:12:41,030
Because of my prejudices, we missed each other for thirteen years.

160
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:45,070
You may not regret it,

161
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,950
but I do.

162
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,770
Fortunately, we still have decades ahead of us.

163
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:57,240
Please leave the rest of your time to me.

164
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:06,320
With diligence, and my best effort,

165
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:09,950
I will be a good husband.

166
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,283
Good. I will be good too.

167
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,390
Thank you.

168
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,510
Come in.

169
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:28,880
Ms. Wang?

170
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,320
Dr. Yu, what brings you here?

171
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,260
Ms. Wang, I'm here to sign up for the group wedding.

172
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,320
Dr. Yu.

173
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,180
Well... do you have a new girlfriend?

174
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,280
No.

175
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,620
Here's the form.

176
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,130
And a pen?

177
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,440
Thanks.

178
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:36,760
 Yu Tu, come to my office. 

179
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:40,740
Professor.

180
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,550
Yu Tu, come on in.

181
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,730
Take a seat.

182
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,290
Well...

183
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,819
Have you...

184
00:15:57,819 --> 00:15:59,530
No.

185
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:01,620
What?

186
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,570
I don't have a new girlfriend.

187
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:07,320
I wasn't about to ask you about that! If you had a new one,

188
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,700
would the folks at that department have called me about it?

189
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,530
I was about to ask you.

190
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,699
Do you have any trouble turning around your finances?

191
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:25,320
If that troubles you, my wife and I can help.

192
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,179
Thank you. But I'm doing fine.

193
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:33,460
Jingjing and I, we just want to make the wedding a little simpler.

194
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,120
Did she agree to that?

195
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,560
She suggested it.

196
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,400
"She suggested it"?

197
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,400
She's been rather mischievous.

198
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:47,980
However, she wants to keep things simple.

199
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,277
She thinks she'd get away from the media if we hold it in the institute.

200
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,080
I know, that can't be possible.

201
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,200
So last night, we discussed that if it couldn't be kept secret,

202
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,159
then it'd probably affect my colleagues.

203
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,917
So we won't attend.

204
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,919
That was what I told Ms. Wang just now.

205
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,100
Keeping your nuptials a secret? That's not a problem.

206
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,398
We are the best at keeping secrets.

207
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,940
By then

208
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:19,890
you'll show up after the wedding ceremony begins.

209
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,559
But what if the secret was leaked midway?

210
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,820
What would you do?

211
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,900
 Surely the wedding won't be held in the institute. 

212
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,060
 It should be in a nearby hotel, just like it's always been. 

213
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,889
 So it may not be kept secret. 

214
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,680
 So it's not in your unit then? 

215
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,239
 If someone finds out, we'll just run away? 

216
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:44,659
 See, that's the benefit of joining a group wedding. 

217
00:17:44,659 --> 00:17:48,020
 If we hold our own wedding, we can't run anywhere. 

218
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,459
 Then I'll have to get myself a pair of sneakers. 

219
00:17:51,459 --> 00:17:53,680
 You, too. 

220
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,870
 I'll just get us one pair. 

221
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,620
 You'll carry me on your back? 

222
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,980
 Then I'll have to order a 50kg wedding dress. 

223
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:10,830
 Can you cut it down to half? Make it 25 kg. 

224
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,720
 12.5 kg? 

225
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,172
 Plus me, that makes 100 kg! 

226
00:18:16,172 --> 00:18:18,120
 I need to eat more. 

227
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,417
It depends on when it gets leaked.

228
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:27,360
If it's early, we'll change plans.

229
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,940
If the leak happens during the wedding...

230
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,800
We'll flee right away.

231
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,680
Once you're done hosting,

232
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,419
find another place to host for us a second time.

233
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:42,699
Are you kidding?

234
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:44,820
This is a wedding, not a guerrilla gig!

235
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,340
This is simply nonsensical.

236
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:51,518
Professor. Have some water.

237
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,420
You're so sly.

238
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,320
Are you setting me up?

239
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,800
Yu Tu. At last, you've completed the most important event of your life.

240
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,060
I'm so happy for you.

241
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:15,858
Xiao Qiao is a fine young lady.

242
00:19:15,858 --> 00:19:20,100
From now on, you must treat her well.

243
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,660
I will.

244
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,060
   

245
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,659
   

246
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:35,939
    
 Families to the air show, get on the bus here.

247
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:38,459
We're about to set off soon.

248
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,979
Are they here already?

249
00:19:53,979 --> 00:19:55,880
The bride is still wearing a veil.

250
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,839
No one seemed to notice them.

251
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,879
Let's leave them alone.

252
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:05,299
Why are there some brides who haven't put on their makeup?

253
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,480
Fix this for me.

254
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,859
- There you go. 
 - Okay.

255
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,177
There are so many people.

256
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:23,720
Are you nervous?

257
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,060
A little bit.

258
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,118
Give me your hand.

259
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Are you still nervous?

260
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,480
I'm feeling much better.

261
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:46,559
Thank you.

262
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,380
Mr. Yu, Ms. Qiao. If you need anything, call me.

263
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,200
We just had our pictures taken outdoors.

264
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,340
So we came in to take a rest and enjoy the atmosphere.

265
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,980
- You don't have to mind us. 
 - Okay.

266
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,079
We only found out today that you're here for the wedding.

267
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:05,140
I'm really surprised.

268
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,100
But don't worry.

269
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,140
All our staff will keep your secret.

270
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,019
Thank you. I appreciate that.

271
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:14,820
As it should.

272
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,780
Are we going to gather up at 10:28 AM to head for the banquet hall?

273
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,280
Yes.

274
00:21:19,979 --> 00:21:22,739
Haven't you taken part in the rehearsal? 
    

275
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,759
Then do you need me to explain

276
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:27,621
the whole wedding process all over again once you're in the hall?

277
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:29,499
Don't worry, I got that covered.

278
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:31,780
I have a lot of experience in this area.

279
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,109
I will take good care of Mr. Yu.

280
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:38,039
I have BDS. So it's okay. 
  (T/N: BDS stands for BeiDou Navigation Satellite System) 

281
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,799
Then please excuse me.

282
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:45,619
We're expecting a team of makeup artists who seem to be late.

283
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,960
They'll be here as soon as they can.

284
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:55,338
What's going on?

285
00:21:55,338 --> 00:21:56,680
I called them.

286
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,860
- The makeup artists' ride crashed into another vehicle. 
 - Are they all right?

287
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,980
Yes. But they're slightly injured. So they won't make it.

288
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,000
So we're four makeup artists down.

289
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,200
Are we able to handle it? It's too late to find substitutes.

290
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,700
Well...

291
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,359
Go ask the hotel and see what they can do.

292
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,060
All right.

293
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,258
We have a problem.

294
00:22:19,258 --> 00:22:23,200
You see, the makeup artists we originally appointed suddenly could not make it.

295
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,160
So now, we're four makeup artists down.

296
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,220
So I'd like to ask if anyone can volunteer to be our makeup artist.

297
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,869
Can any brides apply makeup on their own?

298
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:35,189
I don't usually wear makeup.

299
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm not even good at makeup. I'm no match for a makeup artist.

300
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,619
Besides, our marriage is such a big deal.

301
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:42,276
How can we just make do?

302
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:44,680
It's okay...

303
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,640
Will we make it if we get our other makeup artists to speed up?

304
00:22:48,642 --> 00:22:50,801
It's definitely too late.

305
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,900
Sorry. I'll think of a way.

306
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,559
Do you guys need makeup artists? I brought over a team.

307
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,240
Hello. We are Ms Qiao's makeup team.

308
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,419
May I ask who are the brides that need us to do make up?

309
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:28,300
These four.

310
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,079
Some grooms also need to be tidied up a bit.

311
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,279
Do we have enough time?

312
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,599
The wedding will begin in one hour.

313
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:36,678
The brides are very beautiful. Of course, we'll make it.

314
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,700
Thank you.

315
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,540
You're welcome.

316
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:49,979
Yu Tu?

317
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,959
- Mr. Wang. 
 - Are you part of the group wedding?

318
00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:01,039
That's not right. Isn't your girlfriend a celebrity?

319
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,767
I don't suppose you're a best man?

320
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,900
Today, I'm a groom, too.

321
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,520
Congratulations.

322
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:20,219
It's Qiao Jingjing.

323
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:22,495
Qiao Jingjing? Where is she?

324
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,977
Let's get out of here.

325
00:24:25,977 --> 00:24:27,440
Are Mom and Dad here?

326
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,958
Not yet.

327
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,362
Then where are we going?

328
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:36,359
You said it yourself that we'd run if we were spotted.

329
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,120
Three,

330
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,280
two,

331
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:46,579
one.

332
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,300
Do we really have to run? My parents will kill us for this!

333
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,959
We're not running.

334
00:24:56,899 --> 00:24:58,179
Suddenly, I got a little nervous.

335
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:01,042
What if I make a mistake in the process?

336
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,199
Let's go to practice again.

337
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,280
Come on.

338
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,079
Is this it?

339
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,479
Yes.

340
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,719
We'll get married inside.

341
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:56,123
Let's start rehearsing.

342
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,797
Before the wedding, a staff member will bring us here.

343
00:26:02,797 --> 00:26:05,718
And then one couple after another will be admitted in order.

344
00:26:05,718 --> 00:26:08,799
We are the last newlyweds to enter.

345
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,119
Are we too far behind?

346
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,580
No. I've always been the last on stage.

347
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,499
I thought so.

348
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:21,399
All right. Let's go in.

349
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,240
So romantic!

350
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:32,880
This runway is shaped like a spoon.

351
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,559
It's the Big Dipper.

352
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,920
You are now stepping on its Alkaid star.

353
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,119
If I walk right down, will the other six stars light up?

354
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,219
They'll light up wherever you walk.

355
00:27:50,979 --> 00:27:53,080
You aerospace people are so romantic!

356
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,719
Who came up with this?

357
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:58,179
Those in charge created a group from our unit.

358
00:27:58,179 --> 00:27:59,939
I added it under my alternate account.

359
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:02,219
We all selected the cosmic theme.

360
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:04,080
But this runway,

361
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,399
I designed it.

362
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,340
It was you?

363
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:13,119
I don't believe it.

364
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,279
When I said that I'd plan my own wedding,

365
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,119
you didn't think of anything.

366
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,123
Okay, stop running around.

367
00:28:22,123 --> 00:28:24,271
Let's enter.

368
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,500
Next, we'll walk on the stage together.

369
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,070
We will stand here.

370
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:59,580
Looks like you've memorized it all. You don't need me to navigate.

371
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,000
Today, I am your BDS.

372
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:04,919
And then?

373
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,800
Then the emcee will announce

374
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,259
that the wedding officially begins.

375
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:15,200
My professor will witness our marriage.

376
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:21,498
Today, it is a great honor for me 
    

377
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:28,019
to witness the marriages of twelve new couples from Shanghai Aerospace.

378
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,100
We have a huge crowd...

379
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,300
Our parents, relatives, and friends

380
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,430
will watch us from the audience.

381
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:44,839
That is, to meet our beloved life partners who support each other.

382
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,559
We desire a stargazer's romance.

383
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,019
We also desire a well-grounded happiness.

384
00:30:55,357 --> 00:30:59,559
Next, we'd like to invite our newlyweds on stage to face each other.

385
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:02,439
   
We'll exchange rings,

386
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,599
and recite our vows.

387
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,119
Together we will shoulder the responsibilities and obligations

388
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,559
that come with our marriage.

389
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,880
- To honor our parents. 
 - To honor our parents.

390
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,440
- To teach our children. 
 - To teach our children.

391

- To respect and love each other.

392
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,037
- To trust and encourage each other. 
 - To trust and encourage each other.

393
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,979
And complete our wedding. 
    

394
00:31:47,859 --> 00:31:49,559
Finally,

395
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,539
I may hug you, and tell you

396
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,891
that I love you.

397
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:11,919
Grooms, you may kiss your brides.

398
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,880
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

399
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,700
♫  My heart is like the dust and 
couldn’t bear to stain the hemline  ♫

400
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:27,360
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

401
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,319
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

402
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:35,220
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

403
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,999
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

404
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:43,420
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

405
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:51,040
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

406
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:58,720
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

407
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:06,640
♫  I look forward to every second  ♫

408
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:15,954
♫  I can run toward the future with you  ♫

409
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:21,380
♫  Regardless of everything  ♫

410
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,260
   
   

411
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,820
   
   

412
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,217
Qiao Jingjing got married!

413
00:33:41,217 --> 00:33:42,920
And it was in a group wedding.

414
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,620
No way. This news is so fake.

415
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,000
The photos are out.

416
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,117
It really is a group wedding.

417
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:50,120
I'm going to be a fan of hers.

418
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:53,640
A celebrity actually joined a group wedding? That's not something you get every day!

419
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,498
She surely loves her husband a lot.

420
00:33:57,498 --> 00:33:59,359
Isn't her husband that guy from National Aerospace Research Institute?

421
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:01,359
No kidding! But it's so low-key.

422
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,300
It must be true love.

423
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,519
Oh my God!

424
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,799
I want her husband's picture in one minute!

425
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,639
Her husband is so handsome!

426
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,958
Qiao Jingjing is so lucky.

427
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,238
He's a national scientific researcher.

428
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,360
I think we've got the best brother-in-law!

429
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,839
I'm so envious of her.

430
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,180
   

431
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,480
   

432
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,560
   
   

433
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:57,619
It's so quiet.

434
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,359
I'm going to post on Weibo to tell my fans I'm married.

435
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,259
The phone, please?

436
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,660
No, you post it for me.

437
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:18,579
Post what?

438
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,479
Post

439
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,504
I love you, too.

440
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:58,890


441
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:11,480
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

442
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:18,680
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

443
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:29,360
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

444
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,510
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

445
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:36,050
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

446
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:40,150
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

447
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:47,250
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

448
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:54,510
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

449
00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:01,580
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

450
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:13,580
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

451
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:44,540
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

452
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:51,800
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

453
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:58,960
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

454
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:06,600
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

455
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,240
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

456
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,240
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

457
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:20,440
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

458
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:27,660
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

459
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:34,780
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

460
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:46,310
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
