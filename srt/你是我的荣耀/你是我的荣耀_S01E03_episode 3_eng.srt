 Timing and Subtitles brought to you by the 
  🐇  Jade Rabbit Team  🐇  @Viki.com 

2
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,300
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,197
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:36,800
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,700
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,400
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,840
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:00,480
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,380
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:15,940
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:28,900
♫  I’ve fallen for you, but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,100
   

14
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,980
   

15
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,940
 Can you be my coach? 

16
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,219
 I think it'll be better if you find someone else. 

17
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:59,620
 I might quit this game at any time. 

18
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,179
 Can you guide me a bit when we normally play? 

19
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:07,380
 You can point out my mistakes, and how I should fix them. Is that all right? 

20
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,239
 If you quit, I'll find someone else. 

21
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:14,100
 Jade Rabbit God, please. 

22
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,200
   

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,380
   

24
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,860
 Okay. 

25
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,180
Okay!

26
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,499
One step at a time.

27
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:40,020
Since you agreed to the first step, the second one is not far now.

28
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,900
Wait.

29
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,739
What's the second step?

30
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:49,320
 Let's get started, then. 

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,840
Hey, my Support.

32
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:02,539
 Use Wang Zhaojun. 

33
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:06,660
Use Wang Zhaojun? I don't know how to. I haven't tried it before.

34
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:10,759
If your workplace has a competition, there's a good chance it's in Draft Pick.

35
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,699
You might not necessarily get Cai Wenji.

36
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:14,600
It's not bad for a newbie to use Wang Zhaojun.

37
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,120
For the summoners' abilities, change it to Flash.

38
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,140
Hold on.

39
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,379
Did something happen that I'm not aware of?

40
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,499
 What workplace competition? 

41
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:27,759
It's the Honor of Kings competition organized by my workplace.

42
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,659
I would like Jade Rabbit God to teach me.

43
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:32,580
You don't say. Yu Tu is quite a good coach.

44
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,819
Zhai Liang is a good example.

45
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:37,039
 Look how screwed up it was when he used Xi Shi. 

46
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:38,900
I watched him once

47
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,659
to learn the techniques,

48
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:44,059
but I learned the rest all by myself.

49
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:46,300
Keep bluffing.

50
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:59,159
Finally, the kill count is higher than the number of times I was slain.

51
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,900
   

52
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,180
   

53
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,279
 Why are the opponents using Wang Zhaojun as well? 

54
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,030
 It feels worse than an outfit clash. 

55
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,270
 Absolute zero. 

56
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,110
 You have been slain. 

57
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,120
 You have been slain. 

58
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,140
Am I going to lead you guys to defeat?

59
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,940
Get to highland!

60
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,680
 Victory! 

61
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,330
   

62
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,060
   

63
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,760
   

64
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,179
When I was learning acting, I had to watch the videos of my seniors repeatedly.

65
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:07,019
Now, I have to do the same and watch how I got slain when playing games.

66
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,619
I bet it's because I have been gifted with such great beauty.

67
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:14,740
So all other talents need to be cut back.

68
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,299
   

69
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:20,660
That was so devious.

70
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,739
 You have been slain. 
   

71
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:28,820
Yu Tu is way more devious.

72
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,320
That's why we won.

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,660
Is this game all about who is more devious?

74
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,379
That explains why I lost.

75
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,739
It's all because I'm an upright person.

76
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,600
Be patient.

77
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,500
Be patient.

78
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,699
Sure enough. It's more satisfying than using Cai Wenji.

79
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:07,040
Cotton, not bad, right?

80
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:09,979
How is it? I'm doing better now than I did yesterday, right?

81
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:11,800
 It's already really good. 

82
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,020
I've been practicing all day today.

83
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,160
   

84
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,099
 Hard work pays off! 

85
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:23,140
 I'll prove it with my singing! 

86
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,439
 I'm really something. 

87
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,500
 Triple Kill. 

88
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,759
I have to save this game.

89
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,279
 Cool! Nice one, Girl. 

90
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,759
 But Yu Tu, I never thought a kill stealer like you would let her get the kill. 

91
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,720
 Did he let me get the kill? 

92
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,380
   

93
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,439
He really did let me win.

94
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,740
   

95
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,800
He still hasn't replied.

96
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,499
 Did you let me win when I got the Triple Kill? 

97
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,979
 I've earned enough. 

98
00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:00,160
 It's better for you to get the kill. 

99
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,080
   

100
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,880
   

101
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,980
   

102
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,639
 Thank you. 

103
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:35,799
Dandan, get me the cosmetics contract.

104
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,680
I'll go over it and discuss the details with them later.

105
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,920
- Tell Mr. Wang to get the car ready. 
 - Okay.

106
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,820
Give Mr. Wang a call.

107
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,319
Where is Jingjing?

108
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,200
It's only one o'clock, and she's already gone?

109
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,840
Jingjing hasn't been here for a few days now. Xiao Zhu said she asked you for a leave.

110
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,799
She merely asked for a day off.

111
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,140
Wait, she didn't come here at all while I was away on the business trip?

112
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,440
Why didn't you tell me?

113
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,220
I'll check her place.

114
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,999
Jingjing. Jingjing.

115
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:25,059
Why haven't you come in the past two days?

116
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,299
Have you been practicing by yourself at home?

117
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,280
Let me see.

118
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,819
Not bad.

119
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:52,480
Are you battling AI players?

120
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Are you joking? I'm doing solo matchmaking, all right?

121
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,900
Solo queue?

122
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,440
You're really something now.

123
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,240
You have the guts to do solo matchmaking now.

124
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,639
I was nervous at first, but it's better now.

125
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,899
I've reached Gold 4 now. I did solo matchmaking and ranked up myself.

126
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:08,920
What has gotten into you? You're so good now.

127
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,600
I'm talented!

128
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,180
   
   

129
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,759
   

130
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,420
That's so awesome.

131
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,440
   

132
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,240
   

133
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,060
Let me see.

134
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,200
Wait.

135
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,279
A'Guo never taught you how to use this hero.

136
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:26,519
Did you practice it yourself?

137
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,159
Actually, I asked a game expert to guide me.

138
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:31,359
I think he's better than A'Guo.

139
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:34,220
That's hard to say.

140
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,300
Is he reliable? Will he expose your identity?

141
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,120
Don't worry. I bet he doesn't even know who I am.

142
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,759
Is he an online friend?

143
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,080
How does he teach you then?

144
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,440
Through voice chat.

145
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,320
He teaches me how to use the abilities, how to sidestep, and what I should do.

146
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,500
I'm going to get some water.

147
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,719
Let's see.

148
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,519
Who is it?

149
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,480
Open up my friend lists in the game.

150
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,840
His name is Jade Rabbit Pounding Elixir.

151
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,600
Click on the avatar, and you can see his performance records.

152
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,039
   

153
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,480
He has a 93-percent win rate.

154
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,500
For real?

155
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:10,920
Indeed. He seems to be better than A'Guo.

156
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,799
It's a shame he's just an online friend.

157
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,080
If there's such a good player in real life who's that reliable to teach you in person,

158
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,479
you'd progress a lot faster.

159
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,240
 Yu Tu exists in real life. 

160
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,959
 If he teaches me in person... 

161
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:28,799
But it's okay. Just keep up the training.

162
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,960
There's still a month to go. You need to step up your training.

163
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,360
I've basically declined all the job offers you have lined up.

164
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,340
But for those that we accepted a few months ago, we still have to fulfill them.

165
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,200
Why are you in a daze?

166
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,600
Oh! I know.

167
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,039
You do? Really?

168
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,840
I'll get going then. I still have a contract to discuss.

169
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Okay.

170
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,320
Keep it up.

171
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,559
Got it.

172
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,559
Drink more water. Protect your skin.

173
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,059
Bye.

174
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,180
   

175
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,320
Why is Yu Tu online every day?

176
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,799
He plays games every day.

177
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,900
Is this how he spends his vacation?

178
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,239
 Rabbit God. 

179
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,939
 Do you spend your vacation playing games at home? 

180
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,759
 What does he do now? 

181
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,379
 It doesn't feel like he's in the financial industry. 

182
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,900
 Peipei do we have any classmates who have really cool jobs now?  

183
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,800
 It's you, isn't it? 

184
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,780
 I mean, what are those with good grades doing right now? 

185
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,560
 I see. Those guys? 

186
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,479
 Qi Qi is working as an editor-in-chief in a book company. 

187
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:58,400
 Wang Jiang is now a vice president in one of the top 500 corporations. 

188
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,000
 Who else? 

189
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,060
 Sun Xiu is working in the Office of the Secretary to the Mayor. 

190
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,319
 How about Yu Tu? 

191
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,159
 I think Yu Tu is working at Aerospace Research Institute in Shanghai. 

192
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,759
 Aerospace? 

193
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,279
 He's in the aerospace industry? 

194
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,300
 But didn't he study finance back in college? 

195
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,120
 How do you remember so clearly? 

196
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,640
 How would I know why he joined aerospace? 

197
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,632
 Why do you ask? 

198
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,940
 Check this out. 

199
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,039
   

200
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,639
 Yu Tu, I bought the air purifier which was posted by your institute on WeChat Moments. 

201
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,919
 It broke down all of a sudden. I called to request a repair, but I couldn't get through. 

202
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,320
 Could you help me with it? 

203
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,960
 I just managed to reach them. They said they could only come over tomorrow night to fix it. 

204
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,480
 This is for the kid's room. 

205
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,120
 Could you inform them to come as soon as possible? 

206
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,720
 This kid coughs a lot when he has a cold. 

207
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,240
 Yu Tu sells air purifiers? 

208
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,159
 I think they developed it for civilian use or something. 

209
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,879
 I thought aerospace tech must be really cool, but still, totally unexpected. 

210
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,639
 - Which part is broken? 
 - I can't turn it on. 

211
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,640
 Are you staying in Minhang? I'll go over and take a look. 

212
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,020
 Why did you send this to me? 

213
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,840
 It was in the group chat yesterday. 

214
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,840
 I just recalled so I sent it to you. 

215
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,359
 He's indeed in the aerospace industry. 

216
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:49,520
 Yu Tu, Chang'e 1 has been launched. 

217
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,639
 Someone else is a step ahead of your dream. 

218
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:52,759
 That's perfect, isn't it? 

219
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,679
 Perhaps, by the time I graduate, the moon base will already be built. 

220
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,779
 I'll use the moon as a starting point to conquer Mars and fly out of the solar system. 

221
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:02,320
 Keep bluffing. 

222
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,440
 It doesn't cost me anything to bluff, does it? 

223
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,900
 Fine. You're the top student. So you must be right. 

224
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,600
 Wait up! 

225
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,320
It turns out he didn't give up on his dream.

226
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,619
 Yu Tu is in this city, too. 

227
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,458
 Peipei. Show me the air purifier advertisement that Yu Tu posted. 

228
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:17,760
 It's time to unleash my acting skills. 

229
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,760
 Welcome to Honor of Kings. 

230
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,300
 The enemy's army will arrive at the battlefield in five seconds. Please get ready. 

231
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,480
The smog in Shanghai is too serious. How about you guys?

232
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,799
What a coincidence.

233
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,039
Yu Tu and I are in Shanghai, too.

234
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,899
The smog in Hangzhou is pretty serious, too.

235
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:41,359
The situation in Wuhan is all right.

236
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:44,120
What brand of air purifier do you use?

237
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,840
I bought a Jade Rabbit Air Purifier,

238
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,360
 but it broke down after a few days. 

239
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,919
Yu Tu?

240
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:53,919
Isn't that your company's product?

241
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,840
Is that a product of Jade Rabbit God's company?

242
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,499
That explains it. I bought it because it's the same name as yours.

243
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:01,060
What a coincidence.

244
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,700
It's a product developed by our lab and another company.

245
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,139
Try using another plug.

246
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:07,639
A classmate of mine bought it and said it wasn't working either.

247
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:11,259
 I took a look and found out it was the plug's problem. 

248
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:13,440
 Why did this classmate steal my idea? 

249
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,260
I tried using another plug, but it still didn't work.

250
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,379
I called for repair, but they said it was scheduled for the day after tomorrow,

251
00:17:19,379 --> 00:17:23,300
but my elderly parents are having really bad coughs.

252
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,920
The after-sales service isn't that good.

253
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,299
Yu Tu. Take a look for Cotton.

254
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,680
 What a good line. 

255
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,940
 I have to send So Panicky a set of skins. 

256
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,680
Jade Rabbit God, do you even know how to do that?

257
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,260
Of course.

258
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,960
He is a part-time troubleshooting expert.

259
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,300
Well, Jade Rabbit God, could you take a look at the purifier at my place?

260
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,060
Send me your contact details.

261
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,820
 That was easy. 

262
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:57,100
I'll get the guys at the lab to go to your place and take a look first.

263
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,880
 I knew it wouldn't be that easy. 

264
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,480
 It was so hard to get him to add me on QQ back then. 

265
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,080
 Good thing I still have a trick up my sleeve. 

266
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,419
Thank you, but this is actually the second repair.

267
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,640
I think there's no point in asking them to come anyway.

268
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,419
 That's so unreliable. 

269
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:15,000
What actually went wrong?

270
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,780
I wanted to buy it, but I changed my mind now.

271
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,620
- That's right, Yu Tu. Are your products reliable? 
 - Seriously.

272
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,600
 That's right. 

273
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,380
I bought it because it says on the ads that it's aerospace tech.

274
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,680
Yet I never expected...

275
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,580
 Sorry. The great aerospace industry of the motherland. 

276
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,519
 I'll make it up to you next time. 

277
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:35,580
Didn't the repair guy say what went wrong?

278
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,359
He seemed to be in a bad spot, and he didn't say what the problem was.

279
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,860
 Yu Tu, why don't you go and take a look? 

280
00:18:45,939 --> 00:18:47,780
Do you live with your parents?

281
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,720
That's right.

282
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,939
 Are they at home now? 

283
00:18:50,939 --> 00:18:52,839
Yes.

284
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,820
If it's convenient, I'll come over and take a look.

285
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,419
My house is in Pudong. Is it too far?

286
00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:03,519
So sorry to bother you.

287
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,559
 It's fine. Send me the address. 

288
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,240
You're so lame.

289
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,900
Why do you have to go when her parents are around?

290
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,379
You're the lame one.

291
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,440
Xiao Zhu. Xiao Zhu.

292
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,340
Quickly unpack this newly bought purifier.

293
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,179
Hurry.

294
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,559
How's my makeup?

295
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,060
It's too thick, isn't it?

296
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,960
I knew it.

297
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,900
It's too thick.

298
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:18,960
Do I look girlie?

299
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,799
Yes. Well...

300
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,400
Jingjing, it's late at night. What are you doing?

301
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
Is this a dress-up game?

302
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,400
Destroy the air purifier.

303
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:53,700
   

304
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:17,100
   

305
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,100
Cotton?

306
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,200
No, it's not me. I'm her assistant.

307
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,300
She sent me down to get you.

308
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,000
Assistant?

309
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,400
It's right in front.

310
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,100
I'm Xiao Zhu.

311
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,900
We're almost there.

312
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,500
Jingjing, why did you come downstairs?

313
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,600
I'm worried someone might think that I'm being a snob.

314
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,900
That's why I came down to welcome him.

315
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,500
- It's been a while. 
 - It's been a while.

316
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,600
Has it been ten years?

317
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,300
About that.

318
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,200
Let's take a look at the purifier.

319
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,000
I've stayed in the house for days and haven't stepped out.

320
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,500
I'm feeling a little light-headed. Why don't we go for a walk first?

321
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,400
Here's the thing. I wanted to use the excuse that the power's off,

322
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,200
but I didn't expect Ding Chaoqun already used it.

323
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,700
I couldn't bear the thought of destroying such a cute purifier

324
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,000
so it's doing its work right now.

325
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,800
It's quite cold out here.

326
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,900
I'm going back up to get changed. Wait for me.

327
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,900
   

328
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,200
   

329
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
   

330
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,600
   

331
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,700
   

332
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,300
   
   

333
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,700
I don't feel so safe walking with you.

334
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,100
Are you kidding me?

335
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,300
I should be the one to say that.

336
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,400
No.

337
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,200
When I came out with Xiao Zhu, the girl you saw earlier,

338
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,400
there weren't as many people who turned around to look at us.

339
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,100
Don't make me get photographed, or I'll make the headlines.

340
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,300
Why would you play games with me?

341
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,700
Didn't you invite me? You invited the wrong person. Have you forgotten?

342
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,900
But... why would you be on my QQ friend list?

343
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,900
 Do I have to explain that I used an alternate user ID to secretly add your QQ account? 

344
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
Do you have amnesia or something?

345
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,100
Are you also going to ask me why I asked you here today?

346
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,500
Do you have a Weibo account?

347
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,600
Yes.

348
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,400
Well, log in to your account and check out mine.

349
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,100
   

350
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,800
 Yes, my Goddess is so adorable! 

351
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,800
 An air purifier recommended by the Goddess. I'm buying it! 

352
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,780
 I'm posting the review. I think it's the last unit. 

353
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,880
 When I checked again, the product was sold out. 

354
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,500
 I'll post one. I almost didn't get it. 

355
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,400
 - You snatched the same product as my Goddess. 
 - How much did she get paid for posting this? 

356
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,800
 @The Crescent Moon. 

357
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,200
 Isn't your husband working with that company? Ask him. 

358
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,800
 I did. He said they didn't pay her. 

359
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,700
 The less popular celebrity charges 300,000 yuan for one post. 

360
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,000
 Let alone Qiao Jingjing. 

361
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,500
 My husband said it was all sold out. There are many more orders with limited stock. 

362
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,200
 We didn't see this coming. 

363
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,600
 Speaking of which, the only publicity is for all employees to post on their Moments. 

364
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,300
 This is so cool! 

365
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,100
Why?

366
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,800
It's not like I'm endorsing any other similar products. There's no conflict.

367
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,500
I'm supporting the motherland's aerospace industry.

368
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,000
Thank you.

369
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,600
You are so insincere.

370
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,300
I thought what was insincere was lying to me about taking part in the Honor of Kings competition.

371
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,100
I didn't lie to you. I'm taking part in a competition.

372
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,800
Don't you know I'm the spokesperson of Honor of Kings?

373
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,900
I did see the event of you giving away runes when I logged into the game.

374
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,000
A few months ago, a WeChat friend of mine recorded a video of me playing games

375
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,900
and sent it to the marketing account.

376
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,800
You should know my gaming skills.

377
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,400
So one month after that,

378
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,800
I'll be going on the same stage with professional players to prove myself.

379
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,500
Thus, all of this is happening.

380
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,200
Are you playing with professional players?

381
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,600
Not only pro players.

382
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,200
There are five lucky players, so there will be six of us, including me.

383
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,800
Four professional players. Two on each side.

384
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,100
What do you think of my gaming skills if I were to join the competition?

385
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,500
There's no telling if I will win even with you on the team.

386
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,400
So you want me to teach you?

387
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,200
Can you?

388
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,900
Not the kind through the Internet.

389
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:05,540
That's too inefficient.

390
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,500
It's best if you could teach me in person.

391
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,900
You happen to be on vacation right now anyway.

392
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,300
It wouldn't get in the way of your work, right?

393
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,740
Here's the thing.

394
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,520
I've never watched a professional game.

395
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,370
I don't know much about their gaming skills.

396
00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:21,980
I don't know if I can teach you.

397
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,600
It's okay. I won't get anyone else to teach me anyway.

398
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,800
You should know that.

399
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,100
Do you trust me?

400
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,200
You're my classmate.

401
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:49,100
 Yu Tu. Teach me Math. I'll treat you to crispy chicken. 

402
00:29:57,859 --> 00:30:00,380
- Okay. 
 - Really?

403
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,624
Are you doing it willingly?

404
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,899
Enough walking then. Let's go back and play games.

405
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:07,699
Hold on.

406
00:30:07,699 --> 00:30:10,239
Your parents are there. It's not so appropriate.

407
00:30:10,239 --> 00:30:13,279
Who says that my parents are around? My parents are in our hometown.

408
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,779
The only thing at home is the Jade Rabbit Purifier.

409
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:28,780
What day is the competition next month?

410
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,639
Sunday, the second week of the next month. It's on the 10th.

411
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,440
There's not much time left.

412
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,140
Let's get started now.

413
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,379
Start what?

414
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:42,140
I've just started playing this game recently and haven't thoroughly studied it.

415
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,480
So I'm not sure how I should teach you.

416
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,030
But you can start by telling me the mistakes you've made

417
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,180
when you had a match with us the last few days.

418
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,839
 That was quick of him to enter the coaching mode. 

419
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,039
 We are going to start with the errors collection? 

420
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,599
Are there a lot?

421
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,399
Not really. More than ten.

422
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:27,940
