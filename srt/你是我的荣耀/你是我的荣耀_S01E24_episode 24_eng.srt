1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:21,490


2
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,450
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,210
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,650
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,530
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,330
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:28,990
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,050
   

14
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,920
   

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,830
   

17
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:34,719
Cut.

18
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,460
Try to show the complexity of emotions.

19
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,520
We'll run this again.

20
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:53,002
Cut.

21
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,819
We'll try this again.

22
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:00,900
Let's try again.

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,600
Cut.

24
00:03:16,232 --> 00:03:18,838
Show the emotions.

25
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,820
Make it obvious. Okay?

26
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,700
Cut. Cut. Cut.

27
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,940
Everyone, take a break.

28
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,160
Jingjing, come here.

29
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,120
I'll explain this scene again to you.

30
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:54,094
   

31
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,039
The engine we have still doesn't reach the performance requirement.

32
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,799
We need a higher specific impulse.

33
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,553
Yu Tu, see you tomorrow.

34
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,340
   

35
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,539
 Less talking, my throat still hurts. 

36
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,559
 What's wrong? 

37
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:50,879
 There was a scene earlier. 

38
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,461
 The director was not satisfied, so we had to redo it many times. 

39
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,279
 I haven't had so many NGs in a while. It was so embarrassing. 

40
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,001
 So did it pass eventually? 

41
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,040
 I did. But it was a little disheartening. 

42
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,840
 Cheer me up. 

43
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,380
 I'm glad you made it. 

44
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,540
 Are you brushing me off? 

45
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,219
 Perhaps setbacks are too common for me. 

46
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:37,291
 I've got used to it. 

47
00:05:40,377 --> 00:05:43,680
 Don't give yourself too much stress, dear Teacher Yu. 

48
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,560
 Your work is already challenging and complicated. 

49
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,900
 Science is about making progress out of countless failures. 

50
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,238
 It's the same for you. 

51
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,660
 Breakthrough is no easy undertaking for any occupation. 

52
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,613
 Let's do our best. 

53
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,240
So this is how it feels like to have a soul mate.

54
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,957
How thoughtful of me to cheer up my discouraged boyfriend.

55
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,480
 I have a question, Ms. Qiao. 

56
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,660
 Did that NG scene you mentioned involve kissing? 

57
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,140
A discouraged boyfriend? How silly of me.

58
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,959
 I'll be at Northwestern Polytechnical University for work.
   

59
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,879
 You'll be in Xi'an? The food is famous. Eat all you can, for me. 

60
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,420
   

61
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,390
   

62
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,540
Okay, let's begin.

63
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,279
Who's singing?

64
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,160
A co-worker who came along, Big Meng.

65
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,877
I can tell he's in high spirits.

66
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,140
 We learned a lot from our trip here. 

67
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,780
Did you solve the problems you had earlier?

68
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,120
It's not that easy.

69
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,521
However, the chances of realizing the goal have increased drastically.

70
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:45,918
 Congratulations. 

71
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:48,620
What about you? Did the filming go well?

72
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,319
I got compliments from the screenwriter who visited us today.

73
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,839
When are you going back to Shanghai?

74
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,079
 Tomorrow. 

75
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,199
 After that, things will get busy for a while. 

76
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,600
I get it.

77
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,439
That means you can only reply to my messages after two hours.

78
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:05,999
Who is on a business trip for two months?

79
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:07,959
All right, let's stop there.

80
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,079
Love and peace.

81
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,699
Your co-worker is so funny!

82
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:24,040
He is.

83
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,959
He saw our chat the other day.

84
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,920
I told him it was a WeChat program.

85
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,959
He believed it.

86
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,519
 Later on, he asked me how to download the program. 

87
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,555
 He wanted to try it out too. 

88
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:38,679
The EQ of male scientists is dragged down by their intellect.

89
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,120
Don't say that. I'm often lost too.

90
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,960
You made it sound like I'm stupid.

91
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,478
What were the messages that made him believe I was a WeChat program?

92
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,160
 Are you saying my messages failed to present me as a lively and gorgeous lady? 

93
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,600
 Did I sound like a bot? 

94
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,759
 Which conversation did he see? Send it to me. 

95
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,340
   

96
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,981
Goodbye. 
    

97
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200
 Jingjing. 

98
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,559
 The venue for Starlight Event is confirmed. It will be in Shanghai. 

99
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,879
 You should tell Teacher Yu this good news. 

100
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,919
AI is not available for his service today.

101
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,220
 Are you feeling okay? 

102
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,800
   

103
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,860
   

104
00:09:53,537 --> 00:09:54,757
 I got off work. 

105
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,619
 I have a basketball game with my co-workers later. 

106
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,500
 Are you not working overtime today? 

107
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:07,220
 The work is done for now. We have a debrief tomorrow. 

108
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,579
 We're having some exercise to relax a little. 

109
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:11,362
 Give it your best. 

110
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,420
 I will. 

111
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,980
 I want to see your sports outfit. Show me a selfie. 

112
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,173
 I'll try. 

113
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,360
 I don't trust my selfie skills. My co-worker took this. 

114
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,140
 Do you think this is good enough? 

115
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,084
 He asked me what this photo was for. 

116
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,090
 What did you tell him? 

117
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,329
 I'm going on a blind date. 

118
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:58,638
 They are now staring at my phone and asking for your photo. 

119
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,740
 For real? 

120
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,748
 I got rid of them. 

121
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,078
 So where is your photo? 

122
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,991
 Do you really want it? 

123
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,376
 Why aren't you saying anything? 

124
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,980
 Do you like your blind date? 

125
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,580
   

126
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,680
   

127
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,800
Hello?

128
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,057
From what I heard, one should never trust a girl's selfie.

129
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,817
So my dear blind date, when can we meet up?

130
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,990
   

131
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,159
Fellow leaders and experts, 
    

132
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,199
we've run some specific improvements for certain essential features of God Searcher.

133
00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:09,039
We've made some major breakthroughs for the materials and engine.

134
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:15,380
Up next, we will give a detailed report regarding the rover's modification plans.

135
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,279
Cut.

136
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,559
That should do it.

137
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,559
Actors, take a break.

138
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,080
- The next scene is very important. 
 - Thanks.

139
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,240
So get ready for it.

140
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,680
Ms. Qiao, a minute, please.

141
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,600
I need to discuss this with you.

142
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,360
The truth is, you have an event in Shanghai this Saturday night.

143
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,679
You applied for leave and agreed to film on Sunday night.

144
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,559
Yes.

145
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,559
But there have been some complications at the set.

146
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,720
We can't film on Friday.

147
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,600
Perhaps we could use the next two days to finish the scene.

148
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,961
Then you could go on Friday afternoon.

149
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:07,639
You won't have to rush to get on a flight on Saturday morning.

150
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,720
Sure, I have no problem with it.

151
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,679
Very well. I'll get the new notice ready.

152
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,000
- Okay, thanks. 
 - Thank you.

153
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,840
Don't mention it.

154
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,600
- Have some water. 
 - I'll pass. I need my phone.

155
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,759
 Ding. 

156
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,159
 A kind reminder from your WeChat bot. 

157
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:37,319
 Top up 68 yuan to enjoy a huge promotion pack. 

158
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,359
 Aren't you going to top up? 

159
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:46,600
 I want to try the other program. 

160
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,679
 The first game top-up is usually six yuan. 

161
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,358
 Don't you think you're a little too greedy? 

162
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,840
 But I would consider the offer 

163
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,032
 if I could check the content of the promotion pack. 

164
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,799
 A blind date event for the next three days. 

165
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,637
 You must top up to participate. 

166
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,539
 I'll be back in Shanghai for a promo event. 

167
00:15:02,539 --> 00:15:04,679
 The director gave me a day off. 

168
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,500
   
(520 is slang for I Love You) 

169
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,940
   

170
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,420
   

171
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,840
Hello?

172
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,397
When?

173
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,834
I'll pick you up.

174
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,799
 The event tomorrow starts at 6.30 p.m. 

175
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:31,439
But Sister Ling arranged a slot for a magazine interview after the makeup session.

176
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:34,080
You must start makeup in the hotel at noon.

177
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,860
I shouldn't have told her I would be back today.

178
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,559
Hold on.

179
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:44,120
Let me check if he really is my blind date.

180
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,416
I don't want to get the wrong guy.

181
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,504
And your conclusion?

182
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:53,960
The guy looks better in person.

183
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,360
It's you. Let's go.

184
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,840
Wait.

185
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,252
I need to check on you too.

186
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,220
Well? Do you trust the lady's selfie now?

187
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:13,678
You're in public.

188
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,900
Please restrain yourselves.

189
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,298
Get in the car.

190
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:20,080
I'll leave you be. I can get a taxi to run some errands.

191
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,639
Jingjing didn't ask me to leave. I really have work to see to.

192
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,919
When did I ever ask you to leave?

193
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,039
Never.

194
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,519
You just didn't let me go with you.

195
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,960
I should get going. See you.

196
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,559
Let's go.

197
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,200
- We're going to be rich! 
 - This is juicy!

198
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,080
We missed our target, but we got Qiao Jingjing!

199
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,180
Make sure you post it on April 1st. It will go trending for days!

200
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,544
Was that man her boyfriend?

201
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:55,960
They were too intimate. Of course!

202
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,720
They got rid of the assistant. They are all alone now.

203
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,679
The guy looked dashing. There was no way he could be a staff!

204
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,200
I bet he's rich too.

205
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,880
A Benz SUV.

206
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,201
These female celebrities are unbelievable.

207
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:08,480
Come on, we should follow them!

208
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Sure, let's go!

209
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,378
The traffic isn't moving at all.

210
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:34,425
It takes two hours to reach Lujiazui.

211
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:37,355
It's the peak hour.

212
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:40,380
Maybe there is an accident ahead.

213
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,799
   

214
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,089
Ms. Qiao.

215
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:05,147
I have a suggestion.

216
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:08,580
Well, the way to your home is jammed.

217
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,078
Could we go somewhere else?

218
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,098
We'll get there in twenty minutes.

219
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,158
Tianyu City?

220
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,911
That's where I live.

221
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,040
How could you?

222
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,600
Are you bringing me home on your first blind date?

223
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,515
I wouldn't be the first.

224
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,718
I used to know a beautiful girl

225
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,759
who asked me to go to her house everyday after only a few matches with me.

226
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,357
So did you go to her place?

227
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,739
If you did, you'd be a bad guy. I can't date you.

228
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,220
No.

229
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,279
Liar.

230
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:57,240
Your words can't be trusted from now on.

231
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,159
How can you prove I went to her place?

232
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,017
Do you know the girl?

233
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
I...

234
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,659
The car in front moved. Get moving.

235
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,660
Where to?

236
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:27,798
 Calculating the route. The destination is 20 km away. 

237
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,641
 It will take around twenty minutes. 

238
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:32,158
I must have pressed it accidentally.

239
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,140
Forget it, we'll go there instead.

240
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,319
The traffic is jammed, but my heart is burning.

241
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,336
I can already smell the headline.

242
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:52,499
A juicy scoop.

243
00:19:52,499 --> 00:19:54,079
Don't get your hopes up.

244
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,339
What if they go their separate ways after lunch?

245
00:19:57,339 --> 00:20:00,440
You are too naive. You've never been in love.

246
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,479
Judging by their intimate interaction, a lunch won't be enough.

247
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:06,299
They are certainly getting a hotel room.

248
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:10,079
Maybe they are going home. Qiao Jingjing's home is in Lujiazui.

249
00:20:13,597 --> 00:20:15,037
Something is amiss.

250
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,079
They got on the outer ring. Aren't they going to Lujiazui?

251
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:19,299
Forget that. Follow them.

252
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,960
National Aerospace Research Institute?

253
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,100
This is your workplace.

254
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,619
Yes.

255
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:41,160
   

256
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,359
You're driving too fast.

257
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,079
There's nothing to see here.

258
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,958
My house is next to it.

259
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,277
We'll pass by it often.

260
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:55,079
I didn't know you lived so close to the institute.

261
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,759
It's only across the street.

262
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:59,599
It was one of the commercial houses by the institute.

263
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,077
I took up a loan some years ago and bought it from a co-worker.

264
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,920
That should make a workaholic's life easier.

265
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,140
We're checking out your house right after the blind date.

266
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,500
This is a little too old-fashioned.

267
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,299
I have a more serious question for you.

268
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,820
We just finished the blind date, but I already...

269
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,720
What are they doing in the car?

270
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,400
What else could it be?

271
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,620
We can't see anything.

272
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,820
I don't think that's Qiao Jingjing's house.

273
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,478
Is it the man's house?

274
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,359
It could be.

275
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,780
The car...

276
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,039
I remember it now.

277
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,459
The car belongs to Qiao Jingjing. I've seen it before.

278
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:33,759
When they get out off the car, find out where they live.

279
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:35,979
We could get to see the inside of the house.

280
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,400
I'll take point.

281
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,800
Okay.

282
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,019
They got off the car! Now!

283
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,200
The man is quite tall.

284
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,720
He looks handsome from the side.

285
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,718
He has long legs.

286
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,480
Is he a new celebrity?

287
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,476
No celebrity would live here. It's too inconvenient.

288
00:23:08,478 --> 00:23:11,520
They could at least rent a house near Huaihai Road.

289
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,013
Brother Dou, they got off the car.

290
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,680
Okay.

291
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,934
Slippers.

292
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,739
They are cute. Did you plan this?

293
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,799
I bought it after Lunar New Year.

294
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:43,398
Was that early enough?

295
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,559
Not bad.

296
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,200
But I did it better. I bought an air purifier.

297
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,340
It's like a library in here.

298
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:00,060
Could I have a look around?

299
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,000
That question was redundant.

300
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,400
It's good manners.

301
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,559
You graduated years ago but the learning never stopped.

302
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:27,680
The field of aerospace is systematic engineering.

303
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,878
It involves different elements of science.

304
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,319
The more I learn in the main department,

305
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:35,340
the better I can communicate with the subsystem engineers.

306
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,880
I don't really get it, but it sounded very complex and incredible.

307
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,960
I get it now.

308
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,760
Have some water.

309
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,540
Is this the Yutu rover?

310
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,940
Yes.

311
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,659
It's a 1:30 model.

312
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:05,879
It's so small and detailed.

313
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:09,958
It moves!

314
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,583
You can even hold it.

315
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,000
It's adorable.

316
00:25:24,578 --> 00:25:26,021
I have more in my room.

317
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:28,200
Would you like a tour?

318
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,022
I'm a reserved person.

319
00:25:30,022 --> 00:25:33,060
I can't walk around in my blind date's house.

320
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:36,193
Where are we going?

321
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,500
Check out my room.

322
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,440
It's so tidy and clean in here.

323
00:25:49,442 --> 00:25:53,000
I thought all single men's houses are messy.

324
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,860
My girlfriend was away for months.

325
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,739
It did feel like a single life for me.

326
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,860
Sorry.

327
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,720
I mean, you live here by yourself.

328
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,661
There are so many books here too.

329
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:12,000
I feel a little embarrassed.

330
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,320
Your house is full of books but mine is full of clothing.

331
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,427
Your job requires it.

332
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:21,538
Indeed. I bought them because I need them for my work.

333
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,500
I didn't buy them to look pretty.

334
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,389
What are you looking for?

335
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:32,924
A doll.

336
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,558
Maybe it's not in this room.

337
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,033
Come with me.

338
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,822
I'm not a child anymore. I don't need a toy.

339
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,000
Zhai Liang used to live here. This is the guest bedroom.

340
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,997
Is this rocket merchandise?

341
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:00,200
Long March 5.

342
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,480
Someone gave me at the cosmodrome.

343
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,080
It looks interesting.

344
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,399
It's so cute, how could you lock it up in here?

345
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:11,300
Its master is here now.

346
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,699
Set it aside. Let's have dinner.

347
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:23,059
I had mine on the flight. I'll pass.

348
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,819
Are you cooking?

349
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:27,819
At least try it out.

350
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:47,720
Is this the breakfast from the photo you sent me?

351
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,619
- Yes. 
 - I want a bite.

352
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,920
I regret not trying your cooking in the past.

353
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,319
But now, I'm glad I didn't try it.

354
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:19,699
Why is the noodle so stiff?

355
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,559
I think it's good.

356
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:32,200
You must have a strong digestive system.

357
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,640
Enjoy. I'll play a few matches.

358
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,699
There is a new hero in Honor of Kings.

359
00:28:38,699 --> 00:28:41,219
I should help promote it.

360
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,300
   
   

361
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,994
   
   

362
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,540
   

363
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,359
Hello?

364
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:01,320
Qiao Jingjing, why do you keep turning me down?

365
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,240
I know you're not at the set.

366
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,119
 Hurry up! We need one more teammate. 

367
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,559
No, that's not fair to me.

368
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,240
My ranking drops when I play with you.

369
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,759
 Are you even my friend? 

370
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,300
 I'm only four stars away from the Ace rank. 

371
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,639
Hurry up. I'll send you an invite.

372
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,799
Was that your friend's invite? 
    

373
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,179
Yeah.

374
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,240
I had some free time lately, so I played with my WeChat account.

375
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,480
It was Chen Xue.

376
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,319
She's my good friend, and also an actor.

377
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:32,000
I keep getting her invites.

378
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,540
She always let me down.

379
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,380
Did you stop me from watching her ex-boyfriend's movie?

380
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,175
Yes, that's her!

381
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:41,419
She said she was four stars away from getting Ace rank.

382
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:45,259
She wants me in her five-stacking. I can't carry her at all.

383
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:48,219
Go online.

384
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,219
I'll play for you.

385
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:56,340
It's been a while. I want to try out the new hero.

386
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,697
Four stars...

387
00:29:58,697 --> 00:30:00,679
That should take about an hour.

388
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:02,559
Of course, you can do it.

389
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,019
You can pretend to be me and flex on her.

390
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:07,760
But don't make it too easy for her.

391
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,300
 Send me a red envelope, and I'll get you to Ace rank tonight. 

392
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,119
Come on, the game is starting.

393
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,220
What are the skills?

394
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:38,979
Are you learning it right now?

395
00:30:38,979 --> 00:30:40,900
This is normal.

396
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,260
 You have been slain. 

397
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,160
 Defeat. 

398
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:59,457
Perhaps you're not familiar with the new hero.

399
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:01,759
You'll do fine after a few matches.

400
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,660
Let me try again.

401
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,800
 Defeat. 

402
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:21,878
It is almost impossible to carry her.

403
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,360
Try carrying them with another hero.

404
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,960
Don't worry. I got the hang of it.

405
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,980
 Defeat. 

406
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,599
 Qiao Jingjing, use the voice chat. 

407
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:41,519
 Stop feeding the enemy with the new hero. 

408
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,680
 I didn't pay 200 yuan just to lose three stars. 

409
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,939
It's... It's because the hero is too weak to keep up with your skills.

410
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:51,438
We could try a different hero.

411
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,340
I took 200 yuan from Chen Xue.

412
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:57,207
Okay.

413
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:00,279
What's wrong with me?

414
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,140
 Victory. 

415
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,340
She finally got the rank.

416
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,480
It's time to run away.

417
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,380
This is not worth the 200 yuan.

418
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,881
It's already so late. I must leave now.

419
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:39,961
Sister Ling arranged an interview for tomorrow afternoon.

420
00:32:39,961 --> 00:32:42,179
I must rest well tonight.

421
00:32:43,226 --> 00:32:45,066
It's almost midnight.

422
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,659
It takes roughly an hour to reach your home.

423
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:53,720
That means you'll be home at 1 a.m.

424
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,499
You have events and interviews tomorrow.

425
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,800
Jingjing.

426
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,580
Why don't you stay here for the night?

427
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,449
Stay here?

428
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:06,720
I'll use the guest bedroom.

429
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,438
I used to live at your place for convenience too.

430
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,335
This is the best solution.

431
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,621
Yes, the best solution.

432
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:18,140
It's Chen Xue's fault.

433
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,759
I thought it would take only an hour to carry her.

434
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:24,979
I'll clean up the room for you.

435
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,156
Wait.

436
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,880
What's wrong?

437
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,858
 I'll play for you. 

438
00:33:40,858 --> 00:33:43,959
 It's been a while. I want to try out the new hero. 

439
00:33:44,518 --> 00:33:46,358
 Four stars... 

440
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,160
 That should take about an hour. 

441
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,640
Did I just fall for your scheme?

442
00:33:52,499 --> 00:33:54,540
You lost the first three rounds on purpose.

443
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,219
You were buying time.

444
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:58,600
Every match took over twenty minutes.

445
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,418
Not to mention you were stalling during the last three matches you won.

446
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:07,200
It took you over three hours to carry my friend to Ace rank.

447
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,519
But it took you far less time to carry me through ranked matches.

448
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:13,779
You... Are you an actor?

449
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,517
Don't be paranoid.

450
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:18,440
I wasn't familiar with the new hero.

451
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,079
Besides, I was a little rusty for not playing in a long time.

452
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,579
Is this true?

453
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:24,379
It is.

454
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,413
Solo queue with the new hero. Win a match with it.

455
00:34:29,413 --> 00:34:32,740
Get at least 15 kills, then I won't go home.

456
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,300
That's a little too challenging.

457
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,099
I only had three matches with it.

458
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,760
And I lost all three matches.

459
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,139
It's only Diamond rank.

460
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,220
Fine. Forget it.

461
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,739
Send me home. I don't mind staying up.

462
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,139
I'll give it a try.

463
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,180
   

464
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,080
The fourth time is the charm.

465
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,760
Send me home.

466
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,419
Don't go back on your words.

467
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,959
I'm not.

468
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:46,197
I said I wouldn't go home, I never said I would stay here.

469
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,880
I'm staying in a hotel.

470
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,740
The event organizers always book a room for me.

471
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,343
Well? Teacher Yu?

472
00:35:54,343 --> 00:35:57,252
You're not the only sneaky one around.

473
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,407
I miscalculated.

474
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,419
All right, I need to go.

475
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,867
I have a few days off.

476
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:08,341
I could go to the event with you.

477
00:36:08,341 --> 00:36:11,239
Don't you have work tomorrow? I thought you worked overtime on weekends.

478
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:14,039
So I had been very busy for the past few days.

479
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,459
I barely had any rest.

480
00:36:15,459 --> 00:36:18,039
Driving you home takes at least an hour.

481
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:21,000
By the time I'm home, it will already be 2 a.m.

482
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,600
Then in the morning, I have to go to your place.

483
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,400
You said you need to get ready because I couldn't be trusted.

484
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,379
It seems like I should get ready as well.

485
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,380
Are you hungry? We could grab some food.

486
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,680
I'm not eating your noodles.

487
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:08,180


488
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:15,180
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

489
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:22,400
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

490
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,560
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

491
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:37,240
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

492
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,620
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

493
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,840
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

494
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:51,100
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

495
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:58,160
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

496
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:05,400
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

497
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:14,100
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

498
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:48,360
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

499
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:55,500
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

500
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:02,580
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

501
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:10,260
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

502
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,940
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

503
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,940
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

504
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:24,100
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

505
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:31,200
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

506
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:38,600
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

507
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:46,540
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
