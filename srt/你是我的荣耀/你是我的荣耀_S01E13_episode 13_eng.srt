1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000


2
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,250
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,110
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,650
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,530
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,230
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:27,750
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,280
   

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,380
   

15
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,540
Hi, everyone. Welcome to today's special live stream.

16
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,579
So, what's so special about today? Behold!

17
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:56,190
Hi everyone, I'm A'Tai. 
    

18
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,840
Tai God, welcome to our live stream today!

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,000
Remember to spam "Awesome Tai God" on the screen for five minutes!

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,400
Don't. This is too flattering.

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,420
- So our special mission today is... 
 - We are here for the Honor of Kings Award Ceremony.

22
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,539
- Indeed. Honor of Kings Award Ceremony. Come join us. 
 - Yes.

23
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,900
There is a huge turnout today and our cosplayers have started their performance. They are so pretty!

24
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:19,199
The highlight of today's ceremony is none other than the casual match where our spokesperson,

25
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,559
 Qiao Jingjing, will make an appearance. 
   

26
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,420
 Speaking of which, we've all heard the news 
   
   

27
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,140
 that as the spokesperson of Honor of Kings, 
   
   

28
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,219
- footage of her horrendous gameplay was leaked. 
 - This definitely raised some questions.

29
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:31,599
Whether it's the truth or not, we shall see real soon.

30
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,440
Remember to give a like for Jingjing as she is brave enough to come on stage to show her player skill.

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,820
However, I wonder if the fans of Jingjing can remain happy after the match.

32
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,020
 Jingjing, you're the best! 
   

33
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,499
The match hasn't even begun, and you're already ranked 12 on the trending topics. 
    

34
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,299
I'm getting anxious.

35
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,460
Ditch that sweater. It's too long.

36
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,920
Look. It covers this part.

37
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,700
This pair of jeans is no good too.

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,399
This is good.

39
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:06,339
You look cheerful and cute.

40
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:09,559
A pair of white shoes will go even better with it.

41
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,139
No.

42
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:14,699
Stick to heels. Heels make your legs look longer.

43
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:15,939
Stop.

44
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:19,379
Letting it loose like this looks good. It looks wavy. It's better.

45
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,320
But if I don't tie my hair up, it will block my view later.

46
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,919
You're right. Tie it up then.

47
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,639
However... This spot here.

48
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,199
The spot between your hair and your forehead. Make sure it has volume.

49
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,499
Volume, okay? Cute.

50
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,840
This outfit is great.

51
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,800
You know, we can lose the match, but we can't lose in the face and legs department.

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,840
Don't jinx it, please.

53
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,719
Yes, yes. You'll win. I just want to help you to relax.

54
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,460
That said, I have a question.

55
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,740
I remember you were King 30 stars.

56
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,619
But when I logged in this morning, your rank has dropped a lot.

57
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,719
Bad games lately?

58
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,019
Just drop it. Teacher Yu spends half of his time forcing me to play alone,

59
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:12,979
and another half forcing me to get the Penta Kill.

60
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:15,940
Is he this strict?

61
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,339
My birthday is at the end of this month. What's the hurry?

62
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,720
Don't let the nerves get to you. Just do your best.

63
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,700
I have already talked to the marketing accounts that are close to us.

64
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,820
Even if you lose the match, we can still embellish it.

65
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,300
No one knows the outcome when it comes to e-sports.

66
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,800
If you win, don't show off.

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,750
If you lose, don't say something like "it's an honorable match". It's too over the top.

68
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:39,339
You're right. I almost made this mistake.

69
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:41,219
I have to call the PR.

70
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:43,419
Tweak this part, please.

71
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,200
Rabbit buff!

72
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,700
 The award ceremony will start at 6 p.m. You still have one hour. 

73
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,050
We have prepared a private green room specifically for Ms. Jingjing. You can rest there.

74
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,810
No need for special treatment.

75
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,939
If possible, we can share the same green room with other players.

76
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,660
It's possible, but they are in a communal green room.

77
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,900
- Are you sure it's okay? 
 - Of course.

78
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,560
That'd be great. You can get to know everyone, too.

79
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,439
- Come on, let me show you the way. 
 - Okay.

80
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:23,000
Sweet talk with the players later. Perhaps they will go easy on you.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,739
So that's what you have in mind.

82
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:29,160
Unfortunately, begging for mercy does not exist in our e-sports athletes' dictionary.

83
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,360
"Our e-sports athletes"? She's in the mood already.

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,019
As you can see, I have brought our spokesperson here.

85
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,820
Seize this opportunity to ask for photos or autographs.

86
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,099
- Have a seat. 
 - Sure, no need to stand up like this.

87
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:57,160
- Have a seat. 
 - Thank you.

88
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,479
Have a seat too, Mr. Zhao.

89
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,399
This place sure is crowded.

90
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:05,010
Ms. Qiao, can you please sign these photos?

91
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,799
It's for the lucky draw in the event later.

92
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,939
- I've talked to Ms. Qiu regarding this. 
 - Come, let me have a look.

93
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,419
By the way, speak up if anyone wants one.

94
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:13,759
- Count me in! 
 - Count me in!

95
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,260
No problem with the autograph. However, I'm also a fan of several professional players.

96
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,060
I want their autographs too.

97
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,480
Ms. Qiao, can I get an autograph?

98
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,980
Sure.

99
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,639
Do you know my ID?

100
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,879
Of course. I watched your match and live streams too.

101
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,120
You watched live streams too?

102
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,260
I'm the spokesperson. Also, I have a match today.

103
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,360
I need to know what heroes they play. That's called "know thy enemies."

104
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,580
Now that we're here, should we take a group photo?

105
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,739
- Sure. 
 - Great!

106
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,979
- Please arrange for it, Xiao Sun. 
 - Gather round here.

107
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,200
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

108
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,840
Look here, please.

109
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,220
One. Two. Three.

110
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,820
Makeup's done, I believe? Prepare for the show entrance. Gather outside.

111
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,399
- Let's go. Come. 
 - All the best!

112
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,720
- Good luck! 
 - Break a leg.

113
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,199
- Good luck. 
 - Good luck, everyone.

114
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,080
Goddess, pick me later, please. I'm Zhou Yin, from Heavenly Palace.

115
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,600
- You're shameless. Let's go. 
 - Thank you.

116
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,360
- Pick me! 
 - Good luck. Bye.

117
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,439
It's so nice to be young.

118
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,760
   

119
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,139
Good evening, summoners.

120
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,080
Welcome to the annual Honor of Kings Award Ceremony. 
    

121
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,760
I'm the emcee, Ying Kai.

122
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,020
The Fall Split ended last week.

123
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,270
Team Luo Shen was the champion, and they took the Silver Dragon Trophy with them.

124
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,470
However, honor does not belong solely to the champion,

125
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:43,480
but also to those who labored for their e-sports dream.

126
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,500
In this year's ceremony, we have created 12 awards

127
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,690
to reward players who have performed exceptionally well this year.

128
00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:55,080
First, let's welcome LGD Gaming. Welcome!

129
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,620
   

130
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:04,900
   

131
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,079
Hundred battles for the glory.

132
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:13,219
Welcome Tigress, Decoy, Dawn, Dream, River Town, and Wuxian!

133
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,539
- For more than one month, Jingjing didn't do anything else. 
  - Have you arrived? 

134
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,200
- No shooting, no joining other social events. 
  - Yes, I have. 

135
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,700
She dedicated herself to the training for this casual match.

136
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,360
Great. You have toiled hard, Ms. Jingjing.

137
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,939
We can't wait to see your performance.

138
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:32,339
Good luck.

139
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,600
Excuse me, Ms. Qiu. I just got a message.

140
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,000
A friend of Mr. Gu is here to watch the match. I have to take care of him.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,519
How about this? I'll let Li Li bring you to the VIP room later to watch the match.

142
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:42,380
- Sure. No problem. Go ahead. 
 - All right.

143
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,720
- All right. 
 - See you later, Jingjing.

144
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,420
See you!

145
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,400
Now, let's welcome QG Happy! 
    

146
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,280
Fight till the end fearlessly.

147
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,600
Fight till the end fearlessly.

148
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,070
Welcome, Fly, Demon Blade, Fish, Hurt, and Promise.

149
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,600
   
   

150
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,479
Ms. Qiao, the professional teams have made their entrance. They are on the audience seat now.

151
00:09:12,479 --> 00:09:14,159
- We can leave now. 
 - Okay.

152
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,520
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

153
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,720
Good luck.

154
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,400
- All the best. 
 - Come. This way.

155
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,580
The five lucky winners are on this stage, ready for the match.

156
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,380
Now, show me your most passionate applause and welcome our spokesperson, Qiao Jingjing!

157
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,940
   

158
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,700
 Jingjing! 

159
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,679
Welcome, Jingjing.

160
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,479
Hi, Ying Kai.

161
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:48,359
Hi, everyone, I'm the spokesperson of Honor of Kings, Qiao Jingjing.

162
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:53,079
   
   

163
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,419
 Jingjing! 

164
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,080
Wow, fans of our spokesperson are very excited today.

165
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,080
So, Ms. Jingjing, is this your first time here?

166
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,480
- Yes, it is. 
 - Are you nervous about the match then?

167
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,480
I'm never nervous.

168
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,000
My teammates might be more nervous than me.

169
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,039
- Jingjing is never fazed by a huge crowd. 
 - Of course!

170
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,460
I can tell they are getting nervous now.

171
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,320
In fact, we still don't know who your teammates will be.

172
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,360
It's okay. Allow me to explain the rules.

173
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,240
Your teammates will be decided via a lucky draw.

174
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,899
But before that, please introduce yourself first.

175
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,080
Any volunteers?

176
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,939
All right.

177
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:42,740
Hi everyone. I'm Nine Tomatoes. 
    

178
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:44,559
I'm Battle Bear. 
    

179
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,340
I'm Discerning Eyes. I'm a programmer. 
     

180
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,200
I'm a lawyer and an Ace player. Thank you. 
    

181
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,880
Hello, everyone. I believe a lot of you here know who I am already.

182
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,780
Let me introduce myself again. Hi, I'm Wine Among Flowers. 
    

183
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,320
I'm a King 21 stars player in Honor of Kings.

184
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,739
I'm currently a streamer.

185
00:11:09,739 --> 00:11:12,800
I'd like to clarify that this is not rigged.

186
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,840
I won the lucky draw for real. Thank you.

187
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,359
I can vouch for that. He really won the lucky draw.

188
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:22,800
- Yes. 
 - He's really lucky.

189
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,840
- Do I have to introduce myself, too? 
 - Yes!

190
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,840
Hi, everyone. My ID is...

191
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,880
I have several IDs. Do I have to reveal all?

192
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,220
Also, I didn't set them to private yet.

193
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,039
It's fine!

194
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,399
All right then. Hi, I'm Qiao Jingjing. I'm the spokesperson of Honor of Kings. 
    

195
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,479
I'm a King 15 stars player.

196
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,700
15 stars? That's quite high.

197
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,480
Well, which hero do you usually play? And which position?

198
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,919
I heard that whatever I say on this stage will be banned.

199
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,020
So don't ask. Just know that my pool is deep.

200
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,899
I can't fish info from her. Our spokesperson sure is savvy.

201
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:07,280
Now that the introduction is done.

202
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,270
Let's move on to how we will divide up the teams.

203
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,180
Well, Jingjing and our Mr. Streamer

204
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,780
are both King players, so they can't be on the same team.

205
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,519
Now, staff, please.

206
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,080
Battle Bear.

207
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,980
Congratulations, Bear.

208
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,480
- Lucky Charm Tongtong. 
 - That's me!

209
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,679
Nine Tomatoes.

210
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:38,479
- Congratulations. 
 - Thank you.

211
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:41,900
Jingjing, I'm a huge fan of yours. I signed up for you.

212
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,279
Thanks.

213
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,000
Now, let's give your team a name.

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,240
What's your choice?

215
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,000
We're here to win, so we're called Star-reaching Team.

216
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:56,320
Star-reaching Team. I love the confidence.

217
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,779
And you, Ms. Jingjing?

218
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:02,480
We've discussed, and we believe that gaming not only requires talent but also luck.

219
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,620
So we're called Good Luck Team.

220
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,699
All right.

221
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:11,379
Good Luck Team?

222
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:15,500
This is an interesting name. It's also a highly requested song in this stadium.

223
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,860
I can hear it in my brain now.

224
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,160
♫  Good Luck, we wish you good luck  ♫

225
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,320
And now, the highly anticipated teammates choosing session.

226
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,400
Both teams are free to choose any two players from the audience as their teammates.

227
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,800
Let's see who the audience members are.

228
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,040
Please look at the big screen.

229
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,900
These audience members sure look familiar.

230
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,180
E-sports athletes are here too.

231
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,559
Now, you have three minutes to discuss who you will pick.

232
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,060
- It starts now. 
 - Okay.

233
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,900
Don't be so tense. I'm not that bad a player.

234
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,259
You decide then. I don't think the rumor is true. You're a good player.

235
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,160
I think...

236
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,859
Time's up.

237
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:12,139
Jingjing, your first choice is...

238
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:15,279
Our first teammate is...

239
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,279
 First choice. Zhou Yin from Heavenly Palace. 

240
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,119
Zhou Yin from Heavenly Palace!

241
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,480
Zhou Yin, Heavenly Palace. Welcome.

242
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,180
   

243
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,299
Welcome, Zhou Yin. 
    

244
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:31,859
 Zhou Yin! 

245
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,130
Welcome, Zhou Yin. Zhou Yin is definitely a star player in the World Champion Cup.

246
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,730
He's quite good-looking too!

247
00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:41,720
Jingjing, did you pick him because he's handsome?

248
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,139
Of course not!

249
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:49,179
It's because backstage, Zhou Yin said I must pick him to be on my team.

250
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,720
Really? I bet the athletes down there must be regretting now.

251
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,440
Yes!

252
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,059
As expected from Zhou Yin, the social butterfly in the World Champion Cup.

253
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:01,600
It's a joke, of course.

254
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,720
I picked Zhou Yin because he's a well-rounded player.

255
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,940
He can play every position, and he has a deep hero pool.

256
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,420
So I think picking him will not go wrong.

257
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,600
Jingjing sounds like a pro.

258
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,000
She knows about our athletes' favorite position and their hero pool.

259
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,700
Of course. Before I came here, I made a list of the top three players in every position.

260
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,520
Tell us more then.

261
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,600
I can't. I wouldn't want to get on their bad side.

262
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,750
I can't fish info from her again.

263
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,570
Now, time for the red side to select two pro players.

264
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:38,180
Okay. Our choice is Pig Rider from WGM and Heliu from Luo Shen.

265
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,807
   
   

266
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:45,279
Okay, welcome Pig Rider and Heliu.

267
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,700
Welcome. Wine Among Flowers really knows who to pick.

268
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,480
He picked the top Mid and Jungler on this split's MVP list.

269
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,550
The blue side can feel the pressure now.

270
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,790
Who will be your pick?

271
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:01,600
Our pick is Snow from Heavenly Palace.

272
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,899
Okay. Snow, Heavenly Palace. 
    

273
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,039
Snow!

274
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,120
Welcome.

275
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,840
I have a question for you, Jingjing.

276
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,820
You picked two players from Heavenly Palace.

277
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,360
Are you their fan?

278
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,379
Of course, I am,

279
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,879
but there's a strategy involved too.

280
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:24,600
Honor of Kings is a game about teamwork.

281
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,800
The synergy between each teammate is very important.

282
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,700
That's why I picked two pro players from the same team

283
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,240
because I believe their synergy can amplify our performance.

284
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,119
Wonderful.

285
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:39,600
It seems like you're well-prepared.

286
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,820
 That one is from me, not from Yu Tu. 

287
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,940
She's quite smart.

288
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,000
And now, both teams have completed their roster.

289
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,820
Please proceed to the gaming booth and prepare for the match.

290
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,020
Now, I'll let the casters take over.

291
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,179
Welcome summoners, whether you're watching this online or are at the scene. 
    

292
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:00,480
Welcome to Honor of Kings World Champion Cup Award Ceremony. 
    

293
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
- I'm Li Jiu. 
 - Hi, I'm Tian Yun.

294
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,660
Hi, I'm Gemini.

295
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,160
We're honored to invite four pro players to play in today's casual match.

296
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,139
- VIP guests, indeed. 
 - They are Zhou Yin, Snow, Pig Rider, and Heliu. 
    
   

297
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:15,000
Of course, the highlight of the day is none other than our spokesperson.

298
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,359
The pressure is mounting. Actually, I have done my homework too.

299
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:23,859
I've seen from Ms. Qiao Jingjing's Weibo that she really worked hard for today.

300
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:26,780
After the official account announced the lucky draw winners,

301
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,499
I checked out that streamer's videos.

302
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:33,620
He's quite skilled but he has a shallow hero pool.

303
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,779
In 5v5, he usually uses Meng Ya, Marco Polo, and Gongsun Li.

304
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:42,965
He obviously picked Pig Rider and Heliu because he wants to play marksman. 
    
   

305
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:46,459
My suggestion is to ban the marksmen he's good at,

306
00:17:46,459 --> 00:17:49,440
and first-pick a strong marksman to counter him.

307
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,939
That way, we'll have one less King player to face.

308
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,679
Great.

309
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:57,319
What did Qiao Jingjing say? My idol praised her just now.

310
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,599
I already think that she's smart when she was picking her teammates.

311
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,419
If she wins this time, I'll become her fan.

312
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:08,039
So, can Qiao Jingjing perform well in today's match?

313
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:11,880
- Good luck! 
 - Will others counter her and ban her hero?

314
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,380
- Good luck! 
 - We shall see. 
 - All the best!

315
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,839
Yes, it is indeed intriguing.

316
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:20,599
Targeting the normal players is a good strategy since most pro players have a deep hero pool.

317
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,200
It'll be hard to counter them.

318
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,699
When it comes to a casual match,

319
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:28,459
our guests will usually become the target or receive some special treatment.

320
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:30,799
- That's how a guest will be treated. 
 - Indeed.

321
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,000
I can't wait to see if Jingjing 
    

322
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,680
will become the target in today's match. 
    

323
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,359
All right. Now, it is the Pick and Ban phase of the first round.

324
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,699
- Yes. 
 - Let's see which hero they will pick.

325
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,860
   

326
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,359
   

327
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,519
- A target ban. 
 - How so?

328
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,680
- Wang Zhaojun was banned. 
 - Indeed.

329
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,739
But what for? It's unnecessary.

330
00:18:56,939 --> 00:19:00,480
The blue side banned Meng Ya and Marco Polo.

331
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,959
- Yes, target bans against Wine Among Flowers. 
 - Wine Among Flowers.

332
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:05,839
- Indeed. 
 - Cai Wenji, Wang Zhaojun.

333
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:06,880
That specific?

334
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,160
They didn't target ban the two pro players, but rather the spokesperson.

335
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,680
They are focusing on my hero pool.

336
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,419
Oh, Jingjing did post the match result of these two heroes on her Weibo.

337
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:17,880
They overcomplicated it.

338
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,010
Jingjing was trained under the strict Teacher Yu.

339
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,960
She has a deep hero pool!

340
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,839
Seems like they have a similar strategy too.

341
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:27,739
Just target someone and ban his or her strongest heroes.

342
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:29,179
However, they miscalculated.

343
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:31,259
I casually posted the match result of these two heroes.

344
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:34,519
They are not my strongest hero.

345
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:38,140
But I only know how to use Cai Wenji as Support.

346
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,820
Use Bian Que and go mid. I'll be the Support.

347
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,739
Let's play it safe. Pick Bian Que.

348
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:43,179
Let them pick Gongsun Li.

349
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:46,060
I can play any marksmen. I can win any lane.

350
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,200
Stay humble, please.

351
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,319
Their first-pick is Bian Que.

352
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,920
Based on Qiao Jingjing's hero pool, 
    

353
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,780
it seems like she'll play support this round.

354
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,440
Indeed. Lock in Gongsun Li then. 
    

355
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,060
If Wine Among Flowers doesn't pick Gongsun Li, then he has no one else to use.

356
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,720
Zhang Fei is a great pick to engage and to peel.

357
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,839
Now on the other side, the marksman.

358
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:05,299
His signature hero, Sun Shangxiang.

359
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:06,839
Heliu's pick will be pivotal then.

360
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,759
Indeed, Heliu and Pig Rider haven't picked their heroes yet.

361
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,519
- Yes. 
 - Li Bai is picked.

362
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,279
He'll pick his hero later. Li Bai has priority.

363
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,559
- Jungle King indeed. 
 - Yes.

364
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,020
In terms of aggression, Donghuang Taiyi is not bad.

365
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,000
Let's see the last Mid pick. 
    

366
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,160
- Pig Rider. 
 - Pig Rider.

367
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,600
- For Mid, the Queen of Mage. 
 - Diao Chan.

368
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,979
The team swapped their picks and locked in their heroes. Jingjing picked Donghuang Taiyi.

369
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,240
- Jingjing has to make the choice then. 
 - She can ult anyone.

370
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,620
No one in the team can peel for Sun Shangxiang.

371
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,720
Donghuang Taiyi is the only team fight initiator.

372
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,940
You have to ult the right person.

373
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,160
If you ult the wrong person, you'll lose the fight.

374
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,979
In this case, Jingjing will either make or break the team fight.

375
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:44,879
Indeed.

376
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:46,440
All right. Welcome to the casual match. In the first round,

377
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,680
the blue side is Good Luck Team and the red side is Star-reaching Team.

378
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,840
Jingjing picked Donghuang Taiyi to showcase her skill.

379
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,599
 Welcome to Honor of Kings. 
   

380
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:01,440
 Enemy minions will arrive in five seconds. 

381
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,459
 Please be ready. 

382
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,919
 Prepare to engage! 

383
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,240
   

384
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,720
   

385
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,300
I will harass their jungler.

386
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,080
All right. Be careful. I'll come once I'm done with the red buff. 
    

387
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,500
- Bian Que, help us once you clear the minions. 
 -  Okay.

388
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,200
Jingjing learned Skill 1. Our spokesperson is halfway through to victory.

389
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,699
Yes. A level 1 Donghuang Taiyi is very strong.

390
00:21:24,699 --> 00:21:28,480
Once he has three stacks, he can invade the enemy jungle and disrupt the jungler's tempo.

391
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,360
Yes, we can see that she has all three stacks now

392
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,279
and is heading towards the enemy blue buff.

393
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,699
Good map awareness.

394
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:36,319
- Donghuang is here. 
 - Hold on.

395
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,319
Li Bai is having a rough time.

396
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:39,340
   
   

397
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,119
Yes, a level 1 Li Bai can only retreat when he sees Donghuang.

398
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:45,419
Blue buff has lost aggro. Jingjing is chasing after Li Bai. So aggressive.

399
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:46,340
Slow down. 
    

400
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,799
- He can't do anything about Donghuang. 
 - Right, and now, Xuance...

401
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,880
Back down a bit.

402
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,200
- It's fine. Give it to them. 
 - Really?

403
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,599
Can they fight back around the blue buff camp?

404
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:53,680
Both teams are...

405
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,599
I got the blue buff. Retreat.

406
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,680
- Not bad, Donghuang. 
 - Of course.

407
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,820
They covered for Jingjing's retreat, too. What a huge lead.

408
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,119
Excellent map awareness from Jingjing this time.

409
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,720
She invaded the enemy jungle and helped her own jungler.

410
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,419
Three jungle buffs from the beginning. Good Luck Team has a huge lead now.

411
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:11,919
Come. This way.

412
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,140
Good Luck Team is having a great game.

413
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,480
The match has started.

414
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,079
- Sorry for making you miss the match. 
 - Don't be!

415
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,200
You're Mr. Gu's friend. You're my priority.

416
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,499
This match just passed the 10-minute mark.

417
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:26,319
- It's a pivotal moment. 
 - A team fight is about to break out.

418
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:28,319
Whoever wins the next team fight can grab the Dark Tyrant

419
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,480
- and might even win the game... 
 - Yes.

420
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,480
Look at their position. The red side can only retreat and play in their jungle.

421
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,040
They want to take down the inner turret but Jingjing has her flash and her ult.

422
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,680
It all depends on Jingjing's Donghuang now.

423
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,440
If she can use her ult properly, then she can easily win this round.

424
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,600
Everyone is gathering near red team's inner turret. They are ready.

425
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,359
Let's see.

426
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,400
   

427
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,359
Donghuang Taiyi flashed and locked down Diao Chan!

428
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:54,480
Her teammates followed up. Sun Shangxiang got the first kill.

429
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,680
Hua Mulan is down too. Snow is still pumping out damage

430
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,860
and Li Bai is almost dead.

431
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,680
- Zhang Fei won't be able to outrun this. 
 - Beautiful! 
    

432
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,440
Double, Triple,

433
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,380
Quadra Kill!

434
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,119
 Ace. 

435
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,900
Ace! Oh my god.

436
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,480
What a show-stopping ult from Donghuang.

437
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,500
Diao Chan was hit and died like that. So worth it.

438
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,260
Donghuang Taiyi is Qiao Jingjing's hero?

439
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:23,060
Yes, our spokesperson. Her Donghuang is not bad.

440
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:27,039
I'm surprised.

441
00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:32,020
- Check the minions. 
 - Prepare for an ambush.

442
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,440
 - They are hiding in one bush. 
 - They are up for something. 

443
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,319
Come on.

444
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,899
Wait. Five seconds left on my flash.

445
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:39,780
Seems like Good Luck Team wants to end this.

446
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,359
They are hiding in the mid bush and are waiting for a fight.

447
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,400
Use this minion push. Use Wolf Emblem, Donghuang.

448
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,759
Ult whoever.

449
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,159
Got it.

450
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:50,200
Jingjing charged in with her Wolf Emblem.

451
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,700
She's going to ult someone.

452
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,559
- She charged in. 
 - It landed!

453
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,819
She flash-ulted Gongsun Li.

454
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:56,599
I got him, I got him.

455
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:00,260
 You want a big shot? There you go. 

456
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,039
One bullet, one kill. They pushed in further.

457
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,079
Li Bai flanked from the side and is targeting Sun Shangxiang.

458
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,400
- No damage whatsoever. 
 - Only Li Bai left this time.

459
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,520
The damage was shared.

460
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,250
Sun Shangxiang got one-shot.

461
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:20,839
Impressive. Come on! Attack the tower.

462
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,160
They aced the enemy. What a beautiful teamwork.

463
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,240
The engage from Donghuang Taiyi and Sun Shuangxiang who never missed her attack.

464
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,160
Bottom minions have reached the highland and the turret is down just like that.

465
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,559
They are on the nexus now.

466
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,640
From the engage to the teamwork, everything was impeccable.

467
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,400
Now that the nexus is down, let's congratulate Good Luck Team!

468
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
 Victory! 

469
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:44,259
Jingjing!

470
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,919
 Jingjing! 

471
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,640
 Jingjing! 

472
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,540
 Jingjing! 

473
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,160
- Good job. 
 - Not bad.

474
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,160
 Jingjing! 
   

475
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,799
- Jingjing tanked a lot of damage. 
 - She did well.

476
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,640
Snow's Sun Shangxiang is the MVP.

477
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,559
- Jingjing won! 
 - Jingjing was so good.

478
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,680
Finally, we don't have to argue with those haters.

479
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,759
So many people on the live stream said that Jingjing was being carried,

480
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,459
that she's a support, and she couldn't win on her own.

481
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:23,580
Let them be.

482
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,499
Donghuang was being carried this round? They need to check their eyes.

483
00:25:27,499 --> 00:25:28,499
Just look at how much damage she has soaked.

484
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:30,140
Also, even if she was carried,

485
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,440
it just means that she is strategic and tactical enough to pick the right players.

486
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,340
Exactly!

487
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,879
Once again, congratulations to Good Luck Team for grabbing the first win.

488
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:46,860
Don't be discouraged, Star-reaching Team. This is a casual match.

489
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,680
Having fun is the priority.

490
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,540
And now, there will be small changes to our second round.

491
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,240
Staff, come up here, please.

492
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:02,440
There are a lot of paper notes in this box.

493
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,860
Each note contains a special permission.

494
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,599
Both teams can draw once

495
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:09,500
and are allowed to exercise whatever is granted to them.

496
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,019
The winning team first.

497
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:22,559
What Good Luck Team obtained is... "You can ban one more hero next round."

498
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,480
Jingjing is quite lucky today.

499
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,819
Now, your turn.

500
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,599
What Star-reaching Team obtained is...

501
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,659
This is interesting.

502
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:38,060
"Star-reaching Team can ban the MVP from the previous round."

503
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,259
4v5 then?

504
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:44,900
It means you have to swap the previous MVP out.

505
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,380
So I have to return to my seat?

506
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,640
A round of applause for Snow!

507
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Thank you for your excellent performance just now.

508
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,599
- Thank you. Bye. 
 - Good luck then.

509
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:07,359
Well, that's what you get for being the MVP.

510
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,659
In this case, Good Luck Team will have to select another teammate.

511
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:12,840
Who will you pick, Jingjing? Someone from Heavenly Palace again?

512
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,699
But Snow is the best marksman player on Heavenly Palace.

513
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,500
I remember the official account once said that

514
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,200
we could pick a random person from the audience as our teammate.

515
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
Can I pick a casual player then?

516
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,219
- Well... 
  - No problem. Say yes. 

517
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,319
They did mention it, yes. But are you sure?

518
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,000
I don't know who you'll pick,

519
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,259
but are you sure he or she can outperform a pro player?

520
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:37,640
I know who I'll pick,

521
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,240
but I don't know if he can outperform a pro player.

522
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,819
I want to pick him because he has been a great teammate to me.

523
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:46,060
I want to fight alongside him this time, too.

524
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,960
So your choice is...?

525
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,440
Can I consult my teammates first?

526
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,459
Sure.

527
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:52,060
- Can I? 
 - I'm fine with that.

528
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,240
I'll support you no matter what.

529
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,359
My choice is

530
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,160
- Yu Tu. 
 - Yu Tu?

531
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,479
- Do you know who he is? 
 - Yu Tu.

532
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,779
- Who is he? 
 - Yu Tu?

533
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:22,559
- Who is Yu Tu? 
 - You know him?

534
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,200
He's so handsome!

535
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,200
Is he a celebrity too?

536
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,160
Hold on, cameraman.

537
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,799
How do you know it's him? Are you this superficial too?

538
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:57,160
So, handsome fellow, are you Yu Tu?

539
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,659
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

540
