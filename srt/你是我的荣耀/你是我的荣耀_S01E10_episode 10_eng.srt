1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:16,980


2
00:00:21,419 --> 00:00:25,179
♫  You crossed the sea of stars, bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:29,239
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:36,879
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:40,679
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:44,679
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,679 --> 00:00:48,479
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,919
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,919 --> 00:01:00,559
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:08,359
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:15,919
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:28,979
♫  I’ve fallen for you, but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:40,150
   

14
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,039
   

15
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:14,879
Verify this data again.

16
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,779
Then record it.

17
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:28,518
Mr. Yu, you should eat first.

18
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:32,498
The cafeteria will close at one. You should still eat something.

19
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:48,519
   

20
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:53,258
 I was saying she looked familiar. 

21
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:59,059
 I saw her ad today and remembered that your classmate that day was Qiao Jingjing. 

22
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:03,519
   

23
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,299
 Sorry, Mrs. Zhang. I just got your message. 

24
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:14,099
 That's her. 

25
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:21,659
   

26
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:32,158
Why didn't you invite me for lunch?

27
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:34,919
I saw you fell asleep at your desk, so I didn't wake you.

28
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,558
- I brought you some food. 
 - Let's eat outside and get some fresh air.

29
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,479
I'm getting older, I'm not like I used to be.

30
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,359
I don't know what's come over me. I'm dozing off a lot lately.

31
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:50,398
Why didn't you order noodles? Are you not eating noodles here in Xi'an?

32
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:53,158
There are chili oil noodles, saozi noodles.It's so delicious. 
  (T/N: saozi noodles - sour noodle soup with minced pork and vegetables).  

33
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:56,938
I didn't know when you were going to eat them. Noodles stick together easily.

34
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:58,538
You're particular.

35
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,698
By the way, I received a message right when I came out.

36
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:07,319
The European Space Agency's Tycho Brahe was also affected by the solar wind.

37
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,958
Their situation is worse than ours.

38
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,119
They already announced that they gave up saving it.

39
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,879
The Brahe?

40
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,278
The one they launched last year?

41
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:22,219
They said its power supply was hit directly, so it's hopeless.

42
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,518
JX has only been out for more than a year.

43
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,810
It's supposed to last five years.

44
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,170
It hasn't completed its mission.

45
00:04:33,998 --> 00:04:36,618
So many stars are yet to be seen.

46
00:04:38,498 --> 00:04:40,778
My, you sound artsy all of a sudden.

47
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:42,079
Let me correct you.

48
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,639
JX is to observe the earth.

49
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,578
It's a quote from Yutu rover's Weibo. Someone told me that.

50
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,979
You're just ignorant.

51
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:57,798
Look on the bright side.

52
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,859
JX will not end up like Brahe.

53
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:05,039
At least we have successfully established solar orientation regular recharge.

54
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,459
These past few days, every step of the way has been suspenseful.

55
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:13,079
We figured out that our attitude orbit control may have abnormalities,

56
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,398
but we did not expect the main interface to be broken too.

57
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:31,020
By the way, currently, the earth-oriented attitude maneuver

58
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,070
can only be implemented by the backup.

59
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:36,118
We still have to optimize the implementation strategy.

60
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,918
I have to go back.

61
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:41,658
You haven't finished your lunch.

62
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:43,338
I finished.

63
00:05:43,338 --> 00:05:45,338
What a workaholic.

64
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,919
   

65
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:07,378
Attention, all units. The Jiamusi post reports

66
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:09,898
that the satellite will make its entry in one minute.

67
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,539
Let's hope nothing goes wrong.

68
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:29,530
Attention, all units. The Jiamusi post reports that the satellite has made entry.

69
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:51,359
According to telemetry data, all systems are working normally,

70
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,939
and it is conditioned for attitude maneuvering.

71
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,998
As planned, send the Satellite-to-Earth Orientation Command Sequence right away.

72
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:52,859
 The satellite has entered earth orientation mode. 

73
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:55,139
 Attitude normal. All system parameters are normal. 

74
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,259
It is now conditioned for on-orbit missions.

75
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,415
Old Li, thank you so much.

76
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:13,980
Thank you for rescuing this satellite with us.

77
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,340
This is our duty.

78
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,191
We're satellite shepherds, after all. The satellite is yours, but also ours.

79
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:19,591
Right.

80
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,260
We'll have to let these young people get some rest.

81
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,635
They haven't slept much lately.

82
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:32,120
Director Hu, I'm impressed by the younger members in your unit.

83
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,639
The same goes for your unit. They're all fine young people.

84
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,560
Dedicated, persistent, and full of ideas.

85
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,221
They are the future hope of aerospace.

86
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,300
You've been out for a month. You're as sharp as ever.

87
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,120
You're still thinking one step ahead of others.

88
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,881
You deserve praise, too.

89
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,960
Chief Guan, your orbit simulation calculation capability is also very amazing.

90
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,280
Even Chief Li was about to poach you on the spot.

91
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:33,480
That's good. It can put Old Hu on edge.

92
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,580
But the lifespan of the satellite has still been affected.

93
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:46,921
Still, it could exceed its planned lifespan.

94
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:49,180
But it should have been way more than that.

95
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:53,001
It's already very lucky to be rescued.

96
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,760
This satellite is the first model you participated in the design for.

97
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,700
It was also the first time we worked together.

98
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,800
Do you know how I felt when I first met you?

99
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:12,181
Were you jealous?

100
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:13,640
It was quite obvious.

101
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,040
As if.

102
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,901
When I first met you, I thought you were keeping up appearances.

103
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:25,700
It didn't take long before you gave me a detailed plan of the information flow interface.

104
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:27,640
So I thought,

105
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,861
your talent was as good as your looks, so we'd make a perfect couple.

106
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,800
Watch your words.

107
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,821
Don't embarrass us, engineering students, okay?

108
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,221
Shall we... talk about money?

109
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,119
Did Professor tell you?

110
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,221
Director Zhang called me, he hoped I could get you to talk about it some more.

111
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,499
Are you facing any difficulties?

112
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,280
Or... is it about your family?

113
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,141
By the way, I remember after you answered a call from your family last time,

114
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:12,260
something was wrong with you the next day.

115
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,419
Nothing is wrong with my family.

116
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,600
I was just flustered.

117
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,900
Glad to hear that.

118
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,680
I'm a little curious.

119
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,160
Are investment banks really profitable?

120
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,200
You earn over a million upon graduation. Is that true?

121
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,161
Well... It depends on the person and situation.

122
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,160
Before the 2008 financial crisis, someone could achieve it.

123
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,000
By the time I graduated, the crisis was abating.

124
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,500
It wasn't too bad.

125
00:11:47,601 --> 00:11:50,600
If I were in Google, I'd earn huge paychecks.

126
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,479
Rather than Google, how about NASA?

127
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:56,961
But we're merely foreigners there.

128
00:11:56,961 --> 00:12:00,500
We'll probably never have access to their core tech.

129
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,401
Do you know why I never urged you to stay?

130
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,961
Because I never thought you'd leave.

131
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,121
I thought we were two peas in a pod.

132
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:21,160
Just like my wife said,

133
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,061
simply put, it was untimely.

134
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,741
I also made a bet with my folks that if you really leave,

135
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:32,581
I will change my name to Pigpen Guan.

136
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:37,521
Wouldn't that be a reunion?

137
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:38,880
It's all your siblings, right? 
  (T/N: joking that pigs in the pigpen are his siblings) 

138
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,101
Shut up. Aren't you and I brothers?

139
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,121
Can I ask you something, Yu Tu?

140
00:12:48,721 --> 00:12:51,901
About the satellite failure, no one could tell what caused it.

141
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,580
We solved it in five days.

142
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,460
Some cases took us months to solve.

143
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:03,520
If it really takes months, will your investment bank wait?

144
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,700
Or... will you run away and abandon us?

145
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,921
It's almost 5 a.m. Your sister-in-law should be up by now. 
 (T/N: speaking about his wife Shen Jing) 

146
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:36,741
By the way, is there anything going on with you and Sister-in-law lately?

147
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:39,421
Nothing.

148
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,661
She has a junior sister whom she'd like to introduce to you.

149
00:13:45,481 --> 00:13:48,081
Last time she saw our group photo

150
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:51,200
and asked if you have a girlfriend.

151
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,080
You're so good-looking, so you're really at an advantage.

152
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,660
It took your sister-in-law a lot of effort to court me back in the day.

153
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:05,421
Turn her down for me.

154
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,640
You really don't need one?

155
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,421
But I met her. She's quite pretty.

156
00:14:10,421 --> 00:14:12,041
Please, no.

157
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:27,460
Recently... I met a girl.

158
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,721
She's quite clever,

159
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,761
 a little mischievous, 

160
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:54,861
and well-behaved.

161
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:56,160
That's great.

162
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,880
Did you meet her on vacation?

163
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,680
No, we went to the same high school.

164
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,641
From the same high school? Why are you dating her only now?

165
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:08,680
Back then, I had poor judgment.

166
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,600
I'm not dating her.

167
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,980
You're kidding me.

168
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,860
Is it because she doesn't like you?

169
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,061
But I don't think so.

170
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,960
You still got it.

171
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,480
Why is the door locked?

172
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,721
Not a soul in sight.

173
00:15:57,721 --> 00:16:00,961
Maybe they're busy. Just wait a bit.

174
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,721
In ten minutes, your sister-in-law should be up from bed.

175
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:10,721
I'll call her in a bit, tell her I'm safe.

176
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,160
Or else, once I go in

177
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,220
and the heater warms me up, I'll go out like a light once I see the bed.

178
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,860
Let's rest here for now.

179
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,740
 Yu Tu, I hope you'll reconsider your resignation. 

180
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,941
 You belong to aerospace. 

181
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:15,121
 Luckily, I'm fine. 

182
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:18,520
 Otherwise, we'll end up spending what's left of our savings. 

183
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:20,841
 At times like this, 

184
00:17:20,841 --> 00:17:23,441
 I think our son doesn't need to be a high achiever. 

185
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:26,760
 He might as well find a job in our little hometown 

186
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,680
 or dabble in finance. 

187
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,300
 At least he'll have some free time. 

188
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,240
 Can I ask you something, Yu Tu? 

189
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:42,760
 If it really takes months, will your investment bank wait? 

190
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,721
 Or... will you run away and abandon us? 

191
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,341
 Yu Tu, I'm so disappointed in you. 

192
00:17:59,321 --> 00:18:02,040
 Do you know why I never urged you to stay? 

193
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,741
 Because I never thought you'd leave. 

194
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:13,221
 I wish more than anyone else for you to remain an aerospace designer. 

195
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:43,621
   

196
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:47,341
   

197
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,281
You can call Sister-in-law now.

198
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,501
Easy there.

199
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,700
You should've taken it easy a few more days before you return to Shanghai.

200
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,480
I'll have to go back sooner or later.

201
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,780
I'm getting homesick.

202
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,700
Once I'm there, I'll head straight home.

203
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,540
You should go home and rest, too.

204
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,200
You don't have to take me to the hospital in Shanghai.

205
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,900
No.

206
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,720
I'll speak to your sister-in-law alone.

207
00:20:56,561 --> 00:21:01,061
Then... I will walk you to your apartment building.

208
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:36,341
   

209
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:41,181
   

210
00:21:41,181 --> 00:21:42,941
   
   

211
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:46,680
 She asked me yesterday when I'd be home. 

212
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,539
 I didn't reply. 

213
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,600
 What should I tell her? 

214
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,281
 I promised her last year that I would take her and our son out for a vacation this year. 

215
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,700
 I reneged twice. 

216
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,460
 I was thinking of taking them out at the end of the year. 

217
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,221
 I fibbed. 

218
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,836
 What should I say? 

219
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,580
 Give me my medical records and examination report. 

220
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,281
 I'll take them to the hospital myself. 

221
00:22:28,281 --> 00:22:30,321
 Don't forget. 

222
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,521
 If I hadn't sensed something wrong, 

223
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:41,361
 and pressed the doctor for answers. 

224
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,340
 You wouldn't have planned to tell me? 

225
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:53,780
 I... haven't come up with what to say. 

226
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,941
 Neither have I. 

227
00:23:26,181 --> 00:23:30,461
   

228
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:54,021
   

229
00:24:14,701 --> 00:24:15,760
   

230
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,441
   

231
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:21,361
   

232
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,761
Meng Meng, it's breakfast time.

233
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,640
Mom, have you figured out how to solve this additional problem?

234
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,960
Wei Wei said her dad came up with two solutions.

235
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,480
Your phone.

236
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,701
Now eat.

237
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,300
Have you figured it out?

238
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,240
What grade are you in?

239
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,421
Can a math problem be so hard?

240
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,200
My teacher said it was an additional problem. It doesn't matter if you solve it or not.

241
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,801
But it'll be embarrassing not to solve it.

242
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,700
So... You haven't figured it out, have you?

243
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,801
You're still not as good as Dad. He would definitely know.

244
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:33,240
Is this your homework or mine?

245
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,321
My teacher said we could ask our parents for help.

246
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:40,161
Maybe the teacher wanted to test the parents' IQ.

247
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:43,361
Mom, are you a little dim-witted?

248
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,960
And I inherited it from you.

249
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,001
Only very few people are as smart as your father.

250
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:53,680
I am of average IQ. It has nothing to do with dim-witted or whatnot.

251
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,601
I'm not so sure about that.

252
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:58,321
Remember Uncle Yu, who dropped by for dinner?

253
00:25:58,321 --> 00:26:02,701
I had one question I couldn't answer, but he managed to answer it with just one glance.

254
00:26:02,701 --> 00:26:05,090
Uncle Yu graduated from Tsinghua.

255
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,240
He's awesome enough to earn two degrees.

256
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,661
That puts him in the same league as your dad.

257
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,281
I'm coming.

258
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:17,361
Who is it so early in the morning?

259
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:19,261
Eat up.

260
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,501
Your savior is here.

261
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,820
There are two kinds.

262
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,601
Dad, write another, and I'll be the first in my class.

263
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,401
Just you wait.

264
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:52,901
Plus four...

265
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:55,060
Multiply by...

266
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:57,240
Done.

267
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,480
I'm the first in my class!

268
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,380
But I'll hold it back from my class group chat for now.

269
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,250
Then I'll show them tomorrow.

270
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,480
No one can surpass me by then.

271
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,680
I wonder who he inherited his wit from.

272
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,960
All right. You should pack up and head for the hobby class.

273
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,860
I'll pick you up at noon, and we'll have a delicious lunch.

274
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,521
I don't want to go to the hobby class.

275
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:20,340
It's not every Sunday that Dad is home. I want to be with him.

276
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,741
You have no class in the afternoon. You'll have time to be with him.

277
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:25,840
Hurry up and get changed.

278
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,321
I'm not so sure about that. You know how elusive Dad is.

279
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:32,361
Who knows if he's still here by the time I get home in the afternoon?

280
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:36,310
Then ask your dad, "Will you wander away?"

281
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,510
I'll be in Shanghai. No more business trips.

282
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:09,041
Hello?

283
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,720
 What you asked me this morning, Honor of Kings got back to me. 

284
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,040
The match will use today's updated version. There could be new heroes.

285
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,761
Then I'll try playing with some of the new heroes.

286
00:28:19,761 --> 00:28:21,801
Some adjustments may need to be made to the items.

287
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,281
You're really working hard.

288
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:25,560
About a month ago, you were a newbie at this.

289
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,480
And now, you're a true expert.

290
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,601
 You even took notice of details like what version will be used. 

291
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:34,121
 Well? Are you confident? 

292
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:37,041
In e-sports, I can't tell,

293
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:38,880
but there can't possibly be any shoo-ins.

294
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,181
Even pros will lose. And I'm no exception.

295
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,860
The least I can do is to show the very best of myself.

296
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,500
I think you shouldn't push yourself too hard.

297
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,181
 Besides, I think you're doing really great at it. 

298
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:53,630
 Look at you. You're in Ace 2. Right? 

299
00:28:55,081 --> 00:29:00,070
As for Teacher Yu, he hasn't been teaching you lately?

300
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:06,400
I can climb the ranks myself, whether he's around or not.

301
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,350
 I have a script to read. You can go back to your work. 

302
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:13,510
Okay. Goodbye then.

303
00:29:39,401 --> 00:29:41,380
   

304
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:48,761
   

305
00:29:54,581 --> 00:30:00,620
   

306
00:30:01,621 --> 00:30:05,281
   

307
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:31,181
   

308
00:30:31,181 --> 00:30:32,681
   

309
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:38,420
   

310
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:45,542
   

311
00:30:48,381 --> 00:30:50,421
   

312
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,740
 Double kill. 

313
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,010
 You have slained an enemy. 

314
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,430
 Rampage. 

315
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,110
 An enemy has been slain. 

316
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,900
 Triple kill. 

317
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,750
 First blood. 

318
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,060
 Victory. 

319
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:24,461
   

320
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:37,060
Jingjing. Jingjing. Why is Teacher Yu downstairs?

321
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:40,580
Did you lock him out downstairs and didn't let him come up?

322
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:59,061
♫  You crossed the sea of stars, bringing along the light  ♫

323
00:31:59,061 --> 00:32:03,041
   

324
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:10,721
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

325
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:14,541
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

326
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:18,481
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

327
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:22,221
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

328
00:32:22,221 --> 00:32:26,681
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

329
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:33,790
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

330
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:42,141
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

331
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:48,641
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

332
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:50,021
Are you still angry?

333
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:56,340
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy  ♫

334
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:03,990


335
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:17,820
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

336
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:25,000
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

337
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,090
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

338
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:39,740
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

339
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,420
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

340
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,500
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

341
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:53,700
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

342
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:59,950
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

343
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:07,860
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

344
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:16,390
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

345
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:50,860
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

346
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:58,140
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

347
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:05,160
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

348
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:12,960
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

349
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,540
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

350
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,540
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

351
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:26,700
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

352
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:34,000
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

353
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,200
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

354
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:50,780
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
