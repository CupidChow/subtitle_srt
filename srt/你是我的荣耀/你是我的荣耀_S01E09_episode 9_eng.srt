1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:10,210


2
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:25,319
♫  You crossed the sea of stars, bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:29,179
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t 
 bear to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:36,819
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:40,719
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,719
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,419
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,419 --> 00:00:52,859
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,859 --> 00:01:00,499
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:08,299
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:15,959
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:27,819
♫  I’ve fallen for you, but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:40,219
   

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,120
   

15
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,599
Let's order a few more dishes.

16
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,038
If we can't finish them, you can bring them back to So Panicky. I want to try a few dishes.

17
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:10,478
Jingjing, I want to ask a favor.

18
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:11,998
What favor?

19
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,039
I bumped into my professor and his wife.

20
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,119
They are waiting at the entrance, but there are more than ten customers ahead of them.

21
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:21,338
So can we let them take this room?

22
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,859
I'll treat you to eat somewhere else.

23
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:28,438
I don't mind, but why can't we all eat together?

24
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,999
You don't mind?

25
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:33,099
Why would I?

26
00:02:35,998 --> 00:02:37,798
I'll bring them over.

27
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,819
Here, Professor, Madam.

28
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:54,858
Hello.

29
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:57,278
This is my high school classmate, Qiao Jingjing.

30
00:02:57,278 --> 00:03:01,578
Jingjing, this is my mentor, Professor Zhang, and his wife, Professor Wang.

31
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:03,479
Hi, Professor Zhang. Hi, Professor Wang.

32
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,579
Hello. Hello.

33
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:10,939
Come, have a seat.

34
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:18,599
Here. You can put this here. Have a seat.

35
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,158
Okay.

36
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,958
Xiao Yu, when did you have such a beautiful high school classmate?

37
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,538
I feel like I've seen you somewhere.

38
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:35,278
Is today your birthday, Professor Wang?

39
00:03:35,278 --> 00:03:36,778
No.

40
00:03:36,778 --> 00:03:42,459
Today is actually our wedding anniversary.

41
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,659
We will have dinner here every year to celebrate it.

42
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,559
We actually booked a table,

43
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:53,879
but for some reason, they couldn't find the record.

44
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,099
They must have a lot of customers.

45
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,619
Professor, if today is your wedding anniversary, then we...

46
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:04,358
It's no bother!

47
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:06,318
You know very well that

48
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,678
both of us like company.

49
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:15,079
Having a meal with you two, one of which is a pretty girl,

50
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,118
it can't possibly be better than this, can it?

51
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:21,999
Okay. I'll order food then.

52
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:23,539
No need.

53
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:26,158
We are its patrons for several decades.

54
00:04:26,158 --> 00:04:29,999
I know very well which dish is the best.

55
00:04:29,999 --> 00:04:33,639
You two just enjoy a free meal today.

56
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,679
You took their room first.

57
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,618
Excuse me.

58
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,838
Hello. Ready to order?

59
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:44,138
Yes.

60
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:48,138
For the cold dish, one portion of smoked fish,

61
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:51,099
drunken chicken, candied lotus root,

62
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:54,079
and the Four-Treasures-In-Huadiao-Wine. That's all.

63
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,238
As for the hot dish,

64
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:59,030
red braised pork belly is a must-have.

65
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,270
Then one portion of stir-fried prawn.

66
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:05,798
- And then... 
 - Professor, wouldn't it be too oily? We should have something light.

67
00:05:05,798 --> 00:05:07,318
This is a rare occasion.

68
00:05:07,318 --> 00:05:10,239
Also, you youngsters are here today.

69
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:14,259
Sautéed peas. Fish noodle. Those will do.

70
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:15,638
Okay.

71
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,118
Are you staying in Shanghai? No travel plans?

72
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:23,318
No, I have some business here.

73
00:05:23,318 --> 00:05:25,438
I was looking for you to discuss something.

74
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:31,579
Yu Tu, I have dealt with your problem.

75
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,739
I know that Guan Zai and you

76
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:40,079
have reached a bottleneck in the model research project.

77
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,158
The institute has always played safe.

78
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:49,139
You have to understand that that's how we survived thus far.

79
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,158
Guaranteeing success is the most important part.

80
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:54,638
Redundancy is always good

81
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:57,879
because we can't afford to fail.

82
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:01,910
However, the times have changed.

83
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,830
Our nation has become stronger,

84
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,858
so we also need to change our mindset.

85
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:09,899
We ought to encourage the young to innovate.

86
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:14,038
I can understand why you suddenly said you wanted to quit.

87
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:16,899
That's why I gave you a break.

88
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:19,179
Let you take your mind off.

89
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:23,599
During this whole month, I was busy as well.

90
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:28,098
I discussed with Director Hu many times.

91
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:35,618
The institute's attitude has now softened.

92
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,058
Your project represents the future.

93
00:06:41,058 --> 00:06:46,818
The higher-ups have their eye on Guan Zai and you,

94
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:48,918
the future leaders.

95
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:53,619
We don't want you to follow the old mindset and refuse to change.

96
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:57,139
Your break is almost over.

97
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:03,799
When you return, revise the proposal with Guan Zai again

98
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:07,778
and try to get the institute's support.

99
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,779
Did you hear me?

100
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:30,399
Do you still want to quit?

101
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,359
Let's not talk about business.

102
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,398
Relax.

103
00:07:35,398 --> 00:07:36,438
Come.

104
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:38,138
Let him speak.

105
00:07:39,998 --> 00:07:42,038
Do you have other reasons?

106
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:48,738
Professor,

107
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,399
I left

108
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,099
for money.

109
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:18,998
I understand.

110
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,639
Many people

111
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,219
have left over the years.

112
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:30,599
I can understand their choices.

113
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:35,958
I'm just a bit disappointed.

114
00:08:38,838 --> 00:08:40,919
Yu Tu,

115
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:45,899
you've really disappointed me.

116
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:47,840
You're my proudest student.

117
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,510
I thought...

118
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:59,979
Let's not talk about how my generation's aerospace engineers started everything from zero.

119
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:02,639
Look at your colleague, Guan Zai.

120
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,519
He gave up his high-paying job and came back from the US.

121
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,038
I always thought you were like him,

122
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:11,879
that you had your own belief and persistence.

123
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,018
Yu Tu gave up his high-paying job too.

124
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:31,738
Yu Tu and his colleague are talented people. They deserve the best treatment.

125
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:37,478
But asking them to have no regard for anything else for the sake of their dream, isn't this...

126
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,998
isn't it like kidnapping? 
  (T/N: a guilt trip) 

127
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,359
Jingjing!

128
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:04,579
Sorry.

129
00:10:16,996 --> 00:10:20,096
Professor, I apologize.

130
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:22,738
We won't disturb you and your wife's dinner.

131
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:50,759
You're the biggest beneficiary of our current society,

132
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,179
so you shouldn't say those things to my professor.

133
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:59,319
What do you mean?

134
00:10:59,998 --> 00:11:04,558
If I'm not Qiao Jingjing, if I'm not a celebrity, would I be able to say it?

135
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:07,098
I just wanted to defend you.

136
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:14,419
I want you to be an aerospace engineer more than anyone else.

137
00:11:28,118 --> 00:11:29,818
Why?

138
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,738
Jingjing. Teacher Yu. Why are you guys out here?

139
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:55,979
Can you delete the photo you took just now?

140
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,139
Thank you.

141
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,459
 I'm sorry. 

142
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:55,758
 Don't take what your professor said to heart. 

143
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:59,118
 He was just a bit upset. We respect your decision. 

144
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:03,399
 Also, don't blame your friend. What she said was true. 

145
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:12,358
 Thank you, Professor Wang. 

146
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,359
   

147
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,459
   

148
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,459
   
   

149
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,359
   
   

150
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:25,259
   
   

151
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,859
   

152
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:20,699
   

153
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:25,807
   

154
00:15:25,807 --> 00:15:27,839
   

155
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,320
What's happening?

156
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,039
Why haven't we received the telemetry signal? 
  (T/N: frequency waves that can be used to monitor the activity level of an object) 

157
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:39,039
   

158
00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:51,479
   

159
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,000
 Yu Tu, Satellite JX has some emergency issues. The attitude is out of control. 

160
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,240
 I don't care where you are. 

161
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,140
 Your break is terminated, get to Northwest Satellite Control Center immediately. 

162
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:21,258
Open the trunk, please.

163
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:29,519
What happened?

164
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,499
Did Old Hu summon you with one phone call?

165
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:36,818
I grabbed some documents from the institute and took the last flight to Xi'an.

166
00:16:36,818 --> 00:16:37,959
Why are you out here?

167
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:40,578
I flew over from Beijing. I arrived just a little earlier than you.

168
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:43,060
Old Hu said you'd be here, so I was waiting for you.

169
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,218
What happened exactly? They didn't tell me anything.

170
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:48,218
Let's go in first.

171
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,498
Are you two the staff from Unit 158? IDs, please.

172
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:04,138
These are your passes. Follow me.

173
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:05,338
Okay.

174
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:07,699
Here.

175
00:17:17,478 --> 00:17:20,940
JX was working properly.

176
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,200
But last night, after it finished its first rotation,

177
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,030
the ground station did not receive any telemetry signal.

178
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:30,238
The center informed us straight away.

179
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:32,130
They fixed channels transmission from the ground station,

180
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,950
RF module from the transponder, issuing commands to the back-up,

181
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,790
they did it thrice

182
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:41,090
but they still couldn't receive the telemetry signal from the satellite.

183
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:43,018
Did it just go MIA (Missing In Action)?

184
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:46,478
No response even from the backup?

185
00:17:46,478 --> 00:17:47,978
Yes.

186
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:52,018
The backup transponder on Satellite JX is heterogeneous.

187
00:17:52,018 --> 00:17:54,738
The possibility of a simultaneous error is extremely low.

188
00:17:54,738 --> 00:17:58,378
But it happened. We are the first to arrive from our team.

189
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,700
Others who worked on JX

190
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,530
are occupied. They'll be here by tomorrow.

191
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,460
   

192
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,120
Chief Li.

193
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,260
Mr. Han, Mr. Yang.

194
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,352
Our colleagues from Unit 158 are here.

195
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:26,881
Hi.

196
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:27,820
Hello.

197
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,020
Allow me to introduce you,

198
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,100
this is Chief Li, Head of the Technical Department in this center.

199
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,660
These two are Mr. Yang and Mr. Han, also from the Technical Department.

200
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:38,641
I'm Guan Zai from Unit 158, Satellite JX Chief Engineer.

201
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:42,240
I'm Yu Tu from Unit 158, Satellite JX Engineer.

202
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,000
Director Hu is in Taiyuan now with some business to attend to.

203
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,600
He'll be here tomorrow afternoon at the latest.

204
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,180
Wonderful.

205
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,480
- Thank you for your hard work, Xiao Lu. 
 - No worries.

206
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,780
Have you prepared for their reception?

207
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,700
The receptionists have done it. Don't worry.

208
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,680
This is not urgent.

209
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,460
Chief Li, I want to understand the latest situation of JX's orbit.

210
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,320
Last night, after you transmitted the commands during the second and third rotation,

211
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,121
was the downlink signal received?

212
00:19:05,121 --> 00:19:08,820
So when it entered our range, we sent the command straight away.

213
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,840
However, we still haven't received the downlink signal.

214
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,540
We switched to the backup and sent the command via fixed channels

215
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,520
but there's no response.

216
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,720
We brought along the related documents and drawings.

217
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,451
Do you have any recent telemetry data of the satellite?

218
00:19:25,451 --> 00:19:26,940
It's all in our system.

219
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,880
Let's figure out the problem, then.

220
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,860
Once we find it, we can devise a solution.

221
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:36,440
   

222
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:56,040
   

223
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,980
Are you okay?

224
00:20:04,547 --> 00:20:05,671
I'm getting old.

225
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,116
One all-nighter and I'm dizzy already.

226
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:13,017
Back then, a few hours of sleep for a few nights was no problem.

227
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,453
I'll head to bed now.

228
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,240
 I received another call from the ministry. 

229
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,319
 The government invested a lot to launch this satellite. 

230
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:44,880
 Now that it's not working, the ministry wants an explanation. 

231
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,319
 Should we explore another options instead of focusing on the transponder? 

232
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:50,380
 It could be the power supply. 

233
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,399
 Besides, is it possible that its orbit has changed? 

234
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,360
 The fixed channels might not be able to reach it. 

235
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,559
 The power subsystem and the recent orbital data, I've read them all. 

236
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,840
 The telemetry data is within the normal threshold. 

237
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,600
 I've also checked the orbital data. 

238
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,160
 It matches quite well with the predetermined orbit. 

239
00:21:08,955 --> 00:21:11,760
 However, Chief Guan and I designed the model. 

240
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:18,459
 To reach a conclusion, we need to wait for the electrical and orbital engineers' input. 

241
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,560
   

242
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,225
   

243
00:21:59,225 --> 00:22:00,845
   

244
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:07,800
   

245
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,480
   
   

246
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,625
Old Guan. Old Guan.

247
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,640
Did we find the satellite?

248
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,040
No, but I might have found an explanation.

249
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,720
All right. Let's have a meeting.

250
00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:43,399
    
 Solar energetic particle is already a rare phenomenon.

251
00:22:43,399 --> 00:22:47,616
But to have one whose energy affects two machines at the same time?

252
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,320
This is too unlikely.

253
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,676
Previously, we've been focusing on the satellite itself,

254
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:56,480
and we couldn't locate the problem.

255
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,580
I was exploring the possibility of external factors

256
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,620
and I suddenly thought of the solar wind forecast I saw earlier.

257
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,930
I consulted the International Space Web,

258
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,370
and I did find some relevant info.

259
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,060
While we were waiting for you all,

260
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,559
Chief Guan and I did a rough calculation.

261
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,760
This possibility cannot be ruled out

262
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,570
but to reach the final conclusion,

263
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,720
we still need a lot of calculations and simulations.

264
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,260
The backup is a dynamic backup.

265
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,000
Did we really hit the jackpot this time?

266
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,890
This year is also the year of peak solar activity according to the 11-year solar cycle.

267
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,975
Contact the Space Department of the Chinese Academy of Science.

268
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:36,180
Ask them to provide us the details regarding Satellite JX in its trajectory yesterday.

269
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,620
Okay. I'll do that right now.

270
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,220
Chief Li.

271
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,799
Director Hu of Unit 158 and others who worked on JX have arrived.

272
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,060
Old Li.

273
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,640
Director Hu, you arrived early.

274
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,799
Time is of the essence. I traveled through the night via car.

275
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,800
Let's not waste time chatting.

276
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,979
Any update on JX?

277
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,239
Look at me. So anxious that I'm steaming. 
  (T/N: got sick) 

278
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:06,179
Satellite JX was my last work before I transferred into administration.

279
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,420
If it's gone like that,

280
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:11,319
I will regret it for the rest of my life.

281
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,279
Take a break first, Director Hu.

282
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,179
We might have found a reason. We're waiting for the confirmation.

283
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,160
   

284
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,880
The Chinese Academy of Sciences replied.

285
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,380
They confirmed that the malfunction of the satellite coincided with the solar storm.

286
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,799
   

287
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,079
Run the simulation now.

288
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,700
Cross-check the satellite's position, time of the malfunction,

289
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,018
and the range of the energetic electron storm triggered by the solar storm.

290
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:37,940
- See if they match. 
 - Okay.

291
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,799
How long will it take?

292
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,079
No longer than two hours.

293
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:44,300
We can still salvage it today.

294
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,580
The one in charge of orbit monitoring, calculate its orbit

295
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,899
and surmise its precise trajectory and travel time.

296
00:24:50,899 --> 00:24:54,079
Transponder and satellite coordinator, write the command script now.

297
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,840
The staff in charge of the power supply, copy the previous energy level on the satellite

298
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,559
and evaluate if there's any breach in the power supply.

299
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:04,039
In addition, the solar storm is only the most probable explanation so far.

300
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:05,939
We need to wait for the result.

301
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:10,319
Think if there are any other latent factors.

302
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:16,100
Guan Zai. Since you're the chief engineer, stay in the loop. Report to me every hour.

303
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,600
Noted.

304
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,120
   

305
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,240
According to the simulation,

306
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,600
we can confirm that before Satellite JX entered within our range last night,

307
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,559
it was hit by the energetic electron storm that happens once every 11 years.

308
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,640
The massive energy released might have affected both transponders.

309
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,720
Single-event upset took place simultaneously

310
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,019
and damaged the satellite's entire communications system.

311
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,420
We have already devised a contingency plan for this.

312
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,520
The reception part of the transponder uses analog electronics.

313
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,159
It won't be affected by the single-event upset.

314
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:23,760
Therefore, when the satellite rotates into our range again,

315
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,319
transmit reboot command to the two transponders via fixed channels.

316
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,199
If the satellite receives the command successfully,

317
00:26:31,199 --> 00:26:34,800
its telecommunication system should come back online.

318
00:26:46,324 --> 00:26:47,406
Attention to all divisions,

319
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:51,453
according to Jiamusi Station, the satellite will cross the border in one minute.

320
00:26:51,453 --> 00:26:53,040
K35 Satellite Transponder.

321
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,220
Launching module. Reboot command for both machines.

322
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,740
Command sent by Jiamusi post.

323
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,625
The signal is in.

324
00:27:23,625 --> 00:27:26,460
Telemetry signal received. No interference.

325
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,319
Please check every system now.

326
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,120
How's the satellite?

327
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,960
 Stabilization subsystem malfunction. Three-axis earth-oriented stabilization failed. 

328
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,600
The power system is normal. But there's excessive power supply. It used less power than expected.

329
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,439
We did take into account the damage to the stabilization subsystem due to the solar storm.

330
00:27:46,439 --> 00:27:49,620
We have a plan for this exact scenario.

331
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,159
The power supply malfunction

332
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:53,960
must be the side product of the damaged stabilization subsystem.

333
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,000
 I think it is because of the solar sails, that we can't establish solar orientation properly, 

334
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,459
 so the power supply has increased. 

335
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:02,919
Our utmost priority now is to reduce the workload on the satellite.

336
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,119
Contain its energy consumption and correct its attitude as soon as possible.

337
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,260
Follow the protocol and launch the commands.

338
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,780
Turn off all unnecessary devices and lessen power consumption.

339
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:18,243
Meanwhile, launch solar-oriented commands, to make the satellite's solar panels face the sun.

340
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,020
 The satellite is now out of the monitoring range. 

341
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,320
The next rotation will be at 8:03 p.m.

342
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,702
Attention, everyone. Reporting in from Kunming post. Target is in range.

343
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,959
Based on the telemetry signal, the attitude and control system is abnormal.

344
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:58,592
The satellite has not entered a solar-oriented stable state.

345
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,039
Another all-nighter.

346
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,186
 Send the amended contract to my e-mail. 

347
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,379
The latest one, okay?

348
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:37,780
Xiao Zhu.

349
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,260
Come here.

350
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,160
What's wrong?

351
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,620
What happened to Jingjing recently?

352
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,060
She came to the office three days in a row now.

353
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,810
She's in an argument with Teacher Yu.

354
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,330
Teacher Yu has been absent these few days.

355
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:54,140
Really? Don't they get along well?

356
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,960
Jingjing, I have good news.

357
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,720
Director Li sent us the contract back. The conditions are quite good.

358
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,059
Also, if we announce this news now,

359
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:12,620
we'll have a higher offer for the upcoming dramas.

360
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,520
Am I worth this much money?

361
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,000
I mean, shooting for a drama usually lasts for five months.

362
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,539
Am I worth this much money?

363
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,279
Of course, you do!

364
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,699
Just think about it. When you star in a show,

365
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:31,480
TV channels and streaming platforms all want it.

366
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,679
Advertisers want to place their products in it.

367
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,399
That's how TV channels and streaming platforms make money.

368
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:37,960
Of course, you're worth the money.

369
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,510
Other B-listers would even ask for this price,

370
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,950
not to mention you're an A-Lister yourself.

371
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,480
I'm not comparing myself with them.

372
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,679
Who are you comparing with then?

373
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,540
Am I too sentimental by thinking about these?

374
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,959
Well, it's not about being sentimental or not.

375
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:09,960
I've thought about this question too.

376
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,119
But you see, that's how the market works.

377
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:15,240
If you don't grab it, someone else will.

378
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,480
Besides, if you don't take the money,

379
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,000
the main investors will still sell the copyright at the same price.

380
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,420
So where will the price difference go?

381
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,670
Into the pocket of the investors, of course.

382
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,060
It has nothing to do with sentimentality. It's that dwelling on this will serve no purpose.

383
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,879
Let me ask you, then.

384
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:36,199
If someone offers you tens of millions of yuan for a drama,

385
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:40,699
would you say, "No, I just want millions of yuan?"

386
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,140
I wouldn't.

387
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,179
See? There's no point in dwelling on this.

388
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:47,920
Just do your job properly.

389
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,480
Act well. Stay out of trouble.

390
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,400
Respect their work. Respect their money.

391
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,979
Donate to charities like we're supposed to.

392
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:59,119
Is that not enough?

393
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,420
Look at you. Why are you sulking?

394
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,059
Why did you think of this all of a sudden?

395
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,879
Where's Teacher Yu?

396
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,120
All right. I'll leave now.

397
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,300
Cheer up.

398
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:35,600
See you then. Call me if anything.

399
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,159
Check on her. If something happens, call me.

400
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,079
I'll head out now.

401
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:51,300
Will do. Don't worry.

402
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,060
   

403
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,960
 I'm off on a business trip. 

404
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,800
 Don't know when I'll be back. 

405
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:32,040


406
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:42,730
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

407
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:49,890
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

408
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:57,000
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

409
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,650
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

410
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,130
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

411
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:11,310
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

412
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:18,470
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

413
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:24,570
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

414
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:32,810
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
 that we failed to treasure  ♫

415
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:40,410
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

416
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:15,770
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

417
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:22,950
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

418
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:30,170
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

419
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:37,670
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

420
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,350
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

421
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:44,450
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

422
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:51,710
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

423
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:57,610
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

424
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:05,950
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
 in the passing time  ♫

425
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:16,330
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
