00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,450
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,210
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,650
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,530
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,330
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:28,890
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,050
   

14
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,259
It's snowing!

16
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,159
Your photos used to be posted here all the time;

17
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:12,480
what competitions you entered, what awards you got, etc.

18
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,879
Do you still remember what I said to you at Sister Ling's house?

19
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,120
I said you'd be an amazing aerospace engineer in the future.

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,119
When that happens, as your classmate, I will feel very proud.

21
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,780
I remember.

22
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,399
But actually, it's not like that.

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,539
It's not as your classmate.

24
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,819
Then as what is it?

25
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,280
Actually ever since last time, I have had some weird imaginations.

26
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,779
I'll tell you, but don't laugh at me.

27
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,680
I imagined that after a long time, during the school festival,

28
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,339
you'll get invited back to school as a very reputable aerospace engineer.

29
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:06,300
And then... I'll be by your side.

30
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:15,599
So, Teacher Yu, you have to work hard.

31
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,020
I have high expectations of you.

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,260
Jingjing, I feel that sometimes you're a bit blind when it comes to me.

33
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:34,377
Back in high school, I used to think that I was very smart too.

34
00:03:34,377 --> 00:03:39,639
Only when I left, I realized that it's a vast world out there and how insignificant I am.

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,917
I wasn't as much of a genius as I thought I was.

36
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,639
My IQ is also far from being in the first tier.

37
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,900
The... The first tier you mean is...

38
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:56,019
Qian Xuesen, Sergei Korolev, Theodore von Kármán.

39
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,935
It's okay. You can continue.

40
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:09,919
But I'll work hard.

41
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:12,624
I think I can.

42
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,757
I realized you might gravitate toward BDS.

43
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,718
What's BDS?

44
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,220
Baidu-search it yourself.

45
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,560
How dare you say this to me?

46
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,279
We're closing soon.

47
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,038
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

48
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,639
- Thank you, Sir. 
 - No problem.

49
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,517
- Thank you, Sir! 
 - You're welcome.

You... You're that...

52
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:04,940
Yes, I am! Thank you for letting us in.

53
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,558
Happy Lunar New Year! We'll get going.

54
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,920
- Happy Lunar New Year! 
 - Happy Lunar New Year!

55
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,780
- Come back often! 
 - Okay!

♫  I look forward to every second  ♫

61

♫  I can run toward the future with you  ♫

62
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,100
♫  Regardless of everything  ♫

63
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,260
I think my parents are playing mahjong now.

64
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,720
Let's stop here.

65
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,800
Go.

66
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,060
Go. Goodnight.

67
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,459
If I want to keep our relationship a secret from my parents for the time being, are you okay with that?

68
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:32,500
Otherwise, it's pretty troublesome to keep getting asked about it.

69
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:36,360
How long is "for the time being"?

70
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,319
Until someone spills it?

71
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,260
I think this way they might get surprised.

72
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,879
Our parents might not think the same...

73
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,440
When I send you back to Shanghai tomorrow, what identity should I use then?

74
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,980
Ex-classmate.

75
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,977
Would your parents believe it?

76
00:06:55,977 --> 00:07:00,279
But if you just appear plainly out of nowhere, they'll definitely suspect something.

77
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:02,637
Then let me make up a story first.

78
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,539
Let me think.

79
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,020
I'll say that...

80
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:17,160
I'll say that the driver can't come tomorrow, so I'll drive back to Shanghai myself.

81
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,560
Do you have a driver's license?

82
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,260
Of course I have one. I know how to drive.

83
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,560
Don't interrupt me.

84
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,760
Nonetheless, my parents will definitely object to the idea of me driving back to Shanghai on my own.

85
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,600
And then, just so happens, I come across a message in our high school chatroom

86
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,179
that someone is going back to Shanghai and can bring me along.

87
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,500
After laying out the backstories, my parents definitely won't suspect anything anymore.

88
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,438
What do you think?

89
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,160
What's that face?

90
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,300
Nothing.

91
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:55,320
I just suddenly remembered the time you tricked me into repairing the purifier.

92
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,040
Not only is our Ms. Qiao an actor,

93
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,020
you even know how to make up stories on the spot.

94
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,800
As someone who will be spending the longest time with you for the rest of your life,

95
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,581
I think I need to prepare myself mentally.

96
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:13,700
You look very reluctant.

97
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,720
Why would I?

98
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,160
Then I need to work hard.

99
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,240
I can't have you get ready for nothing.

100
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,317
Don't work too hard.

101
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,819
Are you getting scared?

102
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,920
Not to that extent.

103
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,840
You give it a try.

104
00:08:39,557 --> 00:08:42,857
Hello! How's your elopement going? Happy?

105
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,000
   

106
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,046
 It's more than half an hour now, and he's still not back home yet. 

107
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,621
 Have you sent Peipei back home? 

108
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,659
 Are you home yet? 

109
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,480
 I'm back home! 

110
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,240
   

111
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,660
 Did you just get home? 

112
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,039
 No, I've been back for some time already. 

113
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,960
 My husband kept asking me who's the person who sent me back. 

114
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,506
 Your class had such a good-looking classmate, etc. 

115
00:09:58,506 --> 00:10:02,339
 - It's tiring when your husband cares so much about you. 
 - Read. 

116
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,238
 How about Yu Tu? 

117
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,400
 Yu Tu is not back yet? That can't be. 

118
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,032
 From my house to his, it should only take the cab a few minutes. 

119
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:11,980
 Let me ask him. 

120
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,919
   

121
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,639
 I'll call you in a short while. 

122
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,060
 I'm reporting to my mom now. 

123
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,000
Reporting?

124
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,540
 Okay. 

125
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,424
 I'm done reporting. 

126
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,960
   

127
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,680
 Jingjing, are you asleep? 

128
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,740
 Good night. 

129
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,940
 Good morning. 

130
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:44,020
   

131
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,319
You woke me up.

132
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,998
Have you not gotten up yet?

133
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,637
Back then, I would be at your house at 9 a.m.

134
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,319
It's Lunar New Year. Can't I just sleep in a while longer?

135
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,120
My bad.

136
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,001
I know it now.

137
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:10,839
 What did you mean when you said that you were reporting to your mom last night? 

138
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,910
 It was just my mom asking me why am I going to Shanghai on the first day of the Lunar New Year, 

139
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,500
and who I met last night.

140
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,400
But... someone decided to keep this from our parents.

141
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,118
So I could only say that it was a pretty girl.

142
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,041
And I didn't get the girl yet.

143
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,300
You seemed to have built a rather bad image of me.

144
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,720
Like someone who neither approves nor rejects.

145
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,399
 Your mom would definitely have a bad impression of me. 

146
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,159
I didn't consider things thoroughly.

147
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:48,960
How about this?

148
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,479
Next time, we can tell her that I didn't get the girl whom I met last night and on the first day of New Year.

149
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:56,919
 Ms. Qiao is my new love interest. 

150
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,958
That'll only make me look bad.

151
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,459
 I'm joking. Don't worry about this. 

152
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:03,619
I'm not worried.

153
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:05,840
Elderlies like me.

154
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,179
She'll like me when she sees me.

155
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,240
 Are you still sleepy? 

156
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,080
 Do you want to continue your sleep? 

157
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,919
 Later, I'll need to go downstairs to clear the snow. 

158
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,120
Clear the snow?

159
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,559
 Yeah. 

160
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,159
 Our area is a bit older. 

161
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,000
It's not under any property management.

162
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,920
I'll just clear a bit from the road outside so that it's easier to walk.

163
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,039
Okay then.

164
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,720
I'll sleep a bit more.

165
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,440
Why did you sigh all of a sudden?

166
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,019
 Nothing. 

167
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:40,200
 I was just thinking about 

168
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,760
 when I can go to your place and clear the snow there. 

169
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:53,159
I want to sleep now. Don't wake me up.

170
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,700
I'm hanging up now.

171
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,539
Dad! Mom!

172
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,120
Until what time did they play mahjong last night that they're still sleeping now?

173
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,300
My memory is so good.

174
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,501
Hello, there. I'd like to ask for directions.

175
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,919
I heard that there is a very delicious beancurd shop in Yixing.

176
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,720
I don't know the way. I'm hungry.

177
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,440
Hey, I'm only asking for directions.

178
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,918
Isn't it a bit inappropriate to hug me like this?

179
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,438
Didn't you say you were going to continue your sleep?

180
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,679
You're the one who woke me up.

181
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,520
I woke up and saw that my parents were still in bed.

182
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,460
I'm starving.

183
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,743
Poor thing.

184
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,121
Why aren't you asking me how I knew that you lived here?

185
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,520
Let's go. I'll bring you to get breakfast.

186
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,880
Yu Tu! Your grandaunt called to say that she'll be coming over later to have a meal.

187
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,440
You go...

188
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,999
Your mom...

189
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,119
Oh, no. We're caught.

190
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:12,421
Yu Tu... This... This is...

191
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:14,880
Mom. This is my...

192
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,280
Happy Lunar New Year, Aunty.

193
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,759
I am Yu Tu's girlfriend.

194
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,799
My name is Qiao Jingjing.

195
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,779
Girlfriend?

196
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,040
Qiao Jingjing.

197
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,739
Aunty, the story's like this.

198
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:32,100
Yu Tu and I have been in a relationship for a very long time.

199
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,519
But he always refused to bring me to see you.

200
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,119
So I had no choice but to come myself.

201
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,640
Yes.

202
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,240
It was me.

203
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,140
I feel that...

204
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:55,159
- I feel that... 
 - He feels that...

205
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:57,580
You might not like me.

206
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,480
Who said that?

207
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,199
Yu Tu! What kind of nonsense is that?

208
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:04,900
Jingjing, how can we not like you?

209
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,459
I've never said anything like this.

210
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:09,740
- He never mentioned anything to me. 
 - Mom...

211
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,079
So he has never even mentioned me to you before...

212
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,219
No... That's not it... He hinted to me before.

213
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,599
I was the one who didn't get the hint.

214
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,219
I must have said something that made him misunderstand me.

215
00:18:18,219 --> 00:18:20,193
It's just a misunderstanding.

216
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,499
Jingjing, I really like you.

217
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:27,040
I've never missed an episode of the dramas that you're in.

218
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,459
I know you two were classmates in high school,

219
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:32,140
but I never thought you two would...

220
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,800
Uhm... Let's not just stand here. Let's go into the house.

221
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,380
Go in and chat.

222
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,858
Let me take a call.

223
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:43,400
Hello.

224
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,440
Are you guys here?

225
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,640
Yes. Yes. It's the junction in front. It's right after you turn.

226
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,759
Yes. Yes.

227
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,580
Okay. See you in a while.

228
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,980
Mom, we would like to keep it quiet for now.

229
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,319
Jingjing hasn't had her breakfast yet. I'll take her out for breakfast.

230
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,459
- Okay. Okay. 
 - Happy Lunar New Year, Aunty!

231
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,000
Eat more!

232
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,299
I'll keep the secret for you two!

233
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,779
It tastes so good!

234
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,600
   

235
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,299
 - Yu Tu.  
 - Mom.

236
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,580
 Your grandaunt wants to hang out at our place until the afternoon. 

237
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,240
Why don't we ask Jingjing to come tonight?

238
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,200
Tell me. Is Qiao Jingjing really your girlfriend?

239
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:45,940
Mom, didn't you see everything already?

240
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,919
 I just want to confirm it again. 

241
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:51,219
Let's see when she is free to come to our house.

242
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:53,060
 Ask her whether she's free tomorrow at noon. 

243
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,118
 We'll treat her to a meal. 

244
00:19:56,179 --> 00:19:59,140
Mom, the thing is she has to rush back to Shanghai this afternoon

245
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,800
and back to her drama shoot tomorrow morning.

246
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,979
How about this? Wait till when she comes back for her vacation next time.

247
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:07,200
 I see. What a shame. 

248
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,599
 It's all your fault. 

249
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:11,119
 Not only did you not tell us that you have a girlfriend, 

250
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,759
 you even talked nonsense in front of her, ruining your parents' image. 

251
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,240
 Are your dad and I that kind of people? 

252
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,519
 I haven't even told your dad yet. 

253
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,757
 You just wait until he finds out about this. 

254
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,819
Mom, I was wrong. I know.

255
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:28,198
You must tell her that you were the one who was imagining things all this time.

256
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:30,039
 It has nothing to do with us. 

257
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:33,000
 We would always welcome her to our house with open hands. 

258
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,977
 We all like her very much. 

259
00:20:35,977 --> 00:20:38,540
Mom, she already knows.

260
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,200
 Sure. You two enjoy yourselves. 

261
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,759
- Mom, I'll hang up now. 
 - Okay. Okay.

262
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,159
"I feel that my parents wouldn't like you"?

263
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,319
This way, your mom wouldn't have a problem with me.

264
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,320
Who asked you to create a negative image for me before this?

265
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:05,180
Not bad. It's a pretty good idea.

266
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,559
Right? Was I quick with my response?

267
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,059
Yes.

268
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,900
I need to learn from you.

269
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,299
It's the EQ that I've trained up after all these years of variety shows and interviews.

270
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,639
Where should we go after this?

271
00:21:20,639 --> 00:21:22,417
Let's go to Hufu.

272
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:24,459
I only covered half of the place the other day.

273
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:31,180
Are we going to ride a boat?

274
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,037
You'll be steering it?

275
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,807
Do you know how to steer it?

276
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,259
Then... Do you really know how to steer?

277
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,619
Yes.

278
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,579
Come. Put on the life vest.

279
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:02,080
I don't really trust you.

280
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,720
You have no choice but to trust me.

281
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,779
You're already on my boat now.

282
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,879
Hurry and put it on too.

283
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,560
Are you ready to go?

284
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,919
You really know how to steer!

285
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,239
This is amazing!

286
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,739
The one in front! Go there!

287
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,000
Why did you stop?

288
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,738
I can't go any further. Let's fuel up.

289
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,140
♫  That anticipated and sweet moment  ♫

290
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,160
♫  It is when I can entrust my heart in your hands  ♫

291
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,800
♫  Missing that moment and someone  ♫

292
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,000
♫  It is every moment with you  ♫

293
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,360
♫  Yes, yes, yes  ♫

294
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,519
♫  Right in your world, right next to you  ♫

295
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,080
It's full now.

296
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:06,418
Let's go.

297
00:24:06,418 --> 00:24:10,340
♫  The end of loneliness comes when I have 
 the joy of your company  ♫

298
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,322
♫  I’ll be there for you every day  ♫

299
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,080
♫  My heart is yours, baby, heart is yours  ♫

300
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,360
♫  Fall in love with you  ♫

301
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,100
♫  My heart is yours, baby, heart is yours  ♫

302
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,920
♫  Loving you  ♫

303
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,660
♫  Fall in love with you  ♫

304
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,700
Later in the afternoon, let's stick to what we've planned before

305
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,200
and say that I, your ex-classmate in high school, am here to pick you up. Am I right?

306
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
Yes.

307
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,000
Once I'm done with my act, I'll let you know.

308
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Sure. I'll wait for your contact.

309
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,800
I'll get going then.

310
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,200
Here.

311
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,600
Old man.

312
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,000
- Eat more. 
 - Okay.

313
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,700
Eat more.

314
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,600
Dad, Mom.

315
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,400
Once I'm done eating, I'll need to go back to Shanghai.

316
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,200
What's the rush?

317
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,200
That's good too. It gets dark earlier in winter.

318
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,400
Plus, it's snowing outside.

319
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,200
It's safer to go back earlier.

320
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,700
When is your driver coming?

321
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,800
He can't come today. I'll be driving back myself.

322
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,200
What?

323
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,800
- You can't! 
 - You can't!

324
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,700
Why can't I?

325
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,200
Although I don't drive a lot, my skill is not bad.

326
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,400
I even drove out to hang out with Peipei today, didn't I?

327
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,600
I haven't scolded you about that yet, and you dare to bring it up yourself.

328
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,000
Tell me. How many times do you even drive in a year?

329
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,400
Plus, that's in the city. There's no snow on the road.

330
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,000
Who knows what can happen when you drive long-distance?

331
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,500
No way. You can't.

332
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,400
That driver of yours...

333
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,700
Why is he not here?

334
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:22,900
His plane ticket was canceled and he couldn't get any tickets last minute.

335
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
You...

336
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,400
How about this?

337
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,200
Get her cousin to send her back.

338
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,500
If he can't, I'll send you.

339
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:33,400
Either way, you can't drive back yourself.

340
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,000
That's so troublesome. I can drive back on my own.

341
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,700
No means no. There's no room for discussion about this.

342
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,400
Exactly.

343
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,900
You don't have to worry or trouble my cousin anymore.

344
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,200
Just so happens, my ex-classmate sent a message in the chatroom,

345
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,400
saying he'll be going back to Shanghai today.

346
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,400
Plus, he's been driving for a long time.

347
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,100
Really?

348
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,400
Coming!

349
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,600
What a cold day today.

350
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,200
Coming.

351
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,800
Good afternoon, Aunty.

352
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,400
Good afternoon.

353
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
You are Jingjing's ex-classmate.

354
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Hurry. Come in and have some water.

355
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,200
She's almost done.

356
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,600
Mom! There's no need to drink water.

357
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,600
Hurry! We'll go now.

358
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,000
- Hurry up. 
 - This kid...

359
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,200
How can you be so thoughtless?

360
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,000
It's so cold today. You can go after having something warm.

361
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,500
Exactly. It won't hold you guys up for too long.

362
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,700
- Come. Have a seat inside. 
 - Yes.

363
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,400
Uncle, Aunty, it's okay.

364
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,900
There will probably be more chances in the future.

365
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,600
Hurry, let's go.

366
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:15,800
Actually, I'm Jingjing's boyfriend.

367
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,300
We've been in a relationship for a long time.

368
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,300
But she always refused to bring me to see you

369
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,600
and told me to say that we're just ex-classmates.

370
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,000
What's going on?

♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

374

♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

377

♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

378
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:42,200
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

379
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:49,200
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

380

♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
 that we failed to treasure  ♫

381
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:05,400
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

382
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:39,500
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

383

♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

384
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:53,800
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

385
00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:01,400
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

386
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,000
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

387
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,200
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

388
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:15,300
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

389
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:22,400
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

390
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:29,800
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

391
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:40,000
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
