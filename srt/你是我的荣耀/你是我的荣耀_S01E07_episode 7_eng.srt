1
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:20,000


2
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,500
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,260
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:36,900
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,700
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,500
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,940
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:00,580
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:08,380
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:15,940
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:29,000
♫  I’ve fallen for you, but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:40,100
   

14
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,980
   

15
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,310
   

16
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,300
- Come here. 
 - Over here.

17
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,360
- Pay the bill if you are late. 
 - Yeah.

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,419
I'm not late.

19
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:13,959
We are all single. Why bother being so petty?

20
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,080
- Yeah. 
 - Come, come.

21
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,340
- Shall we toast? 
 - Here.

22
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,940
Cheers.

23
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,720
It's still the same bunch of friends.

24
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,879
Sadly, next year, not all of us will be here.

25
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,120
Yu Tu will work at an investment bank.

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,120
It's a complicated circle. 
  (T/N: world of sensual pleasures) 

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,440
He won't be as pure and innocent as we are.

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,159
Which means we will always be one man short.

29
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,720
Maybe we'll have Old Guan.

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,799
What's with Guan Zai?

31
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,040
Sister-in-law is asking for a divorce.

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
No way!

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,919
They're such a loving couple.

34
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,520
She gave up a high-paying job in America just to be with him.

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,919
Why is it not possible?

36
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,760
His model task is already demanding.

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,719
If Yu Tu pulls out of the research project, he must do it all alone.

38
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,120
He's been working overtime and hardly has time to see anyone.

39
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,760
Of course Sister-in-law would be angry.

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,439
What about the others?

41
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:09,520
Didn't they hire two new hands before I took leave?

42
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,400
What's the point of having new hands?

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,079
No one knows it better than you.

44
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:15,050
Besides, you know how fussy Old Guan is.

45
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,320
One screw-up or two, and he'll dismiss you.

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,520
Stop it, you guys.

47
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Chief Guan even showed off a loving breakfast to me.

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,999
Yeah, Big Meng. You said this out of sheer envy as a bachelor.

49
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,600
Can you at least aim first?

50
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,899
- Let me see. 
 - Okay, let's dig in.

51
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,860
Just this one.

52
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,220
Yu Tu, I recently read a paper

53
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,060
that gave me some inspiration. I want to discuss it with you.

54
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,600
Remember to keep it secret. Don't divulge our technology.

55
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,680
I'm talking to him about foreign technology. What's wrong?

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,580
What can I talk about with him in the future? The real estate market in Lujiazui?

57
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,819
Insolent!

58
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,520
You dare talk about the real estate market of Lujiazui?

59
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,420
You're becoming bolder and bolder!

60
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,400
Fine, I'm not worthy.

61
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,620
Okay, let's eat.

62
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,760
   

63
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:41,879
 We don't come here very often. Let's sing Karaoke. 

64
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,680
 - Yeah. 
 - Count me out. I don't know any new songs. 

65
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,839
 You still have me. 

66
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:47,640
 You? Forget about it. 

67
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,279
 - What's wrong with me? 
 - You guys go ahead. 

68
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,179
 I'm not going. 

69
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:58,920
 Yu Tu, are you really going to leave? 

70
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,300
 Pretty much. 

71
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,580
 No matter what, I wish you a bright future. All the best. 

72
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,980
 All right. Let's toast. 

73
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,120
 Best wishes. After this... 

74
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,559
 it'll always be your treat for dinners. 

75
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:38,159
 Yeah. 

76
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,759
 - Shall we? 
 - Sure. 
 - Okay. 

77
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,220
 - Come on. 
 - Bottoms up. 

78
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,840
 The door is about to close. 

79
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,619
 Passengers to Space City, please board quickly. 

80
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,700
Even Teacher Yu has a date.

81
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,840
While I'm all alone, playing games here. 
    

82
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,760
   

83
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,720
   

84
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,280
   

85
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,720
   

86
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,840
   

87
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,080
   

88
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,720
   

89
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,400
   

90
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,880
   

91
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,220
They really are my loyal fans.

92
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,460
   

93
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,759
Hello?

94
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,060
 Are you playing Wang Zhaojun again? 

95
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:42,299
Are you spying on me?

96
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,879
 I just took a look. 

97
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,439
 Do you want to hang out with me? 

98
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,480
Where are you?

99
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,060
You're back. Was your gathering also nearby?

100
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,199
Pretty much.

101
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,399
They went to a karaoke, but I was not interested.

102
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,500
Then where are we going?

103
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,040
To the movies.

104
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,260
How about this movie?

105
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,040
Are you doing this on purpose?

106
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,560
Everyone knows I'm on bad terms with the female lead.

107
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,800
I don't know much about your circle.

108
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,840
What about this?

109
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,399
This movie is pretty good.

110
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,120
But let me tell you that this male lead just broke up with his girlfriend,

111
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,600
who happens to be my bestie.

112
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,881
No matter how good the movie is, I can't betray my bestie.

113
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,560
You choose.

114
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,319
There is an animated film. It looks like a rerun.

115
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:09,277
Only the seats by the aisle are left.

116
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,319
Put your finger here.

117
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,959
We have to go quickly. It's in 15 minutes.

118
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:04,120
Let's split up.

119
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,959
Don't look back. Someone is following us.

120
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:10,539
Hurry up.

121
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:19,339
 You get the tickets and go in first. 

122
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,960
 It looks like I'll have to get two tickets in one go. 

123
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
 How will you get in? 

124
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:30,280
 I'll tell you after you get our tickets. 

125
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,740
 I hope no one takes his ticket. 

126
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,020
 I feel like being in a spy movie rather than watching one. 

127
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:30,479
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

128
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:33,899
I picked up a ticket from the counter.

129
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,379
No.

130
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,540
   

131
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,679
   

132
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:21,420
 Sometimes, I can't help but wonder 

133
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,320
 what if that didn't happen to us. 

134
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,300
 Did he just flirt with me? 

135
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,440
 I didn't even flirt with him back. 

136
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,217
 I'm embarrassing myself in my entertainment circle. 

137
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:37,120
 Maybe I didn't see it right. 

138
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,820
 What's wrong with music? 

139
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,260
 Nonsense! Music brought us misfortune. 

140
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,539
 - You are never to play music again. 
 - But please... 

141
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:45,700
 - Miguel. 
 - Listen to your grandma. 

142
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,279
 No more music. 

143
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,739
 Please let me play once. 

144
00:12:48,739 --> 00:12:51,040
 This is final. 

145
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,179
 Aren't you afraid you'll end up like him? 

146
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:56,620
 No one will remember him, and he won't have a place on the altar. 

147
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,059
 I don't care about being on a silly altar! 

148
00:13:00,059 --> 00:13:02,199
 - No! 
 - Mother! 

149
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:16,820
 The major I chose at that time, my parents didn't approve of it. 

150
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,620
 I'm planning to give up on the galaxy. 

151
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,759
 What a coincidence. 

152
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,999
 Won't Yu Tu feel bad watching this? 

153
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,750
♫  Remember me  ♫

154
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,390
♫  Though I have to say goodbye  ♫

155
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,510
♫  Remember me  ♫

156
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,320
♫  Don't let it make you cry  ♫

157
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,620
♫  For even if I'm far away, I hold you in my heart  ♫

158
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,530
♫  I sing a secret song to you each night we are apart  ♫

159
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,430
♫  Remember me  ♫

160
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,600
♫  Though I have to travel far  ♫

161
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,439
I will send you home.

162
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,280
♫  Each time you hear a sad guitar  ♫

163
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,600
♫  Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be  ♫

164
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,699
The movie just now, I haven't watched it before, so I didn't know the plot.

165
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,060
It was nice.

166
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:34,600
The protagonist is a fortunate dreamer.

167
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,240
You said you wanted to give up.

168
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,979
Why? Is it because of your family?

169
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:47,140
But I remember that your uncle also works in aerospace.

170
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,779
Why would your parents object?

171
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,380
You know Peipei, she...

172
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,080
I know.

173
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,679
She has all the gossip about our class.

174
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,500
Do your parents still disapprove?

175
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,740
When I went further with postgraduate study, they approved.

176
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,640
Then why?

177
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,860
A while ago... my parents came to Shanghai without informing me.

178
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,860
Rather, my aunt called me

179
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,899
asking about my mom's situation, saying, "Is it benign?"

180
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,400
 That was when I knew they were here to consult a doctor. 

181
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,960
 When I went to see them, 

182
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,440
 they were staying in a budget hotel. 

183
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:55,413
 In their room, I only saw some cookies and instant noodles. 

184
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:05,119
How's your mother now?

185
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,040
She's fine. It was a false alarm.

186
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,639
But I can't help but wonder.

187
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,340
If anything happens to her,

188
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,500
will I be able to give her the best medical treatment,

189
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,880
or have the time to be with them and care for them?

190
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,820
I won't.

191
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,899
I should be able to,

192
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,599
but I won't.

193
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,501
What will you do next?

194
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:57,360
Work at an investment bank, maybe.

195
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,481
Having abandoned it for so long,

196
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:03,879
I have to start all over again.

197
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,820
I have thought I was smart ever since I was a child.

198
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,140
But now that I'm 30,

199
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,940
I've accomplished nothing.

200
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,480
Let's go. It's late.

201
00:18:56,879 --> 00:19:00,240
 Son, we really didn't mean to hide it from you. 

202
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,179
 We called you, but your phone was off. 

203
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:06,700
 Then when you called back later, 

204
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,530
 well... all my tension was gone. 

205
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,900
 We just wanted to tell you after the results were out. 

206
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,660
 Besides, you were carrying out a mission. 

207
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,980
 Telling you would only make you anxious for nothing, isn't that right? 

208
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,740
 Besides, your father is right here with me, what's there to worry about? 

209
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,340
 Right? 

210
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,779
 The doctor said I was fine. 

211
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,240
 We are not going anywhere. It's pretty good here. 

212
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,220
 Besides, your place is too far away, it's inconvenient. 

213
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,500
 The doctor said I'm fine, we'll head home tomorrow. 

214
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,200
 She's right. 

215
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,879
 Don't worry. I'm really okay. 

216
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:58,540
 80 yuan per night, upfront. 
 (T/N: roughly $12 USD) 

217
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,160
 Thanks. 

218
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,279
 We still have an examination report to pick up tomorrow. 

219
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:17,479
 Don't keep telling Yu Tu. 

220
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:20,740
 He's busy with his work. If he can't take leave to spend time with us, 

221
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,899
 he will feel bad. 

222
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:28,259
 I didn't ask him to come. Why don't you believe me? 

223
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,420
 Say, why do we need our son to be a high achiever? 

224
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,099
 At times like this, I think that he ought to find a job in our little hometown, 

225
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:40,579
 or dabble in finance. 

226
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,980
 At least he'll have more free time. 

227
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,879
 You may not be a high achiever, 

228
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:47,639
 but our son is doing so well. We should support him. 

229
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:49,120
 Yeah, yeah. 

230
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,600
 Good thing I'm okay this time. 

231
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,100
 With the savings we have, we can't afford to overspend a penny. 

232
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,460
 When Yu Tu gets married and has kids, they'll all require money. 

233
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,560
 He returned half of the money we gave him for the house loan down payment. 

234
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,280
 I guess he doesn't have any money left with him. 

235
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,500
 Something came across my mind, a quote that describes you well. 

236
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:40,759
 What is it? 

237
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,220
 But you are already a rabbit who has seen the most stars. 
 (T/N: comes from the Yutu robotic lunar rover that is part of Chang'e 3 mission to the moon) 

238
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,299
 From Yutu's official account on Weibo? 

239
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,359
 Yeah. 

240
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,339
 I was almost convinced by what you said. 

241
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:17,980
 How could you say you accomplished nothing? 

242
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,139
Even if you want to give up your previous career and start over,

243
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:24,260
your past accomplishments are still there.

244
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,460
Although I don't know what you actually did, it must be very valuable.

245
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,750
 So even if you're not doing this anymore, 

246
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,320
 you don't have to deny the past, right? 

247
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:37,690
 At least you strived for your ideals. 

248
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,270
 This is better than you compromising when you never tried. 

249
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:43,840
 To me at least, this is not a mistake. 

250
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,879
 Do your best, Rabbit God. 

251
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:06,279
 Thanks. 

252
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,180
 You should go to bed. 

253
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,680
 We'll start doing ranked matches tomorrow. 

254
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:16,419
 Good night. 

255
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,779
 But you are already a rabbit who has seen the most stars. 

256
00:24:17,299 --> 00:24:19,019
Jingjing. I'll tell you two things.

257
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:20,860
First, Director Li has returned from abroad.

258
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,080
He's asking us to meet him at 3 p.m. tomorrow.

259
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,220
Did he invite us himself?

260
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,420
 Not really. 

261
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,020
We've kept in touch periodically over the time he was away,

262
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,679
but I didn't make my intention too obvious to him. Don't worry about that.

263
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,520
There's one more thing that's particularly serious.

264
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,779
On Singles' Day, you went to the movies, didn't you?

265
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:44,080
Are there photographs?

266
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,280
 Why are you so surprised? 

267
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,679
 Why are you so anxious about being seen going to the movies by yourself? 

268
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,720
 I think you should date now. 

269
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,499
 A gorgeous girl like you, going to the movies alone on Singles' Day? 

270
00:24:57,499 --> 00:25:00,360
Listen. As your agent, I feel ashamed about that.

271
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,299
Singles' Day is not Valentine's Day.

272
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,420
And you're actually encouraging me to date?

273
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,379
The world is different now. It's not the same as before.

274
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:10,679
Can't you see your fans are roasting you?

275
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:14,420
 "Why is Qiao Jingjing still single?" 

276
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,000
Fine, I guess this is it.

277
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,780
You're going to see Director Li at 3 p.m. tomorrow, so get ready for that.

278
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,110
Nothing was revealed about Director Li's movie except for the name.

279
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,159
How do I prepare myself?

280
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,639
I watched all his previous works.

281
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:30,839
Good, that's good enough.

282
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:33,180
When the time comes, we'll just play it by ear.

283
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,580
 Bye. 

284
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,279
Hang on a sec.

285
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,360
   

286
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,360
The pictures are not bad.

287
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:03,139
It's pretty spy-ish.

288
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,160
   

289
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:09,800
 I think you should date now. 

290
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,199
 Going to the movies alone on Singles' Day? 

291
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:15,080
 Listen. As your agent, I feel ashamed about that. 

292
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,759
Maybe I could start a relationship,

293
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,439
but only if he's as handsome as Baili Shouyue.

294
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:50,700
What was I thinking?

295
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,679
Only I can be the handsome Baili Shouyue.

296
00:27:00,339 --> 00:27:03,479
 It's peaceful at the Great Wall today. 

297
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,630
 Unstoppable. 

298
00:27:18,479 --> 00:27:21,000
Did you let me win on purpose?

299
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,839
I don't believe it.

300
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:27,739
Then why were you asking?

301
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:29,639
When did I let you win?

302
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:33,180
If you couldn't hit me with a single shot, then I would have been a failure.

303
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,780
You're right.

304
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,479
You taught me how to play Baili Shouyue.

305
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:39,880
I'm going to beat you this time.

306
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,640
 - Victory. 
 - Defeat. 

307
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,439
The AI teammates assigned to my team couldn't control the minions' advance.

308
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,479
Don't blame AI.

309
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:59,959
You were going to lose only because you kept chasing me

310
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:03,120
without farming or destroying towers.

311
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:06,959
I'm practicing, okay?

312
00:28:06,959 --> 00:28:11,060
It's time, Snow is about to go live now. Let's go watch.

313
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,540
That hurts!

314
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,060
Live broadcasts have really gone viral.

315
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,299
If I weren't an actor today, I would like to be a host

316
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:30,099
who sings, plays games, or something like that.

317
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,080
You, play games?

318
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,260
Of course.

319
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,600
I didn't play well in the past because I was so busy acting.

320
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,000
If I really want to be a professional host, I will definitely practice hard.

321
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,800
I can't just sing, or it'll be monotonous.

322
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:54,240
I can also teach everyone how to do makeup and dress, and also yoga.

323
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,580
Come to think of it, I'm so versatile. I'll definitely be famous.

324
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,579
Zhou Yin hasn't started his live broadcasts either.

325
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:04,139
You have quite an understanding of pro players now.

326
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:09,220
Since you had me watch pro games, I have become a fan of quite a few of them.

327
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,600
Zhou Yin and Snow. They're all good-looking.

328
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,090
Don't insult me, okay?

329
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,640
They are good players who also look good.

330
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,700
It's started.

331
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:25,080
 Sun Shangxiang. 

332
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,620
 It's Sun Shangxiang, right? 

333
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,739
 Don't you guys get bored? 

334
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,650
Actually, you can also play e-sports.

335
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,050
You'll surely be more popular than them.

336
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,700
E-sports have a high age requirement.

337
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,520
How old do you think they are?

338
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,220
Twenty-something?

339
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,700
The one you're watching is 18.

340
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,180
He's 11 years younger than me?

341
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,640
Isn't it 12?

342
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,040
I'm 29. My birthday's next month.

343
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,940
 I've been trying his Lightning Blade technique lately. 

344
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,040
Attention to detail.

345
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,300
- I miscalculated. 
  - His stamina should be better than before, 

346
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,120
 but the same can't be said of his firepower. 

347
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,280
The opponent is too weak. Matches are still better.

348
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:20,099
The semi-finals will be in a few days. Why don't we go and watch it live?

349
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:24,499
This venue doesn't seem to be very big. Aren't you afraid they'll see you?

350
00:30:26,479 --> 00:30:28,479
You're right.

351
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:32,719
How about this?

352
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:35,719
Let's make a guess. Will Snow use Sun Shangxiang again next round?

353
00:30:35,719 --> 00:30:39,280
If he does, we'll go. If not, we're not going. Okay?

354
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,220
It might have short-circuited.

355
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,539
Last time you tricked me into fixing the purifier,

356
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:10,060
you said you had a full set of tools at home, right?

357
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,300
Where is it?

358
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,150
 On the shelf in the storage room. 

359
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:22,120
It's the black plastic box on the fourth rack.

360
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,179
Found it.

361
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,140
It hurt my feeling when you say I tricked you.

362
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,521
How can you say I tricked you into playing the game with me?

363
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,940
So you put on an act?

364
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,939
Well, I'm a professional for that.

365
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,320
Do you really know how to fix this?

366
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,980
It's worth the try.

367
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:58,959
 Director Li has rescheduled the meeting for this afternoon. 

368
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:01,259
 I will pick you up. I brought the makeup artist and stylist. 

369
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:03,499
 Get ready. 

370
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,320
Careful.

371
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,320
It may be a problem with the power board.

372
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,600
Do you want to replace this board?

373
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,819
That'd be expensive. Might as well fix it.

374
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,860
Do you aerospace people even know how to do this?

375
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,899
This is one of the fundamentals. Aerospace is systems engineering.

376
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,420
I should know a bit about every aspect.

377
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,999
I'm also a first-rate worker when doing welding.

378
00:32:57,999 --> 00:33:01,600
 The scholar-god is just as narcissistic as he was in high school. 

379
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:10,499
- Hello? 
  - Jingjing, I texted you on WeChat about Director Li changing his itinerary. 

380
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:11,980
 He'll return to Beijing in the evening. 

381
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,299
 So we'll meet this afternoon instead. Have you read it? 

382
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,760
No, I haven't. What time is it again?

383
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,040
 Half past three. I, the makeup artist, and the stylist are downstairs. 

384
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
 We're coming right up. 

385
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:36,920


386
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:49,080
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

387
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:56,300
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

388
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:03,360
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

389
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:11,040
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

390
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,620
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

391
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:17,700
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

392
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:24,900
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

393
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:32,060
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

394
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:39,200
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

395
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:48,000
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

396
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,160
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

397
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:29,400
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

398
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:36,480
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

399
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:44,160
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

400
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,640
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

401
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,840
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

402
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:58,100
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

403
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:04,400
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

404
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:12,400
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

405
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:22,120
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
