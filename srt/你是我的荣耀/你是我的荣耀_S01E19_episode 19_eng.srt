1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:15,760


2
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,250
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,110
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,750
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,530
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,230
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:28,390
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,150
   

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,219
   

15
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,842
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Zhang.

16
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,940
You flatter me.

17
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,799
It's not bad. Just like your previous work.

18
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,300
Thanks to you, Jingjing.

19
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,719
- You performed well. That's why the sales are high. 
 -  No, no.

20
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,417
- Congratulations, Jingjing. 
 - Thank you.

21
00:01:58,417 --> 00:01:59,839
- Thank you. 
 - So humble.

22
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,534
Excuse me, gentlemen.

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,536
Ms. Qiao.

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,757
It's delicious.

25
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:30,159
Try it.

26
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,719
Thank you.

27
00:02:34,698 --> 00:02:37,297
Ms. Wang, long time no see.

28
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:39,878
What brought you here, Mr. Su?

29
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,599
Last time I checked your WeChat Moments, you were still in the UK.

30
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,539
I've been abroad due to my work. I just came back today.

31
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:48,520
And I made meeting you my top priority once I came back.

32
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:52,038
I wonder who's the important one then.

33
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,697
Definitely not me.

34
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,340
All right, I'll leave you two alone to chat.

35
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,216
Long time no see.

36
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,240
How are you?

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,740
Not bad.

38
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,617
I can imagine.

39
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:15,149
You're all over social media.

40
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:16,717
I highly doubt it.

41
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,919
Perhaps because I always click on your news that the algorithm recommends your content to me.

42
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,640
Thank you for supporting me then, Mr. Su.

43
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,820
So who I saw last time at your place is your high school classmate.

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,211
I can't believe you follow gossips, Mr. Su.

45
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,698
As I said, it's the algorithm.

46
00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:45,738
But no, not this time.

47
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:48,219
During the casual match that you took part in,

48
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,059
I was at the live event.

49
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,420
In the VIP room upstairs.

50
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,820
I see.

51
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,334
He played really well.

52
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,036
A Tsinghua graduate.

53
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,965
Was he a ladykiller too, back in high school?

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,126
Was he part of the reason why you broke up

55
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,347
with me so decisively?

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,839
Who would have thought that Mr. Su lacks confidence in himself?

57
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,380
That's because you never looked at me the way you looked at him.

58
00:04:34,694 --> 00:04:37,659
We shouldn't dwell on this anymore.

59
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,938
You're right.

60
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:44,320
After all, we have to move on.

61
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,699
Mr. Su.

62
00:04:49,997 --> 00:04:52,580
I'll leave you be then, Mr. Su. I'll join my friend.

63
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,080
Hold on.

64
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,584
One more thing.

65
00:04:56,872 --> 00:04:59,600
I just wanted to thank you for your help, Mr. Su.

66
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:02,140
If you're occupied, I'll gladly take my leave.

67
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,720
You're welcome. It was just a small matter.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,659
I have always wanted to tell you this, but I never had the chance to.

69
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,359
The reason I went to your house last time was to apologize.

70
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,079
That gameplay footage of yours was leaked by my ex-girlfriend.

71
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:33,978
Of course, that's why she's an... ex-girlfriend.

72
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,777
You are in my WeChat

73
00:05:37,777 --> 00:05:41,060
and both of you recorded my gameplay to post it online.

74
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,760
Not both of us. Just me.

75
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,639
I enjoyed watching you play. So I recorded it.

76
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,479
I don't know how she found it, and then copied it to post online.

77
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,940
I was careless.

78
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,256
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,580
Mr. Su, you never lock your own phone?

80
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,820
It was my fault. An oversight. My bad.

81
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,840
I should have blocked you a long time ago.

82
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,500
I bet your girlfriend must be upset now.

83
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,378
Do let your girlfriend know that,

84
00:06:10,378 --> 00:06:14,339
thanks to her, my endorsement contract was renewed for three more years.

85
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:15,839
Ex-girlfriend.

86
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,794
I'm single now.

87
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,690
You performed really well.

88
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,364
I'm impressed.

89
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:27,953
You flatter me.

90
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,286
If I may, would you give me the honor to take you out for a dinner?

91
00:06:32,286 --> 00:06:33,859
Just to make things right.

92
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:37,058
No need. Everything is already over.

93
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:40,748
If there's nothing else for me, Mr. Su, I'll join my friend now.

94
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,160
Wait.

95
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:49,458
You mentioned that you were still single in the match.

96
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,960
Is it true?

97
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:57,540
If it is, then, are you interested in starting a new relationship?

98
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,481
A new relationship with someone you've known.

99
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,940
I have a question for you, Mr. Su.

100
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,537
Go ahead.

101
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:12,140
You said your girlfriend posted my video online.

102
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,259
Do you really feel sorry for me?

103
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:17,058
Why do I feel like you're enjoying it?

104
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:20,198
Because someone wanted your attention so badly that she did this.

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,820
Maybe the word "enjoy" is not proper.

106
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,960
It's more like you want to see how I will deal with the situation.

107
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,217
You said you had gone to my house that day to apologize.

108
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,217
But that was half a month after the incident.

109
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:38,560
It was more like you were nearby and on a whim, you came to apologize.

110
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,478
Also, I won the match.

111
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,097
What if I had lost?

112
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:46,479
What if I had lost so badly that everyone was mocking me?

113
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,076
Would you still be here telling me all this?

114
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,239
Also, I need to clarify something.

115
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,859
I took our relationship seriously.

116
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:59,458
The break-up had nothing to do with someone else.

117
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,660
Have you already forgotten why we broke up?

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,808
I have always been curious about one thing.

119
00:08:09,808 --> 00:08:12,698
When you asked me to give up my career,

120
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:15,641
were you truly ready to spend the rest of your life with me?

121
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,278
I doubt it.

122
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,761
You said those words so nonchalantly.

123
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,179
That was when I realized that you've never viewed me as your equal.

124
00:08:26,179 --> 00:08:28,258
Even until now.

125
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,840
You're always on your high horse.

126
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,826
I can't deal with it.

127
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,383
Mr. Su, we belong in different worlds.

128
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,358
 Did Su Ye bother you again? 

129
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,321
 Listen to me. Do not ever believe his sweet promises. 

130
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:22,620
 He has a cute face, 

131
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,679
but his personality doesn't hold a candle to Teacher Yu's.

132
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,317
 Have you talked to Teacher Yu lately? 

133
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,799
You guys confiscate my phone most of the time.

134
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,714
What do you think?

135
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:36,635
You're right. You don't even have the time to sleep.

136
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,039
Aren't you back in Shanghai the next two days?

137
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,819
 When you're free, invite him out for a dinner. 

138
00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:44,519
He couldn't attend the celebratory dinner last time.

139
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,136
We still owe him one.

140
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,860
Wait, no.

141
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,860
 Tomorrow is Lunar Near Year's Eve. 

142
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,100
 He might have returned to his hometown already. 

143
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,680
 Maybe after the New Year? 

144
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,639
Wait, no!

145
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,140
Teacher Yu and you are from the same town, right?

146
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,659
You can invite him out back in your hometown.

147
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:01,540
Aren't you going back right after your performance on Lunar New Year's Day?

148
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,600
So this is why you called me in the middle of the night?

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Of course not.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,200
 I need to brief you 

151
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,000
 about the event on Lunar New Year's Day. 

152
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Where is she?

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,800
Xiao Zhu!

154
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,600
I was checking the mail.

155
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,800
We have a lot of letters.

156
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,200
Okay.

157
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,900
They're all bank reconciliations.

158
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,600
Jingjing, someone wrote a letter to you.

159
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,000
Several letters.

160
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,400
Look.

161
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,500
   

162
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,400
 Jingjing, I hope all is well. 

163
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,000
 I went back to Yixing earlier this month 

164
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,100
 and I found our chat history on my old computer. 

165
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,300
 You asked me a lot of questions, 

166
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,400
 but I replied to you rudely. 

167
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,600
 And now, I know my answers are long overdue, 

168
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,400
 but are you still willing to hear them? 

169
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,200
 Your first question was about 

170
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,000
 the escape velocity required for a spacecraft. 

171
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,000
 Can I come to ask you when I have questions in the future? 

172
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,400
 I'm just a beginner. 

173
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,000
 I've only just started having an interest. 

174
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,400
 Sure. 

175
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,000
 What should I ask? 

176
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:07,097
 Chang'e...Chang'e... 

177
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,000
 One question. 

178
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,400
 How fast should a space probe travel to escape the Earth's gravity? 

179
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
 You can search for the answer on Baidu. 

180
00:13:29,437 --> 00:13:31,277
 You guys were discussing the technological difference 

181
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,400
 between the Chinese and the USA aerospace technology. 

182
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,800
 Is the gap that huge? 

183
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,100
 The discussion in the forum is so lively! 

184
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,200
 Do you think we can truly migrate to Mars one day? 

185
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,600
 Ignored again... 

186
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,500
   

187
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,600
 When will you ever talk to me? 

188
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,200
 Your first question was about the escape velocity required for a spacecraft. 

189
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,100
 If I remember correctly, 

190
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,400
 the three cosmic velocities are within the syllabus of high school physics. 

191
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,500
 Did you not pay attention during class? 

192
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,000
   

193
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,300
 I drew a simple graph to help you understand it. 

194
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,600
 These are the definitions of the three cosmic velocities 

195
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
 as well as their principles. 

196
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,200
 You asked this question due to Chang'e 1. 

197
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:45,800
 It's different because the Moon is the Earth's satellite. 

198
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,400
 It is affected by the Earth's gravity. 

199
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,400
 The velocity required for a probe to reach the Moon 

200
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,300
 is lower than the second cosmic velocity. 

201
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
 Take Chang'e 1 for example, 

202
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
 as the payload capacity of a rocket back then was limited, 

203
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,000
 Chang'e 1 first entered the Earth's elliptic orbit. 

204
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,900
 It then adjusted its velocity several times through its own force 

205
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,600
 before entering the lunar transfer orbit at the speed of 10.58km/s. 

206
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,200
   

207
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,600
 Today's letter is a bit boring. 

208
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,200
 I don't know if you'll finish reading it. 

209
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,200
 However, the letter tomorrow will be more fun. 

210
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,500
 Take care. Yu Tu. 

211
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,200
 Jingjing, I hope all is well. 

212
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,600
 There's a blizzard in the south today, so I decided to walk back home. 

213
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,600
 I thought about your question on the way. 

214
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,200
 The gap between China and the US aerospace 

215
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,000
 is too vast a subject. 

216
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,200
 I might need a lot of letters to explain it to you. 

217
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,800
 In this letter, let's talk about the modern history of aerospace. 

218
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,200
 To be frank, in terms of aerospace,  

219
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,200
 we are still quite far from the world's best. 

220
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,900
 Sometimes, when we talk about this among my colleagues, some feel down. 

221
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,400
 They said there is at least a 30- or 40-year gap. 

222
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,000
 However, that doesn't mean we need 30 or 40 years more. 

223
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,100
 It's part of the reasons why my colleagues and I work so hard. 

224
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,200
 I've talked about the comparison between human spaceflight and the rocket. 

225
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,600
 Tomorrow, we can talk about deep space probes. 

226
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,000
 It's my forté. 

227
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,200
 The Voyager and the Yutu 

228
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,800
 have a romantic backstory. 

229
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,000
 That said, based on the post delivery speed, 

230
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
 you'll most likely receive it after the lunar new year. 

231
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:55,400
 Jingjing, will you return to Yixing during the lunar new year? 

232
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,000
 Time flies. 

233
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,800
 The third year of college is about to end soon. 

234
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,000
 Jingjing, what do you want to do after graduation? 

235
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,200
 Are you sending out your CV? 

236
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,800
 Not yet. 

237
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,600
 Someone is asking me to star in a film. 

238
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,100
 A film? 

239
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,300
 That's great! Do it! 

240
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,000
 Oh, Jingjing. 

241
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,800
 Are you in a relationship? 

242
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,500
 No. 

243
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,400
 Well, I heard... 

244
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,600
 That's what they said. 

245
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:46,400
 Yu Tu and Xia Qing are together now. 

246
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,600
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

247
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:10,900

269
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,791
 Thank you for your answers. 

270
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,616
 However, it doesn't matter anymore. 

271
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,220
   

272
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,800
Why did you put the beef here?

273
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,119
We can't finish it.

274
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,899
We will leave tomorrow morning.

275
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:00,200
Jingjing is not a big eater.

276
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,780
New Year's Even dinner is supposed to be a feast.

277
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,960
Having some leftovers brings good luck.

278
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,939
Superstition!

279
00:22:04,939 --> 00:22:07,839
Lower your voice. Jingjing is sleeping.

280
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:13,938
You're awake.

281
00:22:13,938 --> 00:22:16,698
We didn't want to wake you up.

282
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,040
What's the matter?

283
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,119
Why are you getting all chummy with me?

284
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,419
No reason.

285
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:25,960
My, my. Can't you see?

286
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,279
Who else can your daughter be all chummy with other than with her own mother?

287
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,798
Are you hungry, Jingjing?

288
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:31,160
What did you make for me?

289
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,640
- Wait! It's hot. 
 - Ouch!

290
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,480
Did you burn yourself? Are you okay?

291
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,640
I'm fine.

292
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,599
Silly girl.

293
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,339
Here.

294
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,359
Are you sure you don't want to head back together with me tomorrow night?

295
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,919
My performance will be done at around 8PM.

296
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:53,279
It's our turn to hold the new year gathering.

297
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,160
We need to go back early to prepare for it.

298
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,400
Then I should have gone back today to have the New Year's Even dinner with you guys.

299
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,757
Traveling back and forth is so time-consuming.

300
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,440
Don't worry. We have time.

301
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,700
You have a performance.

302
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,693
If you got stuck in traffic, that'd be a problem.

303
00:23:07,693 --> 00:23:09,140
Okay then.

304
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:20,219
Come.

305
00:23:20,219 --> 00:23:22,597
A toast to our daughter.

306
00:23:22,597 --> 00:23:24,279
Hope you will become prettier

307
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,619
and will find a husband soon.

308
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:30,500
I wish both of you good health too.

309
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,279
- Okay. 
 - You take care, too.

310
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,793
Don't work too much.

311
00:23:33,793 --> 00:23:35,079
A husband?

312
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,979
She is not in a hurry.

313
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:38,580
People in her field marry late.

314
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,839
Don't stress her out.

315
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,459
Since it's the New Year's Even dinner, eat more.

316
00:23:42,459 --> 00:23:43,839
Here. Come.

317
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,660
You have to.

318
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,920
Stop giving me food, mom. I have a show tomorrow.

319
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,958
I can't eat this much.

320
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
But it's tomorrow night, isn't it?

321
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,499
Just starve a bit during the day. Come.

322
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,160
Look at you. Say something nice at least.

323
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,480
Starve? No one should starve during the first day of the lunar new year.

324
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,380
You're jinxing her.

325
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,319
Your dad is becoming more superstitious.

326
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,837
- Look at his logic. 
 - How is it superstitious?

327
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,540
- Your favorite. 
 - For you.

328
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,200
- Eat more. 
 - Dad!

329
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,599
It's too much.

330
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,860
Eat more.

331
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,839
Come.

332
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,340
Cheers.

333
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,520
Sure.

334
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,039
Happy new year!

335
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,660
   

336
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,980
   

337
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:28,720
Mom, drive safe, okay?

338
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,898
Yes. After you're done, when will you arrive?

339
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:34,720
I'm the first to perform, so before midnight.

340
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,758
I will wait for you while watching TV then.

341
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:38,119
- Okay. 
 - We'll go now.

342
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,279
- Take care. 
 - Bye, uncle, auntie.

343
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,880
- Bye. 
 - I'll take care of Jingjing!

344
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,600
Good.

345
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,078
Come forward, please.

346
00:25:48,078 --> 00:25:48,979
   

347
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:52,360
 Let's welcome our opening guest, Qiao Jingjing. 

348
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:57,620
   
   

349
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,580
   

350
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:11,854
Here, Ms. Qiao.

351
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,459
No need to see us off. Go do your thing.

352
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:17,259
- Happy new year. 
 - Happy new year.

353
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:19,920
   
   

354
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:25,519
Why are you so happy?

355
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,119
I'm not.

356
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
Thank you.

357
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,960
Since you're going to Yixing, let's carpool.

358
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,680
When did he call you?

359
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,280
Yesterday afternoon.

360
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,000
Let's go.

361
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,467
You don't have to go.

362
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:27,499
- I– 
 - Stay here and keep your mom company.

363
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:29,559
It's okay. I already told my mom.

364
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:32,599
I'll come back with the driver tomorrow.

365
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,440
I guess I won't follow then.

366
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,160
Pack your stuff, then. But you always forget this and that...

367
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,918
Mr. Wang, no need to be our chauffeur.

368
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,620
I'll drive.

369
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,559
You have a driver's license?

370
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:52,860
Of course.

371
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,939
Sometimes, my work requires me to visit extreme environments

372
00:27:55,939 --> 00:27:58,719
like the desert or the snowfield. I drove for all those trips.

373
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,200
Highway is just a piece of cake.

374
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Don't worry.

375
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,380
My driver's license.

376
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:57,879
Jingjing, can you help me with the navigation?

377
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,317
You don't even know the way. Why be the driver, then?

378
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,438
Why are you here?

379
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,620
Don't you need to visit your parents?

380
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:22,415
I came from Yixing this morning.

381
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:24,759
If it wasn't New Year's Eve dinner yesterday,

382
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:26,968
I would have been here since yesterday.

383
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,220
Jingjing.

384
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:43,204
Your reply scared me.

385
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,280
I'll take a nap.

386
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,099
Okay.

387
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,580
   

388
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,616
I need to get gas.

389
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,514
I'll go to the restroom.

390
00:31:25,514 --> 00:31:26,960
Okay.

391
00:31:52,864 --> 00:31:55,238
It's late at night. I worry about you.

392
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,840
Okay.

393
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,824
So my answers truly don't matter anymore?

394
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:15,000


395
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:25,930
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

396
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:33,130
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

397
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:40,240
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

398
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:47,790
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

399
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:50,410
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

400
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:54,450
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

401
00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:01,710
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

402
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:07,110
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

403
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:15,910
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
 that we failed to treasure  ♫

404
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:23,650
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

405
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:58,850
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

406
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:06,190
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

407
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:13,310
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

408
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:21,010
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

409
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:23,690
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

410
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,690
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

411
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:34,750
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

412
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:40,250
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

413
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:49,290
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
 in the passing time  ♫

414
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:59,990
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
