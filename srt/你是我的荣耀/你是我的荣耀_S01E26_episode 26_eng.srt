1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:16,040


2
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,450
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,210
♫  My heart is like the dust and 
 couldn’t bear to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,650
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,530
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,330
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:24,990
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,050
   

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,420
Wake up.

16
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,239
They're hugging.

17
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,556
 She's leaving. 

18
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,078
 She's leaving. 

19
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,987
She even gave him a heart sign.

20
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,539
After taking photos for two days,

21
00:03:05,539 --> 00:03:08,160
even I feel like I've become innocent. It's true.

22
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,260
I'll edit the videos to make them look nicer.

23
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,878
- We can't make them look obscene. 
 - No.

24
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:14,020
- Am I right? 
 - You must edit them well. You can't bash them.

25
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,680
After observing them in the past few days, I think it's true love.

26
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,980
That's hard to come by for Qiao Jingjing.

27
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,093
I have an idea.

28
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:27,760
Later, let's check the identity and background of this guy.

29
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,040
When the time comes, let's expose the relationship first.

30
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,240
Everyone will surely be very curious about this man's occupation.

31
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,340
For the second scoop, let's reveal the boyfriend's identity.

32
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,737
Won't this week's hot news be ours then?

33
00:03:37,737 --> 00:03:39,760
I think that's good. Let's do it that way.

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,628
Let's all go back and have a good sleep then.

35
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:45,580
It's Monday tomorrow. He'll surely go to work.

36
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,213
Let's go.

37
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,677
He has a very healthy lifestyle.

38
00:04:06,677 --> 00:04:08,000
Not bad.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,920
But he wakes up too early.

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,496
We almost missed him.

41
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:13,459
Let's follow him.

42
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,580
He's coming out.

43
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,920
Sir, one pancake.

44
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,619
This handsome guy is quite simple.

45
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:31,600
He's similar to us.

46
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,288
Even that yogurt looks quite delicious.

47
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:34,469
I'm getting hungry now.

48
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:36,670
I must get one later.

49
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,140
   

50
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:51,494
Director Hu.

51
00:04:51,494 --> 00:04:54,160
 Yu Tu, come to my office immediately. 

52
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,581
Okay, I'll be right there.

53
00:04:59,688 --> 00:05:02,219
- Have some tea. 
 - Okay.

54
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,540
Director Zhang, Director Hu.

55
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,735
Close the door.

56
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,060
Yu Tu, these gentlemen are from the National Security Bureau.

57
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,663
They have some questions for you.

58
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:22,360
Answer them honestly.

59
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,340
- Please have a seat. 
 - Okay.

60
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,640
All right. Don't be too nervous.

61
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,206
We just have a few questions.

62
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:37,102
Last Friday to Sunday, who were you with?

63
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,845
My girlfriend.

64
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,968
What is your girlfriend's name?

65
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,529
Qiao Jingjing.

66
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,920
That actress, Qiao Jingjing?

67
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,520
Yes.

68
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,200
In the past three days, did she just stay at your house?

69
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,527
Yes.

70
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:09,440
During one of those days, she went out to attend a brand's promotional event.

71
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,822
We went there together.

72
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:14,662
Didn't you notice that people were following you?

73
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:19,960
According to them, they've been filming you for three days.

74
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,760
On Monday morning, they even followed you to work and took some videos.

75
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,820
Then they were treated as spies and got arrested.

76
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,612
 National Aerospace Research Institute? 

77
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:36,500
 This guy's into scientific research? 

78
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,140
 Yes, I should have guessed. 

79
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,180
 I checked before, 

80
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,980
 and those who live in his community work for the Aerospace Research Institute. 

81
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,679
 It's a confidential unit. 

82
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:46,129
 We can't go inside. 

83
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:48,042
 We can only take some shots outside. 

84
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:49,628
 Just get some materials. 

85
00:06:49,628 --> 00:06:53,780
 Let me see if the materials are enough for the second article. 

86
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,040
 Sir. 

87
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,899
 Let me ask you something. Around the area... 

88
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:04,500
 We're from the National Security Bureau. 

89
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,160
 Please come with us 

90
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
 Get off the vehicle. 

91
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,480
What will happen to them?

92
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,500
Since what they told us matches what you said,

93
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,804
we might need to investigate a bit and confirm that there is no problem.

94
00:07:21,804 --> 00:07:23,546
Then we will educate them, and they can be released.

95
00:07:23,546 --> 00:07:26,243
We already confiscated the photos and videos.

96
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,522
When youngsters date, don't go in over your head.

97
00:07:30,522 --> 00:07:33,020
Did you attend so many confidentiality classes in vain?

98
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,782
You weren't cautious at all.

99
00:07:35,782 --> 00:07:37,740
We'll pay attention in the future.

100
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,100
We'll educate them

101
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,840
to let them know what they can do and cannot do.

102
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,400
They can't just wander around taking photos outside a confidential unit.

103
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
All right. We'll go ahead.

104
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,760
- Sirs. 
 - We'll get going.

105
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,320
Stay here, there's no need to see us off.

106
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,521
I'll get to work.

107
00:08:02,521 --> 00:08:04,221
Go ahead.

108
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,180
Come.

109
00:08:14,983 --> 00:08:18,209
This is a good thing. This is definitely a good thing.

110
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:20,400
However, keep it low-key.

111
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,605
Don't publicize it too much.

112
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:25,544
Of course, this is also a very natural thing.

113
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:28,478
There's no need to intentionally hide it.

114
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:30,043
I understand.

115
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,170
Get to work.

116
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:50,520
Okay, I'm hanging up then.

117
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,680
I'll inform Sister Ling.

118
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:57,920
- It's confirmed. 
 - What about her look?

119
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,680
- We have three sets of clothing. 
 - Prepare fifteen sets.

120
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,844
- As backups. The blue label is good. 
 - Right.

121
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,309
- Hey, Jingjing. 
 -  Let me tell you something. 

122
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:08,280
- Go ahead. 
 - I stayed at Teacher Yu's house when I went back to Shanghai,

123
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,360
and the entertainment reporters took photos of us.

124
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,500
What? They took photos of you?

125
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,322
That's great!

126
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:16,764
 That's because you two are usually so open and brazen. 

127
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,180
Then what should we do now?

128
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,959
After they expose you, will we admit it or neither confirm nor deny?

129
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,921
 Listen, my PR plans have been ready for a long time. 

130
00:09:22,921 --> 00:09:25,220
 I have plans A, B, C, D. I can adapt to any circumstances. 

131
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,760
I don't think they'll expose me.

132
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,961
 Why? 

133
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:32,960
They were arrested as spies.

134
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
 What? 

135
00:09:37,112 --> 00:09:38,780
 Isn't that funny? 

136
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,559
 I wonder which company's entertainment reporters got so unlucky. 

137
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:44,799
They went to the gate of the confidential unit and took photos randomly.

138
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,980
Can they just take photos of the Aerospace Research Institute?

139
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,200
I think they're shocked now.

140
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,820
- I'll do it. 
 - Help me with this a bit.

141
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,120
Hello.

142
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,678
Hey, Ms. Qiu.

143
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:02,761
Well, I'm sorry to disturb you.

144
00:10:02,761 --> 00:10:04,325
You might not know me.

145
00:10:04,325 --> 00:10:05,890
My name is A'Dou.

146
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,380
I usually report on minor entertainment news.

147
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,139
 I usually rely on everyone's help. 

148
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:13,081
Mr. Dou, I've heard a lot about you.

149
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:15,680
Don't say that, Ms. Qiu. Don't say that.

150
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:21,740
This time, I called you mainly to apologize and thank you.

151
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,220
 Last week, Ms. Qiao went back to Shanghai and met with a friend. 

152
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:27,620
We didn't handle matters appropriately.

153
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,999
 I didn't expect that Ms. Qiao's friend repaid enmity with kindness 

154
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:31,480
 and clarified this matter for us. 

155
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,720
 We all know that. 

156
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,120
Loyalty is what matters in our industry the most.

157
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,720
Don't worry. We will stop pursuing this matter.

158
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,939
 We definitely won't expose you. 

159
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,319
 In the future, we definitely won't film Ms. Qiao again. 

160
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:44,740
Thank you then. Thank you.

161
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,361
 I won't disturb you then, Ms. Qiu. 

162
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:48,160
 In the future, if you need anything, just call me. 

163
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,750
You're too kind. Goodbye.

164
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,340
Bye, bye.

165
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,580
When can my PR plans be put to use?

166
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,800
I already spent the money.

167
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,976
   

168
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:13,980
All right.

169
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,641
Yes, that D is crooked.

170
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,842
Sister Ling.

171
00:11:18,842 --> 00:11:20,400
Jingjing is trending again.

172
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,240
She's filming in the desert. Why is she trending?

173
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,500
Let me do it.

174
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,520
No, during Spring Festival,

175
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,679
wasn't Teacher Yu in Beijing on a business trip to the Aerospace Control Center?

176
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,880
They went to a movie, and an ordinary citizen took photos of them.

177
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,419
Wasn't that a few months ago already? Let me see.

178
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:35,119
Take a look.

179
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,980
All right then. Thank you.

180
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,459
   
 A few months ago, I happened to meet Qiao and her boyfriend at the movie theater. 

181
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:41,679
 It's true that her boyfriend is tall. 

182
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,041
 Qiao was wearing a mask. He was also wearing one. 

183
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,399
 I think it was a couple mask. That kind that is a bit cute. 

184
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,740
 Did Qiao force him to wear it? Ha ha ha. 

185
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,020
 I was a coward. I only dared to take side and back photos of them. 

186
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,919
   

187
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,360
Jingjing and Teacher Yu have been photographed so many times in the past two years.

188
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,380
Why doesn't she just make their relationship public?

189
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,540
I don't think she's planning to officially announce it.

190
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,419
I think it's quite good not to make an official announcement, too.

191
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:11,199
The PR plan I prepared earlier is such a thing of the past now.

192
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:13,840
If she makes a public announcement, we must spend more money.

193
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,782
Forget it.

194
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,220
   

195
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,218
What kind of Internet connection do we have here?

196
00:12:30,218 --> 00:12:33,414
What are you checking online? Remember to use an alternate account.

197
00:12:33,414 --> 00:12:36,601
I'm not checking gossip. Why should I use an alternate account?

198
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:39,980
I'm checking the Weibo of Teacher Yu's planetary rover.

199
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,259
Didn't it land successfully a long time ago?

200
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:46,890
But they will post some photos from time to time.

201
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,115
Forget it.

202
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:00,226
Sister Ling.

203
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,939
It's Sister Ling.

204
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,639
Are you not shooting now?

205
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,560
No. We're waiting for the sunset.

206
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,900
 Is the signal bad on your side, and you can't go online? 

207
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,100
Don't get me started.

208
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,079
I can make phone calls. WeChat is fine if you have some patience.

209
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:17,800
 But it takes a lot of effort to surf the Internet. 

210
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,620
That's why I especially called to tell you

211
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,000
 that you and Teacher Yu are trending again. 

212
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,639
Teacher Yu is on a business trip.

213
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,499
We haven't seen each other for almost a month. How can we trend?

214
00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:32,840
 A few months ago, you watched a movie in Beijing, 

215
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,080
 and an ordinary citizen took photos of you. 

216
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
 I don't know why she posted it today. 

217
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,140
Then your fans don't believe it without an official announcement, as usual.

218
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,760
People are cursing entertainment reporters for being useless, as usual.

219
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,179
I am preparing to get that off the trending list, as usual.

220
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:48,551
Everyone's so familiar with what must be done.

221
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:51,940
 In the past two years that you've been dating, I've done this so many times. 

222
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,601
 I think that you two should just make it official. 

223
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,279
No.

224
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,500
 It's not suitable to make it official due to Teacher Yu's job. 

225
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,899
Besides, even if I make it official, my trending rate might not become lower either.

226
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,779
And with the way we are now,

227
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:08,300
at least the public knows that we really want to keep it low-key.

228
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,884
They'll understand it in the future.

229
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,780
Ms. Qiao, the director and scriptwriter will be having a meeting later.

230
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,820
They're inviting you to attend.

231
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,539
Okay, I'll be right there.

232
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,140
 Okay, go ahead. 

233
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,740
 By the way, is Zhou Xiaoqi joining the filming set? 

234
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,266
I have a scene with her in two days.

235
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:31,140
 Don't get into a conflict with her. 

236
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,899
Do you think I'm a child? Do you even need to tell me that?

237
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,840
 - Bye, bye.  
 - I'm hanging up.

238
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,140
Rub some on you too.

239
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,360
I'm not afraid of getting a tan.

240
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,600
 - Let's move the stuff. 
 - Coming! 

241
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:50,460
I think Zhou Xiaoqi is here.

242
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,486
Is she already here today?

243
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:57,219
Come on, let's welcome her.

244
00:14:57,219 --> 00:14:59,740
Is there a need to do that? Everyone knows that you don't get along.

245
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,279
Let's just pass by.

246
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,159
I think you have too much free time since the Internet connection is bad.

247
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:09,719
Follow me while walking later. Don't randomly look around.

248
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:21,280
I came here today mainly to familiarize myself with the environment

249
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,600
and have an idea for the filming in two days.

250
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,479
Ms. Zhou, you're so dedicated to your work.

251
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:28,999
By the way, I brought some beverages and food for everyone.

252
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:29,779
Share it among yourselves.

253
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,560
- Come and thank Ms. Zhou. 
 - Here. Thank Ms. Zhou.

254
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,380
- Thank you, Ms. Zhou. 
 - Come on, let's move these things.

255
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,360
Does Ms. Qiao often treat everyone with these, too?

256
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,020
 Reminder number one. 

257
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,979
 Qiao Jingjing and Zhou Xiaoqi haven't gotten along for many years. 

258
00:15:40,979 --> 00:15:44,220
 You must handle their relationship carefully. 

259
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,220
Well... Ms. Qiao did as well.

260
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,920
All right. I'll take you to the director to say hi.

261
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,879
- Sure. 
 - Okay, come on.

262
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Jingjing.

263
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,070
Qiqi.

264
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,920
 Round 1. 

265
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Jingjing.

266
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:11,100
It's been a while, I missed you so much.

267
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,961
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's fine.

268
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:14,979
I think you were too excited.

269
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:17,099
You look great.

270
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:20,799
After being in the desert for so long, your skin is still so moisturized.

271
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,840
 I rarely have a pimple, and you saw it so quickly. 

272
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,560
My dear, I miss you so much. You're finally here.

273
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,410
Did you become slimmer again?

274
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,259
Your waist is so small.

275
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,079
 I only gained 4 pounds in two years, and my waist increased by 2cm. 

276
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,759
 Can Qiao Jingjing tell? 

277
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,990
 Round 2. 

278
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,460
 If you kill me, soldiers will still chase after you. 

279
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,320
 Give me what I want. 

280
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,599
 Perhaps your life might be spared. 

281
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:37,759
 Stop following me. 

282
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,199
Cut. Thank you.

283
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,890
The look in Jingjing's eyes is perfect.

284
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,790
Xiaoqi isn't bad, either.

285
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,659
How did Qiao Jingjing improve so much?

286
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:05,340
She's usually so dramatic and pretentious.

287
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,599
I thought that she wouldn't be able to play this character well.

288
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,860
I didn't expect that once she's in character, she has great aura.

289
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,020
She almost suppressed mine.

290
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,299
She still wasn't able to suppress you, right?

291
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,179
Besides, I think your acting is way better than hers.

292
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:22,339
Sister, do you want to look at the script and ponder upon it more?

293
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:29,100
Sister, Mr. Chen said that he wants to visit you on set.

294
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,580
Really? Are you visiting me?

295
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,980
Ms. Xiaoqi.

296
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,519
You're so thoughtful. Look, everyone is eating so happily.

297
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,080
If everyone is happy, I'm happy.

298
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,320
There is a lot of delicious food. Shouldn't we thank Ms. Xiaoqi?

299
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,280
- Not bad. 
 - Let's thank Ms. Xiaoqi together.

300
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,539
- This looks extravagant. 
 - Thank you, Ms. Xiaoqi.

301
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,439
Don't be shy. Eat more.

302
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:10,639
Director. Do you want to eat something over there?

303
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,520
Get lost.

304
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,740
Jingjing.

305
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,060
Zhou Xiaoqi's assistant sent some food over.

306
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,700
Did you thank her?

307
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,280
Of course. I know my manners.

308
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,379
There is a lot of food.

309
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,500
They're all oily and salty.

310
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,028
I can't eat them late at night.

311
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,579
Are you still thinking about food?

312
00:19:57,579 --> 00:20:00,280
Aren't you worried at all?

313
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,140
- About what? 
 - Teacher Yu is coming to visit you.

314
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:07,960
What should I worry about? I don't have a kissing scene for this project.

315
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,539
I'm not talking about that.

316
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:14,088
Zhou Xiaoqi's boyfriend came before Teacher Yu, and he brought so much food.

317
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:18,540
Barbecue, spicy hot pot, snacks. And he even invited a chef.

318
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,360
Teacher Yu can't get defeated.

319
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,859
If you're craving food, eat. Don't waste Zhou Xiaoqi's food.

320
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,980
Who's craving food? I'm worried.

321
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:39,460
What if we ask Teacher Yu to bring stuff for the crew too and reimburse it from Sister Ling?

322
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,165
We can't lose to Zhou Xiaoqi on this aspect.

323
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,859
Xiao Zhu. At a young age, why are you so competitive?

324
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:52,981
Don't you always say that you must be prettier than Zhou Xiaoqi?

325
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,660
Today, what Zhou Xiaoqi's boyfriend did was too exaggerated.

326
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,281
Didn't you notice that the director was unhappy?

327
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:09,420
He delayed our filming.

328
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,900
If someone does that again, the director will be furious.

329
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,800
That's why it's better for Teacher Yu to come and leave quietly.

330
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,720
Besides, when I usually ask you who's prettier between me and Zhou Xiaoqi,

331
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,579
I was just joking. Don't take me seriously.

332
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:27,859
Why should we compare our boyfriends? Look at the practice now.

333
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,980
If I want to compete with her, I'll do it with projects.

334
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,360
Besides, Teacher Yu is so smart, talented, handsome, and chic.

335
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,460
Did I use him to suppress others? No.

336
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,180
Because being talented myself is the most important thing.

337
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,640
That's why it's enough for me to be prettier than her.

338
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:57,800
If you didn't use so many adjectives and that last thing you said, I almost believed you.

339
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,379
You're right. Don't waste the food.

340
00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:08,700
Jingjing, when is Teacher Yu coming?

341
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,160
In three days, around 11 a.m.

342
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,760
- Where is he coming from? Shanghai? 
 - I don't know.

343
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:18,080
He didn't tell me where he went on his business trip this time. I think it's confidential.

344
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,559
Anyway, don't aerospace workers perform experiments in places like the Gobi Desert?

345
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,819
When he comes in three days, I should be filming. Help me pick him up.

346
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,600
I wonder where he'll be coming from.

347
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,441
 I'm still very worried. 

348
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:08,919
 What's the matter? 

349
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:12,801
 Teacher Yu is coming for a visit today. I'm waiting for him. 

350
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,739
 Isn't that a good thing? Jingjing and Teacher Yu haven't seen each other for a long time. 

351
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:21,259
 But two days ago, Zhou Xiaoqi's boyfriend came for a visit. He made a big deal with his arrival. 

352
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:24,680
 If Teacher Yu comes here empty-handed, they'll surely criticize him behind his back. 

353
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,600
 I really don't want to see Zhou Xiaoqi's assistant look so pleased. 

354
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:48,563
Xiao Zhu, it's been a while.

355
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,661
Teacher Yu, it's been a while.

356
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,080
I'll bring you over.

357
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,840
 You might not receive this now, but I must tell you. 

358
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,920
 It's useless no matter how exaggerated Zhou Xiaoqi's boyfriend was. We won. 

359
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,620
 Teacher Yu's long legs and army boots made an instant kill. 

360
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,160
Jingjing, I think we should do another take

361
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,810
of you crawling and lifting your head in the desert, okay?

362
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,130
The look in your eyes is right,

363
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,170
- but I hope that your entire body movement has more tension. 
 - Okay?

364
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,420
- Okay. 
 - Thank you.

365
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,820
Thank you, Director.

366
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,139
Let's do it when you're ready.

367
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,240
Scene 38, shot 3, take 2. 
    

368
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,400
Cut. That's a good take.

369
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,160
The director said that we could rest for one hour.

370
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,330
Everyone can relax a bit.

371
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,670
Director. This one is fine, right?

372
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,740
Yes, take a look.

373
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,059
- What do you think? Are you satisfied? 
 - It's good, I'm quite satisfied.

374
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:22,239
- All right. Thank you, then... 
 - Okay.

375
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:24,400
- Rest a bit, okay? 
 - Okay.

376
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:13,079
I missed you so much.

377
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,299
Sister.

378
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,260
Is that Qiao Jingjing's boyfriend?

379
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,759
She doesn't care about people seeing them at all.

380
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:27,714
He's so hand...

381
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,020
He's all right.

382
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,560
Isn't he the one who works at the Aerospace Research Institute?

383
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,680
They've been together for two years and photographed many times.

384
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,479
Let me check.

385
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:53,979
Does it hurt?

386
00:27:57,059 --> 00:27:58,919
There's sand all over you.

387
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,619
It's fine.

388
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,400
Come on, let's go to the lounge room.

389
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,360
Look at them.

390
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,740
They're in front of so many people.

391
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,859
She's not reserved like how a female celebrity should be at all.

392
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:23,420
When my boyfriend came, did I act that way?

393
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,900
Of course not.

394
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,579
You just stayed in the lounge room and maintained your poise completely.

395
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,310
Aren't you on a business trip? How can you visit me?

396
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,660
Is it around the area?

397
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,859
If you can't tell me, you don't need to.

398
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:44,418
I can tell you now.

399
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:48,180
I just finished my mission yesterday. I left this morning.

400
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,800
Were you really in this desert?

401
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,460
Around 200 km away.

402
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,239
200 km?

403
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,217
It was so close.

404
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,080
It's fine. You just didn't come at a good time.

405
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,460
I have to shoot all day.

406
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,379
And I have one more scene at night.

407
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:08,090
But tomorrow, I can rest during the day.

408
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,570
We can go around the nearby area.

409
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:13,740
Treat it as a desert tour paid by the company.

410
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,240
Jingjing.

411
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:22,320
I must go to the airport at 6 PM tonight and return to Shanghai with my colleagues.

412
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,161
I have a meeting early tomorrow morning.

413
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:27,940
Are you leaving today?

414
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:30,979
Yes.

415
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,909
I'm sorry.

416
00:30:04,157 --> 00:30:06,576
Why are you sorry?

417
00:30:06,576 --> 00:30:09,060
I'm busy too, aren't I?

418
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,793
After filming wraps up, I must take a good rest for two months.

419
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:21,279
Okay.

420
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,660
I should have more free time then.

421
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,252
Really?

422
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,900
At least I don't need to go on a business trip.

423
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,679
You haven't eaten, right?

424
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,421
I'll ask Xiao Zhu to get us two portions of lunches.

425
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:36,612
It's fine.

426
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,948
Let's get down to business first.

427
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,780
Business?

428
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,940
What business?

429
00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:07,879
I... have two more scenes in the afternoon.

430
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,920
My make-up can't be ruined.

431
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,780
I can do it by myself.

432
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,398
Jingjing, is he your friend?

433
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,120
No. He's a maintenance worker I hired.

434
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:56,980
- Director. 
 - Director.

435
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,339
Go on.

436
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:02,160
What is he installing?

437
00:32:02,162 --> 00:32:03,819
I don't know.

438
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:05,619
A signal booster.

439
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,140
I know that. Xiao Huang, didn't we install that?

440
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,360
We did, it's that one.

441
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,579
But it doesn't quite work. It's pretty useless.

442
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:15,740
Jingjing told me already.

443
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,220
There are mixed qualities in the market for this equipment.

444
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,480
You might have gotten one with bad quality.

445
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,660
You can remove it later.

446
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,460
A bad quality equipment isn't of much use.

447
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,379
The base station interference is bigger.

448
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,660
Then will this work?

449
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,819
I think so.

450
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:30,058
I asked my friend who's a specialist to make it.

451
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:33,339
Later on, if you film in another place, you can bring it along too.

452
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:35,680
It's very easy to install.

453
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,820
   

454
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,253
   

455
00:32:47,253 --> 00:32:49,020
 I missed you, too. 

456
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:54,319
It's good to go now.

457
00:32:56,786 --> 00:32:58,677
Director, it works.

458
00:32:58,677 --> 00:32:59,979
Really?

459
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,723
It really works.

460
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:03,760
Thank you so much.

461
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,179
You solved a big problem for us.

462
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:07,739
You're welcome.

463
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,499
I'm doing it for myself, too.

464
00:33:11,499 --> 00:33:14,361
It's too long to lose contact for over ten hours every day.

465
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:17,063
Yes, that's a bit long.

466
00:33:17,063 --> 00:33:18,020
Yes.

467
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,819
And Jingjing told me that you have a lot of night scenes later on.

468
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:22,599
Yes, that's right.

469
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:25,717
 Are you done filming today? 

470
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:27,260
No, we're still filming. Look, today...

471
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,401
So what if I have a lot of night scenes? Can't you sleep if you don't see me?

472
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:33,439
I can't sleep well.

473
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:36,323
You're such a sweet talker.

474
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,040
Do you want another one?

475
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,180
Xiao Huang.

476
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,900
Hurry, arrange for someone

477
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:53,299
to treat Jingjing and her boyfriend to dinner tonight.

478
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:55,399
- Thank them well. 
 - All right.

479
00:33:55,399 --> 00:33:56,779
Thank you, Director.

480
00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:00,080
But I must reach the airport by 6 p.m. tonight. I must leave at 2:30 p.m. at the latest.

481
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,880
Are you in such a hurry?

482
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:04,819
If you're leaving at 2:30 p.m., Ms. Jingjing is shooting a scene at 1 p.m.

483
00:34:04,819 --> 00:34:07,344
Then your visit here...

484
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,900
This... This is what we'll do. Let's push back the afternoon shoot for an hour.

485
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,401
There's no need, Director. It's fine. Let's not delay filming.

486
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:16,860
I know what I'm doing. It won't get delayed. It's decided then.

487
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,339
It's decided. Thank you.

488
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:20,494
It's decided.

489
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,860
♫  You crossed the sea of stars, bringing along the light  ♫

490
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:55,620
♫  My heart is like the dust and 
 couldn’t bear to stain the hemline  ♫

491
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:03,300
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

492
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,220
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

493
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,260
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

494
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,900
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

495
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,360
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

496
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:27,140
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

497
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,159
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

498
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,379
I earned an hour.

499
00:35:34,379 --> 00:35:36,380
Can we do whatever we want?

500
00:35:38,819 --> 00:35:41,000
What do you have in mind?

501
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:51,780
♫  I’ve fallen for you, but I’m afraid I’m not worthy  ♫

502
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,540
♫  Of the future you want  ♫

503
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:12,910


504
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:22,080
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

505
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:29,200
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

506
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:36,360
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

507
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:44,040
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

508
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,620
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

509
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,740
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

510
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:57,900
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

511
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:05,060
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

512
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:12,200
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
 that we failed to treasure  ♫

513
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:21,650
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

514
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:55,260
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

515
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:02,400
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

516
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,480
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

517
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:17,160
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

518
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,640
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

519
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,840
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

520
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:31,100
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

521
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:38,200
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

522
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:45,400
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
 in the passing time  ♫

523
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:56,960
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
