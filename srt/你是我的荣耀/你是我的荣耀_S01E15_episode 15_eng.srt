00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,250
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,210
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,750
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,750
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,430
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:07,930
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:28,050
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:40,050
   

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,120
   

16
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,900
   
   

17
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,599
 Qiao Jingjing's classmate is so handsome. Their high school's looks is unfathomable. 

18
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,439
 Sir, don't you want to join the entertainment industry? With his looks, he'll be unrivaled. 

19
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,959
 He's so intelligent, and plays the game so well. 

20
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,520
 His fan base might be even bigger than that of Qiao Jingjing. 

21
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,860
 I can't accept this. This isn't real. 

22
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,199
 Jingjing, you have a good classmate. He has both intelligence and good looks. 

23
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,199
 He has good genes. Quick. Date him. Play games together and stop being single. 

24
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,639
 Stop saying that he's old. You were his classmate. 

25
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,779
 You're of the same age. He is too kind to retaliate. 

26
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:31,400
 Zhuge Liang is so handsome. He used the Bright Moon perfectly. 

27
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,240
 I'm not a fan of Qiao Jingjing. But now I'm a fan of her classmate. 

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,779
 He's an aerospace engineer who works in Shanghai. 

29
00:02:35,779 --> 00:02:37,419
 Then he must be from the National Aerospace Research Institute. 

30
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:40,579
 I know someone who works there. Let me find out more about him. 

31
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,960
 Try to remove this from the trending searches. Hurry up. 

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,639
 Tell all the marketing accounts to avoid mentioning Teacher Yu. 

33
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,839
 Delete all the posts that mentioned him. 

34
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:57,700
 We didn't get it trending. It just happened. 

35
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,800
 I know. Regardless, remove it from the trending searches. 

36
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,500
 I don't want too much attention focused on Yu Tu. 

37
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:07,260
 Why? You brought him onto the stage. 

38
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,719
 I didn't know that he's going back to the institute. 

39
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,779
 His involvement in the entertainment industry will distract him. 

40
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:15,039
 He needs to keep a low profile since he's going to stay in the institute. 

41
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,179
 Understood. I'll get to it immediately. 

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,919
 Didn't Teacher Yu tell you that he's going back to the institute? 

43
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:48,280
Why wasn't So Panicky here today?

44
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,200
Sometimes, he speaks before he thinks.

45
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,800
I gave it a thought,

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,920
and decided that it was better to keep who you are from him.

47
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:09,679
When you were on stage, you said that you were an aerospace engineer.

48
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:16,179
So have you already decided

49
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:19,279
to return to the institute?

50
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,279
Yes.

51
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,560
When did you make the decision?

52
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,200
When I was on my way to Xi'an.

53
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,399
So when are you going back to work?

54
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,759
Tomorrow.

55
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
That's quick.

56
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,860
Jingjing,

57
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:13,839
I may not be able to give you the birthday present.

58
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,639
I may not have time to play games anymore.

59
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,479
So...

60
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:28,639
I might never be able to give you the Penta Kill.

61
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,120
Drop me at the subway station up ahead.

62
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,240
It's convenient for me to go home from here.

63
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,879
Sister Ling invited us to late-night snacks as a celebration.

64
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,460
I think I'll pass.

65
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,460
I have to work tomorrow.

66
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,080
Bye.

67
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,819
Stop. Stop the car.

68
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,160
Yu Tu.

69
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,520
Will you... be in a relationship with me?

70
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,980
Jingjing.

71
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,620
You belong to the brilliant world.

72
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:11,939
And I... belong to another world.

73
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,460
We're not meant for each other.

74
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,760
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

75
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,533
I'll never ask why anymore.

76
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:11,040
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

77
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:18,120
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

78
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,740
♫  There will always be people  ♫

79
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,860
♫  Running towards eternity  ♫

80
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,420
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

81
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,520
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

82
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,200
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

83
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,660
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

84
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,279
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

85
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,279
 Jingjing, 

86
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,460
 you belong to the brilliant world. 

87
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,720
 And I... belong to another world. 

88
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,680
♫  There will always be people  ♫

89
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,800
♫  Running towards eternity  ♫

90
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,260
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

91
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,360
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

92
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,040
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

93
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,600
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

94
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,640
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

95
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,500
♫  Time does not stop,  ♫

96
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,940
♫  Remembering the time that we failed to treasure  ♫

97
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:39,440
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

98
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:12,760
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

99
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:20,120
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

100
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:27,160
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

101
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,340
♫  Will the exit of the dream  ♫

102
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,800
♫  Lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

103
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,320
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

104
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,560
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

105
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,140
♫  Looking into the distance,  ♫

106
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,700
♫  Which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

107
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:55,900
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

108
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,600
♫  Time does not hold back,  ♫

109
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,100
♫  The spring and autumn in the passing time  ♫

110
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,120
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom  ♫

111
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:14,980
♫  As I listen to the tenderness of time  ♫

112
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:35,679
Why are you still at the Base?

113
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,500
Darn. No. I... Didn't I just die?

114
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,620
Then I switched to another app and took a glance at WeChat.

115
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,200
Yu Tu did something big behind our back.

116
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,500
There's a great fuss in our university chatroom.

117
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,600
What's going on?

118
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,159
He played in a match of Honor of Kings.

119
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,619
Not only that, he did it with Qiao Jingjing.

120
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,979
   

121
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:02,920
   

122
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,720
   

123
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,580
 But... isn't this what it's supposed to be? Right? 

124
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,179
 Yes. 

125
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,579
Brothers, it's not convenient for us to talk in the chatroom.

126
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:22,960
I've created another chatroom.

127
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,700
Listen to Qiao Jingjing's voice. Don't you find her voice familiar?

128
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,700
   

129
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:41,679
I called Yu Tu, but he didn't pick up. Maybe I should call again later.

130
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,020
 That's enough. Obviously, something is up. 

131
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,220
 Hurry up. Attack the nexus. 

132
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,260
He's back.

133
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:58,100
You actually played a match of Honor of Kings with Qiao Jingjing.

134
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,000
What is going on?

135
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,220
And the more I listen to her voice, the more I find it familiar.

136
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,559
Is she the "someone you'll see everywhere on the street"?

137
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,640
 Isn't this what it's supposed to be? Right? 

138
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,940
 Yes. 

139
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,360
We'll never see her again.

140
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,380
   

141
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:27,560
   
   

142
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,860
   

143
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,060
Yu Tu.

144
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,639
Are you here to tender your resignation?

145
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,320
I'm here to work.

146
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,380
Really? Are you not leaving anymore?

147
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,879
Yes.

148
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:56,080
I need to tell Xiao Hu and the rest. Our highly-skilled worker is back again.

149
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:03,539
 Yu Tu, come to my office. 

150
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,180
You wouldn't listen to me no matter what I say.

151
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,019
But you received a call from Old Hu, and you went to Xi'an.

152
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:14,179
And you even came back willingly.

153
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:19,200
Which one of us is your mentor?

154
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:23,119
This has nothing to do with Director Hu.

155
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,019
When I was at Xi'an,

156
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,319
I thought it over.

157
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:37,739
Old Hu said that you extended your vacation.

158
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:42,900
Didn't you do that because you were undecided?

159
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,480
No.

160
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,040
There was something I needed to handle.

161
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,840
Have a seat.

162
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,499
Yu Tu.

163
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,680
Don't take what I said last time to the heart.

164
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,240
I gave it a thought.

165
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,840
The environment you live in is different from that of ours.

166
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,880
Back then, it was definitely hard for us.

167
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,219
But every industry had its own challenges.

168
00:18:17,219 --> 00:18:21,560
When everyone had it the same, we wouldn't get disappointed so easily.

169
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,280
But it's different now.

170
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,199
The cost of living has increased.

171
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,120
Economic inequality has also become more significant.

172
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,680
How can we remain in the same mindset?

173
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:38,440
What I told you that day

174
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,640
was detached from reality.

175
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,280
For that,

176
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,300
I want to apologize to you.

177
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,900
Professor...

178
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:54,100
Even though you're back,

179
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,959
if you still have doubts, you won't be able to do anything well.

180
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,500
Let me ask you one more time.

181
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,839
Have you truly thought it through?

182
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,559
I'll give my best.

183
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:11,159
Great.

184
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,459
That's great.

185
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:17,759
Our aerospace team is getting younger and younger.

186
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,780
A few years ago, in Beijing,

187
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,359
a thirty-five-year-old guy was promoted as the chief engineer.

188
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,119
I hope that you'll work towards accomplishing such an achievement as well.

189
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,700
Why did Guan Zai fall ill all of a sudden? Is he all right?

190
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,720
He said he was all right.

191
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,279
He asked me to tell colleagues not to pay him a visit.

192
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:44,540
That is just how he is,

193
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,559
but you have to fill in for him.

194
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,240
All right. Get back to work.

195
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:55,239
Oh, yes.

196
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,979
The girl I saw the other day...

197
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:01,900
My wife told me that she is a celebrity.

198
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,060
She's a nice girl.

199
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,100
What she said made sense.

200
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,080
It's also time for you to think about your marriage.

201
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,200
She looks like a nice girl.

202
00:20:14,739 --> 00:20:17,000
You should be more proactive.

203
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,900
Professor,

204
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,059
what right do I have?

205
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:32,939
With your abilities and what you are capable of.

206
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,219
I don't understand.

207
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:43,400
You're a prospective chief engineer, who graduated from a prestigious school.

208
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,500
Why do you think you're not good enough for a celebrity?

209
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,590
Is it because of money?

210
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:53,600
Let me put it this way.

211
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,830
Even if you earn tens of millions annually,

212
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,580
I'm afraid that you won't earn as much as her.

213
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,119
The aerospace industry is a very romantic industry.

214
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,820
Do you still not understand?

215
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,519
Why is there someone like you?

216
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,940
Get back to work.

217
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,420
The more I see you, the angrier I get.

218
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,540
Stop right there.

219
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,820
I forgot about the important thing because of how angry I was.

220
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:34,539
We are done improving the exploration rover.

221
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:36,900
I have something to do at the assembly department.

222
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,560
On my way, I'll go with you to take a look at it.

223
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:44,780
Director Zhang.

224
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,380
Director Zhang. Mr. Yu.

225
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,159
Let's go.

226
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,459
Yu Tu, are you really staying?

227
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,140
Yes.

228
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:03,900
   
   

229
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,220
   

230
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,420
   

231
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:41,699
Director Zhang, why are you here?

232
00:22:41,699 --> 00:22:43,340
I have work to do.

233
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,699
Besides, regarding the confirmation of the exploration rover,

234
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:51,300
the chief engineer has jobs involving other models.

235
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,219
Also, Guan Zai fell sick unexpectedly.

236
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:56,780
So we've decided to let Yu Tu lead this project.

237
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,259
Mr. Luo.

238
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:00,019
Long time no see, Mr. Yu.

239
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:01,650
He took a leave of absence.

240
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,300
Now, he has to work twice as hard.

241
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,340
- Let's get started. 
 - Sure.

242
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,300
Have you prepared the documents and data from the previous testing?

243
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,080
Yes, they are ready. I'll send them to everyone.

244
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:18,119
Look at this.

245
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,819
That's it.

246
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,480
No problem.

247
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,980
Let's take a look at the exploration rover.

248
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,171
   
   

249
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:10,420
   

250
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,100
   

251
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,599
It's been quite productive today. We have done all the confirmation in one day.

252
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,999
Here.

253
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,060
You've worked hard. Thanks for working overtime with us.

254
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,300
We're used to this.

255
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,739
Can this be delivered to the Stellar Simulation Lab by 10 a.m. tomorrow?

256
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:48,450
Tomorrow? Sure.

257
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,760
All right.

258
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,340
Thank you.

259
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,580
Bye.

260
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,180
Take care.

261
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,240
Before I realize it, it's already 11 p.m. It's another tiring day tomorrow.

262
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,720
Use this as an opportunity to lose weight.

263
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:29,680
Yu Tu, are you not leaving yet?

264
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,319
You can go first. I'll pack things up.

265
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,480
Take a good rest.

266
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:37,079
Let's go.

267
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:48,039
   

268
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:57,519
   

269
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,020
   

270
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,100
   

271
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,299
Here. We'll have a short meeting before we start.

272
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:45,759
The experiment items today are the speed,

273
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,880
the turning, and the mobility under extreme conditions.

274
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,160
Let's discuss these items.

275
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:56,660
   

276
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,810
The soil for the simulation is normal.

277
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,730
It meets the requirement of the experiment.

278
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:14,239
Start the linear motion experiment now.

279
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:22,100
   

280
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,180
First drive cycle on flat ground.

281
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,639
First round, complete. 
    

282
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,980
First drive cycle on flat ground. Second round, complete.

283
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,400
After all, experiments are quite boring.

284
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,500
I'd rather be bored.

285
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,340
I don't need more excitement. I don't want to start all over again.

286
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:00,400
Third drive cycle on flat ground. Fifth round, complete.

287
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,200
Now prepare for the slope-climbing test.

288
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,600
All requirements for the slope-climbing test are met.

289
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,710
The experiment starts now.

290
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,920
Stop! Why is it lagging?

291
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,720
I see abnormalities on the telemetry too.

292
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:41,440
Why is the telemetry data such a mess?

293
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:48,240
Let's reproduce it. Repeat the previous drive cycle.

294
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:10,119
Stop.

295
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,299
Everyone, I looked into the data of the slope-climbing test.

296
00:29:20,299 --> 00:29:22,520
There shouldn't have been an issue.

297
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,959
All of you should make sure that your standalone devices were working well.

298
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,795
There was no issue with the communication system.

299
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:49,499
The telemetry shows that all the indications were well received.

300
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:51,179
We also confirm that there were no issues with the integrated electronics.

301
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:54,279
It accurately sent the indications to the mobile device.

302
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:56,340
There should be no problem with the mobile device too.

303
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,179
We had been doing tests on flat ground, linear motion,

304
00:29:58,179 --> 00:29:59,699
and turning for the whole day.

305
00:29:59,699 --> 00:30:02,500
There was no lagging at all.

306
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,620
Send the test reports and the blueprints to me.

307
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:19,118
Let's work harder and make a thorough inspection.

308
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,780
We'll call it a day.

309
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,060
When we feel more refreshed tomorrow, we'll continue the discussion.

310
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,800
Hopefully, we can find out the problems tomorrow.

311
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,640
Otherwise, I won't get to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday again.

312
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,739
Mr. Yu, are you not leaving yet?

313
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:10,080
I live nearby. I'll stay for a bit longer.

314
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,499
All right. Take care.

315
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,340
   

316
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,880
 Let's welcome our birthday girl, Jingjing! 

317
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,619
 Jingjing. 

318
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:43,779
 Jingjing. 

319
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:46,659
 Jingjing wore a really sweet outfit today. 

320
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:48,559
 Because I knew I'm going to meet you all today, 

321
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,979
 so I decided to dress cutely. This makes me look cuter too. 

322
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:53,000
 Jingjing is the cutest! 

323
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,799
 You're the cutest and the most adorable girl. 

324
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,760
 Today, we've prepared a mysterious gift for Jingjing. 

325
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,280
 But I have my own principles of receiving gifts. 

326
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,179
 Yes, we know. Jingjing doesn't want us to spend money. 

327
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:04,140
 First, let's ask Jingjing a question. 

328
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,499
 Have you received anything special for your birthday? 

329
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:11,340
 I haven't received any special gifts. 

330
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,499
 But I believe what you all are going to give me will be the most special gifts. 

331
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:19,019
 If you bring everything onto the stage, I might not be able to carry them on my own. 

332
00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:23,819
 What do you want for your birthday? 

333
00:32:24,939 --> 00:32:26,639
 Then I won't be shy. 

334
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:28,220
 Don't be shy. 

335
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,510
 Give me a Penta Kill. 

336
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:33,340
 So far, I haven't gotten a Penta Kill. 

337
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,860
 But I want it from you. I don't want it from anyone else. 

338
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,860
 You don't have to imitate their playing styles. 

339
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,480
 I prefer to play with you more. 

340
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,764
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

341
00:32:49,764 --> 00:32:53,400
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

342
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,000
 Jingjing, blow out the candles. 

343
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,319
 Happy birthday! 

344
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:26,000

♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

346
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:46,350
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

347
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:53,410
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

348
00:33:53,410 --> 00:34:01,190
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

349
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,670
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

350
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,850
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

351
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:14,950
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

352
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:21,260
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

353
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:29,350
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
 that we failed to treasure  ♫

354
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:36,950
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

355
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:12,210
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

356
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:19,450
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

357
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:26,630
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

358
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:34,210
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

359
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:36,890
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

360
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:40,990
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

361
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:48,150
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

362
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:54,450
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

363
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:02,550
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
 in the passing time  ♫

364
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:13,270
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
