1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:14,950


2
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,250
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,210
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,650
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,530
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,330
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:28,990
♫  I’ve fallen for you, but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,280
   

14
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,180
What time is it now? Why isn't Qiao Jingjing out yet?

16
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,740
I woke up really early today. I'm getting sleepy.

17
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,020
They drew the curtains.

18
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,140
I don't think we can get a scoop tonight.

19
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,420
Let's wait a bit longer.

20
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,020
We caught them getting down from the car and going into the apartment together.

21
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,479
We'll see if we can catch them coming out together.

22
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,260
Keep a close eye.

23
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,260
 Did you use a new hero to make us lose on purpose? 

24
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,052
What?

25
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:37,920
We lost in the first three rounds, but you were the MVP in every match.

26
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,520
Who is losing on purpose now?

27
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,839
I still think you did.

28
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,985
Well, actually...

29
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:48,860
Never mind.

30
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,260
Next time, I'll introduce my boyfriend to you.

31
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,339
He'll carry you.

32
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,793
 He's amazing as jungler. He can end the game in ten minutes. 

33
00:02:55,793 --> 00:03:01,120
What? You have a boyfriend, and you didn't tell me?

34
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,200
Who? Duan Wu?

35
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,998
Get lost.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,078
Come on.

37
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,220
He's not a celebrity.

38
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,498
He's good-looking, and he's really good at games.

39
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:14,639
 He's a liar who likes giving me the puppy-dog eyes. 

40
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,759
 He's also perceptive. 

41
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,100
My sister, I don't know if I should say this.

42
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,620
Just say it.

43
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,340
 He sounds like a... scumbag. 

44
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,900
He's out! Hurry and take the picture!

45
00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:44,318
Why is it just him?

46
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,901
Where's Qiao Jingjing?

47
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,117
My gosh.

48
00:04:00,117 --> 00:04:02,197
Qiao... Qiao Jingjing is staying the night!

49
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,598
It's confirmed.

50
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,750
That's her luggage. She's spending the night here.

51
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,939
She could still get away last time by saying she went to her friend's house.

52
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,960
But we got her now. He's taking her luggage upstairs.

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,360
We have evidence.

54
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,319
The three of us will stay here all night and take turns being on the lookout.

55
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:17,620
We must get pictures of them coming out of the apartment together!

56
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,959
This is great for us! We hit the jackpot!

57
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,102
 Can I come in? 

58
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:11,002
Hold on.

59
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,850
 Come in. 

60
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,720
I'm here to get the blanket and pillow.

61
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,880
Goodnight.

62
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,200
Goodnight.

63
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,391
 I'm staying at my boyfriend's house tonight. 

64
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:08,033
 Will I be able to sleep? 

65
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,673
 What if I'm not at my best for the event tomorrow? 

66
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,061
 Are you both so full of energy that it's going to affect you tomorrow? 

67
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,101
 It's going to take all night? 

68
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,580
 I got it now. 

69
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,180
 You played the first three rounds. 

70
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,300
 The rest was him. Am I right? 

71
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,860
 Goodnight. 

72
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:53,480
 Are you both so full of energy that it's going to affect you tomorrow? 

73
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,384
 It's going to take all night? 

74
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,301
 You are annoying! 

75
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,839
 It ended so quickly? 

76
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,739
 Am I to blame? 

77
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,119
 We just got together not long ago. We are sleeping in separate rooms. 

78
00:07:12,631 --> 00:07:16,820
 That's not my fault, either. He's not good. 

79
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,518
   

80
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,820
 He doesn't know better. 

81
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,520
 Goodbye! 

82
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,140
Are you not sleeping yet?

83
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,607
Are you feeling cold?

84
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:55,672
- No. 
 - I'll get you a blanket.

85
00:07:55,672 --> 00:07:58,940
I'm not feeling cold. Why are you still working?

86
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I can't bring my work home.

87
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,163
I'm doing some translations.

88
00:08:04,163 --> 00:08:06,460
What is it about?

89
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,679
It's about the Deep Space Probe and its low-thrust orbit transfer design optimization.

90
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,000
You carry on.

91
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,460
You should go to bed now.

92
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,460
Don't you have work tomorrow?

93
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,160
You're not going to bed, either.

94
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,900
Didn't you say you haven't been able to rest for the last few days?

95
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,479
But I have to read through some thesis tonight.

96
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,528
To calm myself down.

97
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,840
I'm going to bed.

98
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,900
Don't come out again.

99
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,900
Or else...

100
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,175
Get some sleep.

101
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,519
Or else what?

102
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,699
 Send me the interview outline for tomorrow. 

103
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,620
 Are you not sleeping yet? 

104
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,779
 You can still read it when you do your makeup tomorrow. 

105
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:32,100
 Sleep early to get some rest. 

106
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,719
 Just send it to me. I need it to keep calm. 

107
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,920
You're awake.

108
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,079
You look half-asleep.

109
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,641
You look silly.

110
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:41,458
You're silly.

111
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:44,500
The pillow is too high. It's uncomfortable.

112
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,140
Why didn't you tell me yesterday? I'll change it today.

113
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,199
You asked me not to come out yesterday.

114
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,878
I think I did.

115
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,740
You could have called me.

116
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,618
I'm starving. Where's my breakfast?

117
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,780
Let's have breakfast then.

118
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,491
What time are we leaving later?

119
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:08,680
I'm getting my makeup done at the hotel at noon.

120
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,080
I haven't told Xiao Zhu that I'm at your place.

121
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:16,819
 You don't have to pick me up at Lujiazui. 
  

122
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:20,060
 I'm with Teacher Yu. I'll go to the hotel myself. 

123
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:31,057
 Qiao Jingjing, I can't believe you are at his place. 

124
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,120
Can you stop making a fuss out of it?

125
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,500
My phone is on speaker. Teacher Yu is listening to our conversation.

126
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,120
 Am I making a fuss? 

127
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,159
 You asked for the interview outline yesterday in the middle of the night. 

128
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,380
 You said you wanted it to keep calm. 

129
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,140
 Why didn't you tell me you were at his place? 

130
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,579
Didn't I tell you before you left?

131
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,020
I told Xiao Zhu to go to the hotel right away, too.

132
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,367
I'll be there after I have breakfast with Teacher Yu.

133
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,340
 Just the two of you? 

134
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,779
 No way. I'll come and pick you up. 

135
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,559
 There's still some time. Send me the address. 

136
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,115
Your house address.

137
00:12:02,115 --> 00:12:03,859
I'll send it to her.

138
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,878
Have you not had breakfast, either?

139
00:12:20,878 --> 00:12:22,454
I was waiting for you.

140
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,278
It wasn't very helpful.

141
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:40,251
Translating the thesis.

142
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,108
Her team is here to pick her up.

143
00:13:04,108 --> 00:13:06,808
Looks like she is going public.

144
00:13:11,003 --> 00:13:13,699
Her boyfriend is going to the event with her?

145
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,925
They are still in their honeymoon phase.

146
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,088
Follow them.

147
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,890
Let's go.

148
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:24,400
 We'll reach the hotel at around noon. 

149
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,459
 You'll get your makeup done first. Then, it's the magazine interview. 

150
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:30,439
The event tonight starts at 6:30 p.m.

151
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,520
Are you still staying at Teacher Yu's place tonight?

152
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,860
It depends on the traffic.

153
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,179
Last night was because Lujiazui's traffic was terrible.

154
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:46,241
So I went to his house to stay for a bit.

155
00:13:46,241 --> 00:13:48,599
Then I was too tired to go back.

156
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,518
Xiao Zhu, watch and learn.

157
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,667
Shanghai's traffic.

158
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,480
Traffic.

159
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,214
What is Teacher Yu going to do when you do your makeup at the hotel?

160
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:06,020
He can pretend as one of the staff and come with us.

161
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:11,718
Are you not aware of how good-looking your boyfriend is?

162
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,080
Him pretending as the staff?

163
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,020
Of course, I know.

164
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,179
Then why did you come up with this terrible idea?

165
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,220
I just want you to compliment his looks.

166
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:25,977
 Well, then, Teacher Yu. When we get there, 

167
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:29,079
 you'll have to find somewhere and wait for us there. 

168
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:30,580
 Sure. 

169
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,058
Actually, Teacher Yu has a wide range.

170
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,317
Just change his hairstyle, put on a pair of glasses and change his outfit.

171
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,020
He can totally pass as my image consultant.

172
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,240
Ivan's styling studio is just up ahead.

173
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,140
We still have some time. Why don't we stop by?

174
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,540
Let's go.

175
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,020
Today is the peak of my career as a manager.

176
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,539
Both of them are my top artists.

177
00:15:44,539 --> 00:15:46,539
But Teacher Yu doesn't want to be a celebrity.

178
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,380
Zip it.

179
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,181
Can't I even fantasize?

180
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,120
Sis, that handsome man over there,

181
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,600
is he your new artist?

182
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,900
He is a new staff in our studio.

183
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,500
Staff?

184
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,600
Sis, what a waste.

185
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,000
He should be an artist with that face.

186
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,300
I'm considering it, too.

187
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,600
What do you think? Will he be famous?

188
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,000
Of course, he will. He's dashing.

189
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,600
And there's something special about him.

190
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,400
Sis, where did you find him?

191
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
If Jingjing can bring him to some events,

192
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,600
everyone will want to offer him a role.

193
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
I hope so.

194
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,400
Xiao Yu, what do you think? I'll make you a celebrity.

195
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,300
Jingjing will bring you to some events, and you will be famous in no time.

196
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,600
I can't do that. I don't simply do that.

197
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
If I have to, that person has to at least sign a 10-year contract with me.

198
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
Ms. Qiao, I can sign a longer contract.

199
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,000
And how do we distribute the money?

200
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,600
I just need some living expenses.

201
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,000
All right. I'll think about it.

202
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

203
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:23,200
Sis, your company has really strict contract terms.

204
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Keep it to yourself.

205
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,500
Jingjing.

206
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,000
We prepared three gowns for you.

207
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,700
You can pick the gown that goes well with the jewelry.

208
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,400
Is she done with her makeup?

209
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,600
Xiao Zhu, please bring them downstairs for afternoon tea.

210
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,000
Get some rest. We will leave together when it's time, all right?

211
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,400
Thank you.

212
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,600
I'll leave them to you.

213
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,700
Goodbye.

214
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,400
You can change into the gown later. Get the interview done first.

215
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,800
But journalists are more sensitive.

216
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,700
And Teacher Yu is here.

217
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,200
I'll go somewhere else and wait for the event to start.

218
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,800
Why did you have to arrange an interview?

219
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
It's just a short one.

220
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,000
Yu Tu, pick a gown for me.

221
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,800
Which one do I look good in?

222
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,400
- All of them. 
 - How insincere.

223
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,600
Come here. Come and pick one.

224
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,800
This seems heavy.

225
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,000
I think this is lighter?

226
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,800
I... I'm fine.

227
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,600
Carry on. Go on.

228
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Your reason for picking this dress is very unusual.

229
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,800
But these gowns are quite revealing. You don't mind, do you?

230
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,300
I'm not that narrow-minded.

231
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,600
I'm glad, then.

232
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,400
But I am narrow-minded. You can't wear this.

233
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,700
I'm going to confiscate this. It's too flashy.

234
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,400
What about my outfit? Can I change it?

235
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Just wear it for another day.

236
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,000
Just one day.

237
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,600
It's too flashy.

238
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,800
You're mine anyway.

239
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,100
Right. I'm yours.

240
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,000
Her boyfriend left the hotel alone.

241
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,200
I suppose he's not joining the event.

242
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,900
 Do we go separately or what? 

243
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,100
Let's trail the guy.

244
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,900
I checked. The jewelry event today is a brand endorsed by Qiao Jingjing.

245
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,000
It's crazy expensive.

246
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,200
It's the same thing, but several times more expensive.

247
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
Why do women love buying it?

248
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,800
Do you think that guy can afford to buy this jewelry for Qiao Jingjing?

249
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,600
I don't think so.

250
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,400
But he should thank us.

251
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,000
They are having a secret relationship.

252
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,900
When we expose their relationship, Qiao Jingjing will have to admit it.

253
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,300
That may not be the case.

254
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,000
She may refuse to admit it and choose to break up with him to avoid suspicion.

255
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
That's also possible.

256
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,400
Well then, we are helping him to end this relationship for good.

257
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,800
We are doing a good deed.

258
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,100
Hi. Can I add you on WeChat?

259
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,300
He's not bad. He dealt with it calmly.

261
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,800
He's used to this kind of stuff.

262
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,400
What are you doing? Why are you taking pictures?

263
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,800
I can't help myself.

264
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,200
Look at this. What do you think?

265
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,400
This will be our token of appreciation for Qiao Jingjing and her team. Right?

266
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,400
Does he have a girlfriend?

267
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
He looks better than celebrities.

268
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,600
I have no idea.

269
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,700
He seems to be leaving.

270
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Qiao Jingjing's event is starting soon.

271
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,000
Let's go.

272
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,000
Hi, everyone.

273
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,600
Good evening to our guests and the media that are here to join us tonight.

274
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Welcome to our event where we admire the "starlight" together.

275
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,800
First, let's welcome our brand ambassador, Qiao Jingjing.

276
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
   

277
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,900
 Qiao Jingjing is here! 

278
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,800
 Qiao Jingjing is here! 

279
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
 Qiao Jingjing! 

280
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,800
 Jingjing, I love you! 

281
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,500
 Wifey, I love you! 

282
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,200
Hi, I'm Qiao Jingjing.

283
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm very glad to be the brand ambassador for Starlight

284
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,000
and to be able to meet all of you here.

285
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,400
 Jingjing, I love you! 

286
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm dying! My wifey looks gorgeous today. 
    

287
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,600
Jingjing, you are so pretty! 
    

288
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,500
 Jingjing. 

289
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,800
 Jingjing. 

290
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,400
 Jingjing. 

291
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,100
 Jingjing. 

292
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,600
Are you one of the media?

293
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,800
You are too far away. You can't even make out her face.

294
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,000
You won't get any views if you put up this kind of pictures online.

295
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,400
- That's right. 
 - It's fine.

296
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,200
I just take these photos for fun. Thank you.

297
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,400
No problem.

298
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,000
Please take some nice pictures of her.

299
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,500
Okay, don't you worry.

300
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Da Mao.

301
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,000
What is it?

302
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,800
The other reporters are taking her photos only.

303
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
But we are taking photos of both of them.

304
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,400
When we put up these photos online,

305
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,800
our competitors will all be flabbergasted.

306
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,600
I think I'm at the perfect spot.

307
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,200
Look. The photo, the composition.

308
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
It's perfect.

309
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,700
He's really good-looking.

310
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,400
We don't even have to label it.

311
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
The readers won't be mistaken.

312
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,400
Take more photos. This is rare. Hurry up.

313
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
   

314
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,200
All right. We will have the guests face the audience

315
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,300
and raise their glasses in celebration of this event.

316
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,800
With this, our event has reached the end. Jingjing and the media may proceed to the back of the stage.

317
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Thank you.

318
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,400
 Jingjing, Jingjing! 

319
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,500
 Jingjing, Jingjing! 

320
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,000
 Jingjing, don't go! Jingjing, don't go! 

321
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,700
I won't go in. Jingjing, you can get changed first.

322
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,000
I'll go and get dinner.

323
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,100
Sister Ling wants to have dinner together.

324
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,900
Sure.

325
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:34,100
It's your first time seeing me at a live event. Do I look pretty?

326
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,600
Yes, you do. You look gorgeous.

327
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,700
I remember Teacher Yu is quite good at language.

328
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,800
Your descriptions are unimpressive.

329
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,300
Looking from afar, you are as bright as the sun as it shines a light on the cloud.

330
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,000
Now you're showing off?

331
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But that's acceptable. It just sounds a little cheesy.

332
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,600
It's my first time going to your event, but I have a problem.

333
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,700
What's with your fans?

334
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,600
The guys and girls all call you "wifey".

335
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,400
They just did it for fun. Are you jealous?

336
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,600
Not really.

337
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,900
In the end, you come home to me anyway.

338
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,400
Come home to you? And then?

339
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,000
To watch you translate a thesis?

340
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,800
♪ I'm on a distant and quiet land ♪

341
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,200
I'm sorry, Jingjing. I forgot to knock.

342
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,200
I... I didn't interrupt anything, did I?

343
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,000
Jingjing.

344
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
Jingjing.

345
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,400
Jingjing.

346
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,600
Where is she?

347
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,900
I'm done translating.

348
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,700
Today, you're not reading any interview outline, are you?

349
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,200
I have a script to go through. You can translate it again.

350
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,600
I have no time. I need to defend my rights.

351
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,400
I just realized I was scammed.

352
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,100
I'm supposed to have three days to date.

353
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,900
But my date came back at 7 PM yesterday

354
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,700
and she's leaving at 8 o'clock tomorrow.

355
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,100
So it's actually only a day and a half.

356
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,600
Is this how mini-apps scam people nowadays?

357
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,800
So what?

358
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,600
Now that I have done it. I won't return the money.

359
00:30:01,357 --> 00:30:04,600
Usually, in this case,

360
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,500
the developer will offer some compensation.

361
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,800
For instance, open up a new area.

362
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,100
It's surprising to hear this from you.

363
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,900
I didn't know you are such a hooligan.

364
00:30:21,434 --> 00:30:23,600
What are you thinking?

365
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,400
I mean my bedroom.

366
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,400
And that's being decent?

367
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,100
No.

368
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,300
Is it okay?

369
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,600
You have been away for so long. I can't wait anymore.

370
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,900
Besides the pillow,

371
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,300
what are the other things that you can't get used to?

372
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,800
You.

373
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,600
There's nothing I can do about that.

374
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,700
You will get used to it.

375
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,800
How is this pillow height?

376
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,700
What do you think?

377
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Don't move.

378
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,600
How do you like it?

379
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,900
What about this?

380
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,300
No.

381
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,600
I'll make it lower.

382
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,900


383
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,200
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

384
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,400
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

385
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:29,600
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

386
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:37,300
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

387
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,800
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

388
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,000
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

389
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,000
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

390
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,300
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

391
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:05,400
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

392
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:14,000
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

393
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:48,400
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

394
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:55,600
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

395
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,600
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

396
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:10,200
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

397
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,000
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

398
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

399
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:24,200
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

400
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:31,400
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

401
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:38,600
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

402
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:48,900
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
