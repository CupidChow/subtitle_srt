2
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,300
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,260
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:36,900
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,600
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,500
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,940
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:00,580
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:08,480
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:15,940
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:28,100
♫  I’ve fallen for you, but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:40,200
   

14
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,080
   

15
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,640
 What do you want for breakfast? 

16
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,740
 Anything. 

17
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,000
 Are you awake? 

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I already bought it. 

19
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,960
 Thanks, Teacher Yu. 

20
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,951
 Jingjing, I suppose I don't have to buy you breakfast again today? 

21
00:02:35,951 --> 00:02:39,554
Are you asking me now? Stop playing dumb.

22
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:41,300
 I just woke up. 

23
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,600
 Teacher Yu took my job, so I quickly adopted the habit of sleeping in. 

24
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,320
He sent me a message on WeChat and said he had already bought breakfast.

25
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,020
He should arrive soon.

26
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,120
However, what he bought these two days is high in calories.

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,280
I gave him an earful yesterday. I wonder if he'll learn today.

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,320
 Jingjing, did you notice that ever since you gave Teacher Yu that bottle of wine, 

29
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,099
 he started to behave differently? 

30
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:12,440
 He'll ask you if you want breakfast or not. 

31
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,479
Isn't it to be expected?

32
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,939
I was drinking with him that day.

33
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:20,659
I'm such a considerate person. He must have been touched by my kindness.

34
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,659
 Really? 

35
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,600
 You were clearly busy posting selfies in the group chat that day. 

36
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,320
 There are at least ten selfies. 

37
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,060
 Let me count them. 

38
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,320
You don't understand. That's how I make him relax.

39
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,540
It's hard for me to explain it to someone who doesn't share my high EQ (Emotional Quotient).

40
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,660
I have to go now. I'm trying to figure out how to brew coffee. See you!

41
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,760
   

42
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,580
   

43
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,359
The calories of today's breakfast should be within your limits.

44
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,620
What a quick learner! As expected from a top student.

45
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,160
I simply used addition...

46
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,180
By the way, I made you coffee. It's in the kitchen.

47
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,760
Get it yourself.

48
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,580
I feel like I got the disadvantage.

49
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,800
How so?

50
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,240
I came all the way to bring you breakfast,

51
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,742
and I had to get the coffee myself too.

52
00:04:48,742 --> 00:04:50,810
But I brewed the coffee.

53
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,600
I even drew something on the foam.

54
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,025
I can't tell what you drew,

55
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:02,025
but I appreciate it.

56
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,962
Wait!

57
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:07,210
Can't you tell it's a rabbit?

58
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,190
It's so obvious those two on the top are ears.

59
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:19,705
I was wondering

60
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:22,525
why you drew three parabolas.

61
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,440
You lack artistic perception.

62
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,365
Should we matchmake on 5v5 today?

63
00:05:34,365 --> 00:05:37,939
You have been playing for a while. Which heroes do you like?

64
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:42,060
Wang Zhaojun, Angela, Donghuang Taiyi, Cai Wenji, Yu Ji,

65
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,080
and Luban No. 7. They are all good.

66
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,839
But my favorites have to be Zhuge Liang and Li Bai.

67
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:50,119
They are the flashiest in the Valley.

68
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:54,193
You can't use heroes with high mobility.

69
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,047
Judging from the matches these few days, you should avoid Jungler.

70
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:05,700
During the casual match, find a professional jungler.

71
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,859
The positions that suit you the most are mid and bottom.

72
00:06:09,859 --> 00:06:12,333
So Marksman, Mage, and Support.

73
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,559
For Mage, you can use Angela, Ganjiang Moye, or Xiao Qiao.

74
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:18,680
They have long ranges so they suit your play style.

75
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:21,215
As for Support,

76
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:25,000
you can go for Donghuang Taiyi, Zhang Fei, Niumo, or Zhuang Zhou.

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,120
They are very forgiving.

78
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,080
Zhang Fei?

79
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,899
He has simple abilities. Very easy to use.

80
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,720
As for Marksman,

81
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,020
do you like Yu Ji?

82
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:44,000
Her skill 3 is useful. Her skill 2 allows me to run for my life.

83
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:48,939
You sure run very quickly, though.

84
00:06:49,714 --> 00:06:51,414
A compliment?

85
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,719
You never leave other players high and dry, but you drop me like a hot potato.

86
00:06:57,433 --> 00:07:01,854
I have always wanted to know what you're thinking.

87
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,679
I just have faith in you.

88
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:08,985
Thank you.

89
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,061
But they are not flashy enough. Not cool enough.

90
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:34,460
If you want someone flashy, you can consider another hero for Marksman.

91
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,920
Which one?

92
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,360
Baili Shouyue.

93
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,700
 Defeat. 

94
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,780
His abilities are flashy. Long-range sniping.

95
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,040
But are you sure that I can play him well?

96
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,630
Your aim is good.

97
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,971
You hit the enemy with Yu Ji's skill 1 quite consistently.

98
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:18,320
You had a bad game just now because, one, your teammates took resources from you and

99
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,379
two, you need to sidestep better.

100
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:24,010
Yu Ji and Baili Shouyue require kiting,

101
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,290
but they are not as demanding as Sun Shangxiang and Marco Polo.

102
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:29,525
You can still use them.

103
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:32,486
But for the latter two, you...

104
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:34,378
I don't have any word for it.

105
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,559
You really have a vicious tongue, you know.

106
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,620
Your comments regarding my Nakoruru last time are circulating in the office thanks to Xiao Zhu.

107
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:44,283
What did I say?

108
00:08:44,283 --> 00:08:47,382
Feeder and suicidal.

109
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,700
I was just describing it objectively.

110
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,720
You still dare to laugh?

111
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,100
Other than sidestepping, you also lack awareness.

112
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,808
You always ask a lot of questions while you're playing.

113
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:06,170
Such as?

114
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,395
Where should I go?

115
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:08,740
What should I do?

116
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,980
Should I use my ultimate skill?

117
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,170
From now onward, we'll spend half a day practicing,

118
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,250
and another half watching pro games.

119
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:24,680
Before the match, you need to come up with a basic overview of both parties' composition.

120
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,584
Are they early game-focused or late game-focused?

121
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:29,349
What will they do? What will you do?

122
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:31,314
Start with the red buff or the blue buff?

123
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:34,273
Any early invasion? These are all strategies.

124
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,100
What's the general idea?

125
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Do you have a pen and paper?

126
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,140
   

127
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,900
   

128
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,180
♫  That anticipated and sweet moment  ♫

129
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,160
♫  It is when I can entrust my heart in your hands  ♫

130
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,100
♫  Missing that moment and someone  ♫

131
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,080
   
   

132
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,380
   

133
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,880
   

134
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,400
♫  My heart is yours, baby, heart is yours  ♫

135
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,500
♫  Fall in love with you  ♫

136
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,499
The only difference is that you need to clear minions before level four.

137
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,180
Do you understand now?

138
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,687
At night, watch some pro games and try it out.

139
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:45,092
If you can predict what they will do next, then you'll pass this test.

140
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,820
Is that considered passing?

141
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,420
I kind of hate you now.

142
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:56,575
What?

143
00:10:56,575 --> 00:11:01,980
I mean, you're merciless, demanding, and deadly serious.

144
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,760
If you had taught me math in high school, I could have gotten into Tsinghua, too.

145
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:11,553
What was your result in the National College Entrance Exam?

146
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,001
How dare you ask me this question?

147
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,930
Mine was like 70 or 80 points lower than yours.

148
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,640
Your score was too high anyway.

149
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,660
If I got into Tsinghua, I would have been one of the smartest actresses.

150
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,799
My fans would be over the moon.

151
00:11:35,511 --> 00:11:41,731
If your fans knew that you want to get into Tsinghua for them, they would be really happy.

152
00:11:44,823 --> 00:11:47,103
It's not because of...

153
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,901
Let's call it a day. I'll head back now.

154
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:55,030
All right. Take care. I won't see you out.

155
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,420
Crystal (shuijing) and I are tired now.

156
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,039
I think Crystal is fine. See you tomorrow.

157
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,640
I have to go to Jiangsu tomorrow for the Double 11 Celebration. I'd like to take a day off. 
  (T/N: Double 11 is November 11) 

158
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,020
Okay.

159
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,670
You can watch my performance.

160
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,140
I'll sing but my slot is quite late.

161
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,140
Send me a message before you perform then.

162
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,304
Do I even have to remind you? Who are you, a VIP?

163
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,965
Respect your teacher.

164
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:26,005
All right, Teacher Yu.

165
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,520
See you!

166
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,220
   

167
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,000
   

168
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,700
   

169
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,580
Why are you still here?

170
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,946
What have you been up to recently?

171
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,499
You always sneak out early in the morning and then come back late.

172
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:11,952
I went out to be a teacher.

173
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,652
What?

174
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:17,066
Nothing.

175
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,811
Are you heading out now?

176
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,481
Why are you so mysterious?

177
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:27,780
Didn't I tell you already? I'll be hanging out with Dragon King for a few days.

178
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,570
Join us.

179
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:31,151
- Hangzhou? 
 - Yes.

180
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:33,878
Let's go have some good food and good times.

181
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:35,898
I'm not as free as you.

182
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:38,780
Your breakfast. Eat it on the way.

183
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,841
Why are you being so weird?

184
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:46,106
See you then.

185
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,699
 Are you free tonight? Let's have dinner together. 

186
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:26,920
 Sure. 

187
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,320
 Does 6 p.m. sound good to you? Something western? 

188
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,920
 I'm fine with anything. 

189
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,940
 I also have some questions regarding aerospace materials. 

190
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
 Okay. 

191
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:21,980
   

192
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,820
Beautiful.

193
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,940
I dare say that if Jingjing wears this gown, she'll look even better than the supermodels.

194
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,680
Of course, your fans haven't seen you for half a month.

195
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,560
You need to surprise them tonight.

196
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,960
You look so good.

197
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,640
I suddenly feel like I'm a female celebrity.

198
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,600
Who else can you be then?

199
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,353
An emotionless gaming machine.

200
00:17:24,353 --> 00:17:28,160
An emotionless lost soul in the Valley of Kings, wandering around the map.

201
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,960
Speaking of which, now that the rehearsal is over, we have a couple of hours before your performance.

202
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,200
It's a perfect time for you to practice.

203
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,000
No, I want to take a break today. Give me the phone.

204
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,911
I will never open Honor of Kings. I'm just watching the live broadcasts.

205
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:45,872
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes. I won't press on that icon.

206
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,833
When you put it this way, it becomes clearer.

207
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,777
I haven't really researched this area.

208
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:59,458
It seems like you have covered more ground.

209
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:03,800
If you want, I can send some latest research papers to you when I get home.

210
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,437
Yes, please. Let me brush up on this area.

211
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:10,480
That said, I really hope that you can join my team soon.

212
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,400
That way, I can relax a bit.

213
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,916
We have at least two projects pertaining to this field next year.

214
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:20,699
We need an analyst who's well-versed in this area.

215
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:24,017
This area has become popular recently.

216
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:28,460
Truth be told, we have candidates who fulfill our requirements,

217
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,660
but personally, I want you to join my team.

218
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,770
After all, we're friends. Right?

219
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:39,439
Also, you said that you told your professor that you'd think this through this month.

220
00:18:39,439 --> 00:18:40,880
I won't rush you.

221
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,800
Once you make up your mind, tell me.

222
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,680
Today is just a friendly get-together.

223
00:18:50,391 --> 00:18:53,392
Thanks, Senior Brother.

224
00:18:53,392 --> 00:18:55,817
No need to be so polite with me. Come.

225
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:59,298
Here's hoping that you'll be returning to Earth soon.

226
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,080
   

227
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,360
 Are you there? 

228
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,185
 Yes. 

229
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,097
 I'm bored. Let's play a game. 

230
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:20,546
 I'm having dinner with my Senior Brother. I need 30 more minutes. 

231
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,149
Junior Brother, you're still the ladies' man.

232
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,040
Do you know that when you came to my office that day,

233
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,480
the girls in my company kept pestering me to know

234
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,345
who was this handsome guy, where is he from?

235
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:44,559
When they knew that you might be a new colleague, they all went ballistic.

236
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,360
It was just like back then when you joined the soccer team.

237
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,980
After you joined the team, everyone in the school had their eye on us.

238
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,960
My effort in persuading you to join us paid off.

239
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,685
So the reason you asked me to join the team was not for my skills?

240
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:03,990
Skills. Of course, it was your skills.

241
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,189
Good looks are also a skill.

242
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,480
Let's talk about your private life then.

243
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,724
When I met Sandbag that day, he told me that you're still single.

244
00:20:15,724 --> 00:20:21,044
How can someone like you remain single? How is that right?

245
00:20:23,061 --> 00:20:24,005
 Okay. 

246
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:27,106
 Let me know when you're done. I'll play on my own first. 

247
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,960
I'm still single.

248
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,045
It's good to be single. No need to find a girlfriend now.

249
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:37,605
Soon, you'll be in even higher demand.

250
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,320
Oh, right, do you have any plans after this meal?

251
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,880
Do you want to grab a drink with my friends in the bar next door?

252
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,110
I won't be going. Next time, perhaps.

253
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,740
I have plans later.

254
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:53,207
I knew it. The nightlife of a handsome guy is always eventful.

255
00:20:53,207 --> 00:20:54,952
All right then. I'll let you be.

256
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:59,291
I'll just let my female colleagues return home disappointed.

257
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,960
Cheers.

258
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,520
   
   

259
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,135
What are you doing?

260
00:21:14,135 --> 00:21:16,560
It'll be fine. We still have time.

261
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,410
Teacher Yu told me to practice when I have time. Can I say no?

262
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,200
I can't.

263
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,559
 Thirty minutes have passed. 

264
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,540
 Almost. 

265
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,180
   

266
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,560
   

267
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,753
So punctual. Did you guys finish your dinner?

268
00:21:57,753 --> 00:21:59,120
Yes.

269
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,840
 Are you still in the restaurant? Did your senior brother leave? 

270
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,080
Yes. He went to drink at a bar.

271
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,600
Didn't he take you? Poor thing.

272
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,560
I know, right? He didn't take me.

273
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,220
- Let me try Niumo this round. You'll play Marksman. 
  - Sure. 

274
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,060
Oh, I accidentally enabled the team's voice chat.

275
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,140
   

276
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,300
   

277
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,900
   

278
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,439
   

279
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:24,680
I think Niumo is harder to use than Zhang Fei.

280
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,600
I don't know where to place my ultimate skill.

281
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,759
Just do your best.

282
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:29,279
You'll win anyway.

283
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,759
I'll record it.

284
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:33,539
Will you then use it as teaching material for me?

285
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:34,740
Yes.

286
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,581
I knew it.

287
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,719
   

288
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:49,260
 Marco, why do I feel like your girlfriend is worse than my girlfriend? 

289
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,521
It's not like you're as good as my boyfriend.

290
00:22:57,199 --> 00:23:01,419
 I can't lose in an argument. Don't mind it. 

291
00:23:01,419 --> 00:23:05,080
Settle down. He is playing Marksman. I'm not familiar with Li Bai.

292
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:08,400
Let me invite you next game and show you how a good Marco looks like.

293
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,340
You can do it, darling.

294
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:15,920
Stop arguing or I'll leave.

295
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,239
Today is the Double 11 Festival, the day of singles.

296
00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:20,279
Couples are everywhere.

297
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:24,360
I decided to stay home, play some games, and yet, I found two couples.

298
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,759
I'm done. I'll leave now.

299
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:29,840
Wait, you got the date wrong.

300
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,032
Double 11 is tomorrow. Today is the 10th.

301
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,379
- Really? 
 - Yes.

302
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,639
Then I'll play one more game.

303
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:47,479
Thanks.

304
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,520
 Double Kill! 

305
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,519
You won!

306
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:56,420
   

307
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,340
   

308
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,340
   

309
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:10,719
Gaming is exhausting nowadays. You even have to coax those singletons.

310
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,719
   

311
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,760
The Li Bai from the previous round invited you.

312
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,479
In the last round, Teacher Yu's Marco was the MVP.

313
00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:21,520
Does he want to show off his Marco, too?

314
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,320
Men are so childish.

315
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,199
What are you guys talking about? Seems interesting.

316
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,380
Let me see.

317
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,279
   

318
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:32,619
Why did your boyfriend reject my invitation? Did he chicken out?

319
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,619
Hold on.

320
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,680
   

321
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,920
   

322
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,580
 Invite me. 

323
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,380
   

324
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,520
I knew he wanted to show off his Marco. Teacher Yu chose Li Bai.

325
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,680
Then this is war. They swapped heroes.

326
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,400
Look how excited you are.

327
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,719
Why did you disable the voice chat?

328
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:11,980
I'm worried that Teacher Yu would put on a great show and you guys start fangirling.

329
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,460
Is his Li Bai that good?

330
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,679
I have never seen him play Li Bai in 5v5.

331
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,359
Technically, he's a talented player, especially with those mobile heroes.

332
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:25,800
Li Bai? You're provoking us then.

333
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:29,699
 I rarely use him. Just want to try him out. 

334
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:32,020
 You can do this, Darling. 

335
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,339
All the best, Boyfriend!

336
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,900
   

337
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,280
   

338
00:25:40,199 --> 00:25:42,339
Two couples, I see.

339
00:25:43,439 --> 00:25:45,760
Stay strong. Don't leave the keyboard.

340
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,059
I won't. I have a cat.

341
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,340
 An ally has been slain! 

342
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,980
 Double Kill! 

343
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,910
 Double Kill! 

344
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,860
 A song for the end of the world. 

345
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,000
 Willing to be drunk forever... 

346
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,140
 Legendary! 

347
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,680
 Double Kill! 

348
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,800
 Triple Kill! 

349
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:30,940
 Quadra Kill! 

350
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,640
 In this vast dream, I remain wide awake. 

351
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,520
 Penta Kill! 

352
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,290
Teacher Yu's Li Bai is so good.

353
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,630
Penta Kill!

354
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,120
Sit down. This is nothing.

355
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,110
This hurts my pride.

356
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,310
It's okay, Darling. You're the best.

357
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,720
- You can do this. 
 - Triple Kill.

358
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,160
   

359
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:05,240
 Aced. 

360
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,620
 Victory! 

361
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:16,008
Cheer up. We won.

362
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,859
Teacher Yu made up 40% of our damage output. 
    

363
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:26,000
Not bad, Teacher Yu.

364
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,999
Has A'Guo ever gotten a Penta Kill before?

365
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,141
He never mentioned it.

366
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,420
 You're so naughty. 

367
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,840

Let's review this part.

376
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,479
You engaged too early. Your teammates were behind you.

377
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,279
Can you see?

378
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,819
I used Marco Polo so I could follow up.

379
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:46,620
But if I used a short-range Marksman...

380
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,740
Niumo is more suitable for counter-engage.

381
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:55,439
 So why did you recall the message yesterday? 

382
00:29:59,239 --> 00:30:00,660
Come.

383
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,039
Let's watch two pro games where they used Niumo.

384
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:06,800
 It's Singles' Day. I'm already single. 

385
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,339
 And I have to practice on a holiday like today. Let me at least use a cool hero. 

386
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:12,580
 Niumo is so ugly. 

387
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,040
 Real man! 

388
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,120
How they cooperated with each other,

389
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,939
do you understand now?

390
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:27,199
Yes.

391
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,360
So what did they do then?

392
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:35,679
I...

393
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,260
This screen is too small. I can't view the team fights clearly.

394
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,499
I remember I have a multimedia room. Should we watch it again there?

395
00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:45,860
Not bad.

396
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,359
Your reflex when looking for an excuse has reached the level of an assassin.

397
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:52,080
Let's call it a day.

398
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,880
I have a gathering with my colleagues tonight. I have to leave soon.

399
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,300
I'll check out the multimedia room tomorrow.

400
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,620
You have a lot of gatherings.

401
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,781
Is that not normal?

402
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,500
Also, they said it's to celebrate Singles' Day.

403
00:31:19,668 --> 00:31:22,160
They said they want to ask me something about work.

404
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,060
Go ahead then.

405
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,980
Practice Supports like Niumo and Zhang Fei. Understood?

406
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,260
Yes.

407
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,280
He's out there having fun but still gives me homework.

408
00:31:40,054 --> 00:31:42,180
How nice would it be if I could hang out with you.

409
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,320
Are you sure you would come with me if I asked?

410
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,919
Have fun!

411
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:00,413
Bye.

412
00:32:00,413 --> 00:32:02,013
See you tomorrow.

413
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:30,060
