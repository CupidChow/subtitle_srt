1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:17,960


2
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,250
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,110
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:36,850
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,650
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,450
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,890
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,430
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:08,530
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:28,050
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:40,050
   

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,460
   

16
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,779
 I'm really feeling the vibe of New Year in Xi'an. 

17
00:02:03,779 --> 00:02:05,979
 Look, it's so beautiful. 

18
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,240
Tomorrow, in Chongqing, there will be another road show.

19
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,319
On New Year's Day, the day after tomorrow, your movie will officially be released.

20
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,320
We'll be flying to Beijing to attend the premiere.

21
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,619
Afterward, you have two other road shows in Wuhan and Nanjing.

22
00:02:20,619 --> 00:02:23,699
Nanjing is close to Shanghai. Do you want to go back and rest a bit?

23
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:26,560
After getting busy with your next schedule, you won't have time to go back anymore.

24
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,680
What activities are scheduled next?

25
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,439
A few interviews, a magazine shoot,

26
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,000
and a shoot for an advertisement.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Before Spring Festival, the platform has a few awarding ceremonies that you must attend,

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,319
but they're all in Beijing.

29
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,680
I won't go back to Shanghai then. I'll fly directly to Beijing.

30
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,879
Okay.

31
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,980
We have time for the Spring Festival Gala on the first day of the lunar new year.

32
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,380
Let's attend then.

33
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,919
Is the schedule for filming on the set of Director Li's movie confirmed?

34
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,759
The fifth day of the lunar new year is the time for the table read and test shoot.

35
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,280
And the eighth day of the lunar new year is when you will officially start shooting.

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,680
If some work can be done before going to the film set,

37
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,319
let's do them all.

38
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:01,400
I don't want to keep taking leaves while filming.

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,520
Okay. By the way, there's an event in April that I think you'll be interested in.

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,600
- What is it? 
 - April 24 is Space Day.

41
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,800
It's probably because you posted something about the aerospace tech air purifier for civilian use

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,000
so the organizer invited you to join their gala.

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,420
When you come back after I leave,

44
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,680
I won't be here to give you a passionate welcome anymore.

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,280
Don't miss me.

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,860
I'm going on a business trip for a month soon.

47
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,080
I don't have time to miss you.

48
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,961
Can you show me some respect?

49
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,719
I may not know what exactly happened between you and Cotton,

50
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,659
but who are you? You're our Tu God.

51
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,319
You shouldn't live this way.

52
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,000
Come on. I'll see you off.

53
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,300
   

54
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,580
- It must have been hard on you. 
 - Thank you.

55
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,380
Bye.

56
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,600
What do you think about the Space Day Gala?

57
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,830
I must give them a reply.

58
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,800
Sure, why not? I'm honored to be invited.

59
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,040
Okay. I'll say yes to them then.

60
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,240
I think this is quite good. It's quite positive for your image.

61
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,600
Besides, you might see Teacher Yu there.

62
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,379
Teacher Yu is so talented. Perhaps he'll be a special guest or something.

63
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,560
Maybe.

64
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,220
At the celebration party last time, Teacher Yu didn't attend.

65
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,820
If you have time later on, treat Teacher Yu to a meal.

66
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,520
We'll see.

67
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,257
- My luggage. 
 - Here.

68
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:22,380
- Good night. 
 - Get some rest.

69
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,760
- Good night. 
 - Good night.

70
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:04,860
♫  Looking back in time and meeting the past again  ♫

71
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:12,020
♫  I write down the greetings I owe you in my heart  ♫

72
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:19,180
♫  Trying to piece together the reason for my longing  ♫

73
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,940
♫  It's the look in your eyes at a moment in my memories  ♫

74
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:33,380
♫  How long have you been alone in the crowd?  ♫

75
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:40,620
♫  I'm used to drifting in the starry sky and the universe  ♫

76
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:47,800
♫  At the place where two worlds converge  ♫

77
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,720
♫  Can I hold your hand tightly?  ♫

78
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,260
♫  Today can we agree  ♫

79
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,220
♫  For me to tell you everything  ♫

80
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,540
♫  The questions I want to answer  ♫

81
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,860
♫  In the sea of people  ♫

82
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,780
♫  I turned around and returned to a familiar scene  ♫

83
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,940
♫  For your sake  ♫

84
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,040
♫  I'm back in the light  ♫

85
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,940
♫  Today can you feel it  ♫

86
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,060
♫  The stars in the sky can attest  ♫

87
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:40,540
   

88
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,280
♫  In my dream  ♫

89
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,320
♫  Carved in my memories  ♫

90
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,680
♫  Is your courage that makes me want to treasure it  ♫

91
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,480
Coming.

92
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,659
- Mom. 
 - Yu Tu. Why are you home?

93
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:11,080
Old Yu, hurry, our son is home.

94
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,360
Dad.

95
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,679
Didn't you just come back in October? Why are you back again?

96
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,080
I have to go on a business trip for a month soon.

97
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,340
I'm not sure how the signal is there so I came home for a visit.

98
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,519
For Lunar New Year's Eve this year, will you be able to make it home?

99
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,519
Yes.

100
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,919
That's good. Great.

101
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,759
That's great. I'll go and buy some cooked food.

102
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,000
Why?

103
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,960
Our son is back. He must eat freshly-cooked food.

104
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,440
Buy his favorites.

105
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,519
Shrimp, fish, and chicken.

106
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,160
- Buy them all. 
 - Okay, I got it.

107
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,600
Come on.

108
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,840
Let me take a look at you.

109
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Why have you grown thinner again? Weren't you eating properly?

110
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,660
I've been eating quite well.

111
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,720
You brat.

112
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,359
Here you go.

113
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,520
Stir-fried shredded potatoes.

114
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,879
Here. Drink some yogurt.

115
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,960
Youngsters nowadays like to drink this. It helps with digestion.

116
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,120
Here.

117
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
Thanks, Mom.

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,279
Dad.

119
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,960
How is Mom's health lately?

120
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,200
It's quite good.

121
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,519
Last time, she got a bit of a scare.

122
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,239
But it was a good thing too.

123
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:32,240
Now, she's more health-conscious.

124
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,059
Less salt, less oil, less sugar.

125
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,739
I have no choice. I can only buy some pork head meat outside to nourish myself a bit.

126
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,800
Where did you get personal money to buy that?

127
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,299
I've been saving it for dozens of years. Of course there's no problem.

128
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
You've been hiding personal money for dozens of years?

129
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,520
Our son is back. I'm just bluffing in front of him. Don't take it seriously.

130
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,720
Save it. Come on, come out. Come on.

131
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,240
I'm washing the dishes.

132
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,660
Can't our son wash them?

133
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,939
Mom. I can wash them. Dad's coming.

134
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,300
   

135
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:18,300
   
   

136
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,140
   

137
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,260
   

138
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,460
 Yu Tu, teach me Math. I'll buy you fried chicken. 

139
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,099
Yu Tu, have some fruits.

140
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:56,399
Isn't that your book from senior high? Why did you think about reading it now?

141
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,600
It's nothing.

142
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,840
Why are my books from senior high still here?

143
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,259
They must have been left behind when I was sorting them.

144
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,299
There are so many of them.

145
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,900
Mom, where's my old computer?

146
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,820
I thought you wouldn't use it anymore, so I placed it downstairs in that small storage room.

147
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,639
This computer is already so old. Why did you think about taking it out today?

148
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,420
When we replaced our television last time, I should have let those people take it away too.

149
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,840
It's just taking up space anyway, but it won't sell for much either.

150
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,039
Mom, let's keep it.

151
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,059
Okay, we'll keep it.

152
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,100
   

153
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:32,700
   

154
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,559
   

155
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,839
 He accepted it so quickly. 

156
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,019
 What should I say? 

157
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,679
 Hi. 

158
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,320
 Hi. 

159
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:55,840
 I saw your QQ account in the aerospace forum, so I added you. 

160
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,600
 The one about Chang'e 1? 

161
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,750
 Your discussion is so interesting. 

162
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,750
 Do you think we can really go to the moon? 

163
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,079
 It's just a matter of time and desire. 

164
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,759
 In the future, can I consult you about some questions? 

165
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,640
 Actually, I'm just a beginner. I've just started taking an interest in this. 

166
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,879
 Sure. 

167
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:25,679
 Thank you. 

168
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,559
 I have a question. 

169
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,640
 How fast should the probe be in order to break away from the Earth's gravity? 

170
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,000
 You can search for that on Baidu. 

171
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:48,499
 Oh, okay. 

172
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,380
 I'm doomed. 

173
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,060
 He must have figured out that I don't know anything. 

174
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,399
 I understand now. 

175
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,039
 But I think it's not quite the same going to the moon, right? 

176
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,660
 Because the moon is the Earth's satellite. 

177
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,799
 Hello. Hello. 

178
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:15,679
 Last time, I asked if I could consult you about some questions. Can I still do that? 

179
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,520
 I saw your forum discussion about the gap between our nation's and USA's aerospace technology. 

180
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,840
 Is the gap between us really that huge? 

181
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,515
 He's not replying again. 

182
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,659
 Are you there? Could it be that you've deleted me? 

183
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,039
 When will you take the initiative to talk to me? 

184
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:47,010
 The group chat discussion is so lively. 

185
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,470
 Do you think mankind can really migrate to Mars? 

186
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,840
 We have a new member. 

187
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,799
 I think so. And it's a girl. 

188
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:05,360
 Hello, everyone. 

189
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,320
 It's really a girl. Did someone invite her? 

190
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,840
 No. I saw your group ID on the aerospace forum, so I joined. 

191
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,320
 Miss, how old are you? Every sentence has an emoticon. 

192
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,399
 I'm 17. 

193
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,759
 You're so young. You must still be in senior high. 

194
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,720
 Senior high students nowadays are incredible. 

195
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,620
 We have a senior high student in our group too. 

196
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,259
 He has a lot of knowledge. 

197
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:28,600
 Is he that incredible? I don't know anything. 

198
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,480
 I'm just a bit curious. 

199
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:33,520
 It's fine. You're welcome here. He hasn't joined us lately. 

200
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,960
 I'll introduce you two when he joins us. 

201
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,200
 Galaxy, you're here. In the afternoon, you missed someone of your age. 

202
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,680
 I was here. But what you were talking about was so professional. 

203
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,890
 I didn't dare to speak. 

204
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:45,019
 But he's really incredible. He knows a lot of things. 

205
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,550
 Is anyone here who can help me? 

206
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,799
 I have a physics problem that I can't answer. 

207
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,540
 So that's how it's done. 

208
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,440
 Thank you, Brother Fish Head. You're so incredible. 

209
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,520
 Brother Fish Head, my teacher said your solution from yesterday was wrong. 

210
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,620
 I can't join you guys anymore. 

211
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,799
 Why? Your parents won't allow it? 

212
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:14,260
 No. I must study hard now. 

213
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,560
 After getting into my target university, I'll come to join you guys again. 

214
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,939
 Which one is your target? 

215
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,540
 Tsinghua. 

216
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,760
 Nice. You can't judge a book by its cover, girl. 

217
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,920
 You have a high ambition. 

218
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:38,940
 Actually, I don't have a high ambition. 

219
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,208
 But lately, I confessed my feelings to the person I like. 

220
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,081
 I think he feels like my grades aren't good enough, 

221
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:44,920
 so I want to get into the same university as him. 

222
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,900
 Perhaps he'll like me then. 

223
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,243
 That's not what men look at. 

224
00:17:49,243 --> 00:17:52,917
 Hand-picked Stars, are you not that beautiful? 

225
00:17:52,917 --> 00:17:54,752
 I am very beautiful. 

226
00:17:54,752 --> 00:17:56,740
 Keep a low profile. 

227
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,140
 Anyway, I keep thinking about it, 

228
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,030
  the only flaw I have should be that my grades aren't good enough. 

229
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,980
 That's why I'm planning to study hard. 

230
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,880
 But my grades are actually around the top 200 in the city. 

231
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,920
 But he's always number one in the city. 

232
00:18:13,699 --> 00:18:15,599
 You can do it. 

233
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,179
 That is a big gap. 

234
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,840
 I think I can study harder. 

235
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,640
 If I could get into Tsinghua too, then I'd be one of the celebrities in the entertainment industry  

236
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,039
 who has a very incredible educational background. 

237
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:40,500
 If your fans knew that you want to get into Tsinghua for them, they would be very happy. 

238
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,770
 It's not because of them. 

239
00:18:48,106 --> 00:18:51,540
 I was quite surprised that you chose Finance as your major for your college application. 

240
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,840
 I've always remembered that your dream is the galaxy. 

241
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,436
 I'm planning to give up on the galaxy. 

242
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:02,780
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

243
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:09,340
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

244
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:13,920
 Why did you say that you wanted to give up? 

245
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,990
 Is it because of your family? 

246
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,160
 But I remember that your uncle is also working in aerospace. 

247
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,100
 Why are your parents against it? 

248
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,440
 Because you've always gotten a perfect score in math and physics. 

249
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,319
 Back then, I thought, 

250
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,599
 "He'll probably become a very incredible scientist in the future. 

251
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:31,400
 I'll feel very honored, too." 

252
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:36,940
 I just wanted to defend you. 

253
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,094
 I want you to continue being an aerospace engineer more than anyone. 

254
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,600
 Why? 

255
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,760
♫  I can run toward the future with you  ♫

256
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,300
♫  Regardless of everything  ♫

257
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,900
 I'll never ask you why again. 

258
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,620
Old Yu.

259
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,141
You just like dilly-dallying. Old Yu, hurry up.

260
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,180
We're going out for a walk. Why do you have a thermos with you?

261
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,740
Old Zhang called me just now to play mahjong with him.

262
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,279
Mahjong... You just know how to play mahjong.

263
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,880
Our son is home, and you're still playing mahjong.

264
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,420
I've already spent a few hours with him.

265
00:20:56,635 --> 00:20:58,800
Fine. Come back before 9 p.m.

266
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,481
I will. Take good care of your mom.

267
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
He only knows to play mahjong.

268
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,839
Your son is home?

269
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:07,599
Yes, he just arrived at lunch time.

270
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,379
Yu Tu is becoming more and more handsome.

271
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:11,960
Does he have a girlfriend now?

272
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,699
He's too busy with work to think about that.

273
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:17,119
No matter how busy he is, he can't delay marriage.

274
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,640
That's the disadvantage of working far away.

275
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,080
The parents can't interfere in his business.

276
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:25,119
If he worked here, his kids would already be in school.

277
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:26,279
Right.

278
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,419
Let me see if there's anyone in Shanghai that I can help introduce to you later.

279
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:30,599
Don't forget.

280
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,299
Bye.

281
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:34,679
Let's quickly leave.

282
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:37,279
That lady just likes to worry about people.

283
00:21:38,994 --> 00:21:40,794
Tell me.

284
00:21:40,794 --> 00:21:44,061
In the afternoon, was something bothering you?

285
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,670
Before I came home last time, I tendered my resignation,

286
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:54,180
but I still went back there now.

287
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,619
I think that you're like your uncle the most.

288
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,060
You've always admired him since you were little.

289
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:05,567
You kept boasting to your friends saying, "My uncle launches rockets."

290
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:08,540
Among my siblings, your uncle is the smartest.

291
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,500
But he also has the hardest time.

292
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,920
He's all alone in northwest China. He can't take care of his family at all.

293
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,200
One time, your grandpa was sick and almost didn't make it.

294
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,040
We couldn't contact him no matter how hard we tried.

295
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,400
Back then, communications weren't as advanced as it is now.

296
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,799
Later on, we were finally able to save your grandpa.

297
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:28,699
We got into contact with your uncle. We wanted him to come home,

298
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:32,759
but he spoke haltingly for a while and said that he couldn't.

299
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:36,340
He said that since your grandpa was fine now, his current mission was also very important.

300
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,320
He could only come home after completing his mission.

301
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,419
And he ended up coming home only after one month.

302
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,900
All of us siblings were mad at him and treated him coldly.

303
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,634
Back then, your grandaunt came to visit,

304
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,980
and pointed at him and scolded him for being unfilial.

305
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,100
Your uncle just listened and didn't say a word.

306
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,440
You were still so little back then.

307
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,400
You suddenly said, "Grandaunt, isn't your son working in the USA?"

308
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,540
Your grandaunt loved hearing that the most.

309
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:11,839
She said, "Right. Yu Tu, study hard too, and go to the USA in the future."

310
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,320
Then you said, "Grandaunt, your son hasn't visited you for so many years.

311
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,820
Why don't you scold him for being unfilial?"

312
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,179
Back then, I thought,

313
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,300
they both can't be with their parents.

314
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,680
If you live abroad, people envy you.

315
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,840
If you're in the northwest of China, and silently making your contribution,

316
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,540
people would say that it's not worth it, and even consider you unfilial.

317
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,381
Does that make sense?

318
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,680
All of us adults couldn't figure it out.

319
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,960
We were no better than a ten-year-old child like you.

320
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,760
I've been smart since I was little.

321
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,240
Of course. You're my son.

322
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,740
Son.

323
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,580
You know about the truths of life.

324
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,920
But when it comes to yourself, you're confused.

325
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,896
Actually, the thing I regret the most in my life

326
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:07,156
is forcing you to choose Finance as your major for your college application.

327
00:24:07,156 --> 00:24:09,340
What was I thinking back then?

328
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,920
I thought, "My son has such high grades. He must go into the most popular major.

329
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,360
Otherwise, his grades would be wasted."

330
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,020
Later on, I found out that you secretly studied two majors.

331
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,360
I regretted it so much.

332
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,479
Because of me, you wasted so much effort.

333
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:30,720
It's all my fault.

334
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,400
Son, be honest with me.

335
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,260
Were you planning to resign because of my illness last time?

336
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,900
Mom.

337
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,060
You're so silly.

338
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,100
You were overthinking.

339
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,859
No matter what you do in the future, don't think about us.

340
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:53,360
Just think about yourself.

341
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,459
Son.

342
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,284
I'm really proud of you. You're already doing very well.

343
00:25:02,284 --> 00:25:05,401
Your dad and I are envied by people so much.

344
00:25:06,854 --> 00:25:08,219
Promise me.

345
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:11,379
There's really no need to be the best in everything.

346
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:23,759
Son, you must consider getting married too.

347
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,880
Otherwise, those ladies would keep asking me, "When will Yu Tu get married?"

348
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,140
Her qualifications don't need to be too good. She doesn't need to be very beautiful.

349
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,300
It's best if she knows how to take care of people.

350
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,980
Mom.

351
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,460
I think I like the opposite of that.

352
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:08,210
   

353
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm sorry. My flight got delayed. I've already gotten off the plane.

354
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,180
Okay. I'll be right there.

355
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,899
Hello, I'm Yu Tu from Unit 158.

356
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:32,299
Hello.

357
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:35,020
The van for your institute is already full. Didn't you fly here together?

358
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,960
I flew here from another place.

359
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,599
Take the last van then.

360
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,020
Just wait for a few more colleagues from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and you can leave.

361
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,319
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

362
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,799
- Hi. 
 - Hi.

363
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:57,019
We're from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. What about you?

364
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:58,519
Mr. Zhou?

365
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,620
How... How did you know?

366
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,580
We had a teleconference before.

367
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,999
I'm Yu Tu from Unit 158.

368
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,400
 I heard from the people who joined the Field Experiment Team before 

369
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,720
that food in the base is very good. They even hired a ramen master.

370
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,059
After hearing that, I've been so looking forward to it.

371
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:21,480
Why do you always keep thinking about food?

372
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,340
I'm from the north. We love noodles.

373
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,079
Mr. Yu, you're from the south, aren't you?

374
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,059
Will the food be different from what you're used to?

375
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,499
No. It's fine as long as I get full.

376
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:34,240
Mr. Yu is handsome. When he speaks, he just sounds like a guy in the technology field.

377
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,279
Right.

378
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:48,620
♫  When the sun shines on the other side of the earth  ♫

379
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:56,560
♫  Please wake me up, I want to see the dawn  ♫

383
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,060
♫  Falling into the vast sky, dissipating with the morning light  ♫

384
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,659
We're here, guys. We'll be living here for a month.

385
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:28,280
♫  Born as an eagle with wide wings  ♫

390
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,160
Sirs. There's a strong sandstorm in the base. Protect yourself well before getting off the van.

391
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,760
Well...

392
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,640
- We're from the Telemetry Team. 
 - Turn right ahead.

393
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,720
- It's up ahead? 
 - Right.

394
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,030
Register here.

395
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,079
Take care.

396
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:25,140


397
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:36,030
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

398
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:43,150
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

399
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:50,310
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

401
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,470
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

402
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,650
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

403
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:11,850
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

404
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:18,910
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time

406

♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

407
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:09,110
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

408
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:16,250
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

409
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:23,430
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

410
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:31,010
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

411
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,690
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

412
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:37,690
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

413
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:44,950
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

414
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:52,150
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

415
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:59,350
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
 in the passing time  ♫

416
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:07,570
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
