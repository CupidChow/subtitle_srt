1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,150
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,110
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:36,750
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,650
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,650
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,350
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,790
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,790 --> 00:01:00,430
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:08,030
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:15,790
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:28,920
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:40,150
   

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,220
   

16
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,651
   
   

17
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,980
Slow down. Slowly.

18
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,700
Great!

19
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,500
   

20
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,260
Today, we start with the specialized test.

21
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,780
Remote telemetry subsystem ready. 
    

22
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,519
Field test confirmed. Are the antenna and equipment functioning normally?

23
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,880
Field test confirmed. Antenna and equipment are functioning normally.

24
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,580
XCMT007.

25
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,800
X-band transponder transmission mode, telemetry functioning normally.

26
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:04,080
Begin mobile mode. Autonomous barrier test.

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,860
Driving cycle 12. Solar zenith angle is at 56 degrees.

28
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,499
Two meters ahead of the rover, a stone with a diameter of 25 cm has been placed.

29
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:14,099
Set the rover's target location to six meters ahead of it.

30
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:18,400
The rover will deploy autonomous barrier mode to move forward.

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
K32 motion subsystem.

32
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,410
Autonomous barrier mode online, motion command has been sent.

33
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,541
Rover is operating normally.

34
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,580
Rover motion subsystem, telemetry data are normal.

35
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,659
Rover GNC subsystem, telemetry data are normal.

36
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:08,319
 Next, second test of the drive cycle. 

37
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,100
Solar zenith angle is at 75 degrees.

38
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,319
Yu Tu, ever since I came to the testing ground, my belly is getting bigger.

39
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,860
Noodles truly make people fat.

40
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,219
Mr. Zhou. Are you taking the car just to get the noodles?

41
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:43,350
Wait for me! Hurry up, drive.

42
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,400
I'll order some noodles for you.

43
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,390
It seems like we should organize some weight management classes on the side.

44
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:59,000
How is Dr. Guan holding up?

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,199
The surgery was a success. I visited him before I came here.

46
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,519
He's in good spirits.

47
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,579
Good. Without him at the base, things feel a little less fun.

48
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:12,840
Our beloved Dr. Guan is intelligent beyond measure and highly professional.

49
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,570
He can also hold his liquor and boast.

50
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,600
He brings people joy. He's an all-rounder.

51
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,399
I'll pass your compliments to him.

52
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,519
That won't be necessary.

53
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,300
I've already expressed my respect for him in person.

54
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,460
Xiao Yu, you should hang out with co-workers after work too.

55
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,519
Don't give yourself too much stress.

56
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:37,299
Our field test went well.

57
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:40,270
One must be serious with his work.

58
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,240
But one also needs to relax.

59
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,539
Don't make your life during the field test a time of hardship.

60
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:51,959
Every night, co-workers partake in ping-pong, photography, and some card games.

61
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,230
You should join them.

62
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,100
Sure.

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,179
It works. Have a look.

64
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,690
Okay.

65
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,939
Yu Tu!

66
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,100
Would you like to join us?

67
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,540
You won't get such a clear sky in the city.

68
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,720
We were looking for you.

69
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,639
It's the "Yutu" rover. It is similar to the pronunciation of your name.

70
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,959
I know you have a telescope, but how can you know where it is?

71
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,570
I mean the general location. Don't take it so seriously.

72
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,880
It's 203 mm. Who brought this?

73
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,860
It belongs to Chief Li.

74
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,400
Yutu rover landed in Sinus Iridum.

75
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,270
Do you have a lens with a higher power?

76
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,720
That's the biggest zoom we can get.

77
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,540
Let me have a look.

78
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,140
Our poor Rabbit is all alone on the Moon. 
  (T/N: Rover "Yutu" translate to Jade Rabbit) 

79
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,790
Let me see it.

80
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,280
 - A saying just crossed my mind. It suits you. 
 - What is it? 

81
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,510
 But you're already a Rabbit who's seen the most stars. 

82
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,690
Yu Tu. Where is Mercury? Can we see it this month?

83
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,000
I think so.

84
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,660
However, its observation window is smaller. It's a little too late.

85
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,830
An hour after sunset is usually the best window to observe it.

86
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,830
It's about at this location.

87
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,020
We can try again earlier tomorrow.

88
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,830
- Okay? 
 - Sure.

89
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,830
Enjoy your stargazing. I have to go now.

90
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,600
   
 - A saying just crossed my mind. It suits you. 
 - What is it? 

91
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,000
 But you're already a Rabbit who's seen the most stars. 

92
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 I was almost convinced by what you said. 

93
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,400
 How could you say you accomplished nothing? 

94
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,600
 Even if you want to give up your previous career and start over, 

95
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,700
 your past accomplishments are still there. 

96
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,000
 Although I don't know what you actually did, 

97
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 it must be very valuable. 

98
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,200
 So even if you're not doing this anymore, 

99
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,600
 you don't have to deny the past, right? 

100
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,000
 At least you strived for your ideals. 

101
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,800
 This is better than you compromising when you never tried. 

102
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,300
 To me at least, this is not a mistake. 

103
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
   

104
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,400
 I was chilling and watching live streams. 

105
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,600
 I found this funny streamer. You can watch it on the road. 

106
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,800
 Watch videos of streamers who focus on techniques. 

107
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,000
 I already have one during the daytime. 

108
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 He is skilled and brilliant. He's strict with everything. 

109
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200
 I'm flattered. 

110
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,000
 I accept the first part, but I'm not that strict. 

111
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,800
 Do you want me to be? 

112
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,000
 No need. You're good enough as it is. 

113
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,700
 Where are you now? 

114
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,000
 I have a craving for youtiao. Could you get me some? 

115
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,600
 What about the calories? 

116
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,300
 I'll only eat half of it. 

117
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,800
 There is also the shorter kind. 

118
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,400
Yu Tu.

119
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,400
Are you texting your girlfriend?

120
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,300
If you're sitting out here, it must be serious.

121
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,600
I was about to go in.

122
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,800
I overheard that she wanted you to bring her breakfast tomorrow.

123
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
Doesn't she know you're in a desert?

124
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,600
Even if that's the case, doesn't she know you're on a business trip?

125
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,600
These are old messages.

126
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,000
You must miss her a lot.

127
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,800
Yu Tu, Mr. Zhou. Come on, I need your help.

128
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,000
The guys from our game left to call their girlfriends.

129
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,800
Come on, hurry up.

130
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,800
- We were having a conversation. 
 - Come with me.

131
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,500
   

132
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,800
Telemetry malfunction.

133
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,000
   

134
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,000
It deviated from the track.

135
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,400
Navigation test, drive cycle three. There's been a malfunction.

136
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,600
 The rover deviated from the track. 

137
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,400
Stop the test.

138
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,900
   

139
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,300
Chief Li.

140
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,400
We don't know why it stopped.

141
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,700
Everyone, analyze the possible causes.

142
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,800
This happened on the testing ground.

143
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,900
We must resolve it immediately.

144
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,320
   

145
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,500
   

146
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,400
I remember it now.

147
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,200
I think the navigation software didn't account for

148
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,600
the difference caused by the sunlight's angle of incidence under natural lighting.

149
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,200
Indeed. The lighting at the testing ground

150
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,800
is different from that of our indoor labs.

151
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,000
It's very likely so. The difference causes the visual system

152
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,800
to miscalculate during the recognition process.

153
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,100
How could we overlook that detail?

154
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,600
We must adjust the parameters and update the algorithm.

155
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
For the time being, this is likely the cause.

156
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,400
Make use of the time to run confirmation tests.

157
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,000
I think we should all call it a day.

158
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,300
Dunhuang Weather Station announced the weather forecast.

159
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:57,200
Later today, there could be some sand and dust storms.

160
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,400
Let's go to the shower together.

161
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,000
You didn't wait for me? How could you?

162
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,800
Let's go.

163
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,700
I've never seen a sand dust storm.

164
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,400
Later on, we have to run the sandbox test.

165
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,200
We could make use of the sand dust storm for the test.

166
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,000
Quantifiable condition, analytic result, repeatable measures.

167
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,500
Don't you know about these?

168
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,600
Of course I know. Don't you have a sense of humor?

169
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,000
Stop talking and shower.

170
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
Our co-workers are waiting for their turn.

171
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,400
Finish in five minutes.

172
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,000
Let's have a card game later. I want Yu Tu on my team.

173
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,600
Have some decency. Yu Tu is from my dorm.

174
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,800
We work in the same department.

175
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,600
You already won a whole bag of my snacks. At least let me win for once.

176
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Have me on your team. Don't bother Yu Tu.

177
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,400
His brain must be exhausted.

178
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,800
The card game is just tiring for him.

179
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't be such a buzzkill.

180
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,800
How could you be so mean?

181
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,200
You are sidelining Yu Tu simply because he is good at the game?

182
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,400
There are only 108 cards in the deck.

183
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,100
Don't mock my intelligence.

184
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,000
But I'll pass tonight.

185
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,900
All the snacks Mr. Zhou won were given to the ladies.

186
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't want to help his evil cause.

187
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,400
You betrayed me!

188
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,200
When you gave them all the snacks

189
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,600
and left me with nothing for my effort,

190
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,200
you should have seen this coming.

191
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,400
I saw that you have a girlfriend, I don't want to sabotage your relationship.

192
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,300
Mr. Zhou, you can't fool us with that.

193
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,200
Yu Tu may be handsome and smart,

194
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
but he is just another single man like me. He has no girlfriend.

195
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,400
Don't be silly. You're still single.

196
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,800
But Yu Tu has a girlfriend.

197
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,400
I saw it some days ago.

198
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,000
His girlfriend was sending him voice messages.

199
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,600
She even asked him to get her breakfast.

200
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,200
Breakfast? No way.

201
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,100
He has his breakfast at the cafeteria everyday.

202
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,000
Is your girlfriend one of our co-workers?

203
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,200
Is your girlfriend really one of our co-workers?

204
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Get on with it. People are waiting.

205
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,300
   

206
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,720
   

207
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,250
- Hello? 
 - Is everything going well over there?

208
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,519
We ran into some minor issues. But we resolved them.

209
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,940
We should be able to finish sooner than we expected.

210
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,779
So why would Chief Li complain to me?

211
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,299
 Is something wrong? 

212
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:53,400
Don't you know? Chief Li is a strict and lively person.

213
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,659
 He wants to know everything about the project. 

214
00:18:55,659 --> 00:18:59,839
 He's also worried about the happiness of his subordinates. 

215
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,350
 He was planning to fix the boy up with 

216
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,920
one of the ladies from other institutes.

217
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,480
But as it turned out, you've been acting  melancholic all the time. 

218
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,500
 You always stargaze all alone. 

219
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,190
 You don't socialize after work. 

220
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:21,119
A bunch of young and innocent girls are mesmerized by your charm.

221
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,540
 You decimated the chances of your comrades. 

222
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,340
Old Yu, I'm pretty sure you didn't have this habit back then.

223
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,600
I've been winning games for days.

224
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,790
They kicked me out of the card game.

225
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,599
That sounds like you're acting too cool.

226
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,920
If you're acting cool when you're handsome, the other gentlemen will have  no chances at all. 

227
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,540
 I'm calling you right now to give you a warning. 

228
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,160
You must keep acting cool.

229
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,240
It's all right.

230
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,959
Trust me. Do not leave the other guys with any glimmer of hope.

231
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,719
When the time comes, you will earn the title as the institute trademark.

232
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:09,780
Is your wife there? Let me talk to her.

233
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,219
Hello?

234
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:19,760
How is Guan Zai?

235
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,960
He's doing well. His recovery is  better than expected. 

236
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,879
Hey...

237
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,400
You...

238
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,019
Don't be so nosy. You know nothing.

239
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,699
 Tell me, Chief Li called me to see if you have a girlfriend. 

240
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,400
 What should I tell him? 

241
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,880
I could just be honest with him

242
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,160
and tell him you're in love with your high school classmate, Qiao Jingjing.

243
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,060
 Listen up. 

244
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,680
 There is a video of you gaming with Qiao Jingjing in the unit's group chat. 

245
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,280
 Everyone knows she was your classmate. 

246
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,400
 I pondered on it a little. 

247
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,659
 She was the girl you kept bringing up back in Xi'an. 

248
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:15,380
 And you were saying she had a crush on you. 

249
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:20,160
But judging by that video, I think she has some special feelings for you.

250
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,060
So why are you still single?

251
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,839
I've been thinking.

252
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,900
What can I possibly give her?

253
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,859
I don't have money.

254
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:45,620
I can't even...keep her company.

255
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:14,836
 Old Yu. 

256
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,901
 According to my wife, that's not how it works. 

257
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,599
 Are you a fool or what? 

258
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,979
You're right.

259
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:35,259
 What? You finally admitted it. 

260
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:37,680
 Have you come to your senses? 

261
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:46,219
Objective facts are always true.

262
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,400
They are not a realization.

263
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,760
It's...

264
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,580
I can't handle it.

265
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:31,540
   

266
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,120
   

267
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:35,740
Run some more tests.

268
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,880
Pick up the spirit. Our job will be done in a few days.

269
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:59,640
I hereby announce all rover functions have reached the expected level.

270
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,279
The field test is a complete success!

271
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,680
Yes!

272
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,440
Let's take a picture together.

273
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,480
Over here!

274
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,580
Come on.

275
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,720
Come on, everyone.

276
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,559
- Hurry up! 
 - Let's go.

277
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,540
Three, two, one.

278
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,359
- We will conquer... 
  - The endless cosmos! 

279
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,019
Try it out. Have some drinks.

280
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:43,259
Enjoy.

281
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:45,179
We'll make plans after we're back in Beijing.

282
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,119
I'll hold you to it. Don't go back on your words.

283
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,000
Sure, you have my words.

284
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,500
Chief Li.

285
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,119
The roasted mutton is ready! Have some mutton!

286
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:57,799
Let's go.

287
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,119
Come and try it out.

288
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,000
Hurry up!

289
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,659
Everyone is enjoying it.

290
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:07,939
- Chief Li. 
 - Roasted mutton.

291
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:10,859
Yeah, Chief Li. You should try it.

292
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:12,759
Chief Li is here. Let's have a toast.

293
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:14,779
Yeah!

294
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:16,559
 - Well done. 
 - Cheers! 

295
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,039
One, two, three!

296
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,920
- Three, two, one! 
 - Now! Cheers!

297
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,740
- Mr. Zhou. 
 - To your health.

298
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,860
Thank you, sir.

299
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,719
Cheers!

300
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,060
Thanks, sir. We'll be over there.

Mr. Yu and Mr. Zhou. Take care.

323
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:02,280
- Take care. 
 - You did great.

324
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,480
- See you. 
 - Bye.

325
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:11,580
♫  For as long as I can, I will stay in this moment  ♫

326
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:17,580
♫  I'll be there for you when you turn  ♫

327
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,480
♫  Today can you feel it  ♫

328
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,760
♫  The stars in the sky can attest  ♫

329
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,960
♫  That you're the one I want to find  ♫

330
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,760
♫  In my dream  ♫

331
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,960
♫  Carved in my memories  ♫

332
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:47,120
♫  Is your courage that makes me want to treasure it  ♫

333
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,340
   

334
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,440
   

335
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,599
   

336
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:11,759
Everyone, our meeting today is about the modifications to Project "One."

337
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,380
I'd like to have your opinions on a matter.

338
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,559
Before the field test, I visited Chief Guan at the hospital.

339
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:24,859
I asked him to give this project a proper name.

340
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:28,999
It's called...the "God Searcher."

341
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,060
   

342
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,300
In the seemingly endless cosmos,

343
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,820
we search for the truth of human and Earth's origins.

344
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,100
In this infinite time and space,

345
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,279
we search for the existence of another God's miraculous work.

346
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,779
Its duty is to prove that humans are not alone in this world.

347
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,160
I wasn't paraphrasing.

348
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,200
I think it is also the goal of our toiling.

349
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,599
Yu Tu, when you did the field test, you also cared for One...

350
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:15,599
I mean, God Searcher.

351
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,680
He's been working on this to the point he didn't socialize.

352
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,340
But whom did you learn that tone from during the testing?

353
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,720
Haven't you noticed it?

354
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,559
"Keep up the good work." You sounded just like my high school teacher.

355
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,920
That sent a chill down my spine.

356
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,260
   

357
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,780
   

358
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,000
   

359
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,920
Yu Tu. Are you sending a letter? You're so old-fashioned.

360
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,160
- Dr. Zhao. 
 - Good morning.

361
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,660
Good morning.

362
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,460
   

363
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,279
It's heavy snow in Beijing.

364
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:48,979
It started snowing in Shanghai a few days ago.

365
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:54,060
- Over here! 
  - The Star Award is over. 

366
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,880
 Wait for a little. The company is throwing a cocktail party. 

367
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,500
 The director and screenplay of your next drama are there. 

368
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,839
 You should meet them at the party. 

369
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,779
Okay. I'll head over there after I get changed.

370
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:09,020
   

371
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,720
- I'm counting on you, Mr. Zhang. 
 - I'm flattered.

372
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,820
We are counting on Jingjing.

373
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,240
Her great performance pulls in the audience.

374
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,759
Congratulations, Jingjing. The film draws well.

375
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,799
Thanks.

376
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,580
Weren't you investing in the project?

377
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,000
Just a little. It was only for fun.

378
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,079
How humble of you.

379
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:58,980


380
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:06,080
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

381
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:13,300
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

382
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:20,360
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

383
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:28,140
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

384
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,620
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

385
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,800
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

386
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:42,000
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

387
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,140
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

388
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:56,200
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

389
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:05,400
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

390
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:39,260
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

391
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:46,400
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

392
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,580
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

393
00:35:53,580 --> 00:36:01,160
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

394
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,740
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

395
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:07,840
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

396
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:15,100
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

397
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:22,300
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

398
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:29,400
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

399
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:39,020
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
