1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:10,400


2
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,150
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,110
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:36,750
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,550
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,550
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,350
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,790
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,790 --> 00:01:00,430
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:08,230
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:15,890
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:28,990
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:40,250
   

14
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:47,140
   

15
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:54,340
 My choice is... 

16
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,780
 Yu Tu. 

17
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,339
He's so handsome!

18
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,499
That's one big secret Jingjing had kept.

19
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:25,450
He's Jingjing's friend. Of course he is extraordinary.

20
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,470
You look a little more handsome than usual.

21
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:30,860
Just a little?

22
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,520
Come here, Handsome Man. Stand on my side.

23
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:41,750
Let me guess. Are you part of the entertainment industry?

24
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,900
No, we're high school classmates.

25
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,680
High school classmates?

26
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,099
Actually, we also went to the same middle school.

27
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:52,679
Sounds like you're destined.

28
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:55,180
You went to the same middle and high schools, but what about college?

29
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,010
Unfortunately, not. After all, I didn't get into Tsinghua.

30
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,690
Now I trust that you play well.

31
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,740
Then you and Jingjing have been friends for many years?

32
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,920
No. We actually lost contact for many years.

33
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,379
It was getting into this game that brought us back together.

34
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,740
In fact, there are really many examples of this.

35
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,320
Honor of Kings has really brought many people closer.

36
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,610
It has given mere acquaintances a sense of

37
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,650
mutual understanding, and even tied some knots.

38
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:28,020
I wasn't referring to you.

39
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,499
If we end up trending, I'll come after you.

40
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:33,579
Please don't. 
    

41
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:38,040
Oh, no. Do you remember that exposure on Jingjing from high school?

42
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,659
And now, she called up Teacher Yu,

43
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:43,379
a Tsinghua graduate, saying she knew him from high school.

44
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,260
It's absolutely certain that netizens will dig it up.

45
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,360
And then someone will figure out that it was Teacher Yu who rejected her.

46
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,179
It was also written that he already has a girlfriend.

47
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:57,980
I hope they don't think of her as stepping in between.

48
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,260
To me, what the emcee said is right.

49
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,619
Honor of Kings is indeed a game that can restore old friendships separated by time.

50
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:09,899
It was through this game that I met a lot of my old classmates and some old friends.

51
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:13,939
We all managed to catch up with each other while chatting over our game.

52
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:17,460
But most of them are already busy with their families and careers.

53
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,399
Unlike Mr. Yu. He's been single for so long, and he so happened to be on vacation.

54
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,390
So I thought to ask him to play the game with me.

55
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,460
 Yu Tu, look at the high school class group chat. 
     

56
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:32,400
 There's a post about you and Qiao Jingjing. 

57
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,159
No way. He's so handsome and a top student, but is single for many years?

58
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:41,539
Don't change the topic. But I also find it peculiar.

59
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:44,710
Not to mention, he plays so well.

60
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:49,750
Nothing peculiar. You are the same.

61
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,580
Top student makes a comeback.

62
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,620
But Jingjing is clever. She brought it up right away so articulately.

63
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:05,140
Teacher Yu collaborated so well. They know each other better than we think.

64
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,380
Teacher Yu is so responsive.

65
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,260
It's really a pity for him to not join the entertainment industry.

66
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,840
Okay, I'll do the dubbing. Ace!

67
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,419
Thank you for speaking up.

68
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:19,900
Now we know that good looks won't get you out of singlehood.

69
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,860
Come to think of it, it's a little inspiring.

70
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,299
 Check the time. Do the introductions and start the game. 

71
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,979
All right. Mr. Yu, as you've witnessed before coming on stage,

72
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:29,380
I'd like you to introduce yourself just like those before you.

73
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,560
That is your ID, rank,

74
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,560
and profession. And then we'll start the game right away.

75
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,580
Hello, everyone. My ID is Jade Rabbit Pounding Elixir.

76
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,480
My rank is King 50 stars.

77
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,110
And I work as...

78
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:54,370
an aerospace engineer.

79
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,419
An aerospace engineer?

80
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:00,900
That's amazing. Do you build rockets? I know CZ-5.

81
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,479
No. I work on deep space exploration.

82
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,060
What an expert! I won't ask anymore.

83
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,390
Contestants, return to your teams and take your seats.

84
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,500
   

85
00:06:21,239 --> 00:06:22,920
We worked pretty well in the last match.

86
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,720
For this one, let's see their lineup, and strategize accordingly.

87
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,320
By the way, can you play the Marksman to make up for Snow?

88
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,979
- Sure thing. 
 - Good.

89
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:34,480
But their bans in the last match were aimed at Jingjing,

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,900
and they didn't expect Jingjing's Donghuang Taiyi played brilliantly.

91
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,639
So they should realize by now that they had strategic issues.

92
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:44,559
If a casual game doesn't do Global BP, 
    

93
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:49,060
the bans would probably go to the three non-pro players' heroes from the last round.

94
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,160
As you can see, the BPs are swapped for the second round.

95
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,360
The blue team, the Star-reaching Team,

96
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,500
and the red, the Good Luck Team. The Star-reaching Team will ban and pick first.

97
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,900
 You mean, they will ban Donghuang, Bian Que and Kai? 

98
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,140
 That's very likely. The non-pros' hero pool is relatively shallow. 

99
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,059
 They'll probably make do with one or two. 
   

100
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:07,900
 To ban them, it can disrupt their entire lineup. 

101
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,820
- Let's ban Donghuang? 
 - Good.

102
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,740
- The blue team, Star-reaching Team, 
 - has banned Donghuang Taiyi. 
 - How respectful of them.

103
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,280
It's a token of recognition for Jingjing's prowess.

104
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,800
- The second ban is Kai. 
 - It's also the hero they previously used.

105
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,859
That's right.

106
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:23,040
They're really banning the heroes we used last round.

107
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,979
Good Luck Team has banned Meng Ya, followed by Marco Polo.

108
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,299
They also exercised their special right to ban Gongsun Li. That's three Marksmen banned.

109
00:07:29,299 --> 00:07:33,020
The legendary Snow is a master of our time, but Wine Among Flowers is out for now.

110
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,590
- That's right. 
 - They're out of heroes.

111
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,680
Jingjing, we won the last round.

112
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,679
Shall we be a bit bolder in this round?

113
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,120
In the last round, the Star-reaching Team pros were very kind to that streamer.

114
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,879
If they keep this up this round, the first hero to pick should be a Marksman.

115
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,900
We once studied together the streamer's hero pool.

116
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:02,979
He'll likely take Consort Yu, so we should be able to get Baili Shouyue.

117
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:04,500
You mean...

118
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,959
I'll play a Mid. You play a Marksman.

119
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,920
Good Luck Team is focusing their BP on Wine Among Flowers' hero pool.

120
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,640
All his three Marksmen have been banned, leaving only Consort Yu.

121
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,300
   

122
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,680
Gongsun Li couldn't carry just now,

123
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,839
it made sense for him to switch to Consort Yu for this round.

124
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,480
We'll see which Marksman Good Luck Team will choose.

125
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,560
Before that, let's see what they've got for their first and second heroes.

126
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,180
Jingjing's Donghuang Taiyi got banned.

127
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,730
What will she take now?

128
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:29,739
Chill.

129
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:32,040
Our Jingjing isn't only good at one Support.

130
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,179
Look, Cai Wenji isn't banned.

131
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,840
Cai Wenji sounds good.

132
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,720
She swept Cai Wenji right away 
    

133
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,119
- after her first-round selection was banned. 
 - That's right.

134
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,000
Jingjing previously played Donghuang when Cai Wenji was banned last round,

135
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,979
so this round she's taking Cai Wenji to peel.

136
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:44,479
Right.

137
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:45,979
Shouyue.

138
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:48,459
Shouyue was chosen by the new member.

139
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:51,660
- I mean, Jade Rabbit. 
 - Because he's Snow's replacement. 
 - Yes.

140
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,079
Actually, using Shouyue in your first game is quite risky.

141
00:08:56,079 --> 00:08:59,120
- That can be nerve-wracking. 
 - Yes, it gets awkward if he misfires.

142
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,399
This is just a casual game.

143
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,519
Two Mids got banned, that is Wan'er and Shen Mengxi.

144
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,879
Next is the fourth hero used by Nine Tomatoes. She's chosen Zhou Yin's Pei Qinhu.

145
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,100
This is assigning the midlane counter-attack to the fan of Jingjing, Nine Tomatoes.

146
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,919
Besides that, let's see. Pig Rider chose Ganjiang.

147
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,720
I think Pig Rider got angry because Diaochan failed to pounce.

148
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,979
That's right. He was about to unleash his signature hero.

149
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:21,159
- Yes. 
 - And the last midfield counter-attack is...

150
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,580
Really?

151
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,739
Zhuge Liang? He locked it so decisively.

152
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:26,239
Just like that.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,840
Everyone on the live stream is commenting that Jingjing can only support rather than fight.

154
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,639
- She's only riding on coattails. 
 - Says who?

155
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,980
I saw it, too.

156
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,900
They're all jeering at her, saying that she's incapable.

157
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,300
Let me see.

158
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,080
   

159
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,259
This is outrageous!

160
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:43,080
Who told them that support is not important?

161
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,559
   

162
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,740
- It's because Bian Que was a relatively passive kind of mage. 
 - Yes.

163
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,520
- While Zhuge Liang is relatively intensive to control. 
 - Wait a second.

164
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,960
Mage...

165
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,300
   

166
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,440
 It's peaceful at the Great Wall today. 

167
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,639
- No, they're changing. They're changing. 
 - Is it Baili Shouyue?

168
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,139
No way.

169
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,960
They're still changing and looking for what they want.

170
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:11,000
- Five seconds to go, they're still choosing. 
 - Jingjing wants Baili Shouyue.

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,639
- This hero's name is Baili Shouyue! 
 - Three, two, one!

172
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,720
- Did they change? No, they're locked! 
 - That's it, really!

173
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
No way!

174
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,159
Baili...

175
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:20,360
Nice!

176
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,259
She chose Baili!

177
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:30,340
Let's look forward to our spokesperson, Ms. Qiao Jingjing's Baili Shouyue!

178
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:35,560
 Enemy minions will arrive in five seconds. Please be ready. 

179
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,400
All right, both teams have finished selecting.

180
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,940
We were very surprised to see that Jingjing has taken Baili Shouyue,

181
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,399
such a difficult hero, while her handsome companion got himself Zhuge Liang.

182
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,440
We just can't wait!

183
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,799
So we have the blue team, the Star-reaching Team,

184
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:51,399
and the red team, the Good Luck Team.

185
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:52,940
It's game time.

186
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,499
   

187
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:55,879
I'm a little nervous. Who do I go with?

188
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:58,480
You as support, go with Shouyue. You're okay going alone midlane?

189
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,900
Yeah, no problem. Cai Wenji, don't be nervous.

190
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,779
Our lineup is highly fault-tolerant.

191
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:04,500
Besides, we have Zhou Yin.

192
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,799
We have Zhou Yin.

193
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,240
Guys, don't resonate like this. You're making me feel lonely.

194
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,140
Come on, Jingjing!

195
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,039
Jingjing sticks to the wall. She's discreet.

196
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:18,680
Increasing move speed with her passive to check the blue side's jungle. 
    

197
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,079
I think for this round, we should leave the rest and turn our full attention to Jingjing's Baili Shouyue.

198
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:25,220
- Though it sounds a bit harsh. 
 - Yes.

199
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,919
   

200
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,879
There goes our first shot.

201
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,500
 You broke in yourself. 

202
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,679
Got it!

203
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,880
Yeah! The hit rate is currently at 100%.

204
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,499
Every dog has its day.

205
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,099
That's normal.

206
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,940
I knew you wouldn't praise Jingjing.

207
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,580
   

208
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,120
She's making another hit. Will it be 50 or 100 percent?

209
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,919
- Re-aim. 
 - She's not holding back.

210
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:06,100
- There goes the second shot! 
 - What a pity, it missed.

211
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,120
Not too bad.

212
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
- I thought it was pretty accurate. 
 - That was a good shot.

213
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,040
Actually, I predicted that she'd miss them all.

214
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,259
Thankfully, I nailed the first shot.

215
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:16,319
If I missed two shots in a row, I would've been a laughing stock.

216
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,939
It's tough being an idol.

217
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:19,680
Of course.

218
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,100
 First blood. 

219
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,139
Did you draw first blood while chatting with me?

220
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:27,039
First blood is drawn. Let's take a look at the replay.

221
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,200
I see both sides on the midlane, laning against each other, and Jade Rabbit was savage!

222
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,240
Hua Mulan, you attack?

223
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,419
- Attack now? 
 - You're just level two.

224
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,890
- You're so weak. 
 - How did you do that?

225
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,650
 First blood. 

226
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:39,799
Unexpectedly, Pig Rider is getting a headache.

227
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,840
- He was battling with an amateur midlaner, but Hua Mulan gave away first blood. 
 - That's right.

228
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,199
By the way, a hero like Zhuge Liang can get so comfy after drawing first blood.

229
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,740
- Yeah. 
 - It was very smooth.

230
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,179
Can you please not chat during a team fight?

231
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:52,399
Be serious.

232
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,719
If you mess up because you're fooling around, my image as an idol will be gone.

233
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,579
I won't fool around anymore.

234
00:12:57,579 --> 00:12:58,720
Let's take a look.

235
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,080
After Zhuge Liang got the advantage, what will he do?

236
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,260
Hua Mulan is clearing the minions. Let's get him.

237
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,080
On my way.

238
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,440
   

239
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,679
Caught on the top lane.

240
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,680
- A tragic end for Hua Mulan. 
 - That's too bad.

241
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,500
Zhuge Liang's ultimate skill did not land.

242
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,959
Killing Spree. It was a direct kill.

243
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,110
- I'm here to make a kill. 
 - Ganjiang is out of skills.

244
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,240
- We can kill him. 
 - On my way.

245
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,580
   
   

246
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,399
Pig Rider makes his pursuit, and bites off Zhou Yin!

247
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,779
Nice shot!

248
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:28,720
Good Luck Team does a Mid-Jungler synergy and builds up their momentum.

249
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,459
Just a few minutes in, and let's take a look.

250
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:32,679
With a huge monetary lead and an advantageous lineup,

251
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,740
Pei Qinhu and Zhuge Liang are being played to the fullest.

252
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,659
Especially when we all know Zhou Yin is famous for getting cocky when things are better.

253
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:42,559
He acts like that in a match and it's more obvious in a casual game.

254
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,819
Surprisingly enough, Jade Rabbit can work with him so well as an amateur midlaner.

255
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:49,920
He's a force to be reckoned with.

256
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,639
Two against five. You'd be cocky if you don't retreat!

257
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,879
Zhuge Liang is also about to be taken down by Zhao Yun.

258
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,419
Pei Qinhu retreats to the tower. They messed up in this fight.

259
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,380
I told you not to mess up. Did you all get so arrogant?

260
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,799
You don't usually mess up like that.

261
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,959
- It's the Jungler. 
 - It's the Mid.

262
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:07,959
Where do you guys come from?

263
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,480
This Mid-Jungler Synergy by Good Luck Team has put a lot of pressure on their opponents.

264
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,360
Pig Rider's Ganjiang is going downward.

265
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,759
The Star-reaching Team must have ideas in this wave.

266
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,600
Looks like Pig Rider is charging at Jingjing's Baili Shouyue.

267
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,620
She has to be careful.

268
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,460
Jingjing, Ganjiang's coming your way. Watch out.

269
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,959
Ganjiang moves up. He sees Baili Shouyue.

270
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,679
Camouflage, and he misses! His ultimate skill also misses!

271
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,600
Shouyue widens the distance and shoots him on the spot!

272
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,300
 Pick up the phone. 

273
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,920
 Continue. 

274
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,840
   

275
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,420
 Red team rampage. 

276
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,700
Spectacular!

277
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,380
Simultaneous hits! It stands to reason that their timing and damage were all clear-cut!

278
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,080
- You're right. 
 - It has to be said

279
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,120
that Jingjing's shot was very critical, and also very precise.

280
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,659
- Reasonably, it was astonishing. 
 - I didn't expect that.

281
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:36,730
I also thought that Jingjing would just pass off.

282
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,359
Whoops, I spoke too soon.

283
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:43,840
But even so, I love her too. Show me the live barrage.

284
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,854
   

285
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:47,179
   

286
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,199
It was refreshing. I could boast about that shot for ten years!

287
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,480
It was so clear-cut!

288
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:56,060
I'm going around. Jingjing, go and give it all.

289
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,100
You sound a little scummy.

290
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,299
You have plenty of health.

291
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,160
Here it is. The star of the show is ready.

292
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,539
Let's take a look at the dying tower. But Shouyue's not leaving.

293
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,800
- He keeps going forward. 
 - Zhuge Liang's closing.

294
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,340
Shouyue wasn't killed. Oh no. Zhang Fei's out of ultimate skill.

295
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,560
- Consort Yu flashes. 
 - Zhuge Liang is coming. Zhuge Liang steps, and sends her off!

296
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,140
- Unstoppable. 
 - She was wiped out.

297
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,719
And if you watch closely, Zhuge Liang's movements in this wave were all predetermined.

298
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,419
He pretends to retreat while he's actually going around.

299
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:23,659
After this wave is over, the momentum is basically all in the hands of the red team.

300
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:25,440
That's right.

301
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,880
Heliu, how much money are you behind?

302
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,299
Over 3,000, but still good.

303
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:31,699
Hua Mulan, don't come over now.

304
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,839
- All right. 
 - Just lead us well.

305
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:34,440
All right.

306
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:37,920
Let's make this quick. Force them into a team fight. Don't give them a chance to farm.

307
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,839
We have the edge now. We can try. Wait till the minions reach the tower.

308
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:43,420
Then I'll engage?

309
00:16:44,059 --> 00:16:46,419
- Lv Bu made a big pounce. He is too rash in this attack. They're throwing. 
 - They gave us an opening.

310
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:48,559
- They are so daring! 
 - Not a single pounce landed.

311
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:51,360
Zhang Fei makes three roars, Zhao Yun counter-attacks,

312
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,960
Zhuge Liang didn't chop off Pig Rider, and Pig Rider turns back around!

313
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,980
 You have been slain. 

314
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,560
 Enemy double kill. 

315
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,500
 Enemy rampage. 

316
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,980
 You have been slain. 

317
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,220
   

318
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,100
To be honest, our amateur player, Lv Bu did pounce a bit early.

319
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,380
Battle Bear, you're more of a tiger than a bear.

320
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,420
We messed up.

321
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,639
It's my fault... I engaged too early.

322
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:19,441
It's okay, they're doing great.

323
00:17:19,441 --> 00:17:22,480
I can buy Bright Moon soon. I'll steal to their rear.

324
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:52,580
When Lv Bu caused an Ace in the last wave, both teams are neck-to-neck in terms of money.

325
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,040
- Lv Bu, retreat. 
 - Minions are almost cleared.

326
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,579
- You're going nowhere. 
 - Lv Bu went a little too far in this wave. He'll get caught!

327
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,699
He has no ultimate skill, so he's done for.

328
00:18:00,699 --> 00:18:02,220
- Lv Bu flashes. 
 - Zhang Fei uses ultimate skill!

329
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,610
 You have been slain. 

330
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,079
   

331
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,800
I'm in a good position. We can win this fight if I surround them.

332
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,459
Zhuge Liang's got a nice spot! No one noticed him!

333
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:11,499
Now. 
    

334
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:13,039
Zhuge Liang killed Consort Yu by a fatal crush,

335
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,279
rather than the ultimate skill, then he steps back.

336
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,599
He's inflicted by Zhao Yun, but the damage wasn't great!

337
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,880
His Bright Moon helps him dodge Zhao Yun's Skill 2.

338
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,400
Zhuge Liang makes his ultimate skill and crushes again!

339
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,119
His Skill 1 contributes a double kill. A passive skill...

340
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:23,120
Triple Kill! There's one more!

341
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,620
Looking for the fourth!

342
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,700
 Quadra Kill! 
   

343
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,660
 Aced. 
   

344
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,200
Nice move! 
    

345
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,559
An amateur player picked randomly made quadra kill?

346
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,940
You're exaggerating.

347
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,619
We won.

348
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:44,000
Your Bright Moon's not bad.

349
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,680
Like he always does.

350
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,280
Don't steal my line.

351
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,960
Zhuge Liang's extraordinary quadra kill has brought the house down.

352
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,340
This Rabbit is definitely one of the King of Amateurs!

353
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,860
The Zhuge Liang was awesome-sauce.

354
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,159
I didn't think this casual player Qiao Jingjing picked can be so damn awesome.

355
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,280
It's bedazzling me.

356
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,470
I'll go home and watch the rerun just so I can see how they did it.

357
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,600
There're minions. Hit the heights.

358
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,680
Without Dark Tyrant and Ruler, they're going to go head-on at them.

359
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,280
They're about to destroy the nexus. Isn't it a bit too confident?

360
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,239
Zhang Fei's doing an ultimate skill.

361
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:11,919
- Lv Bu counter-engages. 
 - Come on, Lv Bu. They are out of rhythm.

362
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,319
Zhang Fei stuns two heroes. Lv Bu pounces pretty well in this wave.

363
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,919
Right in between two players. Shouyue shoots twice at Zhao Yun.

364
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:19,380
Jingjing, be careful when you aim.

365
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,100
Shouyue does a quick scope, and takes down Zhang Fei.

366
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,020
Cai Wenji heals up. Zhou Yin slows down and takes damage.

367
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,259
Shouyue makes a flash and thrashes Consort Yu!

368
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:27,260
- Everyone, push forward. Let's finish this.
- All right.

369
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,119
Zhuge Liang's ultimate skill is locked on Ganjiang. Ganjiang counters but misses.

370
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,480
Shouyue delivers a big blow with his cannon.

371
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,800
Zhuge Liang strategizes behind the frontline.

372
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,179
Baili Shouyue shoots with great precision and makes a headshot!

373
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,140
- What a beautiful shot! 
 - Triple Kill!

374
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,319
Can they end the game? There's enough time.

375
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:47,079
Yes. In such a perfect team fight, Good Luck Team has aced the Star-reaching Team.

376
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:49,200
Get it done!

377
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,019
This is a chance to win!

378
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,240
It's really ending!

379
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,340
Victory in their hands!

380
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,939
Hit the nexus quickly. Hit the nexus.

381
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:56,040
Hit it...

382
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,140
Hit the tower!

383
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,300
Victory!

384
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,470
Let's congratulate... the Good Luck Team!

385
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,739
 Victory! 

386
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:10,740
Jingjing has finally obtained the crucial Triple Kill and completed her self-certification.

387
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,580
I have to say this, but Qiao Jingjing,

388
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,119
you are the most worthy of being the spokesperson of Honor of Kings!

389
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,300
Then, Jade Rabbit, tell me, who exactly are you?

390
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,879
All right, let's congratulate the Good Luck Team for winning the match.

391
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:24,959
Let's congratulate them. Once again, congratulations to Good Luck Team.

392
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,360
   

393
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,980
 - Jingjing! 
 - Jingjing! 

394
00:20:44,219 --> 00:20:45,860
Are you okay?

395
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,730
Yeah, I'm fine.

396
00:20:57,699 --> 00:20:58,939
- Great job! 
 - You did amazing.

397
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:01,740
- Jingjing, that was superb! 
 - That was awesome sauce!

398
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:06,230
Awesome sauce. 
  (they are actually saying 666; 6 sounds like awesome) 

399
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,380
Jingjing.

400
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,580
   

401
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,820
Congratulations to the Good Luck team for winning yet another match.

402
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,359
I'd like to call upon both teams to take centerstage.

403
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:29,450
Please, this way.

404
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,179
Great. Congratulations again to the Good Luck Team.

405
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:42,259
It's a pity that the Star-reaching Team has lost.

406
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:46,039
Do you have anything to say to the audience this time?

407
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:50,399
It's a real pity. But, we were really glad to come here.

408
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:55,659
At the same time, I was also very fortunate to be sniped incessantly by my 'goddess'.

409
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:57,979
What about your teammates?

410
00:21:57,979 --> 00:22:00,680
We didn't expect to lose the second round again.

411
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,960
I guess we somehow took them lightly.

412
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,140
You played well with Zhuge Liang.

413
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:11,259
And your Shouyue was sharp.

414
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:15,220
As for Zhou Yin, enough said. I couldn't stand seeing it.

415
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:17,519
All right, thank you once again.

416
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,800
Could you please give them another round of applause?

417
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,659
   

418
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,979
You know, Jingjing made the most astonishing performance today.

419
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:34,500
- Do you guys agree? 
 - Yes!

420
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,440
All I know is that we're in for another round of exchanging praises.

421
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,520
But can you please show a little restraint? Let me talk a little more, okay?

422
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,860
She is the most powerful female player.

423
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,659
You're flattering me, okay?

424
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:50,259
Speaking about mosts, I'm probably wearing the highest heels today.

425
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:55,259
I just saw you almost fall. So, Jingjing... how are your heels?

426
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:58,620
My feet... My heels?

427
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,419
I'm just kidding.

428
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,660
Jingjing did great. Her Baili Shouyue was a spectacle. I was astounded.

429
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,680
- Were you specially trained? 
 - Yes.

430
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,420
I saw you worked pretty well with your classmate.

431
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,779
Especially in the wave against the Pig Rider. Do you usually team up like this?

432
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:12,700
He plays Zhuge Liang, you play Shouyue?

433
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,019
Actually, no. He can play in any position. Any hero will do.

434
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:20,450
So he's been teaching me.

435
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,180
I also saw that Zhuge Liang was too excellent with his movements.

436
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,890
You did great yourself, Young Man.

437
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,280
Have you thought of joining a pro league?

438
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,480
No, he's too old for that.

439
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Now you've fallen out with him?

440
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,839
Have you forgotten how much he backed you up as his ex-classmate?

441
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:40,740
That's how it should be. Right?

442
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,070
Yes.

443
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,000
What do I do? I can't help but scream!

444
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,880
I feel like I'm not attending a game, but I'm watching Jingjing's idol drama!

445
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,720
I approve this... "brother-in-law."

446
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,279
Me too.

447
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:03,499
Jingjing, Jingjing...

448
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:08,440
Oh my gosh! You were fantastic! I'm more thrilled than you winning a prize.

449
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,939
You sound like I won an official prize.

450
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:13,600
Almost everyone is praising you for that Triple Kill.

451
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,690
Your fans are deifying you!

452
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:18,980
Ms. Qiao? I'd like to invite you to present this year's Toplaner Award.

453
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,939
You may rest at the guest's corner.

454
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:23,710
- All right, I'll be heading there.
- Go ahead.

455
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:28,370
Thank you for your hard work.

456
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,880
Jingjing hugged me so many times today.

457
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,550
I feel like I'm going to become her fan.

458
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,930
Two to zero, and even a Triple Kill.

459
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,360
I didn't expect such a wonderful ending today.

460
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:48,179
Teacher Yu? Thank you.

461
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,520
Thank you, Teacher Yu. I'm so glad to have you. Thank you so much.

462
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,680
You're welcome.

463
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,499
By the way, we've prepared some gifts for our five lucky winners.

464
00:24:56,499 --> 00:25:00,559
In addition, they may choose one hero figurine. Could the two of you please select...

465
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,419
By the way, you may rest at the lounge, where we've prepared snacks and drinks.

466
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,700
Sure, thanks.

467
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,780
- Thank you. 
 - Let's go, Teacher Yu.

468
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:22,499
That was brilliant.

469
00:25:22,499 --> 00:25:25,000
Watching the match at the venue was exhilarating.

470
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,580
The last two waves of team fights almost made my heart jump out.

471
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,800
Did the tension make you thirsty? Here, have some water.

472
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,559
Get some for Teacher Yu too.

473
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,859
Sister.

474
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:37,319
Honor of Kings was very pleased by today's outcome.

475
00:25:37,319 --> 00:25:41,179
I believe that Jingjing's brand endorsement is set for renewal.

476
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:43,280
Come on. Let's wish her well in advance. Teacher Yu.

477
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,459
Here.

478
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:46,359
Ms. Qiu!

479
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:48,060
I'm sorry, Ms. Qiu. I am so sorry.

480
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,200
- Hello there. 
 - I was so busy today.

481
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,079
I couldn't get to you because I had to hand over some prizes.

482
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:56,580
What do you mean? I'm in really good hands.

483
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,299
But you see,

484
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,279
as soon as I entered the VIP room, I started to regret it.

485
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,400
I thought I should've come down to watch, where I could feel the buzz all around.

486
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,760
Great. Next time, I'll arrange for you to come down.

487
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,160
Great.

488
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,519
No problem.

489
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:21,659
Teacher Yu, you may sit down for a while. We have to talk.

490
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,000
Sure, go ahead.

491
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,759
- This way, Ms. Qiu. 
 - Sure, please.

492
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:26,440
Bye, Teacher Yu.

493
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,599
Congratulations to Sweet Dream for winning the most popular Toplaner of the year.

494
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:31,079
Congratulations once again. 
    

495
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:34,160
You may step down and take a break. Thank you.

496
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,640
Our next award is the Most Popular Botlaner of the Year.

497
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,580
Please watch the big screen.

498
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,600
Ms. Qiao, you may rest there.

499
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,760
In half an hour, there will be a photo session.

500
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:46,440
- Right this way. 
 - Jingjing.

501
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,259
As for our nominees for the Most Popular Botlaner this time around, we have five of them.

502
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:53,319
They all come from various categories.

503
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:56,839
One of them is good at using Phantom-type Marksmen.

504
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:00,179
For example, Houyi, Luban No.7, Huang Zhong, Jialuo,

505
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,799
they are all undisplaced Marksmen.

506
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:13,559
Jingjing, your Baili Shouyue was spectacular. Is he your favorite hero?

507
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,720
- Yes. 
 - He was so sharp,

508
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,640
especially with those two shots at Pig Rider.

509
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,599
Actually, it's mainly because I was lucky, and my hands were nimble.

510
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,340
Tell me before you guys take off, okay?

511
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,790
I'll take you through a safe passage.

512
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:25,299
Sure.

513
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,620
Where's Sister Ling?

514
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,060
She and Xiao Zhu are having a meeting with Honor of Kings.

515
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,560
She told her chauffeur to drive you home first.

516
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,319
Your coat.

517
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,819
Thanks.

518
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,959
Did you retrieve it?

519
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,880
A lot of people watched me.

520
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,120
Your phone.

521
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,000
Sister Ling said she'll catch up in a bit. Let's go home first.

522
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,039
But we're not heading the same way. There's a subway station nearby.

523
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,219
I can go by myself.

524
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,760
Don't. You can't go out all alone.

525
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,880
The folks are now scattered outside, queuing up at the exit.

526
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,460
I'll get the staff to take us through a special passage.

527
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:10,050


528
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:19,420
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

529
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:26,880
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

530
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,790
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

531
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:41,540
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

532
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,120
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

533
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,200
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

534
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:55,360
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

535
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,860
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

536
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:09,660
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

537
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:17,500
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

538
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:52,600
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

539
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:59,940
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

540
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:06,860
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

541
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:14,760
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

542
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,340
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

543
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,240
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

544
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:28,600
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

545
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,000
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

546
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:42,940
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

547
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:53,720
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
