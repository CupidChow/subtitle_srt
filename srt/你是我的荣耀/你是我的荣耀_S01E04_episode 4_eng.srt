1
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:15,970


2
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,300
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,160
♫  My heart is like the dust and couldn’t bear 
 to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,800
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,700
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,600
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,400
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,840
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:00,480
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,280
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,940
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:27,700
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:40,100
   

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,980
   

15
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:54,280
I'll pick the items set by the system. I'll pick whatever shows up on the left side.

16
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,999
I saw. Mage's items are usually very conventional.

17
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:59,359
Take Wang Zhaojun for example,

18
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,439
if your opponent is playing as Cai Wenji,

19
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,920
you may buy the Nightmare Fang based on the situation.

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,200
What for?

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,280
To suppress health regeneration.

22
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,020
Also, there is an issue you should know.

23
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,699
What is it?

24
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:18,139
When you play as Support, don't upgrade to Tier Three Support Item.

25
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,280
What is Tier Three Support Item?

26
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,360
Who taught you how to play?

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,159
You said you were a beginner. How do you know so much about it?

28
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,859
You don't need research. I learned about it by playing a few matches.

29
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:37,080
These are the basics.

30
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,139
It's getting late. I won't go up then.

31
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,480
See you tomorrow.

32
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,190
Come over tomorrow at 9 am.

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,520
As you know, it's not convenient for me to go out.

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,240
Sure.

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
See you.

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,940
Bye.

37
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,840
Xiao Zhu!

38
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,879
One of my teenage dreams just came true.

39
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,000
What was it?

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,599
The scholar-god will teach me math!

41
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,840
Hello?

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,199
 Why didn't you reply to my messages? 

43
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,479
 How was it? Is Jingjing back yet? Did he agree? 

44
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,120
He did, but...

45
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,020
 But what? 

46
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,700
But I think they are...

47
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,320
changing to math lessons.

48
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,299
He's back. Relax.

49
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:04,319
Why did it take so long?

50
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,140
I missed the train and had to use another subway line.

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
Save me! Save–

52
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,439
I couldn't save you.

53
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,279
Yu Tu, did you fix the air purifier?

54
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,180
Ask Qiao–

55
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,879
Cotton. It's up to her if the issue is solved for not.

56
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,580
I have something I'm not sure if I should tell you.

57
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,059
 What kind of answer is that? 

58
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,000
Aren't you joining us?

59
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,420
I have something I'm not sure if I should say.

60
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,680
I'm busy. I can't join you.

61
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,900
He started acting weird after going to Cotton's home.

62
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,879
 Cotton. Is your air purifier fixed or not? 

63
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,959
 Yes. Master Yu Tu was amazing. 

64
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,240
 You live with him, are you his colleague? 

65
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,120
No. We studied in college together.

66
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,560
 I just quit my job. The rental contract ended, so I moved out. 

67
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,040
 I'm staying with him while transitioning. 

68
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,000
 Only a handful of people of our age are still single. 

69
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,319
Cotton, were you surprised when you met the mighty Jade Rabbit God?

70
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,020
 He is great at the game, but also strikingly handsome. 

71
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,880
Not bad.

72
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,240
Come again?

73
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,719
 If he's only mediocre to your eyes, you're setting a high bar, Cotton. 

74
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:48,939
   

75
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:51,700
You just stole my kill!

76
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,760
 Who taught you that? 

77
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,519
You're watching a pro match?

78
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,819
When did you start dabbling in this?

79
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:19,800
I think it started with a whim.

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Is Cotton pretty?

81
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:42,930
   

82
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,160
She's like someone you'll see everywhere on the street. 
  (T/N: average-looking) 

83
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,600
Why are you so mean?

84
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,040
How can you say that about a young lady?

85
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,840
It's the truth.

86
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,260
Fine.

87
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,039
Cotton thinks you look...

88
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,020
mediocre.

89
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,460
Nothing special.

90
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,140
Mr. Zhai, please stop bothering me.

91
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,160
Carry on. I'm going to sleep.

92
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,840
Close the door.

93
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,200
Get out.

94
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,240
Then, close the door.

95
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,300
Good night.

96
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,200
 Do you trust me? 

97
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,560
 You're my classmate. 

98
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,510
   

99
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,779
It's only 2 am.

100
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,681
 I missed the train and had to use another subway line. 

101
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,579
 Ask the driver to pick up Yu Tu tomorrow. 

102
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,820
 That doesn't seem appropriate. 

103
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,699
 Right. I forgot to ask for Yu Tu's WeChat. 

104
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,760
   

105
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,640
   

106
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,339
 Jingjing, what was the message you recalled? 

107
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,380
 What did you need me to do? 

108
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,359
 Did you have a stomachache? 

109
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,679
 Bring me two sets of breakfast. 

110
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,459
 Hold on. You don't need to come here this morning. 

111
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,620
 Rabbit God, bring me breakfast. 

112
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,500
Hi.

113
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,279
I casually bought some.

114
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,879
Thanks.

115
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,020
Come in.

116
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,099
The slippers are behind you.

117
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,440
Can we even finish all of this?

118
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
I already ate.

119
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,559
This is all for me?

120
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,660
Do you have some kind of misunderstanding about stomachs in my industry?

121
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,159
I don't know what you like, so I bought a little of everything.

122
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,270
Then we can have the leftovers for lunch.

123
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,040
I won't need Xiao Zhu to bring lunch.

124
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,559
Oh right, since I can't go out,

125
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,960
Xiao Zhu will bring lunch and dinner here.

126
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,240
Is that okay with you?

127
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,280
Dinner?

128
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,740
So my working hour will end at...

129
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,640
9 pm.

130
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,119
As long as your hands are fine.

131
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,080
Are you done eating?

132
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,820
You even brought your laptop.

133
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,679
Who was teaching you how to play?

134
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:05,879
My manager's husband.

135
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:08,080
Did he teach you how to play as Cai Wenji and Sun Bin?

136
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,840
Yes. He thought I would do better as Support.

137
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,459
But after I played with you and your friends, I think I play better with Wang Zhaojun.

138
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,380
Have you watched a pro match before?

139
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:20,859
Let's watch some first.

140
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,700
What do you think?

141
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,920
 He actually asked for a report. 

142
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,039
They didn't die many times.

143
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,559
Unlike us, we die a lot.

144
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,039
They are aware of the damage they take.

145
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,420
Can they win? Is the fight worth it?

146
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,360
They don't start team fights recklessly.

147
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,600
Have you noticed how You Yu from Team Luo Shen played?

148
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,310
The one who used Zhang Fei in the first round?

149
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,960
The commentator mentioned his name a lot.

150
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,840
In the last team fight, he played a decisive role.

151
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,080
He was the MVP of that round.

152
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,360
Support plays an important role.

153
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,740
Sometimes it acts as the commander of the team.

154
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:22,339
Brother A'Guo, my manager's husband,

155
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:25,600
he said Support was easier to play with. Looks like he was wrong.

156
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,200
I can see you're at Gold rank.

157
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,120
You got it yourself?

158
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,440
I was even the MVP (Most Valuable Player) for a few matches.

159
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,299
Try playing with my account.

160
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,679
 My heart melted. 

161
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,240
 First blood. 

162
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,720
Carry on.

163
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,960
   

164
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,340
 You have been slain. 

165
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,930
 You have been slain. 

166
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,079
 Hang in there! We will win! 

167
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,760
 Good job! 

168
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,120
You could play well in Gold rank. But you don't do well in Diamond rank.

169
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,700
The match you'll join has pro players in it.

170
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,870
The difficulty will be even greater.

171
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,879
I didn't know about the challenge you might face.

172
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,519
That was why I thought using Wang Zhaojun was good enough.

173
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,919
The truth is,

174
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,099
this is far from enough to face the challenge that awaits you.

175
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,239
What should I do now?

176
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,899
There is one month left.

177
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,759
Become a King player with your own strength.

178
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,900
   

179
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,080
I think I can do it.

180
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,200
Should we start playing ranked matches now?

181
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,720
No.

182
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,459
We'll do 1v1 matches.

183
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,960
After I went home last night, I watched a few pro matches.

184
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,919
I have a general understanding of the current sandbox of the game.

185
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:37,359
Up next, we will practice with every hero through our 1v1 matches.

186
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,039
Through the matches, you must remember every heroes' skills,

187
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,459
the cooldown of their ultimate moves, damages, and some fine maneuvers.

188
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,360
All of the heroes?

189
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,059
There must be over 100 heroes in this game.

190
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,679
So there aren't that many of them.

191
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:55,759
Yu Ji is one of the best Marksmen in the current sandbox.

192
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,320
She's easier to control.

193
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,979
Her specialty is Skill 2 which gives physical invulnerability and a speed boost.

194
00:16:00,979 --> 00:16:03,840
That protects her from Assassins with physical damage.

195
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,600
 You have been slain. 

196
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,120
Donghuang Taiyi.

197
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,720
This Support suits you.

198
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,079
But you upgraded the wrong skill. You should upgrade Skill 1.

199
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:17,320
 You have been slain. 

200
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,240
   

201
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,240
I must stay strong.

202
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
I must stay strong.

203
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,430
   

204
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,480
 Executed. 

205
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,600
 You have been slain. 

206
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,300
Stop watching!

207
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:03,040
Get ready. We'll practice with Xiao Qiao.

208
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,379
Jingjing!

209
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:12,000
I brought you dinner. How did it go today?

210
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,579
Don't ask me questions I can't answer.

211
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,599
Is there any meat? I want to eat meat.

212
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,279
There's water-boiled chicken breast.

213
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,739
I want braised chicken.

214
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,119
I didn't prepare yours, only Teacher Yu's portion.

215
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,259
We can't have meat at night. Be good.

216
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,520
I'll clean up after Teacher Yu leaves. I won't go inside right now.

217
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,759
Practice well.

218
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,480
Be good.

219
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,720
Do you want some?

220
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,800
It's fine. You eat.

221
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,340
I gained some weight lately.

222
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,799
This isn't fair.

223
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,160
Look. My level is too low.

224
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,079
I'm below level 30. I don't have a full page of runes.

225
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:42,540
Yours is higher than mine. Of course I couldn't beat you.

226
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:48,379
I barely have any runes.

227
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,000
Are you flexing with this?

228
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,800
My ranking is too low.

229
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:59,799
I see.

230
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,799
We've been at it all day. Can you tell which hero suits me the best?

231
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We'll see after a few more days.

232
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,240
You might as well tell me more torture is waiting for me.

233
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,120
Hold on! Wait! No...

234
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,719
 You have been slain. 

235
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,759
I died.

236
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,270
 Enemy unstoppable. 

237
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,640
It's been two days. Can't you just let me win one round?

238
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:02,200
Not winning like this.

239
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,939
Then you're asking too much.

240
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,800
Look at my scores.

241
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,440
 Defeat. 

242
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,240
Yeah.

243
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,720
You can only beat other players.

244
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,280
 I can only win against other players? 

245
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,119
 It's a fact, but you are too narcissistic. 

246
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:32,580
A solo match with other players?

247
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,440
Do you think I can win?

248
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,540
If you can't, then pass me your phone.

249
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,179
Here I go.

250
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,300
 First blood! 

251
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,380
   

252
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,880
   

253
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,379
Did I win already?

254
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:05,179
Continue.

255
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:20,070
 Enemy unstoppable. 

256
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,140
Hurry up.

257
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,459
Can we make a comeback?

258
00:21:28,459 --> 00:21:30,000
You died too many times just now.

259
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,530
You have less money and worse gear.

260
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:35,200
Don't fight him head-on. Sidestep and get him poked.

261
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,280
Remember to clear the minions. Don't let the minions approach the tower.

262
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,880
 Eat this! 

263
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,619
 Can you win against the wind? 

264
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,760
 This is your punishment! 

265
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,160
 He made a comeback after falling so far behind. 

266
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,640
 Were you messing with me earlier? 

267
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:02,920
I told you.

268
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,259
Yu Ji's Skill 2 shields her from any physical damage.

269
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:09,259
But you didn't time the skill well. How about this?

270
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:12,919
I'll use Assassin. You use Yu Ji. We'll continue.

271
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,560
Thank you, Teacher Yu. You've worked hard.

272
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,220
Goodbye, Teacher Yu.

273
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:45,000
I saw Teacher Yu leave while I was downstairs, so I came up.

274
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,719
It took you longer than usual today.

275
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,480
Everything is already cleaned.

276
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,270
Didn't you tell Teacher Yu I would clean?

277
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,499
I couldn't tell him.

278
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,200
He would have known I'm normally too lazy to do my chores.

279
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,319
Then indeed, you need to cover that.

280
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,259
How did it go today?

281
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:05,759
Not only did he teach me math, he played...

282
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,860
I mean, did homework.

283
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,960
Did homework?

284
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:16,080
 After so many 1v1 matches, you should understand all the heroes in this game. 

285
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,260
Next, we'll practice with 3v3 matches. But I'll be your opponent.

286
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,540
How can you be sure you would be matched against me?

287
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,430
There's a function where we can open a lobby in this game.

288
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,730
We each can have two AI teammates.

289
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,999
I'll invite you over.

290
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,940
 You have been slain. 

291
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,130
 You have been slain. 

292
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,410
 You have been slain. 

293
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,620
 Defeat. 

294
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,160
I need some rest.

295
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,920
See? We've been playing with AI teammates almost the whole day.

296
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,360
Let's not get a lobby, okay? 
  (T/N: sounds like let's not get a hotel room) 

297
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,540
Sure.

298
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,599
We should team up and play against others.

299
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,919
I'll allow you to go jungling and skip team fights.

300
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,199
Let me get you some water.

301
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:29,059
Get in the team.

302
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,079
What about rest?

303
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,319
Forget about resting.

304
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:36,059
What rest? I need to win. I'm about to cry because of your torturing.

305
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,640
♫  Right in your world, right next to you  ♫

306
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,180
 Welcome to Honor of Kings. 

307
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,559
 Prepare to engage. 

308
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,680
♫  The end of loneliness comes when I have 
the joy of your company  ♫

309
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,200
Are you jungling with Zhang Fei?

310
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,500
♫  I’ll be there for you every day  ♫

311
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:58,280
I stole your pawn.

312
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
You learn fast.

313
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,599
Money is very important. But do not be reckless to get it.

314
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,420
Don't delay your teammates' farming.

315
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,940
A team fight. My teammate is losing.

316
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,960
   

317
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,939
Why did you suddenly stop?

318
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,540
It's a team fight and you got a call...

319
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,200
   

320
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,559
- Aren't you answering? 
 - Finish the game.

321
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,680
The minions. They got to the tower.

322
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,080
My tower!

323
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,040
 Victory. 

324
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,319
I need to make a phone call.

325
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,519
Sure.

326
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:10,040
I need to go out. Continue with your practice.

327
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,839
Is Xia Qing working in Shanghai too?

328
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,919
She should still be in Beijing.

329
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,480
 She should be? 

330
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,652
Though you say she should be in Beijing.

331
00:26:33,652 --> 00:26:36,240
There are things we can't know for sure.

332
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:41,100
Will I not have a teacher anymore, starting from tomorrow?

333
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,842
Miss, your Americano.

334
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,279
Should we serve the other drink when your friend arrives?

335
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,939
Serve it now. He's here.

336
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,680
I ordered an Americano for you.

337
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,899
Are you here on a business trip?

338
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,820
I am supposed to be in Hangzhou for the business trip.

339
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,960
Why are you in Lujiazui?

340
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,560
I have work here.

341
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,960
I thought you had an interview here.

342
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,080
I had dinner with Dragon King in Hangzhou.

343
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,720
He told me you plan to resign from the institute.

344
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,290
Is that true?

345
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,919
I plan to do so.

346
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,679
Why?

347
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:33,119
You broke up with me to go there,

348
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:35,499
but now you're giving up so easily.

349
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,299
I actually hope you carry on with the work.

350
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:47,540
Otherwise, it would seem as though I meant nothing to you.

351
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,220
Turns out, it's not that you're unwilling to give up,

352
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,759
it's just that I wasn't worth it.

353
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,480
Before we were together,

354
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,040
you knew I wanted to pursue aerospace.

355
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,259
What was the saying again?

356
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,779
The most foolish fantasy is the misconception

357
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:16,140
that you could change a person.

358
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,399
Are you still at QE?

359
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,879
I hopped to another job.

360
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:28,720
I was just promoted to marketing director.

361
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,359
My salary is far more handsome than when I was a fresh grad.

362
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:34,440
There is also more work to do.

363
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,800
You've always been outstanding.

364
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,080
But I'm tired.

365
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,979
I've been thinking.

366
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:46,919
As a woman, why should I work myself to the bones?

367
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,180
Which field do you plan to work in?

368
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:03,480
From what I heard, the DF headquarters in Beijing gave you a job offer.

369
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,240
DF has been doing well these years.

370
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,879
We share the same office building. I know them very well.

371
00:30:08,879 --> 00:30:12,499
If you need any help, I could give you a free consult.

372
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:13,960
Thanks.

373
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,680
But I already turned down the offer.

374
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,420
I see.

375
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,059
Look. It's Qiao Jingjing.

376
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:57,130


377
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:10,580
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

378
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:17,800
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

379
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:24,860
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

380
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:32,640
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

381
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,120
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

382
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,300
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

383
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:46,500
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

384
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:53,660
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

385
00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:00,800
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
that we failed to treasure  ♫

386
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:08,600
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

387
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:43,760
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

388
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:51,000
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

389
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,980
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

390
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:05,660
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

391
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,240
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

392
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,340
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

393
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:19,600
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

394
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:26,700
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

395
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:34,000
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
in the passing time  ♫

396
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:43,420
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
