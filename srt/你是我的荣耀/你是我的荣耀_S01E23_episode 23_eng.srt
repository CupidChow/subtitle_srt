1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:15,000


2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,200
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,200
♫  My heart is like the dust and 
couldn’t bear to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,800
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,600
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,400
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,800
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:00,500
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:08,300
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:15,900
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:28,000
♫  I’ve fallen for you but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:40,050
   

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,100
   

15
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,700
He works in Shanghai. At the Aerospace Research Institute.

16
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,000
The ones that explore Mars, the moon, and the like.

17
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
I didn't want to hide it from you.

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,400
I just wanted to tell you a few days later.

19
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,300
No, we really just started dating.

20
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,400
We just started dating yesterday.

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,600
I'm not lying to you.

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm not being irresponsible.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mom, believe me.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,600
I didn't...

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,600
My mom said that I was irresponsible in my relationship.

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,000
What a coincidence.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,100
My mom said the same thing.

28
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,400
My mom said that I'm inconsiderate of other people's feelings.

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,300
What a coincidence. My mom said the same thing.

30
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,800
My dad even told me to treat you better.

31
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,600
My dad didn't do that.

32
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,300
He doesn't have the right to express his opinion in front of my mom.

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Why exactly are we ruining each other's reputation this way?

34
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sure that you did it first, Ms. Qiao.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Teacher Yu, you're so hard to bully.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I learned from my girlfriend.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Your girlfriend is very innocent.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're the one who has a doubtful nature.

39
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,700
Help me check that.

40
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,000
Perhaps my mom hasn't educated me enough and sent me another message.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,200
Is it that bad?

42
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,600
It's not your mom.

43
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,200
Someone named Zhai Liang sent you a voice message.

44
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,400
He is So Panicky.

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,300
Check what he sent.

46
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,400
So Panicky?

47
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,200
No wonder the name sounds so familiar.

48
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,200
 Yu Tu, I went home for the New Year, and I was forced to go on a blind date indeed. 

49
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,800
 But I quite like the girl. 

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,000
 And she's also working in Shenzhen. 

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,600
 I'll make her my girlfriend in one month and become taken earlier than you. 

52
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,000
The way he speaks is really similar to when we were playing games.

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,400
I'll help you reply to him.

54
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,300
Wish him luck.

55
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,600
Don't scare him.

56
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,800
How would I scare him?

57
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,800
He said that he wished you luck.

58
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
But he became taken earlier than you.

59
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,800
Why isn't he replying?

60
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,400
Perhaps his core processor is burnt.

61
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,800
That's a bit too weak.

62
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,400
   

63
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,000
 Cotton? 

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,800
Hello, So Panicky.

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,200
 Are you really Qiao Jingjing? 

66
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,800
Are you surprised? Is this unexpected?

67
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
 Are you with Yu Tu now? 

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,300
He's driving. It's not convenient for him to talk.

69
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,400
Wait. Let me calm down first.

70
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
My phone fell into my cup earlier.

71
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,800
Later on, if the call gets cut off,

72
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,200
 don't be surprised. 

73
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
 I wiped it dry just now. 

74
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,600
Now I'm taking the risk

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,500
of my phone getting burnt to talk to you.

76
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,800
Do you want to turn off your phone and let it dry first?

77
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,500
 No. Let's make good use of the time. 

78
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,000
Turn the camera towards him.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,700
Let me see if he has a look of love on his face.

80
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,800
I don't think there's any change.

81
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
 There is. 

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
 You haven't lived with him. 

83
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,400
 His facial expression now is the look of love at a typhoon level. 

84
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,500
Typhoon level?

85
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,600
Then his face is a bit paralyzed.

86
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,000
Fine. Let's not look at him.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,600
Turn the camera over.

88
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,400
Were you really classmates in high school?

89
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,600
 Don't find it strange that I'm so surprised. 

90
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,000
 It was really because Yu Tu was usually... 

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,400
 - Well...   
 - How was he usually?

92
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,900
Usually... Usually when he saw your ads on the streets,

93
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,800
he didn't even lift his head.

94
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
- Really? 
  - Yes. 

95
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,200
 A while ago, didn't the game have an event? 

96
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,000
As the game spokesperson, you gave runes to players, didn't you?

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That ad was so beautiful.

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
I myself even took a few more glances.

99
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,800
But he always just got the runes and closed the page.

100
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,200
His facial expression didn't change at all.

101
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,600
 His hands moved so fast. 

102
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,700
 I was right beside him watching him. 

103
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,600
Zhai Liang.

104
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,400
And previously when he helped you fix the air purifier,

105
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,100
I asked him after he came back, "How does that girl look?"

106
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,400
He said, "She's like someone you'll see everywhere on the street."

107
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,200
I remember this very well.

108
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,400
Don't listen to him.

109
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,800
What I meant was

110
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,600
that your ads were everywhere on the streets,

111
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,500
so you could be seen everywhere.

112
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
That happens to prove

113
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,000
that every time I passed by your ad, I did look at it.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,100
Otherwise, how would I know that you could be seen everywhere on the streets?

115
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,200
Am I right?

116
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,100
You're shameless.

117
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,200
You're so shameless.

118
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,300
Get lost.

119
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,600
Survival is more important now.

120
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,400
 Look at him. Isn't he flirtatious? 

121
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,900
 Isn't he flirtatious? 

122
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,800
Based on your reaction and desire for survival,

123
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,800
it was such a waste for you to be single for so many years.

124
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,400
 Cotton. Don't... Don't look at him. Look at me. 

125
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,000
 I'm taking the risk of my phone being burnt to have a video call with you. 

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,200
 Why did you only start dating after I left Shanghai? 

127
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,400
 I can't see you two in person even if I want to. 

128
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Ask him.

129
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,800
No. Am I that easy to pursue?

130
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,200
 That's true. 

131
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,000
 Before I left, there was a period of time when Yu Tu was very down. 

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,400
 It seemed like you tortured him quite badly. 

133
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,000
How was he down?

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,700
What is your phone's model, Zhai Liang?

135
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,000
 What's the matter? Are you planning to get a new phone? 

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,800
If your phone doesn't die in a few more minutes, I'll consider it.

137
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,600
Fine. I'll show you some respect.

138
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,000
 Cotton, I'll still call you that. 

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,700
 Add me on WeChat. I'll give you detailed scoops. 

140
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,600
Okay. I'll check his WeChat later and I'll send you my contact card.

141
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,200
He's letting you use his WeChat so casually nowadays?

142
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,000
Yu Tu, don't you have a limit to how low you can go?

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,400
Cotton, add me. Let's chat later.

144
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,200
Okay.

145
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,800
 I think my phone doesn't have a problem at all. 

146
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,300
 Come on. Let's play a game and see. 

147
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,200
 Okay. 

148
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,840
You dare to play with him?

149
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,500
It should be a while since he last played.

150
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,458
He only had 50 percent skill. Now it should be down to 20 percent.

151
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,699
You're shameless.

152
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:19,198
Are you bearing a grudge? Why are you slandering him this way?

153
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
"Bearing a grudge"?

154
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,500
Did he ever drag me down?

155
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,060
It's hard to say. I will remember what he said,

156
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,820
Mr. "Not worth a glance" Yu about Ms. "Seen Everywhere" Qiao Jingjing.

157
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,499
Enjoy the game.

158
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,780
 I haven't arrived yet. Don't start team fights now. 

159
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,221
 Don't be a coward. Come on. I got three of them! 

160
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:03,879
Wait for me. You started too early.

161
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,470
 You have been slain. 

162
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:14,198
Why are we on the first floor? Have you forgotten which floor my house is on?

163
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,001
What?

164
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:18,740
Yu Tu, are you at Cotton's house?

165
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,560
   

166
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,180
   

167
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,140
 Double Kill! 

168
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,459
Is someone else playing?

169
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:47,440
What are you two doing?

170
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,340
You're insulting my ears.

171
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,859
Listen to my instructions. Go to the top lane.

172
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,800
   

173
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,539
You were right. So Panicky's skill is only 50 percent. You're the most incredible one.

174
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's do a duo matchmaking later.

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,100
I'll go and get something.

176
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,340
My mailbox's pin may be the same as my door's

177
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,580
but didn't you press it a little too smoothly?

178
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,840
I'll make sure to do it less smoothly next time.

179
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,520
It's too late. Why is your letter in my mailbox?

180
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:38,280
Play fewer games and eat more carbs.

181
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,094
What do you mean?

182
00:11:40,094 --> 00:11:42,799
The brain needs sugar to think.

183
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,020
You sent this letter to me.

184
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,100
I remember now.

185
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,900
In the ninth letter, you said I might not receive one of the letters before New Year.

186
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,139
It's regarding the Yutu rover.

187
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:01,180
Jingjing, when I was writing this letter, guess what I was thinking.

188
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,081
What?

189
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,140
This letter is a bit deep.

190
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,310
While writing this back then,

191
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:12,180
I was wondering that when you received this letter,

192
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,459
would I be able to read it to you and help answer your questions?

193
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,324
Do you want to listen to it?

194
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:28,958
"Jingjing, while I'm writing this letter,

195
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,400
the Yutu model is right in front of me.

196
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,659
One day if you see it in my house,

197
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:37,600
you'll surely like it very much.

198
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,420
The model is very small.

199
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,380
The real Yutu is actually not big either."

200
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,840
♫  I write down the greetings I owe you in my heart  ♫

201
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:53,060
♫  Trying to piece together the reason for my longing  ♫

202
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,700
♫  It's the look in your eyes at a moment in my memories  ♫

203
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,020
♫  Today can you feel it  ♫

204
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,300
♫  The stars in the sky can attest  ♫

205
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,740
♫  That you're the one I want to find  ♫

206
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:22,600
♫  In my dream, carved in my memories  ♫

207
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,360
♫  Is your courage that makes me want to treasure it  ♫

208
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,620
You're making me feel sleepy.

209
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,780
Go to bed earlier then. You still have a flight tomorrow.

210
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,259
Don't you need to pack your luggage?

211
00:13:55,537 --> 00:14:00,328
This morning, I already asked Xiao Zhu to do it. She didn't need to come in the afternoon.

212
00:14:03,918 --> 00:14:07,440
Go. The subway won't be running later.

213
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:11,340
I'm staying over tonight.

214
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,779
I'll sleep on the couch.

215
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:21,179
Jingjing, I'll take the initiative in the future,

216
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,320
but I'm not very experienced in taking the initiative.

217
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,139
If it's out of line, remember to tell me.

218
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,157
For example, is it out of line for me to stay over tonight?

219
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,480
Your flight is at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

220
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,178
To go with you to the airport, should I come here at 4 a.m. from my house?

221
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,969
Are you going to send me off tomorrow?

222
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:58,699
Do you require so little from your boyfriend?

223
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:02,940
Even while I'm on vacation, I don't need to send my girlfriend off at the airport?

224
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,499
It's not out of line.

225
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:19,860
It's not out of line.

226
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,879
I really like you this way.

227
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,840
Jingjing, you're up so early...

228
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,380
Teacher Yu.

229
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,100
Good morning, Xiao Zhu.

230
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,559
Good morning. Why are you here?

231
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:09,140
Did you come so early in the morning?

232
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,459
I stayed over last night.

233
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:11,620
Jingjing just woke up.

234
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,540
I'll call her. Come in.

235
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:21,411
He stayed over? She just woke up?

236
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:26,779
Jingjing, Xiao Zhu is here.

237
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:29,265
I'll be done soon.

238
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:36,700
Have you had breakfast? I ordered some breakfast.

239
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,778
I ate already. I brought some breakfast today too.

240
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:51,760
What did you buy?

241
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,620
Xiao Zhu, you're here.

242
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,920
Corn,

243
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,180
boiled egg, soy milk.

244
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,920
I want to eat something with flavor.

245
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,160
I have that. Deep-fried dough sticks.

246
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,217
And look, I got rice balls.

247
00:17:06,217 --> 00:17:10,100
Forget it. I'm overweight.

248
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,099
I also brought some.

249
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,319
This is so sweet. I'll get fat.

250
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,580
I ordered one with no sugar.

251
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,320
This one isn't sweet. You might have gotten the one from the combo meal.

252
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,040
I just drank something with flavor.

253
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,019
Now I feel sad drinking soy milk with no flavor.

254
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:52,540
Do you mind if I drink some?

255
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,180
Try it.

256
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,340
Is it sweet?

257
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,859
Yes.

258
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:26,598
Well... Excuse me.

259
00:18:26,598 --> 00:18:28,100
I have a question.

260
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,939
In the future, is it not convenient for me to come in directly?

261
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:35,021
Should I knock first, then ring the bell and wait for someone to open the door?

262
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,459
I got it. You don't need to answer me anymore.

263
00:18:41,459 --> 00:18:43,920
I'm already a very mature and sensible assistant.

264
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,100
Xiao Zhu, where are you now?

265
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,359
 We're at the airport. 

266
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,400
 We're in the parking lot. We'll be right there. 

267
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,481
I'm at the elevator area of B2.

268
00:18:56,481 --> 00:18:58,801
Tell Mr. Wang not to go the wrong way.

269
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:01,449
 Today's driver isn't Mr. Wang. 

270
00:19:01,449 --> 00:19:03,058
What do you mean?

271
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,960
 I see you now. 

272
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,185
Sister Ling, over here.

273
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,257
Sister Ling, Happy Spring Festival.

274
00:19:25,257 --> 00:19:28,380
Teacher Yu? Why is it you?

275
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,880
The way you look now is similar to how I did

276
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,643
when I opened the door this morning and saw Teacher Yu.

277
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:36,580
This morning?

278
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,068
Opened the door?

279
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,040
Okay. I'll prepare the PR plan immediately.

280
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:52,259
Teacher Yu. From now on, please wear a mask.

281
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:55,520
In the future, this will be a must when you go out.

282
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,939
Will you be going back to Yixing?

283
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:04,419
Yes.

284
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,737
For the Spring Festival this year, I can take my vacation until the seventh day.

285
00:20:07,737 --> 00:20:10,719
I'll go home and let my mom criticize me for a few more days.

286
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,217
I'll go inside first.

287
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:18,760
Until when will you be filming this movie?

288
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,260
It will be quick for movies. Around the beginning of May.

289
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,068
Will you be back in the middle of filming?

290
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,860
It's hard to take days off from the film set.

291
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,920
There's a brand event in the middle of filming,

292
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,200
but the location is not set yet. I might not be in Shanghai.

293
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,721
So we might not be able to see each other for two months?

294
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:39,370
I guess so.

295
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,312
What's the matter?

296
00:20:43,312 --> 00:20:47,100
I realize that I was overthinking before.

297
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,999
I thought that I went on business trips a lot and I was too busy with work,

298
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,060
so I wouldn't have time to take good care of you.

299
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,040
But in reality, you go on business trips more than me.

300
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,120
Who's the one delaying someone's youth?

301
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,900
Is it worth it?

302
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,599
It doesn't matter who delays it. I don't have any objections.

303
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,538
I couldn't look at you two.

304
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:38,800
You were in public.

305
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,520
Weren't you afraid of getting your photos taken?

306
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,217
Be honest with me.

307
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:49,620
When did you start dating?

308
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,101
Was it just the past two to three days when you went home?

309
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:55,539
Did you start dating a long time ago?

310
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,720
Hey. Can you stop giving us such a big surprise?

311
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,720
I need time to prepare.

312
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,820
Tell me the details now so I can prepare the PR plan.

313
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,619
Jingjing.

314
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,201
Did you hear what I just said?

315
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,178
I'm thinking of something even more important.

316
00:22:18,178 --> 00:22:21,841
What else can be more important than this?

317
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:25,340
Dating.

318
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,478
A long distance relationship is very hard.

319
00:22:27,478 --> 00:22:29,779
I have to think about what to do.

320
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,970
   

321
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,820
   

322
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,160
   

323
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,939
   

324
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:19,620
 Nice meeting you. Guess who I am. 

325
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,161
 Nice meeting you. Who are you? 

326
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,758
 I'm your mobile girlfriend. 

327
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,820
 AI Jingjing. 

328
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:46,638
   

329
00:23:46,638 --> 00:23:48,900
   
   

330
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:54,918
   
   

331
00:23:54,918 --> 00:23:56,880
   
   

332
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,080
   

333
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,500
   

334
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,719
 You made that yourself? I can't believe that you can make breakfast! 

335
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,057
 I can only make breakfast. 

336
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,006
 Are you returning to work starting today? 

337
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,941
 Today, we're officially starting filming too. 

338
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,100
 Are you only starting today? 

339
00:25:15,718 --> 00:25:17,517
 We had the table read and confirmed our looks the past few days. 

340
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,445
 We'll start filming today. I'm a bit nervous. 

341
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,400
 Do you still get nervous when filming nowadays? 

342
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,216
 I've never worked with Director Li before. 

343
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:33,619
 Why are you up so early? What time does your work begin? 

344
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,920
 9 a.m. But I usually arrive at 7 a.m. 

345
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,959
 You sleep late and wake up early. Do you get enough sleep? 

346
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,379
 Sleeping four to five hours is enough for me. 

347
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,431
 I hate you. 

348
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,880
 That was why your grades were so good. 

349
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,640
 While ordinary people like us were sleeping, were you secretly studying? 

350
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,828
 In the future, you can observe me in a close distance. 

351
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:11,060
 By the way, you're AI. 

352
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,536
 Considering yourself an ordinary person isn't appropriate. 

353
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:16,340
 I'm sad. 

354
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:20,483
 This AI is shutting down. 

355
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,820
Are you here so early again?

356
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,742
I came earlier to organize some files.

357
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:29,439
 I'll be in the conference room in the morning. My phone won't be with me. 

358
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:32,059
 Okay I'll wait to hear from you backstage. 

359
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,059
 I'll only get reactivated after hearing from you. 

360
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,939
Here have some yogurt.

361
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:50,059
There are the original and white peach oats flavors. Choose one.

362
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:51,600
Thanks.

363
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,944
You eat at the canteen every day, and you're still taking photos?

364
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,280
I'm reactivating my AI app.

365
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,680
Which app is reactivated this way?

366
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,459
The online dating kind.

367
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:25,753
 There's a lot of food! Are they delicious? 

368
00:27:25,753 --> 00:27:27,500
   

369
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,919
AI Girl?

370
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:35,159
Interesting. Is there such a thing in WeChat?

371
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:37,719
Is it a Wechat robot? It's so smart.

372
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,060
I guess you can call it that.

373
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,798
 They taste very good. 

374
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,768
 Are you at the office canteen? 

375
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,456
 We have five canteens in the institute, just like how it was in university. 

376
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:02,217
 Bring me there for a meal next time. 

377
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:04,079
 I haven't eaten in a canteen for so long. 

378
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,381
 Wait. Your office is confidential. Am I not allowed inside? 

379
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,460
 You can enter, but you must leave your ID at the gate. 

380
00:28:11,462 --> 00:28:13,062
 Do you mind? 

381
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:15,668
 Why should I mind? 

382
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:19,402
 My ID picture is as beautiful as a fairy. 

383
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:21,037
 That's good. 

384
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:22,967
 Actually mine isn't bad either. 

385
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,139
It turns out that Teacher Yu is very narcissistic too?

386
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:37,741
What are you talking about?

387
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:41,118
If he's really narcissistic, he can defeat everyone here.

388
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:43,842
But you don't need to be so arrogant.

389
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,580
   
   

390
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,860
 You're filming quite smoothly over there. 

391
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,700
 I'll go back first then. 

392
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,060
Where will the starlight activity be held?

393
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,739
Why didn't we hear anything this year? It's so late.

394
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:06,179
The internal organizers still have some differences in opinions.

395
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:07,499
But don't worry.

396
00:29:07,499 --> 00:29:10,540
I expressed that I hoped it would be held in Shanghai.

397
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,259
I thank you on behalf of Teacher Yu.

398
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:13,459
 There's no need. 

399
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:15,937
 He isn't willing to let me manage him. 

400
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:17,720
Are you still not giving up?

401
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,059
Now I think that if Teacher Yu gets into the entertainment circle, he won't become famous either.

402
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:25,659
Why? Teacher Yu is so handsome and he's so smart.

403
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:27,459
 But he's transparent. 

404
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:29,860
He has an invisible effect. Haven't you noticed?

405
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,860
What?

406
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,580
 He had been going to your house for over a month before 

407
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,650
and no one took any photos of him.

408
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:38,860
Of course, when you were together, you didn't go out often.

409
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,580
 I can understand that. 

410
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:43,279
 But at the airport and in your hometown, 

411
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,219
 you two were so open and brazen already and still no one exposed you. 

412
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,200
 Isn't he transparent then? 

413
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,720
 Sister Ling said that you were transparent. 

414
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,798
 Transparent? 

415
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:13,219
 I can confirm that light rays can't penetrate me. 

416
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:14,909
 What a lame joke. 

417
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,780
So why am I invisible?

418
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,599
 It's very strange. 

419
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:26,739
You went in and out of my house for over a month and no one took any photos of you.

420
00:30:26,739 --> 00:30:27,839
It was the same in the KTV back home.

421
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:29,780
There were so many people, yet no one exposed us.

422
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,699
I know the reason for the latter.

423
00:30:32,699 --> 00:30:36,060
Peipei added everyone there to a group chat and gave everyone money.

424
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,380
Really?

425
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,240
She didn't tell me.

426
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,095
I'll return the money to her.

427
00:30:41,095 --> 00:30:42,580
I'm so touched.

428
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,217
I gave it to her already.

429
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,739
Initially she didn't want to take it.

430
00:30:45,739 --> 00:30:47,820
She said that you gave her a lot of clothes.

431
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,739
 But she quickly thought things through later on. 

432
00:30:49,739 --> 00:30:51,939
 She said that she couldn't let me have the advantage 

433
00:30:51,939 --> 00:30:54,559
 and even asked me to pay her to keep her mouth shut. 

434
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,540
 I knew that she was acting strange that day, saying that she earned 500 bucks. 

435
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,317
She said that she'd return it to us as a wedding gift in the future.

436
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,172
I think that's very reasonable.

437
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,866
How much money did you give?

438
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,780
Around half a month's salary.

439
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,900
That much?

440
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,740
Then they should have just exposed us. What a loss.

441
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:16,141
I'll deduct it from my betrothal gifts in the future then?

442
00:31:16,141 --> 00:31:18,159
I'm going to memorize my script. Bye.

443
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:31,017
 A good boyfriend won't disturb his girlfriend's work. 

444
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:33,799
A good boyfriend won't mention the betrothal gift for now.

445
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,179
 Okay? 

446
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:38,080
Then be good. Don't make a sound. I'm going to memorize my script.

447
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:01,400
"Please show me some respect. Twenty-six years ago..."

448
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,059
"Please show me some respect. Twenty-six years ago..."

449
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,320
What are you doing?

450
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,019
 Writing a letter. 

451
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,420
 Yu Xiaoqiao. A 17-year-old grade 10 student in a senior high somewhere in Shanghai. 

452
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,201
 Since she bought fried chicken for the classmate who tutored her in Math, 

453
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:35,540
 she accidentally won a prize. 

454
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,177
 She got a ticket for a trip to Mars this summer. 

455
00:32:39,177 --> 00:32:40,879
What's this?

456
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:42,939
I promised that I'd answer your question regarding immigration to Mars.

457
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:44,140
Have you forgotten?

458
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,259
Why is there a lead character?

459
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:47,881
Yu Xiaoqiao?

460
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:49,380
 Numbers are too boring. 

461
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,459
If there's a lead character and we use her point of view as a narrator,

462
00:32:52,459 --> 00:32:54,749
 you might find it more interesting. 

463
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,355
This must be hard on you.

464
00:32:58,355 --> 00:33:00,259
You just combined our surnames together.

465
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:02,919
 This name is so random. 

466
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:04,259
Is it random?

467
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:06,060
 We're still very far from immigrating to Mars, 

468
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,298
 so the lead character should be our future generation. 

469
00:33:08,298 --> 00:33:10,500
 There's a possibility of her having that name. 

470
00:33:12,677 --> 00:33:14,757
Okay. Write your letter well then.

471
00:33:14,757 --> 00:33:16,680
I'm going to memorize my script.

472
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:22,319
You're talking about betrothal gifts and future generations.

473
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,077
 That makes sense, 

474
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,060
 but why does she need a tutor in Math? 

475
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,399
 Didn't she get your genes? 

476
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,880
That's a question for you, Ms. Qiao.

477
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,991
Will you allow my genes

478
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:46,255
to influence your genes?

479
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,779
Will you let me memorize my script or not?

480
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,451
Yu Tu!

481
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:11,020


482
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:22,180
♫  I dreamed of starlight pulling the sleeves  ♫

483
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:29,400
♫  A white top covering the thin shoulders  ♫

484
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:36,460
♫  I have seen the wounds healed with each passing year  ♫

485
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:44,140
♫  There will always be people running towards eternity  ♫

486
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,820
♫  The bustling intersection  ♫

487
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,840
♫  Looking back all of a sudden under the dim light  ♫

488
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:58,000
♫  I loved your eyes quietly looking at the starry sky  ♫

489
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,160
♫  And I loved the universe in your heart  ♫

490
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:12,400
♫  Time does not stop, remembering the time 
 that we failed to treasure  ♫

491
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:20,600
♫  The wind passes by the tall buildings with no one awaiting it  ♫

492
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:55,260
♫  I've dreamed of traveling around the planet  ♫

493
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:02,500
♫  Seeing the galaxy pass through the clouds  ♫

494
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:09,580
♫  I looked at the hills with sorrow  ♫

495
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:17,260
♫  Will the exit of the dream lead to the end of the starry sky?  ♫

496
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,740
♫  Looking back all of a sudden  ♫

497
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,940
♫  Which galaxy am I drifting on?  ♫

498
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:31,200
♫  Looking into the distance, which of the stars are your eyes?  ♫

499
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:38,200
♫  It's out of reach, so dazzling and hard to get  ♫

500
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:45,600
♫  Time does not hold back, the spring and autumn 
 in the passing time  ♫

501
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:55,740
♫  The wind sings the song of freedom as I listen 
 to the tenderness of time  ♫
