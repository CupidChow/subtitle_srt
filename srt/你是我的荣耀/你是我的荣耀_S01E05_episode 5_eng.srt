00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,300
♫  You crossed the sea of stars bringing along the light  ♫

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,160
♫  My heart is like the dust and 
couldn’t bear to stain the hemline  ♫

4
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:36,600
♫  Love in a different way with the star fancying the firework  ♫

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,600
♫  I turned around and realized that my heart is missing a piece  ♫

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
♫  Longing overflows the galaxy and surges into the ocean  ♫

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,500
♫  Even the firework wants to give the star a future  ♫

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,940
♫  As long as you are here  ♫

9
00:00:52,940 --> 00:01:00,580
♫  Even the firework is afraid to burst  ♫

10
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:08,180
♫  Watching the light in your eyes dim  ♫

11
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:15,940
♫  I laugh at myself and know I deserve it  ♫

12
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:28,100
♫  I’ve fallen for you, but I’m afraid I’m not worthy 
 of the future you want  ♫

13
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:40,200
   

14
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,080
   

15
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,720
 Which field do you plan to work in? 

16
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,319
From what I heard, the DF headquarters in Beijing gave you a job offer.

17
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,459
DF has been doing well these years.

18
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,499
I know them very well.

19
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:06,160
If you need any help,

20
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,099
I could give you a free consultation.

21
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,599
Thanks, but I already turned down the offer.

22
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,019
I see.

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,760
Look. It's Qiao Jingjing.

24
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,600
   

25
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,800
If she thinks about us now,

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,080
will she find us very laughable?

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,039
We had the best grades in our class, back then.

28
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,600
Now, we can't catch up to her.

29
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,519
She wouldn't.

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,679
You're quite confident.

31
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,060
My flight is in two hours. I have to go.

32
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,120
I'll take you to the subway station.

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,079
I haven't taken the subway in years.

34
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,279
After getting off the plane, I have to meet a client.

35
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,459
I won't squeeze in with the passengers in the subway.

36
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,399
Hello. May I ask if you are the passenger with the mobile number ending in 9472?

37
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,699
Yes.

38
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,559
You know why I came, right?

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,099
You're only thinking about the sky above your head.

40
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,160
Are love and other things

41
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,960
so insignificant to you that are not even worth mentioning?

42
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,240
You don't need to mock me.

43
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,419
I'm not mocking you.

44
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:19,439
I'm just expressing my sentiments.

45
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,559
You shouldn't hold up other people.

46
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,179
Why are you back?

47
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:06,799
Didn't you say that we finish at 9 p.m.?

48
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,959
 It hasn't even been an hour yet. 

49
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:14,160
 Did it go too smoothly, or did they not get along and just part ways? 

50
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,559
I just said it randomly. If you're busy...

51
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:21,139
I'm not busy.

52
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:23,039
Let's continue.

53
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,100
 I think they've parted ways. 

54
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,999
After I left, did you practice?

55
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:29,119
I did.

56
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,160
Let me see the results.

57
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,579
Are you even checking homework?

58
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,179
Your damage output is quite good.

59
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,040
Of course. I've improved a lot lately.

60
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,460
Continue. I'll watch you play.

61
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,420
So Panicky is here too. Should I ask him to join us?

62
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,679
Sure. 
    

63
00:06:08,679 --> 00:06:10,880
Why are we fighting 3v3?

64
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,600
How boring.

65
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,900
I'm practicing a small-scale team fight.

66
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,680
You're quite diligent.

67
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,000
Cotton, do you want to consider having me as your teacher?

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,859
Why?

69
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:25,660
Because your Jade Rabbit God

70
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,900
will have a girlfriend soon.

71
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,959
   

72
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,920
 He's been leaving early and coming home late. I'm not sure what he's been doing. 

73
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,040
   

74
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,979
 Later on, I heard from Slimebag that something's going on with him. 

75
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,640
 But I can't tell you. 

76
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,200
That means you must hang out with me, from now on.

77
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,440
 He doesn't have time to play with you anymore. 

78
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,839
- Really? 
  - Yes. 

79
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,879
He's already leaving early, coming home late, and feeling restless.

80
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,860
   

81
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,060
   

82
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,940
Focus.

83
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,179
 Cotton, why are you so quiet now? 

84
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,279
 - Focus. 
 - How am I not focused? 

85
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,419
Stop typing, speak.

86
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,220
Xiao Zhu is here to bring dinner.

87
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,820
I'll get it.

88
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,580
Xiao Zhu, the yogurt I told you to buy...

89
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,979
I saw that your lights were on when I passed by, so...

90
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:26,479
Excuse me.

91
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,319
Don't you need to explain things to him?

92
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:39,279
We already broke up two years ago, what's there to explain?

93
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,280
And he's so pretentious.

94
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,319
Jingjing, just now, downstairs, why did I see...

95
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,440
- Teacher Yu. 
 - How could he come up?

96
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,400
Wasn't his biometrics for the elevator already deleted?

97
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,640
But he still has the password.

98
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,479
The password was originally changed too, but you kept forgetting it,

99
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,719
so I changed it back.

100
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,420
Then go to Property Management for me to change it again.

101
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,640
Change it to 1316.

102
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,740
What's that?

103
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,559
It's my best result so far.

104
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:13,280
13:1:6. Don't worry, I won't forget it.

105
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,079
Isn't it a bit strange today?

106
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:33,259
What's the matter?

107
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:37,890
Our exes who have lost contact with us for many years, appeared at the same time.

108
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,780
I was with him for over half a year.

109
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,420
One day, he suddenly told me that his family didn't like people in my line of work.

110
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,540
He wanted me to retire from the entertainment industry before he told his family about me.

111
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,820
So I told him, "My family doesn't like those doing business, either.

112
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,499
It's very risky, and it's easy to go bankrupt. Why don't you resign first?

113
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:01,070
Otherwise, my family won't approve of you, either."

114
00:10:02,699 --> 00:10:07,600
Mr. Su is actually very talented. He has a good reputation.

115
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,579
Do you know him?

116
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:13,980
I studied Finance at university, I pay attention to the news in that field.

117
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,910
But you must not be aware that he's very narcissistic.

118
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:24,590
What about you?

119
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,880
What about me?

120
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,590
You and Xia Qing, why did you break up?

121
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,220
Peipei told me about it.

122
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,719
She said that you got together in your junior year of college.

123
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,119
She often tells me stories about our classmates.

124
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:45,700
If you don't want to tell me, pretend I didn't ask.

125
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:50,219
It's fine.

126
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:53,000
Because of work, after I finished my Bachelor's degree,

127
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,790
I left Beijing and studied for my master's and doctorate degrees in Aerospace Engineering.

128
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:59,650
So it was because of long distance.

129
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,939
But I was quite surprised back then that you took Finance as a major.

130
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:08,920
I always remembered that your dream is the galaxy.

131
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,660
Why did you major in Finance?

132
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,980
My parents didn't approve of the major I chose, back then.

133
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,320
But I thought that I could do both.

134
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,830
I was a bit young and frivolous.

135
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:30,499
But you really did it. You even got your doctoral degree.

136
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:33,070
You're indeed the scholar-god of our class.

137
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,880
But why are you having such a long vacation?

138
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,630
Isn't it very busy doing research?

139
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,740
Because

140
00:11:53,499 --> 00:11:56,350
I'm planning to give up on the galaxy.

141
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,730
 Yu Tu, Chang'e 1 has been launched. 

142
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,839
 Someone else is a step ahead of your dream. 

143
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:31,980
 That's perfect, isn't it? 

144
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,139
 Perhaps, by the time I graduate, the moon base will have been built. 

145
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:39,400
 I'll use the moon as a starting point to conquer Mars and fly through the solar system. 

146
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:15,440
 Because I'm planning to give up on the galaxy. 

147
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,300
When did you come home?

148
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,740
I wasn't aware.

149
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,820
I've been back a while now.

150
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,020
You were taking a call outside.

151
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:48,190
Did you meet with Xia Qing?

152
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:50,399
How did you know?

153
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,259
How did I know? Who am I?

154
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:55,250
How did it go?

155
00:13:56,619 --> 00:13:58,660
I really wasn't the one who told her.

156
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,220
Xia Qing went to Hangzhou for a meeting and met with Dragon King.

157
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,220
Wasn't it very normal to talk about you?

158
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,619
You have so much free time.

159
00:14:05,619 --> 00:14:07,740
You should go and work in Shenzhen earlier.

160
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,320
Also, stop speaking nonsense in front of Cotton.

161
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,080
Did Cotton tell on me?

162
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,310
I'll go into the game and deal with her.

163
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:23,990
Go ahead.

164
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,360
Forget it.

165
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,579
Cotton's game has improved a lot lately.

166
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,719
And it's not easy to have a girl on our team.

167
00:14:34,719 --> 00:14:37,079
By the way, Qu Ming called me earlier saying that

168
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,139
he wanted to treat us to a meal tomorrow.

169
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:41,740
At Lujiazui, 6:30 p.m. Let's go together, okay?

170
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,059
- Tomorrow, I... 
 - Don't.

171
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:44,660
Don't keep acting this way.

172
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,100
That stingy guy is finally treating us to a meal, and it's my send-off party.

173
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
Show me some respect, okay?

174
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,200
Let me tell you.

175
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,940
Our University classmates in Shanghai are all going.

176
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,610
Think about it carefully.

177
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,059
Hi, Sir. Do you have a reservation?

178
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,100
It's under Mr. Qu.

179
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,619
All right. Okay, please follow me.

180
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:29,119
How many times did I tell you? You just wouldn't buy it.

181
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:31,519
Now, you've lost money.

182
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,320
That was silly, right?

183
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:35,939
You lost the advantage, right?

184
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:38,480
- Yu Tu. 
 - Hello.

185
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,100
The great talent who has a double major is here.

186
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,500
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

187
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,939
Welcome.

188
00:15:46,939 --> 00:15:49,919
Everyone's here. We're not late, right?

189
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,119
You are. You both are late.

190
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,200
You're late. Why did you arrive together?

191
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,579
Lujiazui isn't big. We met along the way.

192
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:57,980
You happened to meet.

193
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,100
Guys, I'm so happy that Yu Tu can come today.

194
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,459
I thought you were ignoring us.

195
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:06,760
Back in school,

196
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,700
if you weren't at the library, you were hanging out with people from other departments, right?

197
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,220
You wouldn't hang out with us.

198
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,700
Those who weren't aware would think that he was from the Aeronautics Department.

199
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,719
No.

200
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,599
In the sports team, Yu Tu was our department's main force.

201
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,980
- Right. 
 - Which sports team?

202
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,100
- Basketball or soccer? Tell us. 
 - Basketball.

203
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,159
That's nonsense. I was the Basketball Team's captain.

204
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,660
Wouldn't I know that?

205
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,780
I was in the center position in the team before. Right? Yu Tu...

206
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,740
 After all these years, why is Qu Ming still so fond of teasing you? 

207
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,399
 You've already broken up with Xia Qing. There's no reason for him to do that anymore. 

208
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:36,459
Qu Ming, didn't you say that Xia Qing was coming too?

209
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:37,960
Why isn't she here yet?

210
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,439
Right. Let me call her.

211
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:42,859
She should be on her way.

212
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,620
Wait.

213
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,890
Emma, why aren't you here yet?

214
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,150
Tell me.

215
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,020
The restaurant is so close to your hotel.

216
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,000
It's fine.

217
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,400
Do your work first. It's okay. Let's meet next time, okay?

218
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,100
All right. Bye.

219
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,500
What's the matter?

220
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,400
Is the beautiful Ms. Xia not coming?

221
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,000
She has urgent matters to attend to in Beijing.

222
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
She just arrived at the airport.

223
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,400
Why didn't she inform you?

224
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,600
No. She was about to call me.

225
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,000
That's too bad. We haven't seen each other in so long.

226
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,800
Yes.

227
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,400
Xia Qing is apologizing to us in our group chat.

228
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
 I originally agreed to meet you guys today. 

229
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,000
 I had urgent matters to attend to yesterday and went back to Beijing. 

230
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,200
 I forgot to inform you all. 

231
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,500
Qu Ming, didn't you say that Xia Qing just went to Beijing today?

232
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,400
What's going on?

233
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,700
Let's order.

234
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,000
Right, let's order.

235
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,400
You guys were so chaotic earlier. I heard her wrong.

236
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,000
- Right. 
 - Don't mind her.

237
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Let's order.

238
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,400
Waiter.

239
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,800
He has another motive. 
  (T/N: idiom. wine-lover's heart is not in the wine) 

240
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,200
Why did he organize a reunion as a send-off party for me? What send-off?

241
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,000
He just wanted to meet Xia Qing.

242
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He couldn't get her to meet him, but he got to meet you.

243
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Isn't he afraid of making himself look like a dork?

244
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,600
Lafite 1990. That's a good year. Let's drink to our heart's content.

245
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,100
Right.

246
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,300
By the way, Yu Tu,

247
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,000
that day, I met someone from the class next to ours.

248
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,400
Did he say that you went to apply for their company?

249
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
What was the name again?

250
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,700
I forgot the Chinese name.

251
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,200
Anyway, it's a state-owned company under Ren Wang.

252
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,600
Doesn't Yu Tu work in the Aerospace Research Institute?

253
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,400
- Yeah. 
 - Yeah.

254
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,400
So, Yu Tu, are you planning on switch jobs?

255
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,000
Let me remind you.

256
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,500
If you switch jobs now, it'll be like starting over again.

257
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Guess the salary.

258
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,200
It will be exactly the same as a fresh graduate.

259
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,200
Why are you even worse than me?

260
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,700
If Teacher Yu sees my results tomorrow, he'll surely lecture me.

261
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,700
Hello?

262
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,400
Hey, Jingjing.

263
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,800
You told me to buy a salad. Guess who I ran into?

264
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,700
The Chief Coach of 80 Heroes, Teacher Yu.

265
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,000
 You knew? 

266
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I know that he's going to have dinner there, so I remembered that place's salad.

267
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,400
 Come back after buying salad. Don't go look for Edward. 

268
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
 He won't accept my money again. 

269
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,200
I know. I'm just buying salad.

270
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Why would I go to the owner?

271
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,800
I'm just sitting here on the side.

272
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,200
Teacher Yu is sitting right in front of me.

273
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,900
 Don't disturb him. 

274
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,200
 I know. 

275
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,700
However,

276
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
I see someone who's very unfriendly to him.

277
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,700
He keeps mocking him.

278
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,900
 He's so harsh. I'm so furious. 

279
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,000
It's fine if you have some difficulties.

280
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,200
You can find former classmates like us.

281
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,400
We'll give you some recommendations.

282
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,200
He works in a confidential unit.

283
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,000
There's a period of confidentiality if he resigns.

284
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,600
Do you understand that? If you don't, don't speak nonsense.

285
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Just because Xia Qing won't come on a date with you,

286
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,000
don't aim at him.

287
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,700
Don't speak nonsense.

288
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,600
Will you only live until you're 30?

289
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,300
What does that mean?

290
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,600
Why are you in such a hurry?

291
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,800
We have a long way to go.

292
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Let's see what will happen after a while.

293
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,800
I forgot.

294
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,600
You're a great scientist.

295
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,800
Of course, you're looking down on people like us in Finance.

296
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,400
First, don't include the "us."

297
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,000
Qu Ming, don't slander Yu Tu.

298
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,800
He doesn't look down on us.

299
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,300
Those in the field of research

300
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:58,100
aren't better than those in Finance, and vice versa.

301
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,600
But people can be narrow or open-minded.

302
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,000
- What's the matter? 
 - Let's not talk about that.

303
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Aren't we here today for Zhai Liang's send-off party?

304
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
- Right. 
 - So let's not forget the star of the night.

305
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,200
- Right. 
 - No, don't give me a send-off.

306
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,800
Don't say that. I'm not the star of the night.

307
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,300
Actually Qu Ming is.

308
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,000
I understand Qu Ming's intention today. It has nothing to do with me. What reunion?

309
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,400
A send-off party for me?

310
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,700
He has another motive.

311
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,400
When I just resigned,

312
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,700
my annual salary was just a million.

313
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,500
The fund I was managing was just in the nation's top ten.

314
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,400
I didn't feel like I was so great.

315
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,200
Everyone is a junior in front of big shots.

316
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,500
Don't be arrogant. Don't show off.

317
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,000
But some kind of people just earned a few bucks more

318
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,800
and forgot who he is already. He's arrogant now.

319
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,600
- No, Zhai Liang. 
 - That's enough.

320
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,400
Zhai Liang, you stop it, too.

321
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,500
Zhai Liang.

322
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,200
When was your annual salary one million?

323
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,300
You didn't even buy us a drink.

324
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,600
- Right. 
 - You're such a bad friend.

325
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,400
- You're a bad friend. 
 - Before leaving, you must make it up to us.

326
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,000
Fine. Let's drink to our heart's content at home.

327
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,700
Lafite 1989.

328
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,600
Our wine is here.

329
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,600
Mr. Yu, I brought over the wine that you and Ms. Qiao stored here.

330
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
These are our owner's compliments to Mr. Yu.

331
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,000
Please enjoy.

332
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Sir, your wine will arrive in a while.

333
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,800
Yu Tu, have you been here before?

334
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,000
Romanee-Conti.

335
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Seriously?

336
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,100
Yes, look.

337
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Nice, Yu Tu.

338
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,200
- Nice. 
 - Let me see.

339
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,600
I wasn't expecting this from you.

340
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
This wine costs at least...

341
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,400
I have to go. You guys enjoy.

342
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Let's meet another time.

343
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,900
He took the wine too.

344
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,200
Right.

345
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,500
Qu Ming.

346
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,700
Eat, it's free.

347
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,600
Eat up, it's free. Eat.

348
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,400
Let's eat.

349
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,800
Xiao Zhu, did you forget something again?

350
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,700
Why did you come back?

351
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,200
Did you bring the wine too?

352
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,600
I couldn't bear to let them drink it, so I brought it back.

353
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,400
I knew where you were going,

354
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,800
so I remembered that restaurant's salad.

355
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,000
I told Xiao Zhu to buy some. Then...

356
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,600
Do you think I'm too nosy?

357
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,700
Am I the type who's unable to distinguish between good and bad?

358
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,400
I think so too.

359
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,600
How was it then? Did you feel cool and happy?

360
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,500
Like having a successful rocket launch.

361
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,700
To celebrate the rocket launch, do you want to have a drink?

362
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,100
Even if it's just a few hundred bucks, we can't waste it.

363
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,000
A few hundred bucks?

364
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,200
Right. Do you think I'm stupid?

365
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,500
Will I treat people I don't know to such an expensive bottle of wine?

366
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,300
I know the restaurant's owner. I filmed there before.

367
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,100
That was an empty bottle that I used during the shoot.

368
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,700
Are we going to drink it or not?

369
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
Anyway, I won't be playing games today.

370
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,500
My left thumb already has a bunion.

371
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,100
I'll get some glasses.

372
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,600
It's a bit silly to sit here.

373
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,000
Let's sit where the French windows are.

374
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,100
Yu Tu, come with me.

375
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,700
Hurry.

376
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,300
Help me move those things over there.

377
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,919
Candles.

378
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:59,199
Add some fruits.

379
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,900
Even though we have limited resources, these will do.

380
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,750
This way, please, Teacher Yu.

381
00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:39,660
Twenty minutes.

382
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,360
What?

383
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,480
Thank you for letting me drink

384
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:12,175
Romanee-Conti that only costs a few hundred bucks.

385
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,260
Thank you for teaching me how to play games.

386
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,460
Wait.

387
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,560
Let me check something.

388
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,340
   

389
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,080
   

390
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,460
Good thing the calorie count isn't too high.

391
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,680
Bottoms up for me for this glass, then.

392
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,320
The rest is yours.

393
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,020
Okay.

394
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:43,520
Red wine is a bit sour and bitter.

395
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,080
Rice wine still tastes better.

396
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,280
The kind that's made back in our hometown. My mom would make it every year.

397
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,719
Does your family know how to make it?

398
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,079
Yes.

399
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,920
But it's too sweet.

400
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,319
But it tastes good.

401
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,419
The calorie count must be very high, too.

402
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,839
- That's out of line. 
 - It's just a friendly reminder.

403
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,239
Here.

404
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:30,039
 So, Yu Tu, are you planning on switch jobs? 

405
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:33,639
 If you switch jobs now, it'll be like starting over again. 

406
00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:35,660
 Guess the salary. 

407
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,420
 It will be exactly the same as a fresh graduate. 

408
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,520
 I always remembered that your dream is the galaxy. 

409
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,119
 Why did you major in Finance? 

410
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,119
 Dreams and sentiments don't earn money. 

411
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:54,480
 If you live your life this way, don't you think you are wasting your high intelligence? 

412
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,119
Today, while you were out for dinner, I matchmade with others.

413
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,560
My teammates were all bad.

414
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,239
I chose Wang Zhaojun in one round, and my teammates chose Ying Zheng and Daji.

415
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:28,840
The opponents were equipped with the siren cloak.

416
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,040
You know what? I charged forward back then.

417
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:38,020

 Who is it? 

437
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,820
 My former classmate. 

438
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,620
 We're just getting to know each other.
