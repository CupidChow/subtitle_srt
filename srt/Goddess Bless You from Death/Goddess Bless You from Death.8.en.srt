1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,480
It will happen again.

2
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,720
The killer did everything to the victim.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,680
Just like the Tree Murders, seven victims.

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,160
If a murder like this happens,

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,880
it means the main suspect you arrested
is not the real killer.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,600
I want to be a real cop.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,240
Not someone’s puppet.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,640
May I go in and look at Ta Khuean’s office?

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,520
Sure.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,120
He brought dirty money in,
ran it through the place, laundered it.

11
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,280
You think the killer is trying to find victims
to complete all seven days?

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,480
If it’s the same killer,

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,960
he’s looking for seven new sacrificial victims.

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,760
This is Ta Khuean’s debtor?

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
Yes.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,480
I’ve contacted everyone already.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,040
This is the only one I still can’t reach.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,000
No one knows where he’s gone.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,160
I tried contacting people at Santi Tham House,

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,720
to see if anyone knew this man.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,680
They said Warit

22
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,520
often ate free meals at the soup kitchen,

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,039
and often borrowed money from people
at Santi Tham House.

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,600
Ta Khuean.

25
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,600
Let me borrow some first this time, uncle.

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,280
Alright, alright.

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,280
Here, sign for the last round first.

28
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,640
Where are you going?

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,360
To the end of the alley.

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,960
Then let’s go together.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,560
He couldn’t keep the cash rotating.

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,760
And lately, gambling too.

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,240
So he stopped showing up much.

34
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,000
Gambling at Ta Khuean’s den?

35
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Yes.

36
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,520
Got the address yet?

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,479
Then come with me, Sing.

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,479
Ko, help follow up the warrant.

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,720
Yes, Inspector.

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,840
Hello. What’s up?

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,800
Someone sent a Sia-Kaban doll to Darin.

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,680
It was hidden inside a figure.

43
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,360
A Sia-Kaban doll?

44
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,800
I’ll send photos.

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,800
This place isn’t far from Santi Tham House.

46
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,760
Hello. Anyone here?

47
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,560
Who is it?

48
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,480
I’m Inspector Sing.

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,600
From the Special Investigation Unit.

50
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,400
Thought it was a creditor.

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,160
What did he mess up this time?

52
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,560
Nothing yet.

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,520
Just here to ask for some information.

54
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,960
May I come in and talk inside?

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,600
I haven’t heard from him for days.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,520
Didn’t you go look for him?

57
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,040
Why would I?

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,760
All he does is cause trouble.

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,120
Only creditors ever come chasing his debts.

60
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,600
Anything unusual about
your younger brother lately?

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,280
Recently he seemed spaced out,
like scared of something.

62
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,560
Probably the creditors.

63
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,880
The other day I saw him on the phone.

64
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,160
After the call, his face went pale.

65
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,320
He said,

66
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,960
I’ll find the money to pay you back.
Please don’t do anything to me.

67
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,160
Sounded like a death threat?

68
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,440
Seems like it.

69
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,200
Warit liked drawing symbols on his belongings.

70
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,360
P'Sing.

71
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,960
This has only a name… no sender.

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,560
Help me open it.

73
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,080
Oh no, I won’t.

74
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,680
If you want to open it,
open it yourself.

75
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,240
Lion Head.

76
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,920
Wijitmawan.

77
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,160
Mae Sue for Sunday.

78
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,320
Last time, the Sunday pattern
was interrupted.

79
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,920
I think

80
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,520
might be the next victim.

81
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
Hello.

82
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Thank you.

83
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,520
Thank you.

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,080
At the scene, only a wallet
and a lighter were found.

85
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,240
That’s all?

86
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,600
That’s all.

87
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
V.

88
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,520
Same as what I found at home.

89
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,040
P'Sing.

90
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,520
Take it. Hold on to it.

91
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,320
What is it?

92
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,360
Can I try something?

93
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,280
Try what?

94
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,400
Do you remember…

95
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,440
the ghost that keeps appearing to me?

96
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,400
I think maybe he can help us.

97
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,400
You’re going to talk to a ghost?

98
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,240
Aren’t you scared?

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,120
Of course I am.

100
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,160
But if this is the only way

101
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,280
to get evidence to keep investigating,

102
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,120
I’ll try.

103
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,760
Okay.

104
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,400
But if anything happens,

105
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,160
shout for me.

106
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,560
I need your help.

107
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,040
I’m looking for a man.

108
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,680
I don’t know where he is.

109
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,720
I know you’ve been watching over me all along.

110
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,480
Can you help me again?

111
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,240
You know, right…

112
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,120
where the man P'Sing and I are looking for

113
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,440
is.

114
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,320
P'Sing.

115
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,720
He’s right behind there.

116
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,520
So you came to check this spot

117
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
because a ghost told Thup?

118
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,120
If you don’t believe it, go back first.

119
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,400
I’ll handle it myself.

120
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,480
And another thing, I don’t believe in ghosts.

121
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,120
But I believe Thup.

122
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,400
Thup.

123
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,680
Wait in the car.

124
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
Yes.

125
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,520
Inspector.

126
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,560
We found a phone.

127
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,680
Okay.

128
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Khem.

129
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,320
Took you long enough to answer.

130
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,880
Bring my money back. Now.

131
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,000
Or get ready to hand over your organs
for me to sell.

132
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,120
Hello. Hello, hello.

133
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,040
What are you freaking out for?

134
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,880
Ta Khuean’s voice.

135
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,160
I’ll have someone trace the phone signal.

136
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,160
-Paijit.
-Yes.

137
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Handle the rest.

138
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,960
Yes, sir.

139
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Sey.

140
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,800
What is it?

141
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,000
P'Sing, when are you coming?

142
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,280
Darin’s in bad shape, P'.

143
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,640
I’ll go myself.

144
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,360
You’re going yourself?

145
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,600
Yeah.

146
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,440
Take care of things here.

147
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,800
Don’t worry.

148
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,280
From here on, I’ll do everything right.

149
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,720
What’s wrong?

150
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,440
I’m sorry.

151
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,320
If I’d thought of this sooner,
it wouldn’t have ended like this.

152
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,800
Why blame yourself?

153
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,800
Without you, I wouldn’t have found Warit.

154
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
But it was still too late.

155
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,640
Thup, listen to me.

156
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,359
You were a key part
in helping me find the body.

157
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,079
People who doubted you

158
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,040
will stop calling you superstitious.

159
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,440
Really?

160
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,640
Really.

161
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,680
Then…

162
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,560
is there a reward?

163
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,760
That’s enough.

164
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
What’s this?

165
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,240
A wildflower bracelet.

166
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,200
I was waiting for you…

167
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,040
so I made it for fun.

168
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,080
Perfect timing.

169
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,360
You even know my size?

170
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,480
Not just wrist size.

171
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,480
Other sizes too.

172
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,320
Pervert.

173
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,080
Get in the car.

174
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
What?

175
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,040
The big reward,
go get it at home.

176
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,360
Then let’s hurry home.

177
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Hey.

178
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,080
Where’s P'Sing?

179
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,760
Don’t look at me like that.

180
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,440
I’m still the lead on this case.

181
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,920
And I’m worried about you guys too.

182
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,720
Sey, tell me what happened.

183
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,920
Out of nowhere, a package arrived.

184
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,520
Sent to us.

185
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,480
Addressed to Darin.

186
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,720
At first we thought it was a freebie.

187
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,480
So we didn’t think much of it.

188
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,240
But when we were about to,

189
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,720
You don’t need that much detail.

190
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,440
Just normal housework.

191
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,960
Accidentally hit it, it fell and broke.

192
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,720
That’s how we saw what was inside.

193
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,320
Okay.

194
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,600
Then I’ll check the surrounding area.

195
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,640
To collect evidence.

196
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,120
Go ahead.

197
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,920
-Ko.
-Yes.

198
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,320
Check every package.

199
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,520
And get the CCTV from forensics.

200
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
Yes.

201
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,080
Darin.

202
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,920
-What?
-Come here.

203
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,200
What’s wrong?

204
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,920
They’ll take that crazy doll away soon.

205
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,680
No need to worry.

206
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,200
I’m not worried about the Sia-Kaban doll.

207
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,840
Then why the long face?

208
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,200
Just thinking about what they did to Thup
is enough to make me sick.

209
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,600
They threw Thup in jail
even though he did nothing wrong.

210
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,080
Anyone can tell

211
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,920
it was P'King.

212
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,960
So what are we supposed to do?

213
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,440
We still have to rely on him, right?

214
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,840
I’ll send a team to watch over you two.

215
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,080
And for now, if anything happens,

216
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,320
tell me.

217
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,040
That’s not necessary. We’ll be fine.

218
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
Darin.

219
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,160
I know that no matter what I say,
you still don’t trust me.

220
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,200
But I’ll prove it to you myself
that I truly want to protect everyone.

221
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,040
Whether as a cop,

222
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,920
or as someone who used to be your friend.

223
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
P'King.

224
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,840
Is something wrong?

225
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,920
Nothing.

226
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,200
The spot where Warit’s body was found
is about one kilometer from Santi Tham House.

227
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,560
Further checks found no traces
of any other bodies.

228
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,600
As for the CCTV…

229
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,480
broken, as usual.

230
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,760
If Ta Khuean is really the killer,

231
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,800
why would he use this place?

232
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,320
He could’ve committed the murder elsewhere.

233
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,720
Maybe Santi Tham House.

234
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,640
Since Ta Khuean could come and go easily.

235
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,280
But lately there’s been a lot of police activity there,

236
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
so he switched to using this place instead.

237
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,400
Sey’s side has tracked Ta Khuean now.

238
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,840
The last signal shows

239
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,640
around Min Buri.

240
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,160
Then spread our people to search that area.

241
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,400
Have our teams ready to move
as soon as a lead comes in.

242
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,200
As for the body found at the scene,

243
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,280
keep it under wraps for now.

244
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,560
I don’t want the killer to catch on.

245
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,120
Yes, Inspector.

246
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,680
(Sunday)

247
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,000
(Wednesday)

248
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,560
What are you thinking?

249
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,880
Right now, I want to know…

250
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,400
What does the killer choose victims by?

251
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,520
We already know

252
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,080
he chooses by the seven birth days.

253
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,040
But is there

254
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,600
no other reason at all?

255
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,920
Like Natee and Warit,

256
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,200
I can kind of understand.

257
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,280
They were connected to Santi Tham House.

258
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,560
But Darin and the kid named Jump,

259
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,200
they weren’t involved at all.

260
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,760
So why were they chosen?

261
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,960
Or is it because of something…

262
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,720
occult-related or that kind of thing?

263
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,520
How am I supposed to understand the killer?

264
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,840
I need to know what he chooses victims by.

265
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,080
Who are you? Don’t come closer.

266
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,640
No. Don’t.

267
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,240
Did you really take him to see a doctor?

268
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,040
Yeah. I already took him to a doctor.

269
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,360
The doctor said he needs a lot of rest.

270
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,760
But I don’t get it.

271
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,800
He’s been sleeping all day.
Still no better.

272
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,760
Or did Jump really see a ghost?

273
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,640
A regular doctor might not help.
Maybe we need a shaman.

274
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,960
Can you stop it already?

275
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,800
I know it, you’re making content again.

276
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,160
I’m not playing along.

277
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,240
Can’t I joke around?

278
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,360
What about you?

279
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,640
Is it happening again?

280
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,800
Probably haven’t rested much lately.

281
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,120
My immunity’s probably low.

282
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,240
But whatever.

283
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,720
It’ll pass.

284
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,000
Take good care of yourself too.

285
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,880
Hey, can you,

286
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,600
grab the meds for Jump?

287
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,120
They’re on the table by the bathroom.

288
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,920
Don’t come in.

289
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,560
It’s okay, it’s okay.

290
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,720
Bom.

291
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Bom.

292
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,680
What the hell, Bom?

293
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,920
What’s wrong with you?

294
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,640
Nothing.

295
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,720
I saw the pill bottle and remembered
I need to take mine too.

296
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,520
Yeah, that’s good.

297
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,200
Don’t let anything happen to you too.

298
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,800
Jump’s already lost it.

299
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,000
Don’t start seeing things too.

300
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,160
Still not asleep?

301
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,040
Waiting for my reward?

302
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,920
Is that all that’s on your mind?

303
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,920
You could say that.

304
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,240
You’re all that’s on my mind.

305
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,280
That’s too much.

306
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,360
If you’re stressed about anything,
you can talk to me.

307
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,800
You know I can help.

308
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,120
Right now, I’m thinking about

309
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,160
what’s going on in the killer’s head.

310
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,560
Why?

311
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,800
If the killer in Sisaket,

312
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,360
Phang Nga, Chiang Mai,

313
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,000
and Bangkok is the same person,

314
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,280
then I want to know how he chooses victims.

315
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,920
Because if this keeps going,

316
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,200
I’ll just keep chasing bodies.

317
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,960
I want to help them in time.

318
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,560
Then why don’t we go to the origin?

319
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,680
The origin?

320
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,360
The very first case we know about

321
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,360
happened in Sisaket, right?

322
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,760
If we go back there,

323
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
we might find the killer’s origin.

324
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,560
Then we might figure out how he thinks.

325
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,800
That sounds good.

326
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,240
Because when the first incident happened,

327
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,400
the killer had probably just started.

328
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,560
He wouldn’t have been this meticulous yet.

329
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,480
If he made a mistake
and left something

330
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,200
behind, we might be
able to trace it there.

331
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,280
Uncle Chai once told me

332
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,200
there was a shaman there
who performed this ritual.

333
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,080
And the Grandmaster Monk
once chanted funerals

334
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,560
for all seven victims killed by that shaman.

335
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,960
I think he must know something.

336
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,720
But…

337
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,360
we have to go there ourselves.

338
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,160
Wouldn’t calling be faster?

339
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,480
Calling won’t work.

340
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,240
Because that shaman…

341
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,600
he’s already dead.

342
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,240
Wait.

343
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,200
So you’re going there

344
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,480
to talk to a ghost?

345
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,160
Mm. Yes.

346
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,160
It’s been many years already, P'.

347
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,440
People who know about it…

348
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,280
there aren’t many left.

349
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,920
If that’s what you believe, then okay.

350
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,520
I’ll clear my work quickly
and then we can leave.

351
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,360
Then…

352
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,200
does that mean…

353
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,480
you owe me two rewards now.

354
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,800
For helping you with the work.

355
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,400
Give you an inch, you take a mile.

356
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,480
What if I take both the inch and the mile?

357
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,440
Oh?

358
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,240
Did Ai Soon send you to get me?

359
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,000
I was just about to go anyway.

360
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,920
-Don’t run.
-Hey, damn it.

361
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,960
Don’t run.

362
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,360
-Go.
-Go.

363
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,120
Why the hell are you arresting me?

364
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,320
Khuean has helped me a lot.

365
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,160
I’ll try to find a way to help.

366
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,520
But it has to be within the law.

367
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,880
Hello.

368
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,480
P’, we’ve found Ta Khuean.

369
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,400
Where?

370
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,680
Santi Tham House.
The one who reported it was…

371
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,040
the head of the house, Ai Soon.

372
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,560
(Santi Tham House)

373
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,880
Let me go.

374
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,480
I didn’t do anything wrong.

375
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,160
Shut it, Khuean.

376
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,160
Someone saw you

377
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,560
using donation money to run a gambling den,

378
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,160
-and buying yourself a big house.
-Enough.

379
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,480
Let the police handle it.

380
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,840
I’ve heard about the case
with seven murder victims.

381
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,960
All of them were disciples
of Santi Tham House.

382
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,080
If there’s anything I can help with,

383
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,320
please let me know.

384
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,760
Thank you.

385
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,000
Ko, take him in for further questioning.

386
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,440
Up. Move.

387
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,280
What are you doing? You need evidence.

388
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,920
-Get up.
-We’ll talk there.

389
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,640
Do you know this person?

390
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,520
Yes.

391
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,480
What’s your relationship?

392
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,400
He’s the one who…

393
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,160
delivers goods, ice,

394
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,680
supplies to shops at Santi Tham House.

395
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,760
That’s all?

396
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,080
What about this one?

397
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,240
Heard talk about borrowing money,

398
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
about the gambling den.

399
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
What?

400
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,760
I don’t know anything.

401
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,800
And this?

402
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,440
It’s not mine.

403
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,360
How could it not be?

404
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,520
When we found evidence

405
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,640
in your room, and you still deny it?

406
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,680
Warit’s phone also has your number.

407
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,200
If it were me,

408
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,800
I’d confess now.

409
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,560
Might get a lighter sentence.

410
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,000
It was just…

411
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,600
a bit of gambling.

412
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,719
Just among acquaintances, officer.

413
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,600
And the loans?

414
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,840
Oh, there were some.

415
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,800
They were in trouble, so I…

416
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,520
just lent money.

417
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,199
Lent money.

418
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,600
And when they didn’t pay back,

419
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,280
-you got mad and killed them?
-Hey, kill who?

420
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,400
What is this, officer?

421
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,840
Don’t act like you don’t know.

422
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,159
You think you’ll get away with this?

423
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,159
I don’t know.

424
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,080
I admit the gambling, the lending.

425
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,960
But about anyone dying,

426
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,400
I know nothing.

427
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,199
Two days ago,

428
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,360
Natee Lumboriwan

429
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,239
was found dead in an abandoned building.

430
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,639
And yesterday,

431
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,360
Warit Saemanotham was found dead.

432
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,240
So…

433
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,200
those two are dead?

434
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,800
I can put you in jail easily.

435
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,840
Because you’re the main suspect.

436
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,240
Since both of them

437
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,440
are directly connected to you.

438
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,400
From this list,

439
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,800
I don’t know anything.

440
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,120
I’ve never killed anyone.

441
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,240
Then what about these seven?

442
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,280
Oh, these seven.

443
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,080
They’re disciples
who came to Santi Tham House.

444
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,360
Don’t tell me…

445
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,040
that the reason they disappeared

446
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,320
is because they were murdered.

447
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,280
You really don’t know anything?

448
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,200
If you don’t talk,
I can’t help you.

449
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,520
I told you I don’t know.
I don’t know. I don’t know.

450
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,760
I just wanted to…

451
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
I just wanted the money they borrowed
paid back.

452
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,040
I never once thought of harming them.

453
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,240
And over the past few days,

454
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,680
where have you been?

455
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,320
Oh, I wasn’t in Thailand. I…

456
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,240
I went to Poipet.

457
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,600
To a casino?

458
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,040
At first,

459
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,200
I thought you were going to…

460
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,360
arrest me for embezzlement.

461
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,160
So I went to Santi Tham House to get documents
and planned to run.

462
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,720
But I got caught anyway.

463
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,000
But about killing anyone,

464
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,920
I know nothing at all.

465
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,280
They say Ta Khuean

466
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,840
killed everyone for some ritual.
Is that true, sir?

467
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,040
We don’t know.

468
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,320
Let the police handle it.

469
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,120
If there’s anything you need,
please let us know, sir.

470
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,840
We’re willing to help fully.

471
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,320
Thank you very much.

472
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,640
Focus your mind.

473
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,640
Send goodwill to the departed souls.

474
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,360
You’re going to Sisaket tomorrow?

475
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,000
Isn’t that a bit too fast?

476
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,320
You’ve got things covered here.

477
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,680
I’ll go find out what really happened back then.

478
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,320
Taking Mek with you?

479
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,520
No need.

480
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,040
I’ve got Thup.

481
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,000
Let Mek help you here.

482
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,440
You’re getting attached to that kid every day.

483
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,840
So I’m not getting my disciple back, huh?

484
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,760
Drop it.

485
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,920
But I’m not giving up, Sing.

486
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,600
Your problem.

487
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,480
If anything happens,
you report to me immediately.

488
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,720
I know.

489
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,840
You don’t need to rub it in

490
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,640
that you’re my boss.

491
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,640
That’s not what I mean.

492
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,160
Right now, you and I are on this case together.

493
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,280
Stop going solo.

494
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,640
We’re not boss and subordinate.

495
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,560
We’re one team.

496
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,840
Okay.

497
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,680
I promise if anything happens,

498
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,520
you’ll be the first I report to. Okay?

499
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,960
Oh? Since when did you secretly buy black ginger serum?

500
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,640
Look at that, acting like you don’t need it.

501
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,840
Turns out you want to look good too.

502
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,280
You recommended it.

503
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,800
So I should use it, right?

504
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,280
These days you’re a cop
who takes care of himself.

505
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,000
Kinda cute, actually.

506
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,240
Stop teasing me.

507
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,640
You packed yet?

508
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,640
Right here. All done.

509
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,920
What the hell is this?

510
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,280
Isn’t this a bit much?
We’re gone three days.

511
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,040
I promised your mom.

512
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,000
That I’d take good care of you.

513
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Okay.

514
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,120
-What are you doing?
-Normally…

515
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,360
Cops are the ones who frisk suspects.

516
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,640
So this time,

517
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,280
the suspect…

518
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,040
wants to frisk the cop.

519
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,720
Thup. Thup.

520
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,160
Pack your stuff first.

521
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,560
What is wrong with you?

522
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,840
Let me check you.

523
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,320
Ding-dong.

524
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,360
I’ll do a thorough search.

525
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,400
Go pack.

526
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,240
Go pack.

527
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,040
We’re going to work, not on vacation.

528
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,080
I’m going back to my hometown too, not traveling.

529
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,800
Hurry up. We’re running late.

530
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,760
Just a sec, P’.

531
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,600
You forgot everything again. Even the charger.

532
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,800
I really did pack it, P’.

533
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,480
I just forgot to grab it.

534
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,600
You forgot two items, ma’am.

535
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,480
May I ring you up?

536
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,520
Scan to pay, please.

537
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,360
All set.

538
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,880
-All done, thank you very much.
-Thank you.

539
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,920
Done.

540
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,720
Ah, is it ready, Mom?

541
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,520
We’re having beef stew today.

542
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,320
Your sticky rice, right?

543
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,440
Yes. The kid should like it.

544
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,120
Who’s coming?

545
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,400
Who is it, Dad?

546
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,960
-Our nephew’s here.
-Thup’s here?

547
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,960
Oh, come on in!

548
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,560
Hello, Uncle Chai.

549
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,840
Hello, hello.

550
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,440
Oh, I’ve missed you so much.

551
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,400
Hello, Aunt Srijan.

552
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,800
Hello, dear. I’ve missed you so much.

553
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,640
How was the trip? How many hours?

554
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,040
Oh, just eight hours.

555
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,200
P’Sing was speeding.

556
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,480
No idea if he thinks he’s a race driver or what.

557
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,640
P’Sing, this is Uncle Chai.

558
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,320
Hello, I’m Sing.

559
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,760
Hello, dear. Hello.

560
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,520
-And this is Aunt Srijan.
-Hello.

561
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,720
Hello, dear. You must be tired. Come eat.

562
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,120
I cooked so much. Come on.

563
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,280
Come in, come in.

564
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,760
Yeah, sit down.

565
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,000
Come on, dear. I’ve been waiting.

566
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,080
There’s eggplant soup and beef stew.

567
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,160
And catfish with fermented fish. Eat up.

568
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,400
Wow, I didn’t make it in time to help.

569
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,760
It’s okay, dear.

570
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,120
I remember when he was little,

571
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,920
if he wasn’t at home,
he’d sneak into our kitchen.

572
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,160
Whatever we cooked, we’d teach him.

573
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
I never cooked. I always ordered.

574
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,200
I was scared I’d mess up your kitchen.

575
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:09,520
Now that you’re here,

576
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,960
Just show what you’ve got, Thup.

577
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,640
If I’m here, I have to try Aunt Srichan’s cooking.

578
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,040
Aunt Srichan’s cooking is incredible.

579
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,960
Alright, since you’re here,
go put your bags in the bedroom.

580
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,240
Then come down and eat together.

581
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,120
It’s okay. I’ll stay at a hotel nearby.

582
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,360
It’s okay.

583
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,800
If you come to my house, you sleep here.
Why waste money on a hotel?

584
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,000
It’s really okay. I don’t want to impose.

585
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,840
I’ll find a place to stay.

586
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,800
Why be so considerate?

587
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,960
Considerate about what?

588
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,440
You’re Thup’s partner.

589
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,400
Then you stay here.

590
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,600
Can you act like part of the family?

591
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,160
Come on.

592
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,760
Not yet.

593
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,480
Just go along with the old man.

594
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,480
Don’t upset your uncle.

595
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Come on, let’s go.

596
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,800
Come on, carry your things inside.

597
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,480
Go on, go, go.

598
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,840
Go.

599
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,200
Now I know where you got your neatness from.

600
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,880
Ever since Grandmaster Monk passed away.

601
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,760
Before I came to Bangkok, I only stayed
with Uncle Chai and Aunt Srichan.

602
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,560
I’m scared of ghosts,
so I didn’t really go out to see anyone.

603
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,560
So did you tell your uncle that we’re together?

604
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,600
I didn’t tell him.

605
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,080
Maybe he figured it out himself.

606
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,440
How could he figure it out?

607
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,840
I haven’t even asked you to be my partner yet.

608
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,320
Go clear our status with your uncle.

609
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,000
And...

610
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,680
So what’s our status right now?

611
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,760
No idea.

612
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,720
This kind of status.

613
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,240
Like partners, but not really.

614
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,240
What do you call it? A situationship, I guess.

615
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,080
So when do we get to be partners?

616
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,400
Thup.

617
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,160
Finish the case first.

618
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,480
Then you and I can be official.

619
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,360
Why?

620
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,920
Can’t wait?

621
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,160
I can wait. I don’t have a problem.

622
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,960
Just being with you,

623
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,960
and not seeing ghosts,

624
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,960
I don’t want anything else.

625
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,480
I’m going to sleep.

626
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,040
What?

627
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,040
Go to sleep.

628
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,200
Aren’t you using a blanket?

629
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,120
Uncle already sent the location
of the shaman’s house.

630
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,600
Thank you.

631
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,480
You already know this shaman, right?

632
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,520
I don’t.

633
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
But the Grandmaster Monk once said

634
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,920
there was a shaman

635
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,480
who practiced dark sorcery,

636
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,120
performing corpse rituals

637
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,280
with seven bodies to extend life.

638
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,000
The Grandmaster Monk warned that

639
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,000
these things are not good.

640
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,760
The longer it goes on,
the more it turns back on you.

641
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,080
But the shaman didn’t believe it.

642
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,240
Since fifteen years ago?

643
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,920
Yes.

644
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,280
There was a police officer
who handled this case.

645
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,880
Out of nowhere,

646
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,200
he lost it, went insane,

647
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,720
and then disappeared.

648
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,360
Is it really that brutal?

649
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,320
Everyone around here knows.

650
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,240
No one dares go near it.

651
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,960
Because everyone’s afraid it will get to them.

652
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:28,880
You two, if you go into that shaman’s house,

653
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,920
be very careful.

654
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,840
Even though he’s been dead a long time,

655
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,960
his spirit is still vicious.

656
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,120
I’ve passed by that place before.

657
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,600
Whenever I pass by there,

658
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,040
it feels like

659
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,000
there are still eyes

660
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,200
full of hatred watching us.

661
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,160
Then why hasn’t he been reborn?

662
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,480
I think the shaman’s power
is still being contained.

663
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,080
Because he extended his own life improperly.

664
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,760
Taking other people’s lives
to extend his own

665
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,040
kept him from being reborn.

666
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,400
Thup.

667
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,120
Thup.

668
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,560
Can you wait for me outside?

669
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,200
Why?

670
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,680
No.

671
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,680
I won’t let you be alone.

672
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,600
Trust me.

673
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,800
If anything happens, call me.

674
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,600
You’ve got some nerve coming in here.

675
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,680
If you come in, you die.

676
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,360
Did you arrange to meet anyone?

677
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,160
I’ve been clear with you all along,
and you’re still being possessive.

678
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,000
There’s a reason to be.

679
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,080
No idea when they’ll come
and take you back.

680
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,960
So did you get anything more from Sisaket?

681
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,040
What I know now is,

682
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,160
the shaman involved in the
seven-corpse ritual

683
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,440
was a former local police officer.

684
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,400
If he’s the culprit,
he’d know how to cover his tracks.

685
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,240
Inspector, I found more documents.

686
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,200
Have you heard any rumors

687
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,280
about where Ta Khuean
might be hiding?

688
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,800
You must’ve messed with
something bad.

689
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,360
And people close to us get dragged in too.

690
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:37,720
We’ll send word to Stark Industries

691
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,120
that we’ve got the Mind Stone,

692
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,000
and the future Stone as well.

693
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,760
And this is someone
who works way too hard.

694
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,600
(Probably too hard.)

695
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,040
Action, Mek, whoa, those eyes.

696
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,080
(Sleeping, Inspector?)

697
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,320
Gambling at Ta Khuean’s den like that?

698
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,640
-Still talking about it?
-Oh, okay.

699
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,200
So what’s our status right now?

700
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,440
-I’m shy, don’t be so tense. I’m shy, okay?
-Don’t be tense.

701
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,000
Just being close to you,
and not seeing ghosts,

702
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,360
I don’t want anything else.

703
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,880
(Just staying by your side is enough.)
