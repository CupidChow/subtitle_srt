1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,840
You said the talismans and clay dolls

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,040
had to come from a shaman’s house.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,600
What if it’s a meditation retreat center?

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,880
Don’t want people knowing I’m your ex?

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,920
But what you’re doing,

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,920
you’re acting like you own me.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,000
Bangkok had a seven-body murder case.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,280
The case in Phangnga,

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,360
you might not be involved at all.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,480
The ghost was probably mad
I found the decapitation doll.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,680
P’Singha.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,720
Wait a moment for the X-ray results.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,120
Thanks.

14
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,360
Don’t ever do that again.

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,600
Almost died, you know.

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,680
Why though?

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,080
I just wanted to help.

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,200
I don’t want you getting hurt.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,800
I don’t want to see you hurt either.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,800
Thought you said you’d stay home.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,360
Why come to set?

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,920
Uh, I came because I needed to warn you.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,320
Warn?

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,920
About what?

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,280
I don’t even know what it is.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,000
But what I do know,

27
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,440
something bad is about to happen.

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,000
Because the incense pot in front of
Thao Wessuwan at your house

29
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,520
just fell on its own.

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,280
It’s just an incense pot.
Why make it a big deal?

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,080
But the scaffold almost fell on you for real.

32
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,520
If I hadn’t come help in time,

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,759
you would’ve been hurt already.

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,440
Okay.

35
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,360
I’ll give you this one.

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,880
Should be nothing else now.

37
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,680
Wait for the X-ray, then head home.

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,920
Okay.

39
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,600
Sing.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,400
You heard yet?

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,160
Heard what?

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,560
Darin got hit by a car.

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,680
Still hasn’t come out of surgery.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,079
Sey.

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,800
Oh, P'Sing, P'King.

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,040
What happened?

47
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,600
I’ve got no clue.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,600
I went to calm down,

49
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,480
waiting for the lab results at the cafeteria.

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,600
Then suddenly someone started yelling,

51
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,200
Someone got hit by a car.

52
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,120
I went to look.

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,480
And I saw,

54
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,680
Darin was already on the ground.

55
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,040
I was just...

56
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,880
shouldn’t have left him alone.

57
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,520
You didn’t make that car hit him.

58
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,080
He’s in the doctors’ hands now.

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
Calm down first.

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,720
Darin gets scared easily,

61
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,040
but he’s tougher than he looks.

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,400
How’s Darin?

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,720
His lung is torn.

64
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,400
The doctor is operating now.

65
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,200
But he’s lost a lot of blood.

66
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,280
Any family with O-type blood?

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,240
I’m O-type.

68
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,280
Right this way.

69
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,840
I don’t wanna say this, but,

70
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,120
without King today, would’ve been bad.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,080
True.

72
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,800
Guess I owe him for this.

73
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,520
I’ll pay it back somehow.

74
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,520
I thought,

75
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
Thought you were gonna snap at King.

76
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,960
Why would I snap?

77
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,800
This is Darin’s life on the line.

78
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,880
I might hate King’s guts,

79
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,320
but I can set that aside for this.

80
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
You two used to be close, didn’t you?

81
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,200
I can separate things.

82
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,760
I just...

83
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,880
don’t get to decide for you.

84
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,159
But,

85
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,440
when P'King offered to donate blood,

86
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,760
it made me...

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
think about the old days, us.

88
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,360
And,

89
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,760
you and P'King,

90
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,600
any chance you’ll talk things out?

91
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
Right now the answer’s no.

92
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,120
But the future, who knows.

93
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,920
Depends on how he acts.

94
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,720
And you?

95
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,960
You not mad at him anymore?

96
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,760
Still mad.

97
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,960
But when I really think about it,

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,440
people,

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,159
you never know when they’ll be gone.

100
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,800
I just fought with Darin today.

101
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,200
I didn’t clear things up with him.

102
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,320
If something happens,

103
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,880
I’d...

104
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,080
never get the chance to fix things.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,680
Watch your mouth.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,880
King already gave blood.

107
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,720
Darin will be fine.

108
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,400
Hello?

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,680
I bought grilled pork sticky rice
for Sing and Sey, one each.

110
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,440
Thanks.

111
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,200
You some presenter for a pork skewers shop?

112
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,159
I told you to go home and rest.

113
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,840
But Sing hasn’t eaten anything.

114
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,880
I told you,

115
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,080
I’ll take care of his meals myself.

116
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,880
Can you not nag me right now?

117
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,280
I’ll eat.

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,240
Good.

119
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,040
Hey, how’s Darin doing?

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,880
Still in surgery.

121
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,880
Still getting blood.

122
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,520
Using O-type.

123
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,360
Want me to donate too?

124
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,000
I’m O-type.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,400
You’re this tiny.
Who could you even give blood to?

126
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,400
If you faint, you’ll just trouble people.

127
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,040
P'King.

128
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,440
Want some juice?

129
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,480
No, I’m fine.

130
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,680
Thanks.

131
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,320
So, local police just called.

132
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,720
They already reported Darin’s hit-and-run.

133
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,000
Sing.

134
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,360
You coming with me?

135
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,760
Yeah.

136
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,080
It’s a traffic case.

137
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,440
No need to use witnesses from other cases.

138
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,799
Wait here.

139
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,880
I’ll be back.

140
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,520
You guys should head home.

141
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,600
You’ve got work tomorrow.

142
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,480
And you?

143
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,160
Going home or staying here?

144
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,280
I’ll stay and watch him.

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,600
Then I’ll stay too.

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
P'King,

147
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,160
you’re going through too much.

148
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,320
I feel bad.

149
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,480
Stop saying you feel bad already.

150
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,000
Anything I can help with, I want to help.

151
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,560
And another thing,

152
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,280
if forensics calls you in for a rush scene,

153
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,560
what are you gonna do?

154
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,480
Okay.

155
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,320
Then I won’t feel bad anymore.

156
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,720
Having someone here is good.

157
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,200
I don’t want Darin waking up to no one.

158
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,960
Alright.

159
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,000
I’ll order wonton soup.

160
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,960
Same as always?

161
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,200
- The...
- No veggies, no fried shallots.

162
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,200
Everything extra.

163
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,680
Thup.

164
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,840
Want some?

165
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,600
I’m not hungry.

166
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,080
You rearranged the house?

167
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,640
Yeah.

168
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,680
Thanks.

169
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,280
Thup.

170
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,200
I’m stressed.

171
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,880
And sleepy too.

172
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,480
I’ll eat it tomorrow morning.

173
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,160
Can’t eat right now.

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,600
I can eat it myself then.

175
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,720
It probably doesn’t taste good now.

176
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,480
It’s not that I won’t eat it.

177
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
I’m just not hungry right now.

178
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,840
You’re not gonna reheat it?

179
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,200
You don’t like grilled
pork sticky rice, right?

180
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,000
I won’t buy it next time.

181
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,720
What’s wrong with you?

182
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,160
You’ve been like this since the hospital.

183
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,280
It’s nothing.

184
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,680
No.

185
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,640
I know you’re mad at me.

186
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,800
What is it? Just say it.
What’d I do to you?

187
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,320
If Singha can’t think of anything he did wrong,

188
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,000
how could there be anything?

189
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,080
Thup.

190
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,920
Say it nicely,

191
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,000
or do I have to force it out of you?

192
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
What is it? Say it.

193
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,200
I saw the photo of you and Inspector King.

194
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,600
Old photos. What’s the problem?

195
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,920
Other than being coworkers with issues,

196
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,080
you two had something more, didn’t you?

197
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,160
It was just the past.

198
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,040
You don’t need to get involved.

199
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,800
Just know to stay away from him.
That’s it.

200
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,760
True.

201
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,000
I’m just someone staying at your place.

202
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,000
I shouldn’t have asked stuff like that.

203
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,920
I’ll go shower.

204
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,440
So I don’t bother you.

205
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,120
Sey.

206
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,080
Yeah?

207
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,840
When you’re with someone sick,

208
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,720
you gotta keep your mind steady.

209
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,280
If you sit there sulking like this,

210
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,480
they can feel it, you know.

211
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,400
I don’t even know...

212
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,520
what me and him really are.

213
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,040
Friends.

214
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,720
Exes.

215
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,680
Or,

216
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,000
something in between...

217
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,440
friends and exes.

218
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,600
Enough.

219
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
I’m not P’Aoy or P’Chod.

220
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,600
Don’t come to me for love advice.

221
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,920
Fair.

222
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,480
You’re probably the last person

223
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,560
I should talk to about love.

224
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,160
It’s not that I don’t want to hear it.

225
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,320
But I just wanna tell you,

226
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,080
if there’s anything you wanna say to Darin,

227
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,880
wait till he wakes up
and say it to him yourself.

228
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,040
Because I missed my chance to
clear things at the right time once.

229
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,120
Do it right.

230
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,280
So you won’t regret it later.

231
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,160
What are you doing, Thup?

232
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
That’s my storage-room tent.

233
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,200
Why are you pitching a tent in the house?

234
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,920
Too many mosquitoes.

235
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,600
You won’t get mad, right?

236
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,880
You doing this,

237
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,000
because you’re upset with me?

238
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,480
You’re overthinking, Thup.

239
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,960
I just don’t wanna talk about the past.

240
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,600
Why are you being so touchy?

241
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,760
Inspector Singha is full of himself now.

242
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,040
I just have urgent work to send a client.

243
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,200
So I need to focus alone.

244
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,520
Your client wants ghost sketches?

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
How would a cop like you
understand an illustrator’s job?

246
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,520
If you’ve got nothing else to ask,

247
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,720
please zip the tent for me, thanks.

248
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,080
What’s wrong with him?

249
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,920
Just because I don’t eat grilled pork?

250
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,000
I’m heading to set.

251
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,560
You coming?

252
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,400
Thup.

253
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,720
If he sees I didn’t eat, he’ll sulk again.

254
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,440
We need to move fast.

255
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,040
I’m serious, King.

256
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,480
If you don’t close this case soon,

257
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,560
our whole family’s screwed.

258
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,800
Yes, Dad.

259
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,280
I’ll take care of it.

260
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,120
Where’s Singha’s team digging today, Ko?

261
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,080
Sing.

262
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,240
Search warrant.

263
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,400
Oh, hey.

264
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,720
Your spiritual consultant’s not here today?

265
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,680
No.

266
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,600
Why?

267
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,400
Nothing, just,

268
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,280
you two are usually glued together.

269
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,280
And the other teams? Ready?

270
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,080
- Ready.
- Ready.

271
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,520
I’ve already ordered teams to
sweep the victims’ houses we skipped.

272
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,560
Right. And Inspector King?

273
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,800
I informed him.

274
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,280
But it seems like he won’t be
joining the search today.

275
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,680
Sorry, man.

276
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,080
For making you come.

277
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,720
I just want you in the field with me,

278
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,800
in case we see something strange,
we can talk right away.

279
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,200
It’s fine.

280
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,600
It’s my job anyway.

281
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,160
And Darin’s got nurses watching him.

282
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,320
Let’s go.

283
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,280
Excuse me.

284
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,480
Can you tell me about your son James?

285
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,560
James,

286
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,680
he wanted to get into engineering.

287
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,880
Friends invited him out, but he never went.

288
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,680
Stayed in his room all the time.

289
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,040
And do you know,

290
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,120
did his friends come see him at all?

291
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,800
Or did he go to any strange places?

292
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,080
During exam prep,

293
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,000
James liked going to one place.

294
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
After he came back,

295
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,880
he would chant something at night.

296
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Jetasikang.

297
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,240
Jiterumi jittang.

298
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,800
Jetasikang.

299
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,720
Jiterumi jittang.

300
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,840
Do you know,

301
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,600
where he liked to go make offerings?

302
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,760
I think it was called...

303
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,960
something like Santi Tham House.

304
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Mek.

305
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,480
Sweep around the house.

306
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,360
Got it.

307
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,440
- Let’s go, Keng.
- Yes.

308
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,320
P'Sing.

309
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,880
There’s a talisman sheet stuck here.

310
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,120
Same kind you found, right?

311
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,080
Exactly the same.

312
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,560
Collect the evidence for examination.

313
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,800
Yes.

314
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,000
There’s gotta be a decapitation doll.

315
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,680
- Hey, Run.
- Yes.

316
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,040
Watch the front for me.

317
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,960
- Got it.
- Thanks.

318
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,400
Mek.

319
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,840
Why’d you go down there?

320
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,080
Mek.

321
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,720
Mek.

322
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,920
P'Sing.

323
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,400
I saw it in the water.

324
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,800
And something felt like it
was pulling me under.

325
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,280
You sure you didn’t just imagine it?

326
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,840
Bro, I didn’t imagine it.

327
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,320
I’m telling you something
really pulled me down.

328
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,160
If it wasn’t a ghost…

329
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,160
then what else could it be?

330
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,480
Mek, calm down. Listen to me.

331
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,800
You just slipped and fell.

332
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,280
Then panicked.

333
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,880
Go rest for a bit.

334
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,760
And once your head’s clear,

335
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,800
make sure the evidence
gets sent in, that’s it.

336
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,880
Easy.

337
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,240
Every cop here

338
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,120
seems to agree with that spiritual
consultant title you gave Thup.

339
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,600
If it’s not too much trouble,

340
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,920
bring him to the scene sometimes.

341
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,400
You too, huh?

342
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,600
No.

343
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,800
I just think

344
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,280
if Thup can point us in the right direction,

345
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,120
it might make our work easier.

346
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,440
He may look quiet, but he doesn’t talk unless he wants to.

347
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,120
If he doesn’t wanna come,
how am I supposed to drag him?

348
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,680
You force everyone else to work anyway.

349
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,200
Adding Thup wouldn’t hurt, you know.

350
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,240
Or…

351
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,480
that Thup stopped coming

352
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,760
wasn’t a day off,

353
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,880
but you two arguing.

354
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,720
Well…

355
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,640
he asked about King.

356
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,320
I just didn’t want to talk. That’s all.

357
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,360
If it’s that,

358
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,880
I get him.

359
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,600
Anyone would feel that way.

360
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,360
Come on, Sey,

361
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,640
you’re supposed to take my side.

362
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,120
And besides, he and I aren’t anything.

363
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,880
Why ask about my personal stuff?

364
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,320
And now he’s…

365
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,920
mad at me again.

366
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,600
Mm.

367
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,680
You really think that’s all?

368
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,400
Yeah.

369
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,800
It’s all just work. That’s all it is.

370
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,120
Alright.

371
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,800
Fine, if you say so.

372
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,720
But I think,

373
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,480
still…

374
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,000
you should clear things with Thup properly.

375
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,480
from what Captain Mek saw today,

376
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,880
I think you’ll be pushed to bring
the spiritual advisor in for a while.

377
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,280
so what do I do?

378
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,960
make up with him?

379
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,080
well…

380
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,760
yeah.

381
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,960
buy him something?

382
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,760
buy what?

383
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,280
what’s wrong with you?

384
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,480
hurt your back fighting a suspect?

385
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,400
don’t jinx me, man.

386
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,760
you like this, right?

387
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,480
for paying respect to Pu Wes.

388
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,200
and the rosary,

389
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,040
I see you wear it a lot.

390
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,800
so why give it to me?

391
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,600
is it because I’m a witness?

392
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,960
I saw you were sulking.

393
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
I’m tired of the mind games.

394
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,800
living in the same house,

395
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,000
don’t want you going quiet on me.

396
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,200
but from the way you’re acting,

397
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,120
Sey must’ve tricked me.

398
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,120
who said that?

399
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,200
(this grilled pork is actually good.)

400
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,280
thought you’d leave me stressed alone.

401
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,400
I tried making up to you
last night and this morning.

402
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,680
you didn’t notice?

403
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,480
I did.

404
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,560
but I wanted to see…

405
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,640
how far you’d try.

406
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,760
you not telling me about King,

407
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,360
that’s your right.

408
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,080
but I thought we were already close.

409
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,840
I figured I’d…

410
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,800
know a bit about you.

411
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,200
maybe I

412
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,640
got carried away.

413
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,680
held on to you too much.

414
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,200
the reason I didn’t tell you

415
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,600
is because it’s all stuff

416
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,320
that just makes you feel bad.

417
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,400
but if you want to know,

418
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,040
I’ll tell you everything.

419
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,680
even if none of it’s good.

420
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
I met King

421
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,400
when I first moved to investigations.

422
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,760
Singha,

423
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,000
yeah?

424
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,560
after I joined the force,

425
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,160
this is Inspector King.

426
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,960
he’ll be working here with us.

427
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,880
King moved into the same team.
please look after him.

428
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,280
share whatever he needs to know.

429
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,400
yes.

430
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,000
at first we didn’t really get along.

431
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,960
but not long after,

432
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,280
we clicked pretty well.

433
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,000
from then on,

434
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,920
we promised each other

435
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,120
never to betray or leave one another,

436
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,320
no matter what happened.

437
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,200
if I had to move somewhere,

438
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,680
you’d follow me everywhere, right?

439
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,560
you promised.

440
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,800
where there’s Singha,

441
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,760
there’s King.

442
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,600
you don’t have to go that detailed…

443
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,880
you said you wanted to know.

444
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,600
so should I keep going?

445
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,480
no need to be that detailed.

446
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,640
so…

447
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
you and Inspector King,

448
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,920
were you actually together?

449
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,760
Sing’s here. Hurry.

450
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,920
- Hey.
- At work we’re good partners.

451
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,280
Off work we’re close too.

452
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,880
And…

453
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,440
Still feel something for Inspector King?

454
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,760
No.

455
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,400
More like something stuck
inside than anything.

456
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,760
Sometimes I think,

457
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,440
If that thing didn’t happen then…

458
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,200
what would me and him be now.

459
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,240
But whatever.

460
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,120
Being alone like this,

461
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,200
not so bad.

462
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,880
Alone where?

463
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,160
You have me.

464
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,680
Trust me.

465
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,880
Whatever happened…
it’s always for the better.

466
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,360
People can change.

467
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,920
Except…

468
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,080
me wanting to stay
at your place forever.

469
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,880
I’ll trial-work at your place.

470
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,600
Apply to take care of it.

471
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,520
Till you decide to take me in.

472
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,280
Hey.

473
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,440
Not mad anymore, right.

474
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
I’ll shower first.

475
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,560
Supatipanno Bhagavato,

476
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,840
Savaka Sangho.
Sanghang namami.

477
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,120
Shit. Again?

478
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,120
Damn ghost. Get out.

479
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,320
What the hell’s that.

480
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,600
It’s me.

481
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,760
What are you doing.

482
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,360
Masking my face.

483
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,920
Taking care of myself
like you said.

484
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,600
With blackout like this,
not scared of ghosts?

485
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,440
Move.

486
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,240
Yeah, scared.

487
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,280
Move a bit.

488
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,800
Lie down.

489
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,400
Up early tomorrow.

490
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,000
Sleep here?

491
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,360
What.

492
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,760
Wake up.

493
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,600
Who’s sick here.

494
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,720
Easy.

495
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,680
Hurts.

496
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,920
You, man…

497
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,320
scared the hell out of me.

498
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,640
Why not sleep in your room.

499
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,800
This isn’t my condo.

500
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,440
Didn’t wanna sleep alone.

501
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,000
Easy, easy.

502
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,320
Hey.

503
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,640
P’Singha.

504
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,760
Yeah.

505
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,600
Feeling better?

506
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,200
Feeling better.

507
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,640
Good amulet.

508
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,320
Should thank the surgeon
who cut you open,

509
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,680
or give credit to the
painkillers you took.

510
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,920
I wasn’t done.

511
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,160
Good amulet’s fine.

512
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,960
But without you looking after me,
would’ve been worse.

513
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,480
Stronger meds than I thought.

514
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,640
Yeah.

515
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,960
Totally forgot.

516
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,880
I was gonna tell you this.

517
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,320
When I got hit by the car,

518
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,800
lab results came out.

519
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,200
Hair in the decapitation doll,

520
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,120
DNA doesn’t match the victim.

521
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,960
Or any of the relatives.

522
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,800
Hey, something this big,

523
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,240
why not tell me.

524
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,680
That day I couldn’t reach you.

525
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,920
So I rushed to see you.

526
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,680
Then got chased by a ghost
till I almost died.

527
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,240
You’re looping back
to ghosts again.

528
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,160
I know you and P’Singha
don’t believe this stuff.

529
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,600
But,

530
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,880
I really saw it.

531
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,800
This time I didn’t imagine it.

532
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,400
Think about it.

533
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,200
What would I run from
so hard that…

534
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,800
I got hit by a car.

535
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,680
You just weren’t careful.

536
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,520
But I really saw it,
P’Singha.

537
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,760
The ghost P’Darin saw,

538
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,360
what did it look like?

539
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,680
Its eyes were all white.

540
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,480
You trying to test me?

541
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,240
Its mouth was torn.

542
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,840
Almost up to the ears.

543
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,400
Like this?

544
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,480
Yeah.

545
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,200
That one.

546
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,520
Now we can assume,

547
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,080
each victim

548
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,800
was chosen by birthdate.

549
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,200
Plus the Mae Sue doll evidence

550
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,400
we found in each victim’s house.

551
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,920
Except the Ekalai doll,

552
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,000
the one we found
in the abandoned mall.

553
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,080
Which I think that doll,

554
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,520
belongs to Khun Meen.

555
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,120
He was born on Saturday.

556
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,640
From the lab results,

557
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,720
the hair inside this doll

558
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,080
isn’t the victim’s.

559
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,160
Might be the killer’s.

560
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,760
This case is likely
a serial murder.

561
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,560
With evidence we have
from Chiang Mai,

562
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,680
and Phang Nga.

563
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,720
About the ghosts
you two keep seeing,

564
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,800
I don’t know why it’s messing
with you.

565
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,720
From what I understand,

566
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,400
I feel like this ghost

567
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,800
doesn’t want us finding
the decapitation doll.

568
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,680
Or any other evidence.

569
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,400
Like it’s trying to block us.

570
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
Ghost trying to block.

571
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,600
Uh, Inspector,

572
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,600
do we need to put ghosts
in the report,

573
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,880
P’Khem.

574
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,480
Ghosts can be evidence or what.

575
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,680
They can’t.

576
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,360
But from the ghost Thup drew,

577
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,560
it matches everything Darin saw.

578
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,800
So I’m supposed to believe
this now?

579
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,840
After all this you still
doesn’t believe?

580
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,360
Never seen anything
in my life.

581
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,560
You ever seen one?

582
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,160
Never.

583
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,280
It’s okay if you still
doesn’t believe.

584
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,400
Just bringing our
spirit consultant back,

585
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,840
that already makes me happy.

586
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,120
You.

587
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,280
So what do we do next?

588
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,160
From the link between
these three victims,

589
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,640
we probably need to
dig deeper here.

590
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,760
Santi Tham House.

591
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,200
What’s that.

592
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,000
Sorting by birthdate?

593
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,760
Yes.

594
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,720
Simple version, drop coins
on your birthday.

595
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,200
Like I was born Friday,

596
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,280
so drop on Friday.

597
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,960
You were born Saturday.

598
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,680
Yes.

599
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,560
Simple like that, yeah.

600
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,920
But in astrology,

601
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,680
each day has a different power count.

602
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,160
Sunday is 6.

603
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,600
Monday is 18.

604
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,880
Tuesday is 8.

605
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,480
Wednesday daytime is 17.

606
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,200
Wednesday nighttime is 12.

607
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,920
Thursday is 19.

608
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,600
Friday is 21.

609
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,160
And Saturday is 10.

610
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,480
So drop coins on your birthday,

611
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,120
by that day’s count.

612
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,280
Then one coin for each
of the other days.

613
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,880
You get it?

614
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,600
Damn.

615
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,680
Inspector’s consultant
is solid.

616
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,200
Here.

617
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,000
Thanks.

618
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,120
Hey, you.

619
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,000
You were born Saturday?

620
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,000
Yes.

621
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,120
I was born Saturday.

622
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,320
Same day as you.

623
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,400
We’re not here to hang out.

624
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,520
Not looking into the victims now?

625
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,320
We are. Everyone.

626
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,880
Inspector gave the order.

627
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,000
Split up and meet back here.

628
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,600
Thup.

629
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,880
Come on.

630
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,800
Ma’am.

631
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,760
- Yes, dear?
- Need your help.

632
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,320
- Sure.
- Uh…

633
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,560
Do you know this person?

634
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,560
Oh,  that’s Meen.

635
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,480
You know her?

636
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,120
Of course.

637
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,280
She used to stop by here for meals.

638
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,480
Then suddenly disappeared.

639
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,000
And this one?

640
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,240
This one…

641
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,560
Jaojorm.

642
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,480
He often came for the free meals here.

643
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,600
Then vanished. Never saw him again.

644
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,480
And,

645
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,800
this one?

646
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,520
Oh, Kaew.

647
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,680
She used to run around near the kitchen hall.

648
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,680
Her house is right across the street.

649
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,280
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

650
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,480
And this one?

651
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,400
Hmm?

652
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,760
No idea. Never seen them.

653
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,960
Oh, really?

654
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,200
And this one?

655
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,400
This one doesn’t ring a bell either.

656
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,320
So,

657
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,040
almost everyone who died

658
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,080
had been here.

659
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,080
Everyone came here looking
for something to hold onto.

660
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,560
Different problems.

661
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,680
School, family, love,  all kinds.

662
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,880
Everyone,  the master’s here.

663
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,880
Oh.

664
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,880
Hey.

665
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

666
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,960
You’re the young man
who visited that day.

667
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,480
You seemed in a rush then.

668
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,920
Oh, I had something urgent,
so I left quick.

669
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,200
I see.

670
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,480
Um…

671
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,960
Who is that?

672
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,480
Oh,  that’s Master Aisoon.

673
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,720
He came out to meet
his disciples.

674
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,960
Can I go talk to him?

675
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,400
- I want to pay respect.
- Hey, hey,

676
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,760
You can’t.

677
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,520
The place is closed today.

678
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,440
And he’s not well lately.

679
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,600
So the house is closed early.

680
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,320
But…

681
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,560
you can still make merit, son.

682
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,040
Green or red,  either is fine.

683
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,960
Any amount.

684
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,760
You’ll get merit the same.

685
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,480
Sure.

686
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,160
Though if it’s grey,

687
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,760
the merit’s a bit bigger.

688
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,920
Hmm. Have you all eaten?

689
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,280
Yes.

690
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,800
Well, if you’re in a rush again,

691
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,920
I’ll have someone pack food for you.

692
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,080
Oh, no need.

693
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,080
Two packs would be good, actually.

694
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,400
I’ll come grab them.

695
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,560
Oh.

696
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,280
Go prep some food for them, okay?

697
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,400
Yes.

698
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,000
Bless you, dear.

699
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,480
If you need anything, just tell me.

700
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,360
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

701
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,160
Goodbye.

702
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,560
Thup.

703
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,680
If you’re hungry, go eat outside.

704
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,960
I’m not hungry.

705
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,560
You,  come with me first.

706
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,840
What?

707
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,400
- You.
- Yes?

708
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,280
What is this place?

709
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,280
Oh, this?

710
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,280
It’s the old clay kiln of Ta Khuean
and the former master.

711
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,400
Hasn’t been used in ages.

712
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,160
Come on,  let’s keep going.

713
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,280
Yes.

714
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,600
You took case evidence home.

715
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,440
If Thup really turns out
to be the killer,

716
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,840
what will you do?

717
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,760
I’ll take responsibility myself.

718
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,640
Thanks for trusting me.

719
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,600
Every corpse had bamboo shoots
in their stomach.

720
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,960
So the kitchen hall,  points straight
to Santi Tham House.

721
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,960
Nettha Sitthang Aroopang.

722
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,600
It’s a chant to call spirits.

723
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,320
I ate seven,

724
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,440
so I’ll eat seven more.

725
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,200
Thup.

726
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,880
Thup, don’t go.

727
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,440
Thup

728
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,840
Action.

729
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,080
Okay, okay,  yeah, roll it up.

730
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,400
Coming in.
(full bite, full mouth)

731
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,200
I’m full. No need for dinner.

732
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,560
This scene’s so hard to play.

733
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,640
Top barely remembered
his lines earlier.

734
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,160
(do I have to memorize too?)
It’s too hard.

735
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,920
(it’s the pair ring, right?)

736
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,080
We’ll have to stay close,
pressed togetherPavel.

737
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,120
(he likes Pel Pel, huh?)
Fine.

738
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,440
(he likes Pel Pel, huh?)
It drops and boom, we’re pressed tight.

739
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,840
(let me nuzzle a bit)
