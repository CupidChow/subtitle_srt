1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,360
Who exactly is this ghost.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,840
That one, Dao. Your mother, Thup.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,280
Then who is my father.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,880
Name’s Atikun.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,280
- Is this the cold room.
- Uh, yeah.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,520
Why build a cold room here.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,880
Mr. Monthat Bunkingklai has died in custody.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,160
You won’t be on this job much longer.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,320
- What happened.
- They pulled me off the case.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,440
You done yet. What should we eat.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,720
Sorry, Song.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,240
You know the killer wasn’t alone.
We could match your DNA.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,000
Thup’s DNA matches Bom’s.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,960
Or maybe they’re siblings.

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,720
If Mek had been removed from the team,

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,400
we wouldn’t have this information.

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,600
Before the name Santi Hinniyom,

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,120
it was Anuphap Bunprim.

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,240
Both first and last names
were changed at fifteen.

20
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,720
Same surname as

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,440
Atikun.

22
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,240
And the DNA matches you too.

23
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,400
Those two are likely father and son.

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,720
And you’re likely siblings with him too.

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,600
But we still have to keep digging.

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,080
Atikun…

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,000
Is he really dead,

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,520
or hiding somewhere.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,280
But if it’s like what I’m thinking,

30
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,640
he probably changed his name
and started a new life,

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,800
in another province,
and kept committing crimes many more times.

32
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,680
I really want to know.

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,280
How the hell did he evade the police.

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
Then…

35
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,920
Can you ask Captain Mek
to check Atikun’s current name.

36
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,200
Already tried.

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,920
But found nothing at all.

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,160
It’s like someone who

39
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,800
is really dead.

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,240
Bom can still be tracked,

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,800
but Atikun…

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,480
there’s nothing at all.

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,520
If you can catch Bom,

44
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,600
finding Atikun shouldn’t be that hard,

45
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,320
if he’s still alive.

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,920
At the very least,

47
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,200
they should still be
contacting each other by phone.

48
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,720
Then try checking,

49
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,400
Bom’s YouTube.

50
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,000
Find anything.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,120
Nothing unusual at all.

52
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,079
But from what I’ve seen,

53
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,120
he’s gone ghost-hunting
and challenging spirits in many areas.

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,800
I think…

55
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Bom likely used this method

56
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,720
to find locations suitable for his rituals.

57
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,720
I didn’t do anything.

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,440
Don’t move.

59
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,840
I said stop.

60
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,440
Back then, when I found that broken doll,

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,720
I might have interfered with Bom’s ritual.

62
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,880
So a new killing began.

63
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,520
It was already Sunday.

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,840
Hey, what are you doing.

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,200
Hey, I’m filming a clip.

66
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,920
Damn it.

67
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,720
His ritual was interrupted.

68
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,720
So he had to kill someone born on Sunday again.

69
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Om.

70
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,920
Mother, bought to worship
the Black House Mother.

71
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,000
The Golden House Mother, buried,

72
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,279
lying sealed within an earthen effigy.

73
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,800
I invoke Wichitramawanna.

74
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,000
Rise. Look forth.

75
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,120
Breathe your will into this house.

76
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,680
(Goddess Bless You From Death)

77
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,440
(Goddess Bless You From Death)

78
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,920
If you hadn’t found those dolls,

79
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,520
I wouldn’t have gotten this close to them.

80
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,920
But I still feel guilty anyway.

81
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,120
Stop obsessing over Atikun.

82
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,080
Finish this case quickly,

83
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,400
and leave all that behind.

84
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,000
But I don’t want others to bully you.

85
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,560
You’re a cop.

86
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,720
How can you love a killer’s child.

87
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
Who said that.

88
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
Huh.

89
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,400
I’ll punch his damn mouth.

90
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,880
I’m protecting your career as a police officer.

91
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,720
Can you stop talking now.

92
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Why.

93
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,920
If I don’t stop,

94
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,200
are you going to kiss me again.

95
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,200
Then I’ll just keep talking.

96
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,600
Seeing you tease like this again,

97
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,160
I feel more at ease.

98
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,080
If you don’t mind,

99
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,440
then I’m okay.

100
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,400
What about Bom.

101
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,040
No movement at all yet.

102
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,680
The car is still parked in the same spot.

103
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,280
But I’ve ordered the entrances and exits sealed.

104
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,080
We’re waiting for the spare key from management.

105
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Sing.

106
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,560
Why did you suddenly get interested in Bom.

107
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,520
I thought Thup might be connected to Atikun somehow.

108
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,680
So I asked him to run a DNA test.

109
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,000
In case it matched someone in our database.

110
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,280
But it matched Bom instead.

111
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Wait.

112
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,600
Since I came back to Bangkok earlier,

113
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,240
what happened in Sisaket.

114
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,920
Atikun

115
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,440
is my father.

116
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
And he’s Bom’s father too.

117
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
What.

118
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,000
What the hell.

119
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,919
Does that mean Thup and Bom are brothers.

120
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,120
What kind of madness is this.

121
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,440
Management says the spare key is ready now.

122
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,800
- Let’s go. Hurry.
- This way.

123
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,000
Looks like worship of Mae Sue.

124
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,320
But changed from worship to a curse.

125
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,000
Changed from white to black.

126
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,920
Normally,

127
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,000
villagers worship Mae Sue

128
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,520
to protect newborn babies.

129
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,440
But some people misuse it like this.

130
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,840
That’s seriously messed up.

131
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,600
Send it for testing too.

132
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,600
- See if it matches the clay.
- Yes.

133
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,000
P’Sing, come take a look at this.

134
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,800
This calendar has Song’s name written on it too.

135
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,920
It matches Sunday.

136
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,520
Song?

137
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,080
The kid in Bom’s gang.

138
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Yes.

139
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,320
Try contacting him.

140
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,200
If Song was really born on Sunday,

141
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,720
Bom probably dragged him off
for the ritual already.

142
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,120
Then who’s the next victim.

143
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
Who is it.

144
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,840
The ritual has to follow
the days in order, right.

145
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,680
So if Song was born on Sunday,

146
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,720
the next one has to be Monday.

147
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,760
Bom Santi

148
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,000
Jump Thitiphon

149
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,680
Song Songsin

150
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,920
Dear Rotsorn

151
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,280
I think this name was born on Monday.

152
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,040
How do you know.

153
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,720
People born on Monday

154
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,400
can’t have vowels in their names.

155
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,920
It’s considered inauspicious.

156
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Dear.

157
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,480
Born on the 25th, month 11, 2002.

158
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,320
25th of November, 2002.

159
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,840
Damn, Dear was really born on Monday.

160
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,280
Then the next victim

161
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,280
has to be this one.

162
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,040
Shit.

163
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,400
This place is creepy as hell.
Customers would love it.

164
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,600
Hey…

165
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,520
If Song still hasn’t shown up,

166
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,120
maybe… maybe we should go back.

167
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Hey…

168
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,600
Let’s go back.

169
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,400
Go back my ass. We’re already here.

170
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,400
This room’s perfect. Great content.

171
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Look.

172
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,800
Damn, it looks so real.

173
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,920
What was that sound.

174
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,600
I think it’s that room.

175
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,520
Let’s go back.

176
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,120
Did you hear something.

177
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,720
Hey, hey, just go back.

178
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,440
Wait. We’re already this far.

179
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,920
Jump.

180
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Jump.

181
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Jump.

182
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,520
Jump, wake up.

183
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Bom.

184
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,840
Bom.

185
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,040
Monday is done.

186
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,240
Tuesday is done too.

187
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,400
What’s wrong with you.

188
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,600
You haven’t talked to me since earlier.

189
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,040
Or…

190
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,200
Seriously.

191
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,200
Are you still annoyed with me about

192
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,720
me doing those ritual cleansings.

193
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,320
If that’s the case,

194
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,520
would you want me to stop for you.

195
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
Oh.

196
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,120
Probably not.

197
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,520
The reason I do those rituals

198
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,280
is because Master Aisoon once warned me

199
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,400
that if I didn’t,

200
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,640
people close to me could get caught in it too.

201
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,280
And the reason I took holy water baths

202
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,320
- Being soaked like a stray dog is because…
- Because of superstition.

203
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,680
I just don’t want that person to be you, Sey.

204
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Just thinking that something happened to you,

205
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,000
my heart nearly shattered.

206
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,200
If you had told me beforehand,

207
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,720
I wouldn’t have gotten angry.

208
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,320
If I told you, we’d end up fighting.

209
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,920
I don’t want us to fight like before anymore.

210
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,600
Every time we disagreed,
everything fell apart.

211
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,040
I don’t want that.

212
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,920
But if we don’t talk honestly,

213
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,600
it’ll just turn into an undercurrent later.

214
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,680
And I’m not okay with that either.

215
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,120
But from now on,

216
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,040
I’ll adjust.

217
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,200
But…

218
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,240
if you’re going to do
something like this again,

219
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,720
just tell me first.

220
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Okay.

221
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,319
This is…

222
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,000
the protective charm I told you to carry, right.

223
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,839
You actually kept it with you.

224
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,920
I carry it all the time.

225
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,760
So you believe in this stuff now.

226
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
No.

227
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,920
I don’t really believe in this stuff.

228
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,520
But I believe in you.

229
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,160
If you tell me to carry it,

230
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,960
then I will.

231
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,080
Because I want to be with you forever.

232
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,400
I’ve chosen already.

233
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
What is this.

234
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,520
Suddenly getting all sweet.

235
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
I don’t know how to react now.

236
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,920
I can be sweeter than this.

237
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
Wait.

238
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,000
You’re not supposed to wear a Palad Khik
when doing it.

239
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,400
This is my old room.

240
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,120
For now, use it as a safe house
while you’re suspended.

241
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,880
Make yourself at home.

242
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,840
About how many hours.

243
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
Yes.

244
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,720
Alright. Thank you very much.

245
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Everyone.

246
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,000
I’ve contacted Dear’s parents.

247
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,920
They said Dear left home since the afternoon.

248
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,360
His phone is off. They can’t reach him.

249
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,400
I’ll try requesting additional CCTV footage
from private sources.

250
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,200
What about the other kids in the gang.

251
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,680
Jump.

252
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,640
Can’t contact him.
Looks like the whole gang vanished.

253
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,520
I think this is a really bad sign.

254
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
Hungry.

255
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,040
It’s okay, P’.

256
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,200
I don’t really feel like eating anyway.

257
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,440
I’m basically skin and bones already.

258
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,120
Don’t you usually fuss about food.

259
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,320
Come on. I’ll take you to eat.

260
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,400
Come on.

261
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,720
Have you heard anything about P'Sing.

262
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,000
Not yet.

263
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,720
Hey…

264
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,000
I think we should go see P'Sing.

265
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,600
So we can tell him about Santi Tham House.

266
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,400
Then we can keep working, right.

267
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,320
Right now, our heads are already half
on the chopping block.

268
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,120
Big Pong won’t like it for sure.

269
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,800
If he finds out the medical examiner

270
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,040
nudged the police to reopen the case.

271
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,400
Screw it.

272
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,080
We’re doing the right thing.

273
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,520
If we get fired, so be it.

274
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,520
As long as you’ve got me.

275
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,480
That’s badass.

276
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,240
Because our heads will roll together.

277
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,920
Sey.

278
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,000
Who taught you to say things like bad omens.

279
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,320
Just kidding.

280
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,880
Can I come closer.

281
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,320
Another round.

282
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,400
Excuse me.

283
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,200
Could you please sign these documents, doctor.

284
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,080
Of course.

285
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,000
Got a headache.

286
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
A little.

287
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,320
You’ve got a fever.

288
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,000
Should you rest a bit.

289
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,440
You haven’t rested since
getting back from Sisaket.

290
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,360
Victims can’t wait.

291
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,720
How can the police rest.

292
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,920
But…

293
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,240
But what.

294
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,400
But you’re older now.

295
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,320
I’m saying this because I care.

296
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,720
If you don’t rest,

297
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,320
you’ll get sick.

298
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
Don’t you love someone once they’re older.

299
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,080
When I get older,

300
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,600
will you love me less.

301
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Well.

302
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,800
So, do you love me or not.

303
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,000
Of course I love you.

304
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,320
No matter how old you get, I’ll still love you.

305
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,520
Then no need to rest anymore.

306
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,200
Just hearing that

307
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
already cured me.

308
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,800
What, haven’t you heard

309
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,280
when they say

310
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,560
love

311
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,400
makes people stronger.

312
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,280
Sweet stuff like this doesn’t suit P'Singha.

313
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,400
It just doesn’t fit.

314
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,120
You’ve got the nerve to tease me now.

315
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,720
You don’t have to be that sweet.

316
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,320
I’m getting all grossed out. About to puke.

317
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,000
Teasing, huh.

318
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
Come in.

319
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,120
These images were taken
from Santi Tham House.

320
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
This room is in the inner zone
on the second floor.

321
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,920
It was tightly locked.

322
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,920
You guys think there’s something
in the cold room, right.

323
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
A body.

324
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Or a victim.

325
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,320
They might still be frozen inside.

326
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,520
A cold room helps preserve the body.

327
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,080
From the victims you’ve examined,

328
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,800
is this kind of storage method possible.

329
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,120
If the room temperature is below 5 degrees,

330
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,680
and the victim’s clothing is thick enough,

331
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,480
if the killer forces the victim
into a curled position,

332
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,800
the brain slows down,

333
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,760
the body enters hypothermia.

334
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,680
The organs gradually shut down,

335
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,120
and death occurs naturally.

336
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,320
And how long does that take.

337
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,200
Several hours.

338
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,320
So if the killer used this method
and the victim isn’t dead yet,

339
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,720
we still have a chance
to get there in time.

340
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,600
Found the car.

341
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,280
Jump’s car turned off the main road
toward the southern route.

342
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,040
- Send people.
- Yes.

343
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Sing.

344
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,720
Did you forget.

345
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,400
We’ve been pulled off this case.

346
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,400
What authority do you have to give orders.

347
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,000
I’ll track Jump myself.

348
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,200
Then Santi Tham House,

349
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,960
I’ll handle that part myself.

350
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
You.

351
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,120
this is Jump’s car.

352
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
Mek.

353
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
Follow me in.

354
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,720
Should we split up and search.

355
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,880
No. It’s dangerous right now.

356
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,520
But it increases the chance
of finding the victim.

357
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,200
We’re racing against time.

358
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,320
Mek, go get the warrant.

359
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,120
Dad, please sign this for me.

360
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,080
I told you already. No means no.

361
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,160
But we have this much
credible information already.

362
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,320
Are you going to let the criminal walk free.

363
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,040
The case is closed.

364
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,920
I remember transferring you
to Central Investigation already, didn’t I.

365
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,800
Because it’s really not over yet.

366
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,960
I’m asking for just one signature.

367
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,720
Let me search Santi Tham House.

368
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,280
To see what’s really inside.

369
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,040
Stop working on this damn case already.

370
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,000
I swallowed my pride

371
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,960
and sent you back to Central Investigation

372
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
to preserve what little
police honor you have left.

373
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,720
But you

374
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:37,400
keep trying to play the righteous cop
in some morality drama with your friends.

375
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,600
I’m just here to inform you

376
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,000
that I’m going to search Santi Tham House.

377
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,240
And if you don’t sign the approval,

378
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,600
then be careful what I might start talking about,
the things you’ve been covering up.

379
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,480
I’m your father.

380
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,720
How dare you talk to me like that.

381
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,240
Send people to Santi Tham House now.

382
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
King.

383
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,120
As for the warrant,

384
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
I’ll follow up.

385
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,680
Who do you think you are.

386
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,760
King.

387
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,920
Get back here right now.

388
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,880
You ungrateful bastard.

389
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Thup.

390
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
Thup.

391
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,200
Mek.

392
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,720
(Chanting)

393
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,400
(Chanting)

394
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,120
(Chanting)

395
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,200
(Chanting)

396
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,560
(Chanting)

397
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,280
(Chanting)

398
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,280
(Chanting)

399
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,440
(Chanting)

400
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,040
Follow me.

401
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,120
We have to find out.

402
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,480
Where the key to that suspicious room is.

403
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,720
And where are you going to get it.

404
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,160
Hey.

405
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,480
Master Aisoon. Master Aisoon.

406
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,400
What’s wrong, Master Aisoon.

407
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,840
Call a doctor.

408
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,600
Something’s wrong with Master Aisoon.

409
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Yes.

410
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,320
We’re doctors.

411
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,960
- This way.
- Excuse us.

412
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,000
Excuse me.

413
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,720
The patient can’t breathe.

414
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,560
- Some water, please.
- Yes.

415
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,680
Try to stay calm.

416
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,800
Darin, hold his arm.

417
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
Excuse me.

418
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,800
Spit it out.

419
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,320
Okay.

420
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,360
Relax.

421
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,400
Take a deep breath.

422
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,320
P'Singha.

423
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,800
P'Singha.

424
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,920
Can you hear me, P'Singha.

425
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,280
P'Singha.

426
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,240
Answer me.

427
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Thup.

428
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,680
P'Singha isn’t responding.

429
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,120
The radio doesn’t seem to work.

430
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,000
P'Sing, can you hear me.

431
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,520
If you hear me, please answer.

432
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,760
P'Sing. You,

433
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,040
Thup, let me see the radio.

434
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,199
P'Sing. P'Sing.

435
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,800
The signal’s probably bad.

436
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,520
P'Sing will probably come back.
Let’s wait here.

437
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,000
What is that.

438
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,639
That’s a talisman from Santi Tham House.

439
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,720
P'Singha.

440
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
Mesa.

441
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,480
Mesa.

442
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,520
Why.

443
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,800
Why didn’t you believe me.

444
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,120
Why.

445
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,400
I believe you.

446
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,240
I believe you now.

447
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,200
If you had believed me,
I wouldn’t be dead.

448
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
I,

449
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,520
I’m sorry.

450
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,640
Mesa, I’m sorry.

451
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,440
Please forgive me.

452
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,320
Don’t be mad at me.

453
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,040
Come back home with Mom and me.

454
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,760
Mesa, where are you going.

455
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,520
I’m not well. We’re almost home already.

456
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,880
- Why are you saying such crazy things.
- Mom’s the crazy one.

457
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,760
Why didn’t you believe me.

458
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,160
I told you to come live together.

459
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,320
Wait here for me first, okay.

460
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,880
In case someone comes back.

461
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,440
Thup. Thup. Thup.

462
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,320
Damn it.

463
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,720
P'Singha.

464
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,720
P'Singha.

465
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,280
P'Singha.

466
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,680
P'Singha.

467
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,120
P'Singha.

468
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,880
P'Singha. It’s me, Thup.

469
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,440
P'Singha.

470
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,520
P'Singha. It’s me, Thup.

471
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,720
P'Singha.

472
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,880
P'Singha.

473
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,640
P'Singha.

474
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,320
Thup. Thup.

475
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
Thup.

476
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,120
My little sister.

477
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,400
- Okay, all set, Inspector.
- Yes.

478
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,600
What did you actually see.

479
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,520
I think I saw my sister.

480
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,600
But in the end,

481
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,320
it turned into a hollow-eyed ghost.

482
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,800
That definitely wasn’t my sister.

483
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,920
A hollow-eyed ghost.

484
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,000
I think

485
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,480
it was definitely their doing.

486
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,680
They probably sent it to target you.

487
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,720
And with your body this weak,

488
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,680
it makes it easier for them.

489
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,600
Bastards.

490
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,680
They used my sister,

491
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,480
who’s already dead, to come after me.

492
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,920
Do you still feel guilty about your sister.

493
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,480
If there’s something weighing on your heart,

494
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,400
you can tell me.

495
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,400
Take her to a psychiatrist.

496
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
Trust me.

497
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,640
She’s seriously ill.
She’s almost gone mad.

498
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,840
Why are you saying things like that.
That’s your sister.

499
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,120
Believe me.
No spirit doctors, no monks.

500
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,800
- Go see a doctor.
- Singha.

501
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,920
Back then, I didn’t believe
my sister was seeing ghosts.

502
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,360
And my mom tried to treat my sister,

503
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,120
using occult methods.

504
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,440
Mesa.

505
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,040
Mesa.

506
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Mesa.

507
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,400
Where are you going.
Do your homework first.

508
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,720
Come play with me.

509
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,920
Come play with me.

510
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,320
Follow me. Come on.

511
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,040
One day, my mom told me

512
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,520
she found my sister,

513
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,640
dead by the river.

514
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,320
If back then I had believed my mom,

515
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,280
and followed what she said,

516
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,640
Mesa might still be alive.

517
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,560
You don’t have to feel guilty.

518
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,600
People are born

519
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,120
with different ways of thinking.

520
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,320
But if one day,

521
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,920
we open our minds,

522
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,520
and come to understand it,

523
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,880
that’s already enough.

524
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,680
No one ever knows

525
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,480
when we’ll stay or when we’ll leave.

526
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,120
But one thing’s certain.

527
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,720
Mesa, your younger sister

528
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,680
She wouldn’t want to see you
suffering from nightmares like this.

529
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,800
Forgive yourself.

530
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,920
Thank you.

531
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,480
For saving me.

532
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,640
You’re the one

533
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,720
who saved me.

534
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,400
Dry food.

535
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,480
Shit.

536
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,560
P'King.

537
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,400
Easy, Sey.

538
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:50,200
How did you get here anyway.

539
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,680
- What about the warrant.
- What use is a warrant now.

540
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,720
You’re already inside.

541
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Sey.

542
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,800
Go help Darin.

543
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,640
I’ll take over here.

544
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,640
You sure.

545
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,040
Go stall for time.

546
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,200
We’ll meet at the safe house.

547
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,880
Okay.

548
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,520
Be careful.

549
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,400
What are you doing to me.

550
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,160
Stop.

551
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,800
What is that.

552
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,520
Sorted by birth day.

553
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,280
- Yes.
- I was born on Friday.

554
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,120
So it goes under Friday.

555
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,360
Friday.

556
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,760
Friday is done.

557
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,560
Friday.

558
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,880
(Next Episode Preview)

Right now we need to find
who belongs to Thursday.

561
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,000
P'Sing, what about Darin.

562
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,720
We’ve located King.

563
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,640
What if the one he wants isn’t me,
but someone else.

564
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,120
It’s dangerous. Don’t go out.

565
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,680
Once all seven are killed,the ritual will be
performed on the night of the new moon.

566

Then gently push him away, make it a bit sexy.

571
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,280
(Looking very professional, Darin)
- See, that’s pro right there. / - Okay, got it. Let’s do that.

572
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,480
About to lose it already.

573
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,360
Oh, no, no, no.

574
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,760
How can a cop fall in love
with a murderer’s child.

575
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,200
(Sudden kiss!!)

576
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,640
Can you stop talking now.

577
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,440
If I don’t stop,

578
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,320
you won’t stop kissing me.

579
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,160
(This kid’s dangerous)
