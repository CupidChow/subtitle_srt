1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,240
This kind of doll is a Siakaban doll.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,920
Only a shaman’s house would have it.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,680
Or a medium’s shrine.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,880
Thup, it’s me.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,840
Then can you explain it?

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,840
Why this victim buried the doll in the garden?

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,120
I think was hit with witchcraft.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,720
You don’t know Singha?

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,200
He once caused a death from framing like this.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,720
Ghost, come out now.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,360
Someone’s testing it.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,560
- Jump
- Stop

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,960
Thup, Thup.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,920
Thup.

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,080
Thup.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,760
Don’t be scared.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,000
I’m right here.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,840
It’s fine, it’s fine.

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,080
It’s fine.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,200
Easy, easy.

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,480
Easy.

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,360
Uh, Inspector.

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,000
I’ll take these kids to the station first.

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,520
Uh,

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,760
Yeah, okay. I’ll follow.

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,200
Come on, move. You kids.

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,640
Easy, easy, Thup.

28
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,480
You okay?

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,800
P'Singha.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,000
I saw a ghost again.

31
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,720
I know.

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,120
But I’m here now.

33
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,920
No one…

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,039
no ghost can hurt you now.

35
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,320
Inspector.

36
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,759
He should be fine now.

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,440
Thup just got scared.

38
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,360
So I calmed him down.

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,320
Oh, okay.

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,479
I mean it.

41
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,760
I didn’t say anything.

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,920
Take his phone too.

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,639
- Yes.
- Get it checked.

44
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,800
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,080
You really okay?

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,640
I’m okay.

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,840
Then go.

48
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,720
Go.

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,960
So what did you see just now?

50
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,840
You looked more scared than usual.

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,120
Here.

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,440
Thup.

53
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,480
You took this from the scene?

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,120
Uh, I saw it on the ground.

55
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,160
I didn’t know who dropped it.

56
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,240
Maybe it belonged to those YouTubers.

57
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,920
I didn’t dare hand it to you. They were live.

58
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,320
Didn’t want people panicking more.

59
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,840
But you shouldn’t pick it up bare-handed.

60
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,520
I really didn’t think.

61
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,920
I think…

62
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,760
the ghost got mad I found the Siakaban doll.

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,360
Because normal wandering spirits

64
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,560
don’t hurt people.

65
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,320
They want merit offerings.

66
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,480
But this one…

67
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,600
feels like it came to harm someone.

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,240
What do you mean?

69
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,440
I don’t get it.

70
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,360
I think…

71
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,120
the ghost was following an order.

72
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,440
An order?

73
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,880
You saying someone can control a ghost?

74
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,120
Yes.

75
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,320
Like I told you before.

76
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,079
Anyone with these dolls might be hit with witchcraft.

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,680
And the one controlling the ghost…

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,920
has to be a dark shaman.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,880
Witchcraft, ghosts…

80
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,640
and now a shaman who can command one?

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,040
People who keep ghosts to use won’t stop.

82
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,000
From my time as a temple kid,

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,720
and everything I’ve lived through,

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,320
I can guarantee you this:

85
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,640
they won’t stop.

86
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,320
Then I need to know.

87
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,560
Who that damn shaman is.

88
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:59,120
(Goddess Bless You From Death)

89
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,040
Whoa.

90
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,200
What are you doing, Thup?

91
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,600
Trying to burn my house down?

92
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,320
No.

93
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,360
I’m praying to Thao Wessuwan.

94
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,520
Touched something bad yesterday.

95
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,440
Need him to protect the two of us.

96
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,159
When did you buy all this?

97
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,360
Oh.

98
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,800
I woke up around five.

99
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,720
Went to the market on purpose.

100
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,440
You should pray with me.

101
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,800
He’s been protecting you all along.

102
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,200
I can pray for you,

103
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,560
but all I can do is dedicate merit for you.

104
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,120
The rest is something you need to do yourself.

105
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,240
Stuff like this comes from the heart.

106
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,520
And this Thao Wessuwan,

107
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,000
my mom gave him to me.

108
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,240
Of course I have to respect him.

109
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,840
And if you weren’t tied to cases like this,

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,320
I wouldn’t ask you to pray yourself.

111
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
What now?

112
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,480
The Phirot Ring.

113
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,120
Old folks say

114
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,240
wearing it keeps danger away.

115
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,680
You making this up to fool me?

116
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,800
Just because I gave in a little?

117
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,360
You’re delusional.

118
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,840
Just wear it.

119
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,880
I even rented it from a hardcore master.

120
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,440
Think of it as fashion if you want.

121
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,920
Then why are you wearing one?

122
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,440
They have to be worn as a pair?

123
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,880
Of course they do.

124
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,840
We’re dealing with
witchcraft cases all the time now.

125
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,040
You think I’d rent one just for you?

126
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,799
I need to survive too.

127
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,200
I don’t want to wear a matching ring with you.

128
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,799
Everyone knows it’s a Phirot Ring.

129
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,640
No one thinks it’s a couple ring.

130
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,360
Only…

131
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,280
someone clueless like you.

132
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,440
Hey, you little,

133
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,360
The ring does look kinda cool though.

134
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,120
Time to eat.

135
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,320
Hey, P'Singha, wait.

136
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,080
Where’s the food, Thup?

137
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,840
Uh…

138
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,920
I spent all my money on offerings today.

139
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,720
So I think you might have to…

140
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,880
eat red apples, grapes,
pomegranate, dragon fruit

141
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,200
instead of breakfast.

142
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Hey, no, no.

143
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,880
We’ll just eat out.

144
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,880
Oh, okay.

145
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,400
Let’s go.

146
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,840
Why are you here?

147
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,360
Got yourself a smart little
suspect guarding your house now?

148
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
How many times do I have to say it?

149
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,760
Thup is a witness.

150
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,240
Not a suspect.

151
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,360
And you? How did you get in?

152
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,080
Same way I always did.

153
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,360
I got in the same way now.

154
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,080
You gonna tell me yet?

155
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,800
Why you’re here.

156
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,720
Or should I arrest you for trespassing?

157
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,160
Fine.

158
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,560
I’ll give in.

159
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,640
I just came to warn you about last night.

160
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,720
Inspector Singha letting
outsiders enter a crime scene,

161
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,680
that’s not good at all.

162
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,800
We already pulled them out.

163
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,000
And more importantly,
the scene wasn’t damaged.

164
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,040
And you, head of the special unit,

165
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,040
what were you doing?

166
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,360
Just sitting around?

167
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,880
Collecting a paycheck, huh?

168
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,080
The scene may not be damaged,

169
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,680
but the case can be.

170
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,800
And more importantly,

171
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,760
a cop like you went and did that on camera.

172
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,720
I went in because Thup saw a ghost.

173
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,520
A ghost.

174
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,920
Someone like you believes in ghosts?

175
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,800
I don’t.

176
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,440
But anything that protects
the only witness in this case, I’ll do it.

177
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,840
Clear?

178
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,120
I could let last night slide.

179
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
But hurry up.

180
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,600
I need this case closed fast.

181
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,720
Orders from headquarters.

182
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,160
I hope you won’t waste time
playing ghost games,

183
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,040
and forget what matters.

184
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,360
Because if you get transferred this time,

185
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,160
no one can save you.

186
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,400
What’s wrong?

187
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,400
I’m fine.

188
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,320
Let’s go.

189
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,600
You worried about hugging on
the live last night?

190
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,800
Don’t worry.

191
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,160
I handled it.

192
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,120
I was just thinking…

193
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,400
where you hide your keys so
P'King can’t find them.

194
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,600
The spare key?

195
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,680
Why do you need to know?

196
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
You go home with me every day anyway.

197
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,520
Or you planning something?

198
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,600
Don’t let me find out.

199
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,360
I’ll lock you up for sure.

200
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,720
It’s not like that.

201
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,120
I may not have money,

202
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,720
but I’ve never thought of
stealing from anyone.

203
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,680
Including stealing someone
who already belongs to someone else.

204
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,480
If he really was your boyfriend,

205
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,520
I shouldn’t be around you like this.

206
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,800
It wouldn’t look good.

207
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,640
I don’t have a boyfriend.

208
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,880
No one owns me either.

209
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,120
Okay, then.

210
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,840
That’s a relief.

211
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,400
What?

212
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,320
I’m not gonna do anything to you.

213
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,480
Someone like me,

214
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,800
I don’t do things to people that easily.

215
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,800
Someone I’d like…

216
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,560
can’t be scared of ghosts.

217
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,400
And can’t be obsessed with the supernatural.

218
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
What are you talking about?

219
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,760
I didn’t even say anything.

220
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,520
Why are you telling me that?

221
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,840
Mm.

222
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,120
Oh, thanks.

223
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,320
Hungover?

224
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,520
Yeah.

225
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,280
Dehydrated.

226
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,360
That bad? Want to call in sick?

227
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,040
I’m fine.

228
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,000
But last night,

229
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
I was so drunk I remember nothing.

230
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,480
I still have no idea

231
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,440
how I ended up in your room.

232
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,840
That’s you.

233
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,000
Always crawling back here in the end.

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What?

235
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,440
What are you staring at?

236
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,200
Can’t I tease you a little?

237
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,120
So last night was that fun?

238
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,440
Heh.

239
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,120
Where do I ever party?

240
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,560
That was…

241
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,880
my first blackout in years.

242
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,760
Of course.

243
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,320
When you were with me,

244
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,400
I never saw you into that stuff.

245
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,160
So why go this time?

246
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,040
Just trying something new.

247
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,840
Maybe I’d find something new.

248
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,320
They say

249
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,120
if you live the same way,

250
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,320
you only meet the same things.

251
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,520
And what’s so wrong with the same old things?

252
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,160
And in your story,

253
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,520
that someone new?

254
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,760
Even if he is,

255
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,839
it still has nothing to do with you.

256
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,800
I’m thirsty too.

257
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,319
Go make your own drink.

258
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
(Did you get home safe last night?)

259
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,040
(Want to meet outside next time?)

260
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,400
We really didn’t do anything wrong.

261
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,040
Just stepping into a crime scene

262
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,680
is already illegal.

263
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,240
Didn’t you know that?

264
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,440
What did you guys run into last night?

265
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,080
Tell me everything.

266
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,760
Well…

267
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,920
No noth… nothing much.

268
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,800
– Shit.
– Jump!

269
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,560
You called, so here I am.

270
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,320
It was so dark I could barely see anything.

271
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,560
You’re sure?

272
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,600
’Cause it looked like you
were running from something.

273
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,320
See a ghost?

274
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,800
You saw it too?

275
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,760
Like it was coming to take my friend?

276
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,960
Bom, shut it.

277
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,800
Well?

278
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,360
I barely remember anything.

279
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,200
I… I’m sorry.

280
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,240
I shouldn’t have tried to provoke anything.

281
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,160
Sacred beings, please protect me.

282
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,400
Namo Tassa Bhagavato…

283
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,360
I’m really sorry.

284
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,400
Whose doll is this?

285
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,840
It’s not ours.

286
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,680
We don’t know anything about it.

287
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,600
You know something?

288
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,920
You’re the one who brought us there.

289
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,720
If you know anything, tell him.

290
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,040
I really don’t know anything.

291
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,400
I… I didn’t think
that place actually had anything.

292
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,720
This headless doll, does it
have anything to do with the case?

293
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,160
You’re in no position to ask us anything.

294
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,720
If I ask, you answer.

295
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,640
So whose doll is it?

296
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,040
It’s really not ours.

297
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,680
We didn’t take anything from the scene.

298
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,520
If it’s not yours, how’d it end up there?

299
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,680
Sing.

300
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,240
Ko.

301
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,920
Take these kids for DNA and record history.

302
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,240
Then release them.

303
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,240
And I hope won’t see you posting

304
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,880
Or doing anything tied to the scene again.

305
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,720
Otherwise,

306
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,000
Next time won’t be just history.

307
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,720
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

308
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,960
- Go.
- Go.

309
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,880
- Go now.
- Follow.

310
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,200
Sing.

311
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,040
Questioned so much, still no progress.

312
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,800
I say go back to my plan.

313
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,640
Plant charges on a witness?

314
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
Two years passed.

315
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,120
You still use the same dirty tricks.

316
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,800
Don’t get mad at me yet.

317
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,920
I think you and me just now

318
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,960
Played good cop bad cop well as always.

319
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,920
It’s classic.

320
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,280
Bad cop role is for scaring.

321
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,440
I’ve always played it like that.

322
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,160
And you,

323
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,720
Just put on the good guy face.

324
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,280
Aren’t you good at it.

325
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,800
Go ahead and jab at me all you want.

326
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,200
I won’t blame you.

327
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,560
Just like that you and I
don’t have to try so hard.

328
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,520
Still click the same.

329
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,800
Makes sense you’re
my best partner ever.

330
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,280
Wait, Sing.

331
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,920
So what will you do next?

332
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,840
Plan in my room.

333
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,360
Or yours, fine either way.

334
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,000
Don’t.

335
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,880
Work better alone.

336
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,160
Don’t want a partner.

337
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,320
How is it, P'Singha?

338
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,000
What did the YouTubers say?

339
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,560
They swore they’d never
seen the doll before.

340
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,960
Means nothing is moving then.

341
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,920
Must’ve missed something.

342
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,600
Thup.

343
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,400
You said the talismans.

344
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,640
And those clay dolls.

345
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,560
Must be from a shaman’s house.

346
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,480
Or a medium’s shrine, right?

347
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,640
Yes.

348
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Why?

349
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,200
And what if it’s a house.

350
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,080
Or a center inviting people
to meditate and practice?

351
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,760
I just saw that the homes
of these two victims.

352
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,120
Had the same prayer book.

353
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,040
Searched it.
(Santi Tham)

354
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,680
Came up as Santi Tham.

355
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,280
Santi Tham House?

356
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,000
Yes.

357
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,520
You think there’s
something there?

358
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Religious centers.

359
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,560
Should mostly be good people.

360
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,880
Still have to check
to be sure.

361
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,400
Feels a bit too coincidental.

362
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,400
These two victims.

363
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,200
Had the same prayer book.

364
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,840
Mek.

365
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,040
Yes.

366
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,520
Send these dolls to forensics.

367
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,640
- Might find something useful.
- Yes.

368
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,240
And Santi Tham House.

369
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,560
Look into it.

370
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,040
And check.

371
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,640
If any victim.

372
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,040
Knew or ever went there.

373
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,560
Yes.

374
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,720
- Uh.
- Yes.

375
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,240
There’s a ritual…

376
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,400
Let’s talk over there instead.

377
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,440
Yes.

378
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,840
What were you about
to ask me?

379
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,000
Does this place have
a Mae Sue worship ritual?

380
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,760
Sorry?

381
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,120
Like animal heads,
like a tiger head.

382
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,520
Tiger head, Ekalai.

383
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,120
Saturday’s Mae Sue.

384
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
Guys like us.

385
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,720
Know Mae Sue too?

386
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,240
Know a little.

387
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,600
So… do they perform
that ritual here?

388
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,000
Hm. They don’t.

389
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,440
It’s an old belief.

390
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,640
Okay.

391
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,080
- Thank you.
- Mhm.

392
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,320
I checked what you
told me to.

393
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,200
In the CCTV.

394
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,400
Khun Thee went to make merit
at Santi Tham House every day.

395
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,920
As for Khun Meen.

396
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,760
The last victim.

397
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,560
Stopped for gas.

398
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,120
On the route to Santi Tham House
as well.

399
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,640
Right now I think these
seven victims.

400
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Must have something linked
to Santi Tham House.

401
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,840
And maybe the two
Siakaban dolls we found.

402
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,000
Might have something linked.

403
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,200
To the belief in Mae Sue.

404
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,560
Each Mae Sue.

405
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,960
Watches over those born
on each day.

406
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,440
If so.

407
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,040
These seven victims.

408
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,720
Might all be born
on different days.

409
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,640
Jame Jirayu.

410
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,120
Born Sunday.

411
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,520
Jom Jompon.

412
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,920
Born Monday.

413
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,720
Orn Orawan.

414
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,240
Born Tuesday.

415
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,160
Thee Thanakorn.

416
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,440
Born Wednesday.

417
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,480
Kaew Kotchakorn.

418
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,000
Born Thursday.

419
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,240
Nai Chanin, born Friday.

420
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,200
Meen Phakaphong.

421
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,560
Born Saturday.

422
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,720
All seven victims.

423
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,120
Were born on different days.

424
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,840
If it’s really a ritual,
like Thup said.

425
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,680
I think every victim.

426
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
Might have a Siakaban doll
in their home.

427
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,200
If we find those dolls.

428
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,840
We can start forming
a hypothesis.

429
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,440
Should I request warrants
to search the other victims’ homes?

430
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,920
Good. Do it.

431
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,200
Phone, Earn, come with me.

432
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

433
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,920
This is because of you.

434
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:12,000
You helped me and the team
find links between the victims.

435
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,720
We’re getting closer
to the killer.

436
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,680
(Seven-Tree Case)
(Meen, Thee)

437
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,800
(Nai)

438
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,120
I’m glad.

439
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,720
To help you.

440
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,440
What is it?

441
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,400
Oh, the paperwork Inspector
asked me to do.

442
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,120
Requesting to meet
Trewit, inmate in Phang Nga.

443
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,920
From the similar case
ten years ago.

444
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,520
Good. Tell them.

445
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,760
In an hour, I’ll go in.

446
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,960
Yes.

447
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,600
Want me to go alone?

448
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,120
Think you want to finish
something first?

449
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,320
Nothing I need to finish.

450
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,840
Tell them I’ll go in.

451
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,240
Yes.

452
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,920
And?

453
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,320
Will you take your
favorite witness.

454
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,280
To meet the killer too?

455
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,800
Not your business.

456
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,120
I’m the head of the
special investigation team.

457
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,840
Your business is mine.

458
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,240
Uh, P'Singha.

459
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
I’ll wait at home.

460
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,320
You’ll work more comfortably.

461
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,360
Having me there
might not be good.

462
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,400
You sure you can go home?

463
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,920
I can.

464
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,280
Spare key.

465
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,120
Under the plant pot.

466
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,960
Leftmost of the fence.

467
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,240
If doctors can’t love patients.

468
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,720
Cops shouldn’t love suspects.

469
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,320
Hope you know the line.

470
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,720
How many times must I say.

471
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,640
Thup and I.

472
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,440
Are just cop and witness.

473
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,000
I want to believe that.

474
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,440
But right now you look like
a stubborn suspect, Singha.

475
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,840
Don’t act like you know me.

476
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,200
Because I really do
know you.

477
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,000
I’ve seen that look
in your eyes.

478
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,480
Before.

479
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,480
You used to look
at me like that.

480
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,160
Are you a chronicle
or what?

481
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,320
Always digging up
the past.

482
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,240
What’s over is over.

483
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,720
Someone like me,
hurt sticks.

484
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,360
Watch me.

485
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,440
I’ll do whatever it takes
to get you back.

486
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,720
I’ll prove it to you.

487
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,520
That I’ve changed.

488
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,240
P'Sing.

489
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,880
Can we talk?

490
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,960
Let’s go.

491
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,360
What is it? Work?

492
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,320
Not work.

493
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,520
I need advice.

494
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,920
About Darin.

495
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,720
You two getting back together?

496
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,760
Opposite.

497
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
I really want to move on.

498
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,520
But damn.

499
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,200
Feels like I’m stuck in a loop.

500
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,680
Can’t get anywhere with anyone.

501
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,600
Getting back with her…

502
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,440
Doesn’t feel right.

503
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,120
Whatever makes you happy.

504
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,920
Pick one and go with it.

505
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,680
But.

506
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,560
You saw what it was like
when we were together.

507
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,640
How much of a headache it was.

508
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,720
Let it go.

509
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,200
With how you two are now.

510
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,000
It’ll take a long time
to settle.

511
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,840
What ring is that?

512
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,320
Thup gave it to me.

513
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,920
He said.

514
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,640
It keeps bad things away.

515
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,520
In case the case involves
black magic, so we don’t die.

516
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,640
Didn’t you not believe
in this stuff?

517
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,400
Still don’t.

518
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,080
But if wearing it makes
Thup feel safer.

519
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,720
I just… don’t want
to see him anxious.

520
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,960
Oh.

521
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,040
So you’re doing it
for Thup.

522
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,280
Don’t turn it back to me.

523
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,120
Worry about yourself.

524
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,320
Ask yourself first.

525
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,960
Whether you can’t move on,
or can’t do anything.

526
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,560
Because you’re scared of what?

527
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,239
I just want both me
and her to be okay.

528
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,920
I don’t know.

529
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,000
If I really manage to move on.

530
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,840
Will she be okay?

531
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,120
You? Move on?

532
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
You still worry about her
this much.

533
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,040
How will you move on?

534
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,080
P'Sing.

535
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,320
Even if she’s an ex.

536
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,239
Darin is still…

537
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,840
A junior.

538
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,440
A coworker.

539
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,320
A bed partner.

540
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,360
I still do everything
the same.

541
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,719
I don’t want her hurt.

542
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,719
Then why make it so hard
for you two?

543
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,920
I just want both of you
to be happy.

544
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,720
But for you.

545
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,520
You should start thinking
about yourself too.

546
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,280
About what?

547
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,840
You know it well.

548
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,640
P'King came back.

549
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,240
Not just for the case.

550
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,840
He probably wants
to make up with you.

551
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,240
So what will you do?

552
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,320
Will you give him a chance?

553
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,880
Me and King.

554
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,120
No way.

555
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,240
I didn’t mean just P'King.

556
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,720
I meant the one
who gave you the ring.

557
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,920
P'Sing.

558
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,040
If you have a way
to move on.

559
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,080
I want you to.

560
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,960
Don’t get stuck in a loop
like me.

561
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,840
Messy.

562
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,120
When the case ends,
you separate anyway.

563
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,040
Done? Anything else?

564
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,600
That’s all.

565
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,120
Don’t overthink. Go.

566
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,560
Tewit Kengkitsakun.

567
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,520
You’re the convicted killer
in the seven-body case in Phang Nga.

568
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,480
In 2015.

569
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,440
Can you tell me.

570
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,320
What happened that day?

571
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,600
Hey.

572
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,880
Officer asked you.

573
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,720
If you’re asked, answer.

574
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,800
Why?

575
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,440
What good will talking do?

576
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,840
Told cops a hundred times
I didn’t do it.

577
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,920
Still ended up in prison.

578
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,400
Cops don’t arrest people
for no reason.

579
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,240
There must’ve been evidence
strong enough.

580
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,440
That’s how you ended up here.

581
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,120
The documents say clearly
there was your DNA.

582
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,760
On the bodies.

583
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,120
You’re no different
from those cops.

584
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,840
Go.

585
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,520
You’re wasting my time.

586
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,960
I’m not like them.

587
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,480
Who rush to pin the blame
just to close cases.

588
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,640
You think I believe that?

589
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,800
Khun Tewit.

590
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,920
If you tell me everything
one more time.

591
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,520
I might find something
that could help your case.

592
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,840
Bangkok just had a
seven-body killing too.

593
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,240
Hanged on trees the same way
as your case.

594
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,040
The one you were accused of.

595
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,240
So what?

596
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,440
I’m already in prison.
What’s it got to do with me?

597
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,920
Because I know.

598
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,880
This case has nothing
to do with you.

599
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,160
And maybe the Phang Nga case
didn’t either.

600
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,680
If you want to reclaim
your justice.

601
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,880
Then help me with
what you know.

602
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,320
Until I can close this case.

603
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,720
And bring the real killer
to prison.

604
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,240
I can’t return your ten years.

605
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,560
But I can help you not spend
the rest of your life like this.

606
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,760
I know it hurts.

607
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,360
But if anything comes to you.

608
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,120
Tell me.

609
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,600
That day my father and I.

610
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,160
Didn’t go out to sea.

611
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,080
Storm warning.

612
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
(Phang Nga, 2015)

613
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,440
But late at night someone
called me.

614
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,920
Said my net drifted off the boat.

615
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,520
So I went to check.

616
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,920
Cut through the woods they
called the graveyard.

617
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,440
I saw lights.

618
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,120
So I crept in to see.

619
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,840
And…

620
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,640
What I saw next…

621
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,800
Was the scariest thing
in my life.

622
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,640
Cops arrested me.

623
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,160
Said I was the killer.

624
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,040
They said the evidence was…

625
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,320
A rope with my DNA.

626
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,080
But that was the only thing
pointing to me.

627
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,520
When was the last time you saw
the victim you knew?

628
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,760
Not sure, maybe…

629
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,040
The Sart Duean Sip merit day.

630
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,720
Few days before it happened.

631
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,920
And clay dolls or
Siakaban dolls.

632
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,160
Did you ever see them
at the scene?

633
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,200
No. Never saw them.

634
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,720
Excuse me.

635
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,360
Yes.

636
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,320
Where were you?

637
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,640
I… took the documents
to P'Sing.

638
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,360
Had to take them in person?

639
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,240
Don’t you usually email?

640
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,960
Well…

641
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,440
There were some case
details to explain.

642
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,120
And what’s this? What
are you doing?

643
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,160
The doll P'Sing found.

644
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,040
Hey.

645
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,760
There’s hair on it.

646
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,200
Yeah.

647
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,720
I’ll rush it to the lab.

648
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,000
Maybe the DNA matches
one of the victims.

649
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,080
P'Bew.

650
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,160
Yes.

651
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,640
Please run DNA on the hair
from this doll.

652
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,960
- Sure. Okay.
- Make it urgent, please.

653
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,240
Darin.

654
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,160
Sey.

655
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,040
What’s wrong? You okay?

656
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,640
Just now…

657
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,280
I thought I saw
something weird.

658
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,800
It’s nothing.

659
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,760
Your vision’s blurry.

660
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,880
Didn’t you sleep?

661
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,640
Sey, I’m scared.

662
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,240
There’s nothing, man.

663
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,920
Don’t overthink.

664
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,520
What’s going on with you?

665
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,120
Come here.

666
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,720
Here.

667
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,960
Hello, P'Singha?

668
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,040
Thup.

669
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,720
Tewit said

670
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,920
around the time it happened
ten years ago,

671
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,880
it was during Sart Duean Sip.

672
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,880
Some Southern ritual
or something.

673
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,600
You know anything about it?

674
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,600
It’s a Southern ancestor
honoring ceremony.

675
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,160
Held every wanraem 15
of the tenth month.

676
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,360
The moon stays dark
the whole month.

677
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,800
I can find that online myself.

678
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,160
You got anything more?

679
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,320
Hmm.

680
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,240
Grandmaster Monk once told me

681
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,320
about a ritual involving
the moon.

682
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,240
If it’s during wanraem,

683
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,520
and you perform a ritual,

684
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,800
the effect of the occult
gets much stronger.

685
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,360
Wanraem nights?

686
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,920
Here.

687
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,120
P'Singha, do you think

688
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,320
Tewit isn’t the killer?

689
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,760
I’m sure he’s not.

690
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,600
Otherwise how would it happen
every five years?

691
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,000
Makes no sense.

692
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,920
I’ll be back late tonight.

693
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,800
Need to gather more info.

694
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,720
Okay, P'Singha.

695
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,600
I told you I can stay
on my own.

696
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,120
You don’t have to worry.

697
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,440
You, though,

698
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,720
you’re still wearing the
Phirot Ring I gave you, right?

699
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,680
I am.

700
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,600
What are you afraid of?

701
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,120
Nothing. Really.

702
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,440
Just so I don’t have to worry
when P'Singha’s alone.

703
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,760
When you’re done, hurry home,
okay?

704
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,640
I cooked a lot for you.

705
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,200
Dry phalo stir-fry,

706
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,200
basil stir-fry, clear pork soup.

707
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,160
You made too much.

708
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
It’s just the two of us.

709
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,640
No need to feed the whole block.

710
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,920
It’s fine, P'.

711
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,920
I’ve got plenty of time anyway.

712
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,040
Anything I can do,
I’ll do it.

713
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,840
Okay.

714
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,520
I’ll finish up here

715
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,920
and head back to eat.

716
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,240
Okay. And just…

717
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,760
take care of yourself,
P'.

718
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,840
I worry about you.

719
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,640
I’ll wait at home.

720
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,080
Wait as long as you can.

721
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,480
If you’re sleepy, go to bed first.

722
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,800
Okay.

723
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,720
(Medical Examiner’s Staff Room)

724
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,240
It’s a clean-food recipe
from my shop.

725
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,040
Saw you’re on a late shift,
so I brought you some.

726
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,320
Here.

727
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,840
You run your own shop?

728
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,560
Impressive.

729
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,080
If you like it, I can make more
for you.

730
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,480
Sure.

731
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,320
This the guy from your story?

732
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,560
Uh…

733
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,880
Hi.

734
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,720
Yeah.

735
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,040
This is Bas.

736
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,160
The guy I met at the party.

737
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,440
And this is Darin.

738
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,040
My coworker.

739
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,320
Just a coworker?

740
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,200
Come on.

741
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,000
You already had dinner with me.

742
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,320
I can eat again.

743
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,160
Oh.

744
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,320
Old meals don’t fill you up, huh?

745
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,240
So you need something new.

746
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,040
What’s your problem?

747
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,400
Your ex just wanted to say hi.

748
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,760
Is that not allowed?

749
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,120
Just curious,

750
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,600
what your new boyfriend
is gonna be like.

751
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,600
Darin.

752
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,520
I should get going.

753
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,960
I’ll DM you later, Sey.

754
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,360
Okay.

755
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,840
Anyway…

756
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,960
thanks for the food.

757
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,320
Sure.

758
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,400
What’s wrong with you?

759
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,040
Why’d you do that?

760
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,920
What?

761
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,840
I just wanted to say hi
to your new guy.

762
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:15,400
That’s not “saying hi.”

763
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,160
That’s starting trouble.

764
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,120
Why?

765
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,600
Don’t want people to know

766
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,240
that I’m your ex?

767
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,080
What do you want?

768
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,480
Nothing.

769
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,760
I don’t want anything.

770
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,800
Then why’re you so mad at me?

771
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,240
Because what you did,

772
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,160
you’re acting like you own me.

773
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,880
When actually,

774
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,880
we’re nothing anymore.

775
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,520
Just…”sleeping buddies.”

776
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,080
That status,

777
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,280
doesn’t come with rights
to be jealous.

778
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,840
What you’re doing,

779
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,600
it’s not okay for us.

780
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,840
Get that straight.

781
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,800
(DNA test sample)
DNA test sample.

782
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,360
Shit.

783
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,640
Sey, pick up.

784
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,520
Come on, Sey. Pick up.

785
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,440
Sorry.

786
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,480
The number you’re calling
cannot be reached.

787
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,400
Sey, the DNA results are out.

788
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,600
I’m heading to P'Singha’s house.

789
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,920
Fuck it.

790
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,080
Hello?

791
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,760
Huh?

792
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,320
Hello?

793
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,840
You really wanna mess with me?

794
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,720
You really wanna mess with me?

795
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,640
Thanks a lot. See you tomorrow.

796
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,840
Yes, Inspector.

797
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,960
Hey, Lieutenant,

798
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,040
have a beer.

799
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,400
No thanks, Sergeant. Early shift.

800
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,400
Alright, alright.

801
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,920
- Hello.
- Hello, everyone.

802
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,680
- Hello, Inspector.
- See you.

803
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,040
- P'Singha,
- Hey.

804
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,600
Thup.

805
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,040
Thup.

806
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,680
Thup.

807
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,040
Thup.

808
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,600
Thup.

809
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,000
Thup.

810
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,840
Thup.

811
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,040
Do you know where he likes
to go pray?

812
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:36,240
There’s a talisman sheet
stuck here, P'.

813
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,320
Feels like this ghost doesn’t
want us to find the Tukkata Siakaban.

814
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,040
We need to keep digging here.

815
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,320
Santi Tham House.

816
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,720
Shouldn’t have left him alone.

817
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,840
You didn’t make him get hit
by a car, man.

818
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,920
Do you still feel anything
for Inspector King?

819
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,440
Being alone like this,

820
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,440
- it’s kinda nice.
- Who’s alone?

821
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,800
You’ve got me.

822
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,120
(It’s raining!)
Grab your stuff and take cover.

823
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,960
May we survive this scene safely.
(Calling on the spirits now.)

824
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,000
My prayer came true.
(The deity has blessed us.)

825
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,520
(Came here for encouragement?)

826
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,080
P'Singha.

827
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:17,920
(So happy, huh, Pel Pel)
He was protecting me.

828
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,160
I kinda wanna get arrested too,
but I’ve got no case.

829
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,280
(Just wants to get arrested)
We’re police.

830
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,240
My ex just wanted to say hi.
Is that not allowed?

831
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,240
Emotional explosion, everyone,
but nothing’s exploding.

832
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,520
’Cause he’s naturally a softie.

833
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,000
- What now?
- What?
