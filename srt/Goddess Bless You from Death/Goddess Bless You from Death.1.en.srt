Mom.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,680
What is it?

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,720
Blood.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,640
Please take care of my baby.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,920
Go now, hurry!

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,600
Venerable monk...

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Venerable monk.

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,200
Please take this boy under your care.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,480
Your life won’t be an easy one.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,200
You must endure.

15
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,760
Make it through whatever comes.

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,040
You’ll see things you wish you hadn’t.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,680
You’ll hear,

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,120
things you never wanted to hear.

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,360
From now on, your name is,

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,920
Thup.

21
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,160
(GODDESS BLESS YOU FROM DEATH)

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,400
(25 years later)

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,760
We’ve found code 241,
total of seven victims.

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,079
At the abandoned mall.

25
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,640
Requesting units 30
and 40 to inspect the scene.

26
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,400
Alright, enough.

27
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,880
- I got the call.
- I’ll check it out myself.

28
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,280
Yeah, go see who’s here.

29
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,880
Excuse me, sir.

30
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,640
This is a crime scene,
outsiders aren’t allowed in.

31
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,800
P’Tle, P’Tle.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,360
This is Inspector Singha
from Special Investigation.

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,640
He just got transferred back.

34
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,760
Good to see you, sir.

35
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,800
Hello.

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,640
First day and you’re already on duty, huh?

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,480
- Let’s go.
- This way, please.

38
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
Sing.

39
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,560
I’ve called forensics, they’re on their way.

40
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,360
- Open it up.
- Okay.

41
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,760
Bring Sey and Darin here.

42
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,920
Got it.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,480
Good morning.

44
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,560
Told you not to get close while working.

45
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,880
We’re coworkers.

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,160
How can I not?

47
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,160
And another thing,

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,040
I’m your boss, remember?

49
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,280
Damn you.

50
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
P’Kem.

51
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,160
You ever seen something like this before?

52
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,840
- Seven bodies?
- Yeah.

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,920
Never seen seven at once.

54
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,560
Rough first day for you, Inspector.

55
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,600
Sey.

56
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,080
I’m serious about this one.

57
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,080
Don’t touch anything unless you have to.

58
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,159
Why not?

59
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,360
Look around.

60
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,360
Everything here feels... off.

61
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
If something bad sticks to you, then what?

62
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,400
You’re talking nonsense.

63
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,920
Oh, Captain Mek! Hello.

64
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,960
Hello.

65
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,320
You’re handling this case yourself?

66
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,840
Not really.

67
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,840
The returning inspector’s in charge.

68
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,040
Showing up this late and keeping me
and forensics waiting,

69
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,240
That’s not right, is it?

70
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,640
Singha.

71
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,120
Yeah?

72
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,240
How’ve you been?

73
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,960
I’m good, sir.

74
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,800
Dr. Sey, Dr. Darin ,
you may begin the autopsy.

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,000
Sing.

76
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,440
Welcome back.

77
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,880
Yeah.

78
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,880
Glad we’re working together again.

79
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,600
It’s been two years already.

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
I actually missed this kind of pressure.

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,200
Two years and your mouth’s still the same.

82
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,240
Darin.

83
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,760
Sing.

84
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,480
Over here, please.

85
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,400
I’ll be right back.

86
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,560
Please look after my uncle for me.

87
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,040
Sure thing.

88
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,560
Sir.

89
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,800
Inspector Singha is in charge of this case.

90
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,680
Forensics and the medical team
are collecting evidence, sir.

91
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,080
Relax, no need for formalities.

92
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,560
I’m counting on you.

93
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,640
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,720
I’ve ordered the press to stay back.

95
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,960
And also...

96
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,960
the entire area’s been sealed off.

97
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,400
I want this handled...

98
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,920
as quietly as possible.

99
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,200
Most importantly,

100
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,560
close this case as fast as you can.

101
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,240
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,360
Yes, sir. Female, middle-aged.

103
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,280
Average build, fair yellowish skin.

104
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,320
Facial area shows stitched wounds.

105
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,960
A rope was found around the neck.

106
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,760
It circles twice, forming two loops.

107
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,600
Tied with a non-sliding knot.

108
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,240
Behind the right ear area.

109
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,720
Come here.

110
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,240
I know you’re waiting for the lab results
and the full report.

111
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,000
But can you give me a rough estimate?

112
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,760
From the smell, sir,

113
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,760
this body’s been dead no more than two days.

114
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,480
But the others,

115
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,360
some have been dead for at least five days.

116
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,000
Each victim,

117
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,320
has been dead for more than 24 hours.

118
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
And they didn’t all die the same way.

119
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,280
So they might not have died
at the same time.

120
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,320
Is that right?

121
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,480
Yes, sir.

122
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
No signs of struggle found.

123
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,800
The murder and assault,

124
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,920
most likely didn’t happen here.

125
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,840
All victims were probably killed elsewhere.

126
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,240
Then dragged here and hung afterward.

127
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,840
The killer probably
dragged all seven bodies in.

128
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,920
Then hoisted them up one by one.

129
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,000
But as for the details,

130
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,240
I’ll confirm everything again in the lab.

131
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,480
Why go through all that trouble?

132
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,320
Sewing, hanging...

133
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,000
This isn’t something ordinary.

134
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,799
I think...

135
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,039
it’s definitely connected
to the supernatural.

136
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,680
Or maybe...

137
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,840
- ghosts.
- Darin.

138
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
You’re talking nonsense.

139
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,960
What kind of ghost kills people,

140
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,520
stitches their eyes and mouths shut,

141
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,680
then hangs them up?

142
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,400
The killer’s human, for sure.

143
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,280
Still, Sing, this case,

144
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,240
it really feels strange.

145
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,280
I felt it the moment I walked in.

146
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
And after seeing the bodies,

147
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,360
I got chills all over.

148
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,440
In all my years as a cop,
I’ve never seen anything like this.

149
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
If it’s not some deranged psycho,

150
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,280
then maybe Dr. Darin’s right.

151
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,080
You too, Mek?

152
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,320
Stop!

153
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,080
Stop!

154
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,280
Police!

155
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,520
I said stop!

156
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,000
(Chanting softly)
Phut-thang kancha, Tham-mang kancha,

157
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,200
Sangkhang kancha, nara nacha,

158
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,440
Phuttha khun-nang, Thamma khun-nang,

159
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,880
Sankha khun-nang.

160
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,040
Phut-thang kancha,
Tham-mang kancha, Sangkhang kancha,

161
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,080
Nara nacha.

162
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,920
Phuttha khun-nang,
Thamma khun-nang, Sankha khun-nang.

163
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,200
Hey!

164
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,920
Who the hell are you?

165
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,480
What are you doing here?

166
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,080
They’re all gone, aren’t they?

167
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,800
What’s gone? Speak clearly.

168
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,760
Want me to get you drug tested first?

169
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,240
You high or something?

170
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,080
Cooperate with me, will you?

171
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,000
What were you doing?

172
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,280
You’re covered in blood.

173
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,320
How long have you been here?

174
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,280
Are you messing with me?

175
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,160
Come here. Come.

176
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,600
Move.

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,520
- What’s up, Sing?
- Mek.

178
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,560
Have forensics sweep
the entire building for clues.

179
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,840
And take this guy in for questioning.

180
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,120
But I don’t know anything, officer!

181
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,080
Why are you taking me in?

182
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,680
You’re the only one found at the scene.

183
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,160
You’re covered in blood.

184
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,640
You ran from the police
and dodged every question.

185
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,440
Who else am I supposed
to suspect if not you?

186
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,080
You are a suspect in a murder case.

187
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,200
You have the right to remain silent or speak.

188
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,080
Anything you say
may be used as evidence in court.

189
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,200
But I swear, officer,

190
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,480
I had nothing to do
with those hanging bodies!

191
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,520
I didn’t do it, I swear!

192
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,400
Facts,

193
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,960
are what will prove everything.

194
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,200
Take him away.

195
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,040
I didn’t do it.

196
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,320
If you didn’t,

197
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,600
then who did?

198
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,800
Ghosts.

199
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,200
Ghosts did it.

200
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,920
You’re saying ghosts did all this?

201
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,480
Yes.

202
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,800
I really saw a ghost!
What else do you want me to say?

203
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,200
If you’re really innocent,

204
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,480
then cooperate with the investigation.

205
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,360
Soon we’ll find out,

206
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,160
whether you’re a witness,

207
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,000
or the killer.

208
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,720
Mek.

209
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,680
Get forensics to collect his DNA.

210
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,880
Got it, sir.

211
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,280
Where are you taking me?

212
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,640
Come on. Why are you arresting me?

213
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,680
Sit down.

214
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,520
Stay here for now.

215
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,440
Until the blood test results come back.

216
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,080
- Uh, officer,
- Hey, hey.

217
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,160
Is there another cell available?

218
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,400
Sit down.

219
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,680
Sit.

220
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,840
Anywhere but this room, please.

221
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,920
Please.

222
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,680
You think this is
a five-star hotel? Sit down.

223
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,480
Unlock it.

224
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,280
Alright, give me your hand.

225
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,760
Don’t cause any trouble.

226
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,160
Sing, leaving him like
that isn’t a good idea.

227
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,960
Honestly, he doesn’t look
like a criminal at all.

228
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,360
He might just be unstable or maybe,

229
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,800
You’re saying he actually saw a ghost?

230
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,600
Are you crazy?

Officer, please help me!

236
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,280
Officer!

237
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,000
There’s a ghost inside!

238
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,800
Get me out of here!

239
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,640
Officer!

240
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,160
Get out,  what’s wrong with you?

241
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,960
Please, I’m begging you,
get me out of here.

242
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,560
Anywhere else is fine.

243
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,200
There’s a ghost in here!

244
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,520
- Mek.
- Yes, sir.

245
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,640
Take him away.

246
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
Please, officer, put me somewhere else!

247
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,920
If you can’t wait quietly
for the lab results,

248
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,040
then go in for questioning.

249
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,040
- Bring him in.
- Move.

250
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
This video will be used as evidence.

251
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,960
for the suspect’s investigation record.

252
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,280
Thamawat Santasakol.

253
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,160
Age 25, from Sisaket.

254
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,000
How long have you been in Bangkok?

255
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,360
Where’s your family?

256
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,280
Uh...

257
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,240
It’s kind of a long story.

258
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,760
You think I’m asking for fun?

259
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,720
Answer me.

260
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,680
I grew up in a temple.

261
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,560
I’ve lived with a monk since I was a kid.

262
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,040
After he passed away,

263
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,840
I moved to Bangkok.

264
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,560
To work and support myself.

265
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,720
What kind of work?

266
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,640
I’m a freelance illustrator.

267
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,280
Then what were you doing in the mall?

268
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,360
Illustrators don’t just wander
into abandoned malls at night.

269
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,200
Not to draw something, that’s for sure.

270
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,880
If I tell you,

271
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,360
you’ll just think I’m crazy again.

272
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,480
But I’m telling the truth.

273
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,640
Deciding what’s true,

274
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,240
that’s my job.

275
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,320
You just give me the facts.

276
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,000
So what were you doing
at the abandoned mall?

277
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,800
A few nights ago,

278
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,360
I had a dream...

279
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,600
that something terrible
would happen there.

280
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,280
It felt so real.

281
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,080
You’re saying a ghost sent you that dream?

282
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,400
But...

283
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,560
the dream I saw,

284
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,120
it felt like I’d seen it before.

285
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,880
So I took a taxi and went there.

286
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,000
And then?

287
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,000
After I got there,

288
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,800
I walked inside.

289
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,800
And I saw a tree, just like in my dream.

290
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,400
And seven bodies hanging from it.

291
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,680
If you really saw the bodies,

292
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,280
and you were that scared,

293
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,280
why didn’t you leave?

294
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,960
Just seeing them hanging there,

295
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,680
I completely lost it.

296
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,480
And then there was...

297
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,280
uh...

298
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,200
wandering spirits.

299
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,240
(Chanting)
Phut-thang kancha, Tham-mang kancha...

300
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
That’s when I ran into you, Inspector.

301
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,400
Right now,

302
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,640
you’re a suspect in a mass murder case.

303
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,680
If you keep talking nonsense like this,

304
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,800
there’s no way you’ll get out of it.

305
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,920
But I swear, officer, I didn’t do it!

306
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,400
How can you accuse me of that?

307
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,240
Without solid evidence,

308
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,000
I can’t release you.

309
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
Take him back to his cell.

310
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,680
I’m not going back in that room!

311
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,680
Sir, please, I’m not going back in there!

312
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,800
You,

313
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
so damn fussy.

314
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Someone hanged themselves
in that room, right?

315
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,040
Whoever stays in there,

316
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,360
ends up hanging themselves too.

317
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,000
I don’t want to be next.

318
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,040
That room,

319
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,880
someone really did hang themselves there.

320
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,080
And every suspect kept in it,

321
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,240
ended up hanging themselves too.

Stay in here for now.

326
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,920
Don’t cause any trouble, got it?

327
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,280
Yes, sir.

328
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,240
I promise I’ll stay quiet.

329
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,440
I won’t go anywhere until
the blood results are back.

330
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,560
The only reason I put you here,

331
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,680
is so you don’t bother anyone else.

332
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,560
Yes, sir. And…

333
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
what happens next?

334
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,240
You can only hold me for 48 hours, right?

335
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,920
So you know the law too, huh?

336
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,680
Why?

337
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,360
Planning to run?

338
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,920
Why would I run, sir?

339
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,280
I didn’t do anything wrong.

340
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,800
You’re not,

341
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,360
the kind of cop who arrests
innocent people, right?

342
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,960
Once the lab results are out, we’ll know,

343
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,800
if your DNA’s on the bodies or not.

Inspector Singha.

345
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,200
Commander Yuth is asking for you, urgent.

346
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,080
Okay.

347
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,600
The suspect apprehended at the scene,

348
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,320
the report says,

349
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,200
there was only one suspect, right?

350
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,920
Yes, sir.

351
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,000
I’ve already questioned him, sir.

352
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,080
Most likely just a local from the area.

353
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
We might have to keep him
as a witness for now.

354
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,360
Listen.

355
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,680
We can’t overlook something like that.

356
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,280
He could be the real killer.

357
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,080
I understand, sir.

358
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,960
I’m still questioning him.

359
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,520
But we can’t jump to
conclusions without evidence.

360
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,600
Look,

361
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,200
The higher-ups are pressing us now.

362
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,800
They want this case
cleared as soon as possible.

363
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,880
You know,

364
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,480
who owns the land at
that construction site, right?

365
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,200
And what they plan to build there.

366
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,520
Yes, I’m aware.

367
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,200
Good.

368
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,080
So if you’re going to investigate
or make an arrest,

369
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,120
do it as fast as you can.

370
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,280
Because right now,

371
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,280
I’ve already signed the order
for a special task force.

372
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,800
You’ll be leading that team.

373
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,840
Yes, sir.

374
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,880
I’ll find the real killer
as quickly as possible.

375
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,920
But I think you already know,

376
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,360
If you can’t close this case quickly,

377
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,080
you might end up being transferred back.

378
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,200
Understood, sir.

379
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,960
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,520
Hello?

381
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,840
Sing.

382
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,320
Darin and I just finished the autopsies.

383
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,520
But the DNA results aren’t in yet.

384
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,640
You coming here yourself or,

385
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,440
Yeah, I’ll head over.

386
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,320
Both eyes show stitching marks.

387
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,440
Same for the mouth.

388
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,800
Rope marks found around the neck.

389
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,840
Another long, consistent wound was found,

390
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,840
with a diameter of about 0.5 millimeters.

391
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,280
The entire body was covered in bruises.

392
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,000
Estimated time of death: one to two days.

393
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,600
The stitching on the mouth
and eyes was postmortem.

394
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,400
The stitches were messy and uneven.

395
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,680
But there were no signs of struggle.

396
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,520
What’s stranger is,

397
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,480
we detected GHB.

398
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,280
Commonly known as
a date-rape drug, in every victim.

399
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,800
This drug,

400
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,840
suppresses brain function.

401
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,800
It suppresses respiration,
causing loss of consciousness.

402
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,000
So the drug was used on every victim.

403
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,200
And aside from that,

404
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,800
is there any connection
between the seven victims?

405
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,720
No physical similarities whatsoever.

406
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,120
Different genders, different ages.

407
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,160
But this one,  is a transgender victim.

408
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,680
What about time of death?

409
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,120
We can’t determine the exact time yet.

410
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,720
But what we do know,

411
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,600
is that every body,

412
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,560
died at different times.

413
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,480
All seven were murdered using wire,

414
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,480
and thin rope.

415
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,480
After that, their eyes were sewn shut,

416
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,840
and their mouths too.

417
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,200
Then their bodies were hanged from the tree.

418
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,400
The killer must’ve been very strong,

419
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,960
to do all that alone.

420
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,800
At this point, I’m not even sure,

421
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
how many killers we’re dealing with.

422
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,560
And the blood-stained shirt,

423
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,440
from the suspect at the scene?

424
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,440
The DNA doesn’t match any of the victims.

425
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,240
It’s his own blood.

426
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,440
Wake up.

427
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,160
Comfortable, huh?

428
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,200
Wake up.

429
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,120
Oh, you’re back already?

430
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,680
Put your arm on the table.

431
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,600
Or do you want that wound infected?

432
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,600
Give me your hand.

433
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,480
Your hand.

434
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,600
You got a nickname?

435
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,840
Thup, sir.

436
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,400
Thup.

437
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,880
Fits a temple kid just right.

438
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,480
So, you always talk about ghosts like this?

439
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,000
I don’t like talking about them.

440
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,200
I actually hate ghosts.

441
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,240
But when I say that,
you’ll just scold me again.

442
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,520
So tell me,

443
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,280
you think you’ve seen ghosts since birth?

444
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Didn’t you say you don’t believe in ghosts?

445
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,280
What if I did?

446
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,880
When did you start seeing them?

447
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,840
Since as far back as I can remember.

448
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,320
When I was living with Luang Pu,

449
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,720
I couldn’t see any ghosts.

450
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,080
I only started seeing them
after he passed away.

451
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,000
Why don’t you wear an amulet?

452
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,480
Do you worship anything?

453
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,400
People scared of ghosts usually do, right?

454
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,400
It doesn’t help anymore.

455
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,280
Not since my master passed.

456
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,160
I’ve lost all hope since then.

457
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,440
Could you stop acting so pathetic?

458
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,880
Ow.

459
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,280
Why’re you tensing up?

460
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,280
I’m just putting on ointment.

461
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,120
I’m not tense.

462
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,120
I’m cold.

463
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,120
Sir.

464
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,200
Sing.

465
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,040
Black coffee, no sugar as usual.

466
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,720
Ah, thanks.

467
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,760
It’s your first day back at work,

468
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,200
and you already got a big case.

469
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,640
You’re not thinking of quitting,

470
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,880
and transferring back to Prachin, right?

471
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
I never quit. Not my style.

472
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,280
Good thing you’re still here, though.

473
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,480
Would’ve been tough without you.

474
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,400
I’m glad you’re back too, sir.

475
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,320
Working with you always
gets my adrenaline up.

476
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,480
Still as cheeky as ever, huh?

477
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
Just a little, sir.

478
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,600
Hey, Sing.

479
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,800
That taxi driver sounded just like Thup.

480
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,440
His statement and the DNA results match.

481
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,200
So that kid, Thup,

482
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,040
is just a witness in this case.

483
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,360
Yeah.

484
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,440
But right now,

485
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,040
where the hell do we start finding clues?

486
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,720
Or maybe it’s a ghost.

487
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,680
Like Thup said, right?

488
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,120
You want me to write in the report

489
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,400
that everything happened
because of a ghost?

490
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,600
Yes, sir.

491
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,120
Sir, it’s loud in your office!

492
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,040
That kid Thup’s freaking out again!

493
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,600
You’d better come quick!

494
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,120
Okay.

495
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,920
Buddhang ganja, Dhammang ganja,
Sanghang ganja...

496
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,080
Narara nacha, Buddha khunnang,
Dhamma khunnang, Sangha khunnang...

497
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,720
Please don’t come closer, I’m scared!

498
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,200
Don’t hurt me!

499
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,240
Get out!

500
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,120
Go!

501
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Thup.

502
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,040
Thup, it’s me.

503
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,080
Sir...

504
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,600
The ghost’s about to break my neck!

505
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,320
If you don’t let go of me,

506
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,000
I’ll be the one to break your neck!

507
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,360
You’re pretty strong this time.

508
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,679
- Why’re you yelling?
- The ghost tricked me!

509
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,920
I’m serious, sir!

510
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,719
It’s right there by the window!

511
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,360
You’re saying all this was the ghost’s doing?

512
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,280
Stop making up stories.

513
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,239
And stay quiet.

514
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,199
Or I’ll cuff you again, got it?

515
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,280
Sir, I think...

516
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,840
I can’t stay in this room anymore.

517
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,120
What now?

518
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,480
You won’t stay in that room,

519
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,159
and you can’t stay in mine either.

520
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,719
So what do you want exactly?

521
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,760
Maybe it’s...

522
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,719
not about the place.

523
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,280
It’s more about me.

524
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,920
Then...

525
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,200
can I stay with you, sir?

526
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,280
Please, I'm begging you.

527
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,320
Please.

528
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,760
When I'm with you, sir

529
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,360
the ghost disappears.

530
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,120
You’re my talisman, like my master.

531
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,760
Can I stay with you too, sir?

532
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,280
Me? A holy thing?

533
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,760
I'm human.

534
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,840
I don't know.

535
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,160
But I think ghosts must fear you.

536
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,120
Legally speaking,

537
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,240
I'm still presumed innocent.

538
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,680
The police have no evidence against me.

539
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,640
You're a cop,

540
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,200
so protect the innocent.

541
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,880
Sing.

542
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,600
He's right about that, Sing.

543
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,480
Also, the DNA test confirmed

544
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,280
it doesn't match any body.

545
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,000
I'm warning you.

546
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,080
If you're coming with me,

547
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,480
don't be a nuisance.

548
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,760
Don't cause trouble.

549
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,000
And most importantly,

550
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,640
don't even think of running.

551
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,920
Got it?

552
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,800
Yes, of course, sir.

553
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,960
Helmet on.

554
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,720
Come here.

555
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,680
Get on.

556
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,240
Or do you want me to carry you?

557
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,640
Uh, no need, sir.

558
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,280
Hold on to me.

559
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,280
Hold tight.

560
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,160
If you fall off,

561
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,640
I’m not taking responsibility.

562
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,680
You sleep downstairs.

563
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,600
There’s only one bed upstairs.

564
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,800
You can take the sofa, right?

565
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,680
If you let me sleep on the floor,

566
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,680
I’d still be fine at this point.

567
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,280
You and that mouth of yours.

568
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,960
Give me that.

569
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,280
Wait here. I’ll be back.

570
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,280
Lights are broken.
Deal with it for now.

571
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,000
Go shower and change.

572
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,400
You look like

573
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,080
a stray dog.

574
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,200
Thanks for taking me in, even temporarily.

575
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,720
This isn’t a shelter, kid.

576
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,200
Thank you, sir.

577
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,560
Call me Singha.

578
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,560
Huh?

579
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,480
From now on, call me Singha.

580
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,600
Hearing “sir” outside the station’s annoying.

581
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,600
Alright.

582
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,680
P’Singha.

583
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,840
Bathroom’s over there.

584
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,920
No wonder.

585
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,760
When I’m near P’Singha, the ghost vanishes.

586
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,920
It’s because of you.

587
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,240
Please protect me too, sir.

588
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,080
Thup.

589
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,120
- Whoa,
- Thup!

590
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,840
What the hell are you doing?

591
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,120
Uh, I’m sorry, sir,

592
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,400
I mean, P’Singha!

593
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,600
I didn’t mean to.

594
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,600
You blew the power?

595
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,640
I just...

596
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,120
plugged in the fish tank and it shorted.

597
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,800
Now the whole house went dark.

598
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,480
I told you not to cause trouble!

599
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,080
I’m sorry!

600
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,600
But please don’t yell at me yet.

601
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,200
Shouldn’t you put some clothes on first?

602
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,880
Mind your own business.

603
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,040
I’m not cold.
I could stay shirtless all day.

604
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,680
But I’m cold just looking at you.

605
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,560
I told you to take a shower.

606
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,680
So do it.

607
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,800
It’s annoying when you don’t listen.

608
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,120
And one more thing,

609
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,520
I didn’t ask you to renovate my house.

610
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,480
I just don’t want to be a burden.

611
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,400
Can I at least help with chores?

612
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,880
So you won’t kick me out.

613
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,960
No need.

614
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,800
That kind of work,

615
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,680
I save it for my wife.

616
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,120
Your wife?

617
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,600
And lastly,

618
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,760
Stop causing trouble.

619
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,600
Go to sleep.

620
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,800
P’Singha.

621
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,800
If I see something, can I go upstairs to you?

622
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
Don’t even think

623
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,720
about bothering me.

624
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,600
Wow...

625
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,280
Thup.

626
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,320
Thup.

627
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,040
You sleep like the dead, huh?

628
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,680
Who told you to act like it’s your own house?

629
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,320
Thup.

630
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,120
Thup, wake up.

631
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,600
Thup.

632
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,280
Oh.

633
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,200
Good morning, P’Singha.

634
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,120
Get dressed already.

635
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,400
You sleep all over the place.

636
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,360
Here, get dressed.

637
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,800
Wear mine for now.

638
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,680
I was planning to wake up early
and make you breakfast.

639
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,080
But I kinda overslept.

640
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,800
Don’t bother.

641
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,240
I might end up poisoned
and hanging from a tree.

642
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,280
Honestly,

643
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,320
I seem way more likable than you are.

644
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,440
Cut the whining already.

645
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,880
After you, P’Singha.

646
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,880
P’Singha, wait here for a sec, okay?

647
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,400
Don’t go anywhere.

648
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,800
I’ll just grab my clothes real quick.

649
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,080
What are you, three?

650
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,160
You that scared I’ll leave you?

651
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,320
Just a second.

652
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,680
Yeah.

653
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,240
Let’s go.

654
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,400
How long are you planning
to stay at my place?

655
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,560
It’s temporary, not permanent.

656
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,840
Better extra than not enough, right?

657
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,720
Hurry up, we’ve got a lot of stops to make.

658
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,680
Aren’t we going back to your house?

659
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,040
We are.

660
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,600
But we need to stop somewhere first.

661
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,680
Why are we here?

662
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,720
We’re reconstructing the scene.

663
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,200
Show me how it happened.

664
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,920
What exactly went down yesterday.

665
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,240
Thup.

666
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,160
I’m trying to help you here.

667
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:31,280
Even if there’s no victim DNA on you,

668
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,680
you’re still the only one who was here.

669
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,960
You can’t fully clear yourself as a suspect.

670
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,680
So what do I have to do,

671
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,320
to finally be free from this?

672
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,720
If you don’t wanna be
the scapegoat, start talking.

673
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,240
Alright then.

674
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,960
But P’Singha, you have to let me hold you.

675
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,120
What?

676
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,000
Hold you?

677
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,320
Because ghosts are scared of you.

678
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:29,040
I can show you what happened.

679
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,000
But let me hold onto you for a bit.

680
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,800
Ghosts fear me, huh?

681
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,520
Alright.

682
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,080
Do whatever you need to do.

683
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,600
Uh...

684
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,320
I walked in from that direction.

685
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,160
Then I came across this tree.

686
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,080
It looked exactly like in my dream.

687
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,360
There were...

688
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,280
incense sticks, candles,
and trays scattered everywhere.

689
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,480
When I looked up,

690
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,560
I saw seven bodies
hanging right here, P’Singha.

691
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,000
Then...

692
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,120
after that...

693
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,080
What is it?

694
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,880
There’s...

695
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,080
Thup, I don’t have all day.

696
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,800
P’Singha...

697
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,920
I think this place used to be a cemetery.

698
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,080
A cemetery?

699
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,240
What cemetery are you talking about?

700
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,280
Yesterday...

701
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,160
When I first met you here,

702
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,800
I...

703
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,760
I saw so many wandering spirits around.

704
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,080
And what does that have to do with anything?

705
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:20,440
This place is overflowing
with spiritual energy.

706
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,080
I’m afraid that

707
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,960
the bodies dumped here...

708
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,000
were part of a ritual sacrifice.

709
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,680
A sacrifice to feed spirits.

710
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,280
To gain even more power.

711
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:43,120
Usually, the people who do this

712
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,480
practice dark magic or witchcraft.

713
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,320
They make deals with ghosts,

714
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,400
so the ghosts do what they want.

715
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,600
Wait,

716
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,960
Make deals with ghosts?

717
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,040
You’re saying they sacrifice bodies

718
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,720
to command the spirits?

719
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,280
Yes, sir.

720
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,000
Okay.

721
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,880
What is it?

722
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,960
Sing,

723
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,800
Get back to the station now.
Something big’s happened.

724
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,600
Alright.

725
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:27,800
Yes, sir.

726
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,680
What I’d like to say is that the police

727
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,400
are doing everything we can on this case.

728
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,720
We’d like everyone to trust

729
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,200
that this case isn’t anything special,

730
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,600
nothing strange,

731
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,600
unlike what the news has been spinning.

732
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,120
Then to keep the reports consistent,

733
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,400
who’s leading this case, sir?

734
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,000
Since this is a major investigation,

735
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,400
the person overseeing it

736
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,280
has to be the best in our unit.

737
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,920
Who’s that?

738
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,680
- Oh...
- Inspector King.

739
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,120
Why Inspector King?

740
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,960
Therefore, I’ve appointed Inspector King,

741
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,800
Lieutenant Colonel Wachira Kongthampipat,

742
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,720
as the lead investigator
for this special case.

743
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,320
So that means Inspector King
will handle the whole case?

744
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,640
- Yes, of course.
- That’s right.

745
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,320
Have you found any new evidence?

746
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,560
Yes, any leads?

747
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,000
Or do you have any direction
for the investigation, Inspector?

748
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,160
Anything new to share?

749
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,000
Close this case as fast as possible.

750
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,720
That’s why headquarters sent
Inspector King to assist.

751
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,840
Our unit can handle this ourselves.

752
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,160
So what connects these seven victims?

753
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,840
There’s no connection at all.

754
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,760
Then what’s the motive behind it?

755
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,160
This looks like a black magic case to me.

756
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,400
It’s called a serial murder case, genius.

757
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,760
Help!

758
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,120
Five years ago in Sisaket,

759
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,640
ten years ago in Phang Nga,

760
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,840
five years ago in Chiang Mai,

761
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,960
and now Bangkok.

762
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,160
The reason I let him stay here

763
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,960
is for his own safety.

764
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,680
(This is real, no stunt doubles.)
No stand-ins here, folks.

765
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,480
(*All characters seen are dummies.)
The setup’s seriously massive.

766
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,640
- What the heck is this?
- Work.

767
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,880
Cut.
(Just watching makes me tired.)

768
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,680
Walkie one to walkie two,
come see the lovebirds.

769
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,680
Who are you? What are you doing here?

770
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,160
(What are you up to, Singha?)

771
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,480
- Done already?
- Done.

772
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,920
They’re gone.
(Otto hasn’t even filmed yet!)
