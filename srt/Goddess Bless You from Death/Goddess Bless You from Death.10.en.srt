1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,840
(Previously)
Why come here.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,800
I know the truth now
about what the killer wants.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,920
Besides offering sacrifices to ghosts,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,320
that ritual also forces the ghost
to do what it wants.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,000
You must’ve messed with something bad.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,440
Worst case, it’s not just us in danger.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,800
Anyone close to us could be dragged in too.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,440
Anuphap Bunprim.
I want to know where his parents are.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,320
There was a nurse with that last name.
Her friends called her Chaba.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
The ghost Auntie saw,

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,840
was its mouth split wide like this?

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,120
This one?

13
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,000
You.

14
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,080
You’re coming with me.

15
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,960
Thup.

16
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,800
Run.

17
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,200
Thup, run.

18
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,079
Run.

19
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,000
Run.

20
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
Don’t stick your nose in my business.

21
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,800
What happened?

22
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,120
The same ghost.
It attacked me and Auntie Srijan.

23
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,840
But something saved me.

24
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,200
(Goddess Bless You From Death)

25
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,280
What you’re rushing for is,

26
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,600
going to see Thup, right?

27
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,200
If it’s nothing urgent, talk tomorrow.

28
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,400
I’ve got something important, Singha.

29
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,800
I need a word.

30
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,600
Just you and me.

31
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,320
Thup.

32
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,800
Wait in the room first.

33
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,000
I’ll follow.

34
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,120
I think we should head back to Bangkok.

35
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,280
You should question Ta Khuean yourself.

36
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,600
You deserve the credit in this case.

37
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,000
Your dad won’t let me cut in front of you.

38
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,520
I’m serious.

39
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,320
Because last time, I couldn’t protect you.

40
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,680
But this time,

41
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,000
I’ll do everything to protect you.

42
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,760
What the hell are you talking about?

43
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,120
Making my dad happy matters too.

44
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,000
But do you know,

45
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,520
there’s one thing
that’s never changed for me?

46
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,320
It’s you.

47
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,520
Do you remember?

48
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,120
What’s this?

49
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,480
Happy birthday.

50
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,520
Come here. Let me put it on you.

51
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,640
From now on,
I’ll wear the watch you gave me.

52
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,120
To prove I’ll protect you.

53
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,120
Why the hell would you wear this damn watch?

54
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,200
I told you to throw it away a long time ago.

55
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,680
How could I throw it away?

56
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,920
When this watch,

57
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,320
is our promise to protect each other.

58
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,720
Protect what, damn it?

59
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,440
If I hadn’t agreed to your transfer back then,

60
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,160
my dad would’ve framed you and kicked you out.

61
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,680
I didn’t want you to lose what you loved.

62
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,600
I thought back then,

63
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,200
that choosing this would make
everything go back to normal.

64
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,920
But it was the worst decision of my life.

65
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Don’t waste time talking about the past.

66
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,000
It’s already over.

67
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,800
Our memories,

68
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,960
you can just throw them away like that?

69
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,320
The memories between you and me,

70
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,800
they never disappeared.

71
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,320
But the scars,

72
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,200
the ones you left on me,

73
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,520
they never disappeared either.

74
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
But I love you.

75
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,280
King.

76
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,200
Listen to me.

77
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,520
If back then you’d told me
what your dad was going to do,

78
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,880
we could’ve fought it together.

79
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,720
There were so damn many ways.

80
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,040
But you chose that one.

81
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,640
But now,

82
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,920
I’ve moved on.

83
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,120
I don’t care what you think.

84
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,320
You and me,

85
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,320
we can only be friends.

86
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,280
Fine.

87
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,040
I’ll be your friend.

88
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,080
That’s better than being nothing
in your life.

89
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,520
Aren’t you going to ask me,

90
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,120
what we talked about just now?

91
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,200
I won’t ask.

92
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,320
I trust you.

93
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,520
But your face doesn’t say that.

94
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,480
It’s okay.

95
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,200
You came back to me now.

96
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,280
That means you chose me.

97
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
That’s enough.

98
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,600
From now on, you don’t have to worry.

99
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,280
I’ve handled everything.

100
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,200
Run.

101
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,720
Run.

102
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,680
(Chanting)

103
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,480
(Chanting)

104
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,120
The deceased in the morgue.

105
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,200
What is this, officer?

106
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,680
I already told you everything I know.

107
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,480
I want to know about the time
you were a police officer,

108
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,400
when you were in Sisaket.

109
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,360
I don’t remember.

110
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,640
You didn’t resign from service.

111
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,280
You fled because you killed your wife,
didn’t you?

112
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,440
Twenty-five years ago,

113
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,400
how exactly did your wife die?

114
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,400
Uncle,

115
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,840
Even if there’s no evidence
of what happened to your wife,

116
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,680
you ran from duty like this,

117
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,960
it’s like you’re guilty
of killing your own wife.

118
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,400
She died on her own.

119
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,000
Listen, uncle,

120
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,320
intent to kill your wife
gets you life in prison.

121
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,320
She caught you cheating
with a nurse, right?

122
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,760
I wasn’t cheating.

123
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,600
It was all a misunderstanding.

124
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,400
You wouldn’t listen.

125
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
One day, I just lost my temper.

126
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,840
I hit her a bit too hard.

127
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,880
I didn’t think she’d die.

128
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,320
And the officer named Atikun who died,

129
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,160
what do you know about him?

130
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,680
Atikun?

131
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
What?

132
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
What’s wrong?

133
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,720
Who said he’s dead?

134
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,320
That seven-bodies-on-the-tree case,

135
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,560
based on forensic evidence

136
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,160
and the police investigation,

137
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,800
the killer had to murder one per day.

138
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,200
Seven days, right?

139
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,600
Why?

140
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,000
I find it strange.

141
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,720
By the time it reaches day seven,

142
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,200
the condition of the first body,

143
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,720
it’d be too wrecked to hang, right?

144
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,080
If the killer really needs seven victims

145
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,880
to perform that sacrificial ritual,

146
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,000
then they must have a way to keep them,

147
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,800
or,

148
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,800
a cold room to preserve the bodies.

149
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,400
- Right?
- Uh… a cold room.

150
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,880
Or it could be,

151
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,920
A big fresh-food container.

152
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,600
You, Darin.

153
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,400
You okay?

154
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Okay.

155
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,120
You sure?

156
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,080
Thank you.

157
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,000
Let’s go, Thup.

158
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,480
I’ll head back to Bangkok first.

159
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,600
Catch up soon.

160
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,080
Get home safe.

161
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Come here.

162
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,560
What is it?

163
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,400
I know you’re in a rush, P’Singha.

164
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,319
But remember I said before heading back,

165
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,319
I had something I needed to ask Uncle Chai.

166
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
You sure?

167
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,079
You don’t need me to go down with you?

168
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,880
It’s okay.

169
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,520
I need to handle this myself.

170
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,080
Thought you already left for Bangkok.

171
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,640
I was going to.

172
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,000
But I had a question I needed to ask first.

173
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,400
Who exactly is this ghost?

174
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,680
Do you recognize them?

175
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,520
I don’t know them.

176
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,200
Thup, just go back to Bangkok.

177
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,280
Your life’s good now.

178
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,360
Why dig up the past?

179
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
But I need to know.

180
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,480
No matter how much I try to run,

181
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,800
I can’t escape these ghosts.

182
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,920
The only way is to find the truth.

183
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,120
I told you I don’t know. Go. Leave.

184
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,520
He must’ve been one of the victims.

185
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,280
The red thread sewn on
the mouth and eyes, it’s the same.

186
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,200
You stayed with the Grandmaster Monk
for a long time.

187
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,520
He must’ve told you something.

188
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,920
The other ghosts only hurt me,

189
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,160
they attacked Auntie Srijan,

190
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
they hurt the people close to me.

191
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,400
But this ghost keeps protecting me.

192
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,600
Who is she, really?

193
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,600
You must’ve messed with something bad.

194
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,400
That’s why a ghost won’t leave you alone.

195
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,600
Worst case, it’s not just you in danger,

196
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,240
but the people you love,

197
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,320
and those close to you.

198
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,920
will get dragged in too.

199
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,280
Drink it.

200
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,200
It’s okay.

201
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,880
The ritual can’t continue.

202
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Let’s go back.

203
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,320
What’s wrong with you?

204
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,880
Acting all mysterious.

205
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,000
You’re scared of ghosts,

206
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,200
yet you still dare come to a ritual like this.

207
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,720
Cold?

208
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,680
Are you worried I’m cold,
or are you about to scold me?

209
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,960
Pick one. I can’t prepare my emotions.

210
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,680
This place might be linked
to the seven-body case.

211
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,680
And you still dare come here?

212
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,160
Ta Khuean acted alone.

213
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,320
That doesn’t mean this place is bad.

214
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,600
Besides, I’m just here for a cleansing ritual.

215
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,120
It’s nothing serious.

216
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,800
Nothing serious?

217
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,000
What if something happened
after you drank that water?

218
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,600
Then what?

219
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,600
- I didn’t think,
- Don’t argue.

220
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,720
I think you believe in this stuff too much.

221
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,520
So much you’re risking your own life.

222
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,160
And the water you bathed in,

223
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,120
who knows if it’s contaminated.

224
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,800
I’m going to change clothes.

225
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,520
I don’t want to fight with you.

226
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,400
After your grandma,

227
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,360
left you with the Grandmaster Monk,

228
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,280
he ordered that nothing be told to you,

229
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,520
about your family,

230
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,160
about your home,

231
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,680
because he was afraid,

232
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,680
you’d be put in danger.

233
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,800
The picture you drew,

234
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,520
that one, Dao,

235
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,080
that’s your mother, Thup.

236
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,000
Your mother,

237
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,600
was a kept woman of a police officer.

238
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,880
She hoped that,

239
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,720
after giving birth to you,

240
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,200
your father would leave his main family

241
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,320
and come live with the two of you.

242
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,400
But that’s how it goes,

243
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,280
men’s true nature.

244
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,200
After that,

245
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,400
he stopped caring about either of you.

246
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,000
So your mother,

247
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,320
quit her job as a teacher,

248
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,120
planning to move somewhere else,

249
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,520
not wanting to be people’s gossip,

250
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,680
and then this happened first.

251
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,000
Mom… Mom…

252
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,320
Mom… Mom…

253
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,720
What is it? Blood,

254
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,200
Please take care of my child.

255
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,800
Go now, Mom.

256
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,400
Please

257
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,600
Please don’t.

258
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,440
Good thing,

259
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,200
your grandma found you

260
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,480
and brought you to the Grandmaster Monk,

261
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,120
for your safety.

262
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,800
Grandmaster Monk,

263
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,920
please take my grandson in and look after him.

264
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,720
From now on, your name is,

265
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,280
Thup.

266
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,720
So how exactly did my mother die?

267
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,320
Some said it was her ex-husband.

268
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,040
Others said it was black magic.

269
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,720
But in the end,

270
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,280
the villagers

271
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,160
found your mother’s body
in a sacrificial ritual.

272
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,800
Her mouth and eyes were sewn shut,
just like that case.

273
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,720
Run, Thup.

274
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,600
Thup, run.

275
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,200
Don’t hurt my child.

276
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,200
As for your father,

277
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,600
whether he was the one who did it,

278
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,200
I’m not sure.

279
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,080
Then who is my father?

280
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,200
Your father was a former police officer.

281
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,320
But he died a long time ago.

282
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
They said his name was,

283
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,680
Atikun.

284
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,360
What Ta Khuean said just now,

285
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,040
it sounded strange.

286
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,640
Like Officer Atikun isn’t actually dead.

287
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,120
Who are you calling, Captain?

288
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,440
P’Sing.

289
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,920
How did the officer named Atikun die?

290
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,600
Seemed like illness.

291
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,040
A quiet ceremony at home.

292
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,400
No one from the station attended.

293
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,440
So no one ever saw the body, right?

294
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,080
Probably.

295
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,640
Why?

296
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,720
Because what Ta Khuean said earlier,
it sounded like Atikun isn’t dead.

297
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Like there’s some kind of plan.

298
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,720
Then keep questioning Ta Khuean for me.

299
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,000
If he really faked his death,

300
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,120
Ta Khuean might be involved.

301
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,280
And that person might be connected
to Santi Tham House in some way.

302
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,760
I’ll head back right away.

303
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,000
Got it.

304
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,400
So? Did you find anything?

305
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,720
I found what was bothering me.

306
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
Good.

307
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,800
Then we’re heading back to Bangkok.

308
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,600
There’s a suspect who may have faked his death,

309
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,520
using his status as a former cop
to cover his tracks.

310
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,200
A former cop?

311
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Yes.

312
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,320
His name is Sergeant Atikun.

313
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,520
He was the husband of a nurse named Chaba.

314
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,960
Thup.

315
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Thup.

316
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,080
What’s wrong, Thup?

317
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,920
Sergeant Atikun,

318
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,280
is my father.

319
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,560
Darin.

320
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,000
Next time,

321
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,000
don’t sneak off alone again.

322
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,480
And why did you follow me?

323
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,920
Worried about me, huh?

324
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,600
What?

325
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,680
What now?

326
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,080
Power cables.

327
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,880
Cooling pipes.

328
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,000
Look, there’s cold air coming out.

329
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,320
Hey, I think we should go back.

330
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,240
Salt.

331
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,680
Darin.

332
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,880
- What?
- Is this a cold room?

333
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,600
Yeah.

334
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,240
Why build a cold room here?

335
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,520
Let’s go.

336
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,320
You don’t have to feel bad.

337
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,400
Either way, we need the truth
to prove the evidence.

338
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,200
Maybe Atikun really is dead.

339
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,000
Or,

340
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,920
he and your father

341
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,000
might be two different people.

342
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,320
And if he really did it,

343
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,120
how am I supposed to feel,

344
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,640
having a father who’s a killer,

345
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,000
who killed who knows how many,

346
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,000
and even killed my mother,

347
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,560
and tried to kill me too?

348
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,800
What would you do?

349
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,280
You and your father,

350
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,520
are not the same person.

351
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,600
But I can’t deny the truth,

352
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,240
that I’m connected to him.

353
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,720
Either way, he’s my family.

354
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,800
Family,

355
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,320
doesn’t mean sharing the same DNA.

356
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,280
It means people who love each other,

357
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,120
who are bonded, who trust each other.

358
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,720
So that Atikun,

359
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,920
is definitely not your family.

360
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,320
Your family,

361
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,480
is me.

362
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,240
You’re really that confident in me?

363
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,720
You’re a good person.

364
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,040
I’ve trusted you all along.

365
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,600
No matter who your father is,

366
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,080
it doesn’t change

367
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,800
what people see in you, Thup.

368
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,200
You’re so good to me,

369
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,520
I’ll save up and replace the ring for you.

370
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,880
No need.

371
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,080
This way it’s cool, one of a kind.

372
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,680
But if people find out

373
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,280
we’re using the Phirot Ring as a couple ring,

374
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,320
they’ll think we’re weird,

375
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,360
considering where we found it.

376
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,000
This way fits just right.

377
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,520
Come here.

378
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,400
Don’t overthink it.

379
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,400
- Please wait here for a moment.
- Sure.

380
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,880
What’s going on, officer?

381
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,800
Hello, sir.

382
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,880
We’ll need to trouble you
to conduct another search here.

383
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,680
We’ve received new information,

384
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,320
there may be another suspect

385
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,840
working with Ta Khuean,

386
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,040
possibly connected to Santi Tham House.

387
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,719
They may be hiding here,
so we need to search.

388
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,920
Search whatever you need.

389
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,800
Just don’t disturb
the practitioners here.

390
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
Thank you.

391
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,840
Then I’ll need to collect DNA samples,

392
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,239
from you, and from all male disciples
who work here.

393
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Go ahead.

394
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,679
You can’t do that, officer.

395
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,239
You can’t make accusations
without evidence.

396
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,920
A virtuous, moral person like him,

397
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,840
- how could he do such a thing?
- That’s enough.

398
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,520
Hello to all fellow practitioners.

399
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,080
Please share this widely.

400
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,679
The police are harassing people of virtue.

401
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,840
This really is the dark age
of uniformed bandits.

402
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,520
We’re just doing our duty.
We really need your cooperation.

403
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,440
- Get out, you demons of religion!
- Yeah, go! Get out!

404
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,200
- Get out!
- We don’t want you here!

405
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,120
Let’s come back another time.

406
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,800
Then I’ll take my leave for now.

407
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,680
- Go! He’s a good man!
- Yeah, go! Get out!

408
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,400
- Please leave!
- Go back!

409
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,480
Sey, Darin, how did you end up here?

410
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,000
Darin’s a disciple here.

411
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,320
He just came for some kind of cleansing ritual.

412
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,920
And you, Captain, what are you doing here?

413
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,240
Go! Get out, you demons of religion!

414
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,840
Get out!

415
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,240
Leave the way you came.

416
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,600
- We’re leaving!
- Get out!

417
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,920
- So hot-headed. How do you even practice?
- Keep filming.

418
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,040
Why did the police have to search
Santi Tham House?

419
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,560
That’s something Inspector King
and other officers,

420
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,800
cannot comment on.

421
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,520
Because as of now,

422
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,120
I have personally taken over this case.

423
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,280
At this moment, the police
have arrested the suspect,

424
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,960
Mr. Khuean,

425
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
the manager of Santi Tham House.

426
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,920
He was taken into custody days ago.

427
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,560
And once the investigation,

428
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,480
and all evidence are fully established,

429
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,320
Mr. Khuean will be forwarded,

430
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,840
to court for further proceedings.

431
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,000
So Mr. Khuean is the killer, right?

432
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,000
The evidence is clear, correct?

433
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,760
Here.

434
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,200
(Instant relief, stick it on.)

435
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,320
You, seriously.

436
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,280
Hello?

437
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,320
Have you seen the news about my dad?

438
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
What news?

439
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,600
What did your dad do now?

440
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,120
Just see it yourself.

441
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,280
Mr. Montat Boonkhingklai,

442
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,040
the suspect in the
seven-bodies-on-the-tree case,

443
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,680
has died in custody.

444
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,120
Police believe the deceased
may have feared prosecution.

445
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,240
Is that true, sir?

446
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,240
- Was this a scapegoat, sir?
- That’s right.

447
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,800
Yes, what about it, sir?

448
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,960
Hey, everyone, calm down.

449
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,240
Are you sure,

450
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,800
this wasn’t your dad’s doing,
killing our only lead?

451
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
You get that, right?

452
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,520
You can’t do this, sir.

453
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,200
I’ve already signed off to close this case.

454
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,520
You and King are dismissed.

455
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,160
How many more people have to die

456
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,920
as scapegoats, sir,

457
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,440
before you realize
what a police officer’s real duty is?

458
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,720
A police officer’s duty,

459
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,920
is to keep the country under control,
to prevent chaos.

460
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,400
And that’s exactly what I’m doing.

461
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Yes, sir.

462
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,480
Not running around meddling,

463
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,520
until everything spirals out of control
like you did.

464
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,160
A good police officer’s job,

465
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,000
is to catch criminals
and bring them to justice.

466
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,200
As for how you get them,

467
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,680
the public doesn’t really care.

468
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,520
Before long, they’ll forget.

469
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,320
These days, the internet keeps evidence.

470
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,080
Aren’t you afraid people will figure it out later,

471
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,040
that you fooled them just for appearances?

472
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,880
This time, just dismissing you,
I don’t think that’ll be enough.

473
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,680
Don’t worry.

474
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,320
You won’t be doing this job much longer.

475
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,760
Because power,

476
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,320
lies at the tip of the pen that signs.

477
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,880
I told you already, didn’t I,

478
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,400
there’s no place for cops like you here.

479
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,200
Just wait and see.

480
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,600
What happened?

481
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,040
They pulled me off the case.

482
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,080
But as long as I’m still alive,

483
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,600
I’ll keep investigating.

484
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,640
Whether Ta Khuean is the killer or not,

485
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,800
you already know,

486
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,080
there isn’t just one culprit.

487
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,200
So what are you going to do next?

488
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,200
If you really are Atiyakhun’s son,

489
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,400
we should be able to match your DNA.

490
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,720
And if Atiyakhun isn’t dead,

491
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,800
you’re the only lead.

492
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,280
P’Sing.

493
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,800
I’ve sent it to the lab
and asked them to rush the test.

494
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,880
Yes. I’ll let you know
as soon as the results are out.

495
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,000
Got it.

496
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,720
What are you doing?

497
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,800
Don’t tell me,

498
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,400
you booked another cleansing ritual
or some exorcism course again.

499
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
No.

500
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,280
I’m looking at this.

501
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,200
This is,

502
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,440
the same logo we found at Santi Tham House.

503
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,400
It’s an industrial cooling unit.

504
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,920
Santi Tham House shouldn’t need something like this.

505
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,920
But is the temperature low enough to store bodies?

506
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,480
Ai Song.

507
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,600
- How’s it going? Still a lot left?
- Not much. Almost done.

508
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,720
That’s a long one.

509
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,920
What do you want to eat after this?

510
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,200
What are you doing?

511
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,120
Sorry, man, Ai Song.

512
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,560
Hello?

513
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,600
The lab results are out.

514
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,160
Thup’s DNA,

515
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,640
matches someone.

516
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,560
Who?

517
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,800
Someone from Santi Tham House?

518
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,680
No.

519
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,520
A kid named Bom.

520
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,240
Who?

521
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,000
Bom.

522
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,360
The YouTuber you arrested before.

523
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,680
I kept his DNA on file.

524
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,400
Thup’s DNA matches Bom’s.

525
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,240
Thup and Bom,

526
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,800
might be related.

527
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,600
Or someone in the family.

528
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,000
Or maybe,

529
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,000
they could be siblings.

530
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,920
How can a cop fall for a killer’s kid?

531
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,280
Who said that? I’ll punch his mouth.

532
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,280
The Mae Sue has made amends.
Inviting Wichitramawanna to descend.

533
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,000
So both were born on Sunday.
The next one is Monday.

534
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,880
Since getting back from Sisaket,
you haven’t rested.

535
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,160
Victims can’t wait.
 Cops don’t get to rest.

536
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,960
I think it’s definitely their work.

537
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,040
You think there’s something in the cold room?

538
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,840
If the killer used this method
and the victim isn’t dead yet,

539
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,200
we might still make it in time to save them.

540
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,440
I said we should live together.

541
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,680
Casting a charm so
the husband loves and adores her.

542
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,600
You can tell this is a Naga medium,
half the body in water.

543
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,640
(Naga spirit possession)
And the other half,

544
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,240
the lower half is still human,
then it turns into a snake.

545
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,640
- Down there it’s a snake now.
- Okay.

546
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,160
I need to talk.

547
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,080
Just you and me.

548
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,760
You’ll get punched for sure.

549
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,560
When you turn around, it might be like,

550
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,400
