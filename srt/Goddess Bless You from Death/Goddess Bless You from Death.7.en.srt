1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,360
Who did you ask to keep the Tukkata Sia-Kaban?

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,079
Darin said there might be
another seven-body sacrifice.

3
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,640
I’ve eaten seven.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,280
And I’ll eat seven more.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,200
Thup came back.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
- Thup
- Came back.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,000
Makes me think of
what happened to Maysa, my sister.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,600
If you’re ever ready to talk, you can tell me.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,920
I’d rather start over with you again.

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,600
Mr. Thamawat Santasakon.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,680
You’re under arrest for joint murder.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,000
So this is what you want?

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,600
Move.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,800
Sorry, Inspector.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,880
Inspector King ordered that

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,760
no unrelated personnel may visit the suspect.

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,160
Especially…

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,120
Inspector Singha.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,960
Why can’t I get in?

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,360
I’ve been on this case from the start.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,120
Please don’t make this hard for me, Inspector.

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,880
I don’t want to get punished.

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,480
You want him yelling at you later,

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,840
or me yelling at you now, huh?

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,320
Oops.

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
Uh… I was just taking a break.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,360
I’ll go to the restroom for ten minutes.

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,840
As for this part…

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,880
I’ll leave it to you, Inspector.

30
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,720
Are you okay?

31
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,200
I’m fine.

32
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,759
Does it hurt?

33
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,880
It’s nothing.

34
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,320
How did you even get in here?

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,960
I heard Inspector King banned all visits.

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,120
I’ve got my ways.

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,039
Did he force you? Or hurt you?

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,759
You don’t have to worry.

39
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,479
No one would dare do anything
that out in the open.

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,040
A case like this has too many eyes watching.

41
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,280
You don’t know King and his guys well enough.

42
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,400
They’re the last people you can trust.

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,600
Hang in there.

44
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,840
I’m working on getting you out.

45
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,920
I’m really okay… you know.

46
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Just believe in me.

47
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,320
Believe I didn’t do it,

48
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,079
What are you talking about?

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,360
If I didn’t believe in you…

50
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,600
why would I be doing all this?

51
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,160
I’ll get you out of here.
No matter what.

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,840
Didn’t I make myself clear?

53
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,640
No one goes in.

54
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,520
Don’t blame Goh for this.

55
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,880
I came in on my own.

56
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,680
And if you’ve got something to say,
say it to my face.

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,200
Don’t take it out on others.

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,440
Why the hell would
I have a problem with my team?

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,600
But from now on,

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,840
I’ll assign guards here around the clock.

61
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,280
No one gets in.
I don’t care who they are.

62
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,560
Follow proper protocol, Inspector.

63
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,280
This is a major case.

64
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,280
People are watching.

65
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,800
Someone like me,

66
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,400
I always do what’s right.

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Save that for telling yourself.

68
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,560
(Goddess Bless You From Death)

69
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,560
P'Sing, are you okay?

70
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,800
If I’m not, what can I do?

71
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,280
What do we do with the team now?

72
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,400
Our spiritual advisor suddenly
became the prime suspect.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
You really think Thup did it?

74
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,159
I don’t think that at all.

75
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,880
If he were the killer,
he would’ve fled long ago.

76
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,080
Why would he stay
and help us investigate?

77
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,720
Then we need to find the real killer.

78
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,640
What about Ta Khuean? How is he?

79
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,800
I checked his financial records.

80
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,880
The money he used to buy
the house and the car,

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
all of it,

82
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,520
came from donations from Santi Tham House.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,880
So the most we can charge him
with is embezzlement.

84
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,480
Not murder.

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,160
And if Ta Khuean really is the killer,

86
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,080
what would be his motive?

87
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,360
I’d like to report a missing person.

88
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,000
- You can’t go in, ma’am.
- Please calm down.

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,160
You can’t go in.

90
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,840
You need to file the report
at your local station first.

91
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,040
- Please calm down.
- Entry is not allowed.

92
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,080
- What’s going on?
- She can’t enter, sir.

93
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,800
My grandson is missing.

94
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,840
It’s been two days. I can’t reach him.

95
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,000
I told her to report it at the local station,
but she won’t listen.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,200
I did.

97
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,760
- But nothing has moved forward.
- How about this,

98
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,880
Write down your grandson’s name.

99
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,320
I’ll coordinate with the local police right away.

100
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,080
If there’s any progress, I’ll contact you.

101
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,159
All right.

102
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,760
His name is Natee Rungbariwan.

103
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,960
Don’t worry.

104
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,520
I’ll follow up right away.

105
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,159
Yes, yes. Thank you so much.

106
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,800
- Thank you.
- This way, ma’am.

107
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,920
- Yes, yes.
- This way.

108
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,000
Take care of it.

109
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,880
- Mek.
- Yes?

110
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,320
Thup.

111
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,440
P’Sing asked me to look after you.

112
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,000
Here.

113
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,880
This is all I can do.

114
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,040
Thank you so much.

115
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,240
Mm.

116
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
I’ve never asked you for anything.

117
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
But if you really are sacred,

118
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,000
please protect Thup.

119
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,280
He’s a good person.

120
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,280
And he didn’t do anything wrong.

121
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,680
It’s happening again.

122
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,800
It’s happening.

123
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,480
It’s happening.

124
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,080
It’s happening.

125
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,600
You? Renting a Thao Wessuwan statue?

126
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,280
I can’t believe it.

127
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
I just wanted you to feel at ease.

128
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,280
Or you don’t want it?

129
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,920
I can return it right now.

130
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,160
I want it.

131
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,200
I asked around.

132
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,320
They said Thao Wessuwan,

133
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,600
he’s the one who wards off evil.

134
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,240
Spirits. Ghosts.

135
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,360
So you won’t have to be scared.

136
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,560
Sey.

137
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,800
Where are you going?

138
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,160
Sey.

139
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,080
I’ve eaten seven.

140
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,160
And I’ll eat seven more.

141
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
Hey,

142
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,520
Hey, wake up.

143
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,120
Hey.

144
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,600
You okay?

145
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,280
Sey… is that really you?

146
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,080
Yeah.

147
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,240
It’s me.

148
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,640
What’s wrong?

149
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,200
Nightmare?

150
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
I don’t think it was just a nightmare.

151
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,760
It was a warning.

152
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,240
Huh?

153
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,400
I…

154
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,800
I dreamed that,

155
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,760
I was taken for a ritual.

156
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,960
I was hung on a tree,
just like the body we opened.

157
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,840
Calm down.

158
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,760
It was just a dream.

159
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,160
Don’t overthink it.

160
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,760
But it felt so real, man.

161
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,200
That ghost’s voice I heard,

162
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,080
it’s still echoing in my head.

163
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,240
If I really am the killer’s next target,

164
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,080
what the hell am I supposed to do, Sey?

165
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,240
You need to stay focused.

166
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,240
You’ve got me here.

167
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,120
I won’t let anyone hurt you.

168
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,040
Don’t be scared.

169
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,680
- Uh… hello.
- Hello.

170
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,480
Sorry to interrupt. I’m Niti.

171
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,960
These are for…

172
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,600
your room. All of it.

173
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,200
Buying this much,

174
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,680
you trying to bury my room with it?

175
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,480
Guess I’m stressed.

176
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,880
Ended up clicking too much.

177
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,560
It’s fine.

178
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,200
Something wrong?

179
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,400
Pass me the cutter.

180
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,440
Why?

181
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,720
Wrong item?

182
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,080
Maybe I ordered too much.

183
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,440
So they threw in extras.

184
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,440
With this much stuff,

185
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,440
they should’ve added ten more things.

186
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,200
You’re early today.

187
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,120
You think you can visit the suspect?

188
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,960
Stay out of my business.

189
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,520
Go work for the taxpayers.

190
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,800
You assigned guards to
watch that kid last night.

191
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,880
Why? You care about him that much?

192
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,400
Just because I don’t say it,

193
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,920
doesn’t mean I don’t know.

194
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,600
All of this… is your doing.

195
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,680
You ordered someone to
plant drugs on Thup, didn’t you?

196
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,800
Inspector.

197
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Do you have any proof?

198
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,800
I’ve been to his room.

199
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,640
There wasn’t a single pill you mentioned.

200
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,240
Anyone can see it’s your handiwork.

201
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,880
Your father told you to do it, didn’t he?

202
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,280
Whatever I do is my business.

203
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,000
But this case will close under my name.

204
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,120
Unless you beg,

205
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,480
or crawl back to me.

206
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,480
Then maybe I’ll think about letting that kid go.

207
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,240
I’m not selling myself out
over something this small.

208
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,840
I’ll catch the real killer.
No matter what.

209
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,840
And you,

210
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,240
stay out of my way.

211
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,720
I’m sorry.

212
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,600
Why are you sorry?

213
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,600
You didn’t do anything wrong.

214
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,160
If I’d just swallowed my pride
with King a bit more,

215
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,920
you’d be out by now.

216
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,800
If you have to bow to Inspector King,

217
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,000
I’d rather stay in jail.

218
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
Don’t joke like that.

219
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,080
If I don’t get you out,

220
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,720
you’re definitely doing long time.

221
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,400
So what,

222
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,960
you’re really giving in to Inspector King?

223
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,720
So I can start preparing myself?

224
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
For years behind bars,

225
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,720
or maybe even execution.

226
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,319
For killing seven people.

227
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,040
You really dare say that?

228
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,480
Pretty bold, aren’t you.

229
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,800
I’m not being bold.

230
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,920
I just know,

231
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,400
you’d never leave me like this.

232
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,200
Am I right?

233
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,080
I may talk big,

234
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,360
but you need to catch the killer fast.

235
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,560
I want to sleep in my own bed again.

236
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,960
I know. Don’t tell me.

237
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,880
Yeah? What is it?

238
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,160
P’Sing.

239
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,280
Can you bring the team to the scene?

240
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,080
I found a crucial piece of evidence.

241
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,040
It might clear Thup from the case.

242
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,720
Yeah, we’re coming.

243
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,360
Local police reported
a murder discovered at dawn.

244
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,400
The victim is Natee Rungbariwan.

245
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,280
His name is Natee Rungbariwan.

246
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,680
The missing nephew.

247
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,840
P’Sing.

248
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,200
There’s something in the details,

249
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,480
that might connect to our case.

250
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,400
What details, Sey?

251
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,760
Better if you see it yourself.

252
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,200
The killer did everything to the victim,

253
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,560
exactly like the Seven-Tree murders.

254
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,280
But the killer didn’t finish.

255
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,160
Why?

256
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,840
They probably lured him here last night.

257
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,480
He must’ve struggled during the stitching.

258
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,120
Then ran off this way.

259
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,720
Judging by the marks on the neck,

260
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,880
he was strangled until he couldn’t breathe.

261
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,920
Inspector.

262
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,080
Here’s the clip recorded at the scene.

263
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,520
Hey! What are you doing, stop!

264
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,880
Send it to the analysis teams now.

265
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,120
Yes, sir.

266
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,200
I’ll send people to pull more
CCTV around the area.

267
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,400
Think it’s a copycat?

268
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,000
The details,

269
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,560
the way it was done,

270
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,440
match the construction-site murder.

271
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Looks like the real killer.

272
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,520
But he rushed it,

273
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,600
and someone probably saw him.

274
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,680
Didn’t you say this only happens every five years?

275
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,600
It hasn’t even been that long. Why again?

276
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,880
I don’t know.

277
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,520
But one thing’s clear,

278
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,520
a murder done like this

279
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,680
means the main suspect you arrested

280
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,240
isn’t the real killer.

281
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,320
So you should release Thup already.

282
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,480
Bet you’re thrilled.

283
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,400
Thrilled my ass, someone died.

284
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,280
Focus on catching the real one, man.

285
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,160
So no one else ends up dead.

286
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,080
Here you go, dear.

287
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,920
Want some water?

288
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,280
Auntie.

289
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Oh?

290
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,040
You’re the one who came asking the other day.

291
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,680
You’re a police officer?

292
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,560
Where’s Ta Khuean, Auntie?

293
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,240
Oh, Ta Khuean,

294
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,200
he hasn’t been here for days.

295
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Doesn’t pick up my calls either.

296
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,160
Auntie.

297
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,920
Have you seen this man?

298
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,720
Has he ever come here?

299
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,720
I don’t recognize him.

300
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,120
Definitely not one of Master Soon’s pupils.

301
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,360
Please take a good look.

302
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,880
Here.

303
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,560
I really don’t know him.

304
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,480
If he came here often,

305
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,320
I’d remember his face.

306
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,880
Here.

307
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,200
Take it back, dear.

308
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,320
What?

309
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,520
Didn’t you say we needed to check here?

310
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,480
If it’s the same case,

311
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,920
everyone who died should link back here.

312
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,000
But it turns out like this.

313
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,560
Makes him harder to track.

314
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,400
Ko, send people to pull CCTV around here for me.

315
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,080
Every road connected to Santi Tham House.

316
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,480
I’ll have someone check Ta Khuean’s place.

317
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,280
I want to know where he was when it happened.

318
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,640
Mom, who are the police arresting?

319
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,000
We’re not arresting anyone.

320
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,840
Just asking for information.

321
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,480
Have you ever seen this man?

322
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,200
That’s… the ice delivery guy.

323
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,680
But someone else has been delivering for a week.

324
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,000
Which shop? Do you have their number?

325
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,320
Oh, Natee, right?

326
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,760
Yeah, he delivered our supplies.

327
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,600
He drops stuff here a lot,
and drinks there often.

328
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,480
Natee delivers ice.

329
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,240
Mostly works with Ta Khuean.

330
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Gets drunk and brags about
making money with Ta Khuean.

331
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,760
By living off traders at Santi Tham House.

332
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,400
Contact Ta Khuean’s relatives yet?

333
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,680
He has none.

334
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,480
His wife and kid are dead.

335
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,160
Nothing to do with Ta Khuean.

336
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,280
Mek.

337
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,680
When was Natee born?

338
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,880
Sunday.

339
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,040
Why?

340
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,480
But the spirit told me

341
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,920
it ate seven.

342
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,840
And will eat seven more.

343
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,800
Wednesday.

344
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,800
Wednesday.

345
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,120
Wednesday.

346
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,680
My birthday.

347
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,840
Darin was born Wednesday.

348
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,160
And today’s Sunday.

349
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,800
I’m telling you.

350
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
It’s starting again.

351
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,480
You think the killer’s
completing all seven days?

352
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,560
I don’t think so.

353
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,000
But it’s possible.

354
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,600
If the killer’s the same person.

355
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,320
They’re finding seven new sacrifices.

356
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,800
(Special Investigation Unit)

357
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,280
Tell me.

358
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,600
How something this insane happened.

359
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,720
Simple, Commander.

360
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,400
Means the man Inspector King arrested

361
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,360
wasn’t the real culprit.

362
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,040
And the evidence Inspector King used on Thup,

363
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,960
like the GHB,

364
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,760
likely wasn’t his.

365
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,160
Inspector.

366
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,440
So…

367
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,960
Thup’s staying at P'Singha’s house now.

368
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,840
I can get into his old rental room.

369
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,880
Handle it for me.

370
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,280
I just followed orders to close the case fast.

371
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,360
Thamawat was the most suspicious.

372
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,080
- But he wasn’t.
- Stop.

373
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,040
Your father sent you.

374
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,640
I respect him.

375
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,880
But you can’t do this.

376
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,880
I think it’s best

377
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,400
you adjust your approach a little.

378
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,040
Understood.

379
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,800
Did I say you could sit?

380
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,520
This is my house.

381
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,880
Not yours.

382
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,320
So why’d you call me here?

383
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,720
Just to yell at me?

384
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,120
Why? Such a small case,

385
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,280
and it still won’t close.

386
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,120
Even with a suspect already.

387
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,400
Just wrap it up.

388
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,480
If it’s that easy,

389
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,560
do it yourself.

390
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,440
Why send me?

391
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,120
I sent you

392
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,680
so you’d earn credit.

393
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,960
Not embarrass me like this.

394
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,280
I followed you and planted
the drugs on Thamawat.

395
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,080
But he isn’t the culprit.

396
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,600
We should focus on the real one.

397
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,520
Who asked for your opinion?

398
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,720
Oh, right.

399
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,160
You think you’re big now, huh?

400
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,360
In this field,

401
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,960
no one knows better than me.

402
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,200
Over something this small?

403
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,600
Others do far worse.

404
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,160
I’ve crossed lines for you so many times.

405
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,320
But I don’t want to be looked down on anymore.

406
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,280
I want to be a real cop.

407
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,480
Not someone’s puppet.

408
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,320
Just a moment working close

409
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,320
to that stray mutt,

410
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,640
and you’re acting like him now.

411
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,440
Who do you mean?

412
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,000
Who else.

413
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,440
That Inspector Singha.

414
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,280
He got you thinking you’re
suddenly stronger, huh?

415
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,560
Want me to show you how
I cut a chicken for a monkey again?

416
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,400
This time I’ll get him removed from service.

417
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,000
Wanna try?

418
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,320
Hey.

419
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,480
What’s wrong?

420
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,880
Back’s a bit sore.

421
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,040
Didn’t sleep well there.

422
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,480
Here, take your shirt off.

423
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,320
Shirt off.

424
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,680
Are you about to do something to me?

425
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,320
Do what?

426
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
I’m putting balm on.

427
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,600
Or you want pain like this?

428
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,640
Fine.

429
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,400
Come on, I’ll help.

430
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,600
Will this ever finish?

431
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,800
Come.

432
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,280
What?

433
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,280
Turn around.

434
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,320
Come here.

435
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,800
Thanks.

436
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,400
And…

437
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,560
when you weren’t there when I got released,

438
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,000
you were doing this?

439
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,600
Why.

440
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,880
Didn’t like it?

441
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,040
I did.

442
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,760
But…

443
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,680
means I don’t get to sleep upstairs anymore?

444
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,080
It’s not that you can’t sleep upstairs.

445
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,400
I’m moving down here.

446
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,680
To watch you.

447
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,920
Why.

448
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,760
The tent fits many.

449
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,360
Heh, I already fill it alone.

450
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,800
Come.

451
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,400
I’ll show you.

452
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,800
Well?

453
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,080
Full enough?

454
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,400
If you want to trick me
into the tent, just say so.

455
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,000
I’m not tricking you.

456
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,800
But if I told you straight,

457
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,720
would you come in?

458
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,680
I’ll do anything P'Sing tells me to.

459
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,360
I’m a good boy.

460
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,040
P’, what are you doing?

461
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,440
Sorry, the number you
have dialed is unavailable.

462
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,600
(Singha)

463
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,680
(Calling Singha)

464
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,200
Sorry, the number you
have dialed is unavailable.

465
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,360
Uh, P'Singha.

466
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,760
I’ve been meaning to ask you.

467
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,400
Why do you live here alone?

468
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,240
Where is everyone else?

469
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,680
Everyone else,

470
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,240
meaning who?

471
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,400
Well…

472
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,040
in your house,

473
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,760
there are photos of your mom and sister.

474
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,360
No one lives here.

475
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,880
My sister’s gone.

476
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,760
And my mom,

477
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,560
she chose to live somewhere else.

478
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,159
I couldn’t keep them here.

479
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,800
I’m sorry, P'Singha.

480
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,880
If I made you uncomfortable.

481
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,880
No.

482
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,320
My sister,

483
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,199
she had something like you.

484
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,320
She could see spirits like me?

485
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,120
Yeah.

486
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,159
Back then I didn’t believe her.

487
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,320
She asked me to help.

488
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,000
But I didn’t.

489
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,680
Because I didn’t believe her.

490
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,560
I let my sister…

491
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,080
die just like that.

492
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,200
But it’s been a long time.

493
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,600
Now I…

494
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,200
can live alone.

495
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,560
The past is the past.

496
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,080
Yes, P'Singha.

497
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,200
The past is the past.

498
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,840
I don’t know what you faced.

499
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,040
But you’ll never let me die too.

500
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,920
And I,

501
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,120
will never leave you.

502
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,680
You’re up early today.

503
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,600
And you, why are you up?

504
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,120
I was going to give alms.

505
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,680
And buy breakfast for you.

506
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,520
Want to go together?

507
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,560
Okay.

508
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,000
I’ll shower first.

509
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,640
And don’t forget to use this too.

510
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,880
A rough cop like me needs this?

511
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,400
Of course.

512
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,680
Cops should take care of themselves too.

513
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,320
When you go meet people,

514
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,520
and they see your handsome face,

515
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,280
they’ll cooperate more.

516
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,640
Handsome face.

517
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,720
Okay.

518
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,000
I’ll try it.

519
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,280
And…

520
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,760
you waking up early like this,

521
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,400
something wrong?

522
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,760
I dreamed of Maysa.

523
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:29,040
Maybe because you talked about her yesterday.

524
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,400
Or…

525
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,080
maybe she misses you.

526
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,080
If you’re uneasy,

527
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,800
want to make merit for her?

528
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,000
I’ll take you then.

529
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,520
Have you ever done it?

530
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,160
Never.

531
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,560
I don’t know if merit even reaches her.

532
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,240
So I never did it.

533
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,560
No one can know.

534
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,120
But at least,

535
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,800
the one doing it feels better.

536
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,560
Okay.

537
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,320
I’ll do it.

538
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,560
Then…

539
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,880
let’s go to the temple I gave alms at.

540
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,240
I have a place in mind.

541
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,880
It’s really peaceful here.

542
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,720
Feels like a meditation place for sure.

543
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,680
How’d you know this place?

544
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,440
This is my mom.

545
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,200
Hello.

546
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,640
Hello, dear.

547
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,760
Coming all the way here today,

548
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,080
is something wrong?

549
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,960
I met someone who sees like Maysa, Mom.

550
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,760
Thank you, Thup,

551
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,600
for bringing my son.

552
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,040
Came to make merit.

553
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,720
Since getting here,

554
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,520
haven’t seen Singha’s face at all.

555
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,720
I didn’t bring P'Singha here.

556
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,280
Last night P'Singha dreamed of Maysa,

557
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,320
so wanted to come feel at ease.

558
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,520
But without Thup,

559
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Singha wouldn’t believe any of this.

560
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,000
I really want Singha to let go,

561
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,280
that he wasn’t at fault for his brother’s death.

562
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,000
But it’s hard.

563
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,840
Hope I’m not crossing a line.

564
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,600
You staying here,

565
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,400
it isn’t because you’re mad at P'Singha, right.

566
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,160
Singha probably thinks so.

567
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,680
But I’m here

568
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,600
because I have to be.

569
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,880
Thup, can you promise me,

570
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,880
that you’ll stay and look after P'Singha.

571
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,560
Why say something like that.

572
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,400
Soon,

573
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,960
there may be something dangerous
coming for Singha.

574
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,760
Even if I still don’t know what it is,

575
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,800
I’m certain

576
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,480
that what’s coming...

577
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,920
There must be a reason for it.

578
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,880
Your gift, Thup,

579
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,200
it could help Singha.

580
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,480
Yes, Mae.

581
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,080
I’ll look after P'Singha myself.

582
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,400
Please don’t worry.

583
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,160
Thank you, dear.

584
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,000
I’ll head back now, Mae.

585
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,120
May the holy spirits

586
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,120
shield and protect my child,

587
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,520
keeping all harm away.

588
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,920
Bringing only peace and growth.

589
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,880
Wherever you go,

590
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,280
may you be safe, my child.

591
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,280
Yes, thank you.

592
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,800
Take care of yourself, dear.

593
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,880
Yes.

594
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,200
Thup, sure you’re not heading home first.

595
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,000
I’m not.

596
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,800
I promised your Mae I’d look after you.

597
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,440
Why would you look after me.

598
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,560
Forgot I’m a cop.

599
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,440
And you’re clear of this case now, Thup.

600
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,000
No need to stick to me anymore.

601
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,520
No one can touch you now.

602
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,360
I know.

603
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,240
I chose to stay with you.

604
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,160
Okay.

605
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Come on.

606
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,080
Hello.

607
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,480
Today,

608
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,000
they’ve been chanting since morning, officer.

609
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,680
Nothing the house staff know
that we won’t know.

610
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,280
Didn’t you come asking questions the other day.

611
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,240
I’m looking for Ta Khuean right now.

612
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,120
Mm, Ta Khuean.

613
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,400
Heard he wasn’t feeling well,

614
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,520
so took leave.

615
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,560
If the center can tell me

616
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,640
anything about Ta Khuean, please do.

617
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,760
Sure.

618
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,720
Khuean was at Santi Tham House before me.

619
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,480
But five years ago,

620
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,560
the former abbot passed away,

621
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,200
so Khuean...

622
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,160
invited me to take over here.

623
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,240
I saw people here

624
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,640
all needed spiritual support,

625
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,120
so I agreed.

626
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,680
Meaning Ta Khuean is someone who...

627
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,120
handles everything here, right.

628
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,000
You could say that.

629
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,480
I look after the villagers’ well-being,

630
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,000
and Khuean handles donations,

631
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,560
using them to run the center.

632
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,960
Is there a problem, officer.

633
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,680
Right now Ta Khuean

634
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,440
is a suspect in a major case.

635
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,120
What kind of case.

636
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,240
I still don’t have enough evidence

637
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,960
to get a warrant.

638
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,840
But a lot of things point back to him.

639
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,080
As for motive,

640
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,400
likely donation money.

641
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,520
From what we’ve known of him,

642
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,880
he’s always been kind-hearted.

643
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,520
But money, desire,

644
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,920
greed,

645
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,240
can take over anyone.

646
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,240
It’s human nature.

647
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,760
May I check Ta Khuean’s office.

648
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,840
Of course.

649
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,880
Nothing’s hidden here.

650
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,680
This,

651
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,800
did he use donation money for gambling.

652
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,440
He ran dirty money through
the center to wash it.

653
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,600
Khun Meen.

654
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,080
The victim who was killed,

655
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,280
was a debtor at Ta Khuean’s den.

656
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,080
But it’s strange.

657
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,520
Killing someone over a debt?

658
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,240
You don’t know gamblers at all.

659
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,480
These people owe millions.

660
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,800
I’ve seen many end like this.

661
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,920
I think Ta Khuean

662
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,600
used these rituals

663
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,920
to cover his tracks,

664
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,280
so no one could trace back to him.

665
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,880
But I still believe whoever performed this rite

666
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,440
was after some kind of power for real.

667
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,760
Hello.

668
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,520
Oh, Uncle Chai?

669
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,000
Of course I remember.

670
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,760
Okay, Uncle Chai. Thank you.

671
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,080
What happened.

672
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,160
Remember what you asked me?

673
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,360
Why they needed seven sacrifices

674
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,400
even though it’s not five years yet.

675
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,520
I remember. Why.

676
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,360
Just now Uncle Chai,
my uncle in Sisaket,

677
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,480
He called saying this ritual,

678
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,280
is a dark craft

679
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,680
that needs seven sacrifices.

680
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,720
Because the performer draws
life-force into themselves.

681
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,880
Some believe it extends lifespan,

682
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,360
others think

683
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,240
it strengthens their fortune.

684
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,160
But if the rite’s incomplete,

685
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,720
or disrupted,

686
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,200
a new sacrifice is required.

687
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,200
If not, the curse turns on them.

688
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,200
So this,

689
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,600
is what they mean

690
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,600
when something dies under a curse,

691
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,680
it’s tossed aside, uncared for.

692
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,960
Want to rewind and break up again?

693
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,360
Why.

694
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,640
Changing your mind?

695
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,080
Can I even change.

696
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,120
So that means,

697
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,320
the body we found

698
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,280
was disrupted?

699
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,720
Meaning,

700
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,800
someone born on Sunday.

701
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,400
Sey.

702
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,280
must be killed again.

703
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,280
I need your help.

704
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,400
I’m looking for a man.

705
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:52,920
P'Singha.

706
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,560
But Darin and the kid named Jump
aren’t connected at all.

707
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,920
So why were they chosen.

708
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,480
I need to know what he picks victims by.

709
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,400
Should we go to where it began.

710
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,960
- Where it began.
- The earliest case we know of.

711
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,640
It happened in Sisaket, right.

712
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,880
You’re getting attached
to that kid more each day.

713
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,120
Meaning I have no right to go back now?

714
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,000
Being with you,

715
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,280
and not seeing ghosts,

716
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,280
I don’t need anything else.

717
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,680
(It’s rising, rising.)

718
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,760
(Help me.)

719
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,040
Struggle.

720
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,320
- Okay, cut.
- Cut, cut.

721
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,160
- Want to get down first?
- I’m good.

722
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,120
(So realistic.)

723
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,520
Really scary.

724
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,600
But less scary since we can’t see it.

725
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,000
Watch how he puts it on, he’s a pro.

726
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,120
He wears it like this.
(You wanna hold hands?)

727
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,480
Top can't put it on.

728
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
(The doctor’s wicked.)

729
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,040
Sorry.

730
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:43,360
Why say sorry.
You didn’t do anything wrong.

731
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,400
(A little kiss for courage.)
