1
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,600
All seven of them , age, job,

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,040
environment, and family ,

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,560
nothing connects them.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,560
- Which one’s the latest?
- Phakaphong, the transgender.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,400
Have our informant find out
what this talisman means.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,920
Looks like the victim got
cursed for messing with magic.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,080
It’ll take a while
before we can close this case.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,000
I just want you to go back
to how you used to be.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,200
There was a similar case in Chiang Mai.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,479
Same corpse marks, same setup.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,000
Fifteen years ago in Sisaket.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,160
Ten years ago in Phang Nga.

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,080
Five years ago in Chiang Mai. Now, Bangkok.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,840
Or Killer strikes every five years?

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,560
Due to Colonel Singha Wetarak’s

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,280
negligence,

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,400
the suspect’s death occurred.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,160
Hereby removed from his position

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,720
pending further investigation
until the next stage of inquiry.

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,800
Oh, P'Sing.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,560
If the commander doesn’t approve,

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,840
should I tell the team heading upcountry

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,520
to pause for now?

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,720
No need.

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,120
We stick to the original plan.

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,479
We have to close this case fast,
before it’s too late.

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,320
Call back everyone
from the provincial fieldwork.

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,160
Have them continue
the probe at the next victim’s house.

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,479
Roger that.

30
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,960
What are you doing?

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,880
Uh, nothing.

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,200
I was waiting, so I doodled a bit.

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,520
Heading out for a bit.

34
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,600
Where to?

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,040
Victim’s house.

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,479
I’ll just wait in the room.

37
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,160
Don’t wanna bother you.

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,520
I’d feel bad.

39
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,880
What’s wrong with you?

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Weren’t you the one who wanted to
stay close ’cause of ghosts?

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,360
But I told you to come along, but you held back.

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
So what do you actually want?

43
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,760
Uh, I...

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,000
You’re the only witness
and spiritual consultant in this case.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,880
Do whatever I tell you to do.

46
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,440
From now on, if any other cop
orders you around, ignore them.

47
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,880
Only listen to me.

48
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,040
Got it?

49
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,720
Yes.

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,560
Hurry up.

51
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,000
(Goddess Bless You From Death)

52
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,800
Sey.

53
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,920
Can I take a day off today?

54
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,200
Submit your leave form
to the section chief here.

55
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,160
Just thinking about
what I have to do today is exhausting.

56
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,000
No way.

57
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,400
It’s a big case. I can’t handle it alone.

58
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,800
You need to help me coordinate
with the provincial hospitals today.

59
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,880
And cross-check the cases too.

60
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,120
Yeah.

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
Got it.

62
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,200
Then let’s split up.

63
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,760
See you at the hospital.

64
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,120
What?

65
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,560
You should stop those habits.

66
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
No touching outside the bed.

67
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,080
It’s not the same anymore.

68
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,520
Get that straight.

69
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,000
Hey, what’s up?

70
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,560
You coming to my place tonight?

71
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,800
Don’t think so.

72
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,960
Busy with work.

73
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,840
I invited a bunch of hot people, man.

74
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
All your type.

75
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,560
Maybe you’ll finally get a new lover.

76
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,480
But...

77
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,480
- I...
- Or you’ll never move on from the old one.

78
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,480
See you tonight, man.

79
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,000
Who were you talking to?

80
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,720
A friend.

81
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,600
You set this up?

82
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,800
Heh, not me.

83
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,720
Sey didn’t ask you to come.

84
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,920
I went to Sey’s condo last night.

85
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,280
Didn’t see him there.

86
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,400
So I thought I’d try here.

87
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,800
You two back together or what?

88
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,520
Whether we are or not,

89
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,280
it’s none of your business.

90
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,040
But if you’re that curious, I’ll answer.

91
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,680
We’re not getting back together.

92
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,520
Even if everything feels the same.

93
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,520
So why are you here?

94
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,240
If P'King needs anything for the case,

95
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,120
you should come see us
at the forensic institute.

96
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,640
Why?

97
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,200
Just like before.

98
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,240
Me, Singha, and you two,

99
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,160
we used to work cases together.

100
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,960
So why can’t I come see you now?

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,400
Like I said,

102
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,000
everything may look the same,

103
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,920
but it’s not the same.

104
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,520
I’m actually here about the case.

105
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,800
But not about the autopsy report.

106
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,680
I want to know about the kid staying with Singha.

107
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,280
I’ll give you one chance to answer properly,
is that kid a witness,

108
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,600
or… what exactly is he in this case?

109
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,560
Here’s the warrant.

110
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,960
Thanks for your cooperation.

111
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,960
Hello.

112
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,040
P'Sing.

113
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,840
I invited Khun Koi, the neighbor,

114
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,880
and Khun Ton, the village committee head,

115
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,000
to witness the house inspection.

116
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,000
Khun Koi said he hasn’t left home for days.

117
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,840
Khun Thee?

118
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,440
Khun Thee, are you there? Khun Thee!

119
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,320
Even his Dharma radio hasn’t been on.

120
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,120
Until they realized he was gone.

121
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,560
Hmm.

122
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,400
Inspector.

123
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,920
After his wife passed away,

124
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,680
he started listening to Dharma radio,

125
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,520
and turned more toward religion.

126
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,280
His daily routine was quiet, avoiding people.

127
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,880
He mostly kept to himself.

128
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,400
Split up and search the place.

129
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,680
Each victim must have
something that connects them.

130
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,720
We just need to find what it is.

131
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,200
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,080
Stay here for now.

133
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,760
Okay.

134
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,880
Help!

135
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,560
Help!

136
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,160
Help me!

137
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,480
Help me!

138
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,680
Help me!

139
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,040
Help me!

140
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,520
Help me!

141
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,680
Help me!

142
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,280
No signs of struggle.

143
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,480
Means the victim wasn’t attacked here.

144
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,840
After his wife suddenly died of a heart attack,

145
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,600
he started making merit
and visiting temples every day.

146
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,520
And before he went missing,

147
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,000
he had gone to make merit again.

148
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,880
Find out which temple he usually went to.

149
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,200
And take the neighbor in for questioning.

150
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Got it, P'Sing.

151
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,960
Oh, Thup.

152
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,840
Can I use the bathroom for a sec?

153
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,560
Don’t touch anything.

154
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,320
P'Singha.

155
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,920
P'Singha.

156
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,200
P'Singha.

157
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,280
P'Singha.

158
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,240
P'Singha.

159
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,000
P'Singha.

160
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,839
P'Singha.

161
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,960
P'Singha, help me!

162
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,720
Thup! Thup!

163
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,960
Thup! Thup!

164
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,360
Thup! Thup!

165
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,520
Thup! Thup!

166
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,800
Thup!

167
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,800
It’s me.

168
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,480
Calm down.

169
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,120
Easy, easy.

170
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,960
Breathe slowly.

171
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,880
Slowly.

172
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,560
Okay?

173
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,040
Breathe... breathe.

174
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,240
What got you this time?

175
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,800
Ghosts.

176
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,240
Two of them.

177
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,560
One I’ve never seen before.

178
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,000
A woman.

179
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,600
With white eyes.

180
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,360
And a mouth slit to her ears.

181
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,160
The other one was the owner of this house.

182
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,840
Y-you mean Khun Thee?

183
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,080
Yes.

184
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,200
You sure you weren’t just hallucinating?

185
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,280
He vomited out...

186
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,200
a ghost-summoning talisman.

187
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,440
Same kind you found
at the last victim’s house.

188
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,480
And there was also...

189
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,080
a Tukkata Siakaban Samoltat,

190
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,200
with an elephant-shaped head.

191
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,560
Like this?

192
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,760
Yes.

193
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,760
The doll’s neck was snapped, just like that.

194
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,840
Now you can’t say
I was just imagining things.

195
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,360
Checked already.

196
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,520
The two talismans are completely identical.

197
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,120
Since you’re the expert in this kind of thing,

198
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,040
can you tell me,

199
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,800
where these talismans come from,

200
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,200
or who’s giving them out?

201
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,680
If it’s about talismans or cloth talismans,

202
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,640
any temple could hand them out.

203
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,680
There are hundreds,
thousands of temples in Thailand.

204
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,320
Can you narrow it down a bit?

205
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,560
I may have grown up in a temple,

206
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,280
but I’m not some mystic-marketing expert.’.

207
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,480
What about this doll?

208
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,800
This kind of doll is called a Tukkata Siakaban.

209
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,440
It’s used in a ritual to dispel misfortune.

210
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,800
They believe every child born into the world

211
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
has a guardian spirit called Mae Sue.
(Mae Sue: Guardian Spirit of a Child)

212
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,640
Some say Mae Sue protects the child.

213
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
But others believe

214
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,800
she’s the one who brings sickness upon them.

215
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,520
That’s why they perform a Siakaban ritual,

216
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,520
or a Mae Sue Cleansing Ceremony.

217
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,680
The doll’s left at a crossroads.

218
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,960
Yes, Monk.

219
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,680
Grandmaster Monk once told me

220
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,960
I went through that ritual myself as a kid.

221
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,760
Villagers believe that

222
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,320
the clay doll represents that child.

223
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,040
Once the spirit Mae Sue takes the doll,

224
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,840
it won’t harm the child again.

225
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,920
These rituals vary from place to place.

226
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,480
I’m not even sure

227
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,040
if they always have to break the head.

228
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,160
But honestly,

229
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,160
no one ever takes a doll like that home.

230
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,840
It’s bad energy.

231
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,960
Then can you explain

232
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,800
why this dead person

233
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,920
buried the doll in their garden?

234
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,560
A doll with its head broken,

235
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,640
wrapped in a cloth talisman,

236
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,800
a ghost-summoning talisman,

237
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,240
and buried underground.

238
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,440
I think someone cursed them.

239
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,520
When that happens, their life force weakens.

240
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,080
And spirits can harm them.

241
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,360
All that... just from one doll?

242
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,440
P'Sing,

243
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,320
don’t mock what you don’t believe.

244
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,720
I’ve heard of people
who really use black magic.

245
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,880
Maybe Khun Thee thought bringing
that stuff home was good luck.

246
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,520
Even if temples hand out cloth talismans,

247
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
dolls like these,

248
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,160
no temple would ever give them out.

249
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,000
Only from...

250
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,640
a shaman’s house,

251
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,440
or a medium’s shrine.

252
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,000
Not like I have many options.

253
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,280
But we’ll never know till we try.

254
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,200
Track both victims for me.

255
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,600
See if they ever visited such places.

256
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,040
Got it. I’ll check it out.

257
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,320
Inspector Sing, are you investigating,

258
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,720
or interrogating witnesses?

259
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
You never call me in.

260
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,280
Why would I?

261
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,120
My job

262
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,440
is to find the culprit.

263
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
If all we do is hold meetings,

264
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,600
or kiss up to the boss,

265
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,320
the killer’s not gonna show up to get caught.

266
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,880
I understand.

267
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,800
So if I work for once,

268
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,320
you won’t interfere, right, Inspector Sing?

269
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,040
Khun Thamawat,

270
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,680
please come give your statement with me.

271
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,000
King,

272
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,200
I just want to question
the only witness at the scene.

273
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,400
No objection from you, Inspector Sing?

274
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,680
Because if you refuse to cooperate,

275
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,320
I might have to reconsider
Khun Thamawat’s status,

276
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,760
that maybe he’s not just...

277
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,520
a witness anymore.

278
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,320
I can go.

279
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,160
Thup,

280
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,520
P'Singha.

281
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,000
I’m fine.

282
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,240
Either way,

283
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,160
I have to cooperate with the investigation.

284
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,400
Follow me.

285
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
When you answered P'King this morning,

286
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,480
you meant it, right?

287
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,600
When have I ever lied?

288
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,000
Every word was true.

289
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,480
Okay.

290
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,240
Hey... you think,

291
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,720
P'King believes it?

292
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,400
That Thup really saw a ghost?

293
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,040
Or will he go after Thup like P'Singha did?

294
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,320
Doesn’t really concern us.

295
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,200
Let the police handle it.

296
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,200
So,

297
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,360
you’re not gonna ask me?

298
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,920
Where I’m sleeping tonight?

299
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,280
Nope.

300
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,520
Got plans tonight.

301
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,280
Yeah.

302
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,400
I’m coming with you tonight.

303
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,920
What’s with Inspector Sing?

304
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,360
Letting a murder suspect walk around free?

305
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,840
P'Sing did nothing wrong.

306
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,640
I’m a witness, not a suspect.

307
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,880
You called him “P’.”

308
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,880
You two that close?

309
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,880
But legally speaking, Khun Thamawat,

310
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,080
no witness is ever fully reliable,

311
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,440
not until the real culprit is caught.

312
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,560
No matter how many times you ask,

313
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,160
I’ll give you the same answer.

314
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,040
I didn’t do it.

315
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,440
Hmm.

316
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,040
Because actually,

317
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,280
I don’t intend to ask what
every other officer already did.

318
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,760
They say you can see ghosts.

319
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,280
Is that true?

320
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,600
You confirm you can see the unseen?

321
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,960
Things science can’t explain,

322
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,440
that’s why you got tangled up in this case.

323
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,120
Yes.

324
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,080
Sing doesn’t believe in any of that.

325
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,200
So why did he keep you at his place?

326
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Uh... well,

327
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,000
does that have anything to do with the case?

328
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,360
When I’m with P'Sing,

329
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,880
I don’t even know why,

330
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,600
I stop seeing those terrifying things.

331
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,480
P'Sing always protects me from the spirits.

332
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,120
And also...

333
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,360
from cops who just want a scapegoat.

334
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,040
I know the police want to close the case fast,

335
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,760
but if that’s how it’s done, I’m not playing along.

336
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,880
Do you know why Sing keeps you close?

337
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,040
So it’s easier to frame you later.

338
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,080
Because you’re so obedient.

339
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,920
Don’t you know Sing,

340
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,800
he’s done this before.
Someone died because of it.

341
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,280
But I’m not denying
what you said, seeing the unseen.

342
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,760
Because no matter how I look at it,

343
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,280
this case isn’t normal.

344
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,080
If you ever have useful information,

345
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,680
you should come to me,

346
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,560
not to Sing.

347
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,800
Because if you trust
the wrong cop and end up dead,

348
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,080
don’t say I didn’t warn you.

349
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,680
Inspector, that’s not right.

350
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,800
Didn’t you read Thup’s autopsy file?

351
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,480
Nothing on his shirt links to the victim.

352
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,600
No circumstantial evidence either.

353
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,680
I read it.

354
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,400
I just wanted to talk.

355
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,960
Why?

356
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,880
Can’t I talk to him?

357
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,880
You’re the one keeping him at your place.

358
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,240
Think no one knows?

359
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,920
How sure are you,
you won’t screw up again?

360
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,160
- Same place as always.
- Yeah.

361
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,360
Tonight, man,

362
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,680
I’ve got plenty of good wine for you.

363
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,040
Bay,

364
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,840
I’m not drinking much.
I’ve got work tomorrow.

365
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,200
That’s Barolo wine.

366
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,000
A famous one from Italy.

367
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,880
It has a strong aroma,

368
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,600
maybe not ideal for beginners, though.

369
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,720
Right.

370
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,760
I’m not that good with wine anyway.

371
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,600
Then let Buss take care of it for you.

372
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,400
Bay,

373
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,240
you should start with a Merlot.

374
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,280
This wine,

375
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,120
has a rich flavor,

376
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,680
and a soft fruity scent.

377
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,120
Perfect for beginners,

378
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,120
or maybe...

379
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,000
for getting to know someone new.

380
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,240
Come on, I’ll take a picture for you.

381
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,440
Smile, man.

382
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,200
One, two, three.

383
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,800
Hey,

384
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,520
I’m crashing here tonight.

385
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,840
I’m drunk.

386
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,960
Sey,

387
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,640
I don’t like this.

388
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,960
Go take a shower first.

389
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,280
You stink.

390
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,400
I’m sleeping like this.

391
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Shouldn’t have gone there.

392
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,320
Too crowded, too loud.

393
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,199
Got a headache too.

394
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
Then don’t go next time.

395
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,239
Yeah.

396
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,360
You still nag like always.

397
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,040
You’re huge, you know.

398
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,720
Thup,

399
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,080
What did King talk to you about?

400
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Just questioning. That’s all.

401
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,200
He talked about the case's odds.

402
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,000
I insisted I didn't do it.

403
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,600
Same as I told you.

404
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,360
That's it.

405
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,920
Don't you lie to me.

406
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,520
What did that King say to you?

407
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,000
Inspector King said

408
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,480
Maybe...

409
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,120
Maybe you didn't want to protect me.

410
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,520
But you kept me so you could pin the case.

411
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,720
I saw the old transfer book.

412
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,600
Did P'Singha cause a suspect to die?

413
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Inspector King said

414
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,680
Maybe I'm next.

415
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,600
Did you really do it?

416
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,480
Everything he said

417
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,680
was all true.

418
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,920
I did kill someone.

419
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,360
Stop, stop,why bring me here?

420
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,840
- Come.
- Let go. I'm not guilty.

421
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,240
Sit.

422
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,880
Sit.

423
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,880
- Why bring me here?
- You'll find out if you're guilty.

424
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,760
Whether you're guilty or not,

425
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,040
We'll deal with it in court.

426
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,440
- Quiet.
- Help!

427
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,840
If you don't cooperate,

428
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:54,400
the holding room will become a cell.

429
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,040
Let me out. Let me out.

430
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,520
Shit.

431
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,640
King.

432
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,760
King.

433
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,160
News spread nationwide
that I arrested the wrong suspect.

434
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,960
So I was transferred.

435
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,560
I must take responsibility for every mistake.

436
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,480
As for that King,

437
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,320
he was promoted to central with his father.

438
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,800
Even if it wasn't all my doing,

439
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,760
I caused an innocent person to die.

440
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,480
If a cop like me dared to stand firm a bit more

441
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,200
and hadn’t followed that King,

442
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,080
that wouldn’t have happened.

443
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,720
I’m not that good a cop, Thup.

444
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,800
But still better

445
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,280
than that bastard King.

446
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,280
To me,

447
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,200
P'Singha is already a good cop.

448
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,760
If I were that good,

449
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,880
you wouldn’t doubt me.

450
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,880
I’m sorry.

451
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,360
I’m sorry for misunderstanding you.

452
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,080
But I didn’t believe Inspector King’s words.

453
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,000
I still came back to sleep at your house.

454
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,600
’Cause my house isn’t haunted.

455
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,280
Right?

456
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,080
Yeah.

457
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,880
But I...

458
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,680
wanted to see for myself

459
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,520
what kind of cop you really are.

460
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,840
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come back here.

461
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,520
Believe me, P’.

462
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,000
I wouldn’t risk my life.

463
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,600
Can you stop making that face?

464
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,120
I feel guilty.

465
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,080
I’m not making any face.

466
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,120
Stop sulking.

467
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,600
I’ve never begged anyone
except the Grandmaster Monk.

468
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,680
Stop comparing me to a monk.

469
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,080
I’m comparing you to the one I love most.

470
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,920
Since the Grandmaster Monk passed away,

471
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,120
I only have you left.

472
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,000
Take me in, please.

473
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,000
Short-term or long-term, I don’t mind.

474
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,200
Don’t cross the line.

475
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,680
You stay only until the case is done.

476
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,880
I know you’re

477
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,680
strong on the outside.

478
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,160
Inside your heart

479
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,760
so soft.

480
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,480
See? Soft.

481
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,320
What the hell’s wrong with you?

482
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,360
Thanks for worrying about me.

483
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,920
I’ve been a burden to you today.

484
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,880
It’s my job anyway.

485
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,560
Hello?

486
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,040
- Hello.
- Hi.

487
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,600
We are Ghost Hunt.

488
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,720
Today we’re at the infamous Seven Corpses Tree.

489
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,000
Let me tell you all, today,

490
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,600
If I meet a ghost, I’ll ask right away

491
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,320
who the killer is.

492
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,400
Shit.

493
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,880
Man, you’re hopeless.

494
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,040
Hey! Ghost! Come on out!

495
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,040
Someone’s here to test you.

496
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,400
Bom, we’re a ghost-challenge channel, dude.

497
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,160
If we want fame, the ghost better show up fast.

498
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,280
Can’t stay with us otherwise.

499
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,120
- Guys,
- Hey!

500
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,400
Hey, Dear!

501
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,320
Where did they hang themselves?

502
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,640
This one?

503
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,280
- These guys?
- Yeah.

504
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,520
Shit.

505
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,760
- Damn, it’s real.
- Hey, hey.

506
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
- There’s fruit to eat too.
- Guys.

507
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,520
They say this place

508
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,520
was built over an old graveyard.

509
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,200
Right on top of it.

510
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,600
This must be real for sure.

511
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,440
Let’s go back.

512
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,880
Why are you in such a hurry?

513
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,240
The fun’s just about to start.

514
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,160
Hey, Bom.

515
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,840
Want an orange? I’ll peel it.

516
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,280
Eat it yourself.

517
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,960
Whoa, look.

518
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,800
All rotten.

519
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,200
Stand up, guys.

520
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,680
- What?
- I wanna shoot a thumbnail.

521
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,920
Here.

522
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,400
- Come.
- Yeah.

523
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,200
I’ll use this shot for the thumbnail.

524
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,240
Ready,one, two, three.

525
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,360
Yeah.

526
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,640
Hey, where’s the stuff?

527
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,880
Here.

528
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,760
Hey.

529
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,400
Did you hear footsteps?

530
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,800
Hey.

531
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,280
This isn’t right.

532
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,880
If you wanna livestream, do it in daylight.

533
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,080
Ugh.

534
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,000
If you’re scared, wait in the car.

535
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,880
- Yeah.
- Views are spiking right now.

536
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:25,640
I’m not going anywhere.

537
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,680
You’ll see something real soon.

538
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,200
Don’t chicken out. Come on, keep going.

539
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,840
You sure about this?

540
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,480
Yeah, we’ve come this far.

541
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:39,520
This method,

542
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,080
It’ll work for sure. I looked it up.

543
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,040
Yeah.

544
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,240
So, one incense stick is
for paying respect to the dead.

545
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,160
But if you do this,

546
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,800
it’s to summon a spirit.

547
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,680
Please, let me see a ghost just once.

548
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,400
I’ll ask it myself who the killer is.

549
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,680
Let me see it, please.

550
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,480
Record this, record this.

551
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,600
Shit, that’s a real crow sound.

552
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,600
Rubber’s too soft.

553
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,880
Stay here first.

554
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,400
P'Singha.

555
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,680
P'Singha, the car door’s locked.

556
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,400
Why can’t I open it, P’?

557
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,080
What happened?

558
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,480
Another ghost?

559
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,280
Yes.

560
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,640
But I’ve seen this one before.

561
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,240
Where?

562
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,200
Clearly... it was,

563
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,160
in your office.

564
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,080
If it’s followed me this far,

565
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,880
maybe it’s trying to warn us about something.

566
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,520
If it wanted to warn you, it wouldn’t scare you.

567
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,680
Let’s go.

568
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,520
Views are skyrocketing,
tens of thousands now.

569
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,760
What should I do to thank the viewers?

570
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,280
If it hits...

571
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,760
thirty thousand,

572
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,600
I’ll climb the tree and call the ghost.

573
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,880
Yeah, do it!

574
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,240
- Should I?
- Yeah, go on!

575
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,920
- Let’s do it.
- Hurry up!

576
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,640
- For real?
- Yeah.

577
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,520
What’s there to fear?
We’ve come this far.

578
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,480
Hey, Jump, be careful.

579
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,040
Relax, man.

580
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,280
Alright.

581
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,000
Three, two, one.

582
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,440
Hey!

583
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,160
That’s so cool.

584
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,480
See? Nothing happened.

585
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,600
- Yeah.
- Totally chill.

586
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,000
What’s wrong with you?

587
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,680
Just seeing things,
stared at the screen too long.

588
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:35,200
- Shit!
- Jump!

589
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,440
- Hey!
- What the hell’s wrong with you?

590
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,600
Jump, what’s wrong?

591
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,200
You called me, so I came to you.

592
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,400
- Shit, I’m scared!
- Jump!

593
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,280
- Jump!
- Jump!

594
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,720
- Officers! I said stop!
- Don’t come near me!

595
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,320
- Hold him!
- Stay still!

596
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,000
- What’s happening?
- Hold him down!

597
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,920
- Calm down!
- I’m scared!

598
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,520
I said stop!

599
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,520
What’s happening?

600
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,560
Hey!

601
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,960
- He’s not making sense!
- We didn’t do anything.

602
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,600
- Nothing, sir!
- P’Jack!

603
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,480
Take him outside to calm down.

604
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,880
I’m scared!

605
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,400
- Move it!
- I’m scared, don’t hurt me!

606
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,800
I’m really scared!

607
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,080
You’ve trespassed on a crime scene.

608
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,480
That’s against the law.

609
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,720
How did you even get in here?

610
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,240
Show me your IDs.

611
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,640
Got any?

612
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,600
And stop filming right now.

613
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,440
Give it here.

614
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,720
Turn it off. Now.

615
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,920
How did you get in here, huh?

616
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,120
Do you even know this is a crime scene?

617
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,960
God, these kids…

618
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,800
Thup. Thup.

619
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,600
Thup.

620
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,800
Thup.

621
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,480
Don’t be afraid.

622
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,160
I’m right here.

623
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,080
Tell me everything you saw last night.

624
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,560
- Saw a ghost?
- P’, you saw it too?

625
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,200
I think the ghost is following
orders more than anything.

626
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,880
There’s hair too , I’ll send it to the lab.

627
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,800
Maybe the DNA matches a victim.

628
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,280
You said those talismans and clay dolls

629
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,200
must belong to a spirit Shaman’s House
or a medium’s shrine, right?

630
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,200
What if it’s a meditation center that lures people in?

631
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,320
I’m glad I could help you, really.

632
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,080
Two. One.

633
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,280
(Where have you been poking, little Thup?)

634
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,360
Shoot it.
(calm down, Inspector)

635
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,520
Don’t worry.

636
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,840
I’m here now.

637
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,400
So mushy.
(I want to watch them being sweet)

638
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,760
If she jumps,

639
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,360
we’ll let her jump alone.
(aren’t you going to help her?)

640
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,960
Wake up, Otto.

641
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,680
(Get back to work, Inspector)
Come on, straight to the cold room.
