1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,880
(Previously on)
So if two were born on Sunday,

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,040
the next one has to be Monday.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,760
Monday is confirmed.

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,760
You think there’s something
in the cold room, right

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,080
A body or a victim.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,560
Stop this damn case already.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,280
It has to be their doing.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,800
They probably sent it after you.

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,880
They used my sister.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,320
The one who’s already dead,
to mess with me

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,720
No one ever knows
when it’s time to stay or go.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,040
Friday.

13
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,640
Shit, Bom.

14
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,520
Dear, dear.

15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,920
Dear, dear. Calm down.

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,320
It’s almost over, Dear.

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,680
Over my ass.

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,240
What the hell is over

19
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,280
- Dear, calm down, Dear.
- Jump.

20
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,400
- Dear, calm down, Dear.
- Let go. I said let go.

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,120
So you don’t like it easy,
you like getting hurt

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,120
Fine by me.

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,200
I’ll give it to you.

24
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,920
Let go. Let go of me.

25
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
Take some fever medicine first.

26
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,400
I’m fine.

27
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,480
P'Sing needs to take fever meds too.

28
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,959
No need.

29
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,080
A fever is still a fever.

30
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,520
And your leg is injured.

31
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,200
We don’t know if it’s infected.

32
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,720
You still have to take it.

33
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,000
So you want me to feed you, right?

34
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,800
I can take it myself.

35
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,720
It shattered this badly.

36
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,880
It’s fine.

37
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,320
Still usable. I’ll claim it later.

38
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,400
You can’t. It’s that broken.

39
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,880
What if it cuts your hand?

40
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,560
You bought this here, right?

41
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,680
It has a two-year screen warranty.

42
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,200
It’s not expired yet, right?

43
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,720
Not yet.

44
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,400
Okay.

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,800
I’ll handle the claim for you.

46
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,480
If I wait for you, nothing gets done.

47
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,159
I won’t interrupt lovers.

48
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,920
I’ll report back later.

49
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,520
Mek.

50
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,840
When I’m better, you’re dead.

51
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,720
What’s the report.

52
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,720
This looks like the killer’s hideout.

53
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,640
We found animal bones.

54
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,000
Looks like some kind of ritual, bro.

55
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,200
Anything linking it to the seven bodies.

56
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,600
No red threads or pha yant like before.

57
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,400
Alright. I’ll leave it to you.

58
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,200
I can’t get too involved.

59
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,600
King’s dad might punish you guys.

60
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,440
Got it.

61
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,400
Get well soon,
so we can get back to it.

62
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,800
You… come here.

63
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,600
Yes.

64
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,000
That hurts.

65
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,280
- Shy and still violent.
- This guy.

66
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,000
I’m off. I’m off.

67
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
What is it.

68
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,360
P'Sing.

69
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,600
King is missing.

70
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,440
Aisoon suddenly relapsed.

71
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,560
Darin called an ambulance.

72
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,680
I took the key and checked the cold room.

73
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,040
Did you find anything.

74
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,840
Nothing at all.

75
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,320
Just a regular cold room.

76
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,720
Then King showed up.

77
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,920
He told me to come back
and look after Darin.

78
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,960
Okay. I’ll go.

79
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,360
Alright.

80
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,200
Go.

81
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,000
The cops found our place.

82
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,520
What do you want me to do.

83
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,000
Once I’ve killed,

84
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,640
I can’t stop, right.

85
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,120
I have to kill.

86
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,480
Kill. Kill. Kill.

87
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,720
It has to keep going.

88
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,800
You can’t stop now.

89
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,640
The last time I saw King

90
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,919
was in the cold room.

91
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,120
Before we split up.

92
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,159
P'Sing, the killer wouldn’t
make Inspector King

93
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,680
part of the ritual, right.

94
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,160
I’m afraid that’s exactly
what he wants.

95
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,720
Everyone, stay calm.

96
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,920
King won’t go down that easy.

97
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,960
Our goal right now is

98
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,760
to catch the real culprit.

99
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,680
So we need to find him fast.

100
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
So who’s next.

101
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,640
Right now, the missing ones are

102
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,160
Song, born on Sunday,

103
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,680
Dear, born on Monday,

104
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,920
and Jump, born on Tuesday.

105
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,000
Inspector King was born on Friday.

106
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,000
Could he’ve been added to this set.

107
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,160
That means the rest are

108
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,600
Wednesday,

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,160
Thursday,

110
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,600
and Saturday.

111
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,800
You.

112
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,400
Do you remember what Jump said

113
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,120
about

114
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,520
Wednesday.

115
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,640
Wednesday.

116
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,480
My birthday.

117
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,520
Or maybe

118
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,880
the killer picks people he knows.

119
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,000
One criminal psychology trait
is choosing familiar victims,

120
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,240
the ones he can control.

121
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,760
That shows, deep down,

122
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,720
he’s actually sensitive

123
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,600
and deeply afraid.

124
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,720
It’s okay.

125
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
Knowing the target helps.

126
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,040
We can stop it in time.

127
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,000
Mek.

128
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,880
Stay close to Darin.

129
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,880
Yes, sir.

130
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,280
Sey, what day were you born.

131
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,520
Friday.

132
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,840
Same as King.

133
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,520
He won’t take you.

134
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,640
What about you, Mek.

135
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,600
Sunday.

136
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,520
That leaves Thursday and Saturday.

137
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,640
P'Singha and I were born Saturday.

138
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,200
Right now, we need to find

139
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,120
who was born on Thursday.

140
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,520
There’s one more thing that helps.

141
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,520
The killer’s ritual date pattern.

142
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,720
When did you last see
someone you knew among the dead.

143
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,840
At the Sart Festival, I think.

144
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,160
A few days before it happened.

145
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,960
It’s an ancestor rite
in the South.

146
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,160
Held on the 15th waning
of the tenth month.

147
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,840
The moon goes completely dark.

148
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,400
During the waning night.

149
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,160
If a ritual is performed,
the occult effect

150
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,440
will become even stronger.

151
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,320
Once seven are killed,

152
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,560
the killer will perform the ritual

153
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,920
on the night of a dark moon.

154
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,680
Five days left.

155
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,400
The fifteenth waning night.

156
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,600
A new moon night.

157
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,080
Hey, kid.

158
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,720
Hey, kid.

159
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,800
Wake up.

160
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,960
Easy.

161
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,800
- Hey, kid. Kid.
- Bro.

162
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,400
- Help me.
- Listen to me.

163
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Kid.

164
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,280
Calm down.

165
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,240
Please help me.

166
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,240
What day were you born.

167
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,840
Tuesday.

168
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,320
Then the next victim

169
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,840
is who.

170
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,080
The ritual follows the days, right.

171
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,240
That’s tomorrow.

172
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,680
Tomorrow.

173
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,720
Why tomorrow, bro.

174
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,920
You’re the next victim.

175
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,520
- Get me out of here.
- Calm down.

176
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,360
We’ll find a way together.

177
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,400
Okay.

178
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,520
Okay.

179
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,840
Who did this.

180
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,720
Who brought you here.

181
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,040
Did you see his face.

182
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,160
Damn it, Bom.

183
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,040
Bom took me.

184
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,520
He was alone, right.

185
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,200
Okay.

186
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
But P'Singha needs to know

187
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,280
what you’re seeing isn’t real.

188
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,800
It’s Bom, or someone messing with you.

189
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,400
Making you feel guilty.

190
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,880
I know.

191
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,400
But the image of Mesa I saw

192
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,000
felt so real.

193
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,120
I keep thinking about it.

194
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,800
If right now,

195
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,320
my sister and my mom were still alive,
what would our family be like.

196
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,400
Mesa would probably

197
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,760
be about your age now.

198
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,240
But still,

199
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,520
we can’t change the past.

200
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,360
I think

201
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,720
living each day with happiness

202
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,080
is probably what

203
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,720
the people around you want for you.

204
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,680
Both Mesa,

205
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,520
your mom,

206
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,960
and me.

207
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,600
Stop acting like my dad.

208
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,920
Then I’ll be your kid’s dad.

209
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,680
But I never said

210
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,080
having you in my life

211
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,200
made it worse.

212
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,520
Then promise me, P'Singha,

213
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,360
that both of us

214
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,600
will be okay.

215
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
We’ll get through this together.

216
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,840
Okay.

217
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,000
I promise.

218
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,640
What are you doing, Sey.

219
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,079
I came to pray,
ask for protection.

220
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Wait.

221
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,040
You’re the one

222
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,400
dragging me to pray.

223
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,040
Yeah.

224
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,520
You’re that scared.

225
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,920
Then I guess I have to…

226
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,680
If you don’t believe in it,
you didn’t have to bring me.

227
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,720
They can tell if you’re forcing it.

228
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,840
You don’t get to decide for me.

229
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,000
Right now,

230
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,880
I’ll do anything.

231
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,600
If it keeps you safe.

232
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,240
You’d go that far.

233
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,480
Why even ask.

234
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,400
If I didn’t agree,

235
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,320
would I bring you here.

236
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,920
Then why not agree
two years ago.

237
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,720
You called me superstitious.

238
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,080
Now I’m agreeing to everything.

239
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,120
So you can feel at ease.

240
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Darin.

241
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,520
You don’t have to worry.

242
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,800
Nothing’s going to happen.

243
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,320
And…

244
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,040
all that old stuff,

245
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,600
let’s stop talking about it.

246
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
So what.

247
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,600
Should we head back.

248
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,480
I’m kidding.

249
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,480
But I’m glad.

250
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,200
that you brought me here.

251
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,520
And…

252
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,920
what do I do now.

253
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,680
Go get the tray.

254
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,320
Follow me.

255
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,080
Place the lotus right here.

256
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,200
Then chant this.

257
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,880
What is it.

258
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,160
Inspector,

259
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
we can’t reach Sergeant Khem.

260
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,000
Why not.

261
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,560
Officers reported

262
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,960
he saw a suspicious person
under Bom’s condo.

263
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,840
He followed him
and then went silent.

264
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,320
Damn it.

265
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,520
Damn it.

266
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,800
- Shit.
- Sergeant… Sergeant Khem.

267
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,800
What did you do, Bom.

268
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,280
What did you do to him.

269
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,360
Sergeant.

270
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Have you tracked his phone.

271
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,120
It’s powered off.

272
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,200
His car is still there.

273
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,600
But Inspector,

274
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,520
we found a red pha yant
in Sergeant Khem’s car.

275
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,320
More importantly, we just found out

276
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,200
Sergeant Khem was born on Thursday.

277
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,240
Sergeant Khem.

278
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,640
You bastard, Bom.

279
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,840
What did you do to him.

280
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Sergeant.

281
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
You.

282
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,720
You.

283
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,600
Please help me.

284
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,160
I don’t want to die.

285
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,200
- Tuesday.
- Shut up.

286
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,920
- It’s time.
- Time my ass.

287
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,800
- You bastard, Bom.
- Come to me.

288
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,520
Please don’t. Let me go. I beg you.

289
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,600
- Don’t hurt me. I beg you.
- I told you to come here.

290
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,920
Come here.

291
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,640
Inspector.

292
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,360
Could you mind your manners.

293
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,760
I have business with this one.

294
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,320
It’s not your turn yet.

295
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,000
But you won’t wait long. I’ll come.

296
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,160
And don’t worry, Inspector.

297
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,480
There will be

298
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,520
many following you soon enough.

299
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,920
- Jump.
- Bom, please. I’m begging you.

300
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,480
Please don’t hurt me. I’m begging you.

301
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,120
- Jump.
- We haven’t played together in ages.

302
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,000
- Kid.
- Please let me go. I’m begging you.

303
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,840
- Won’t you play with me, Jump.
- What’s wrong with you. Stop it.

304
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,960
Jump, where do you think you’re going.

305
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,720
- What’s wrong with you.
- Aren’t you my friend.

306
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,320
Please.

307
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,720
We haven’t played in so long.

308
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,640
- Please let me go.
- I told you to stop.

309
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,640
Jump.

310
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,760
- You psycho.
- You bastard, Bom.

311
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,880
Jump, come play with me.

312
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,040
- You bastard, Bom.
- Jump, come play with me.

313
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,920
You bastard, Bom.

314
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,800
Why are you running, Jump.

315
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,360
- Bro.
- Play with me first.

316
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,680
- Help me…
- Play with me first.

317
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,000
Don’t. Please don’t.

318
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,720
Thank you.

319
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,720
How did the killer know

320
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,120
what day Sergeant Khem was born.

321
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,440
I think he may have made merit there.

322
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,200
The killer probably chose victims

323
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,920
based on birthdays

324
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,720
from people who went to make merit.

325
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,440
Inspector.

326
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,000
Yes.

327
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,400
I found Inspector King’s phone in the car.

328
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,680
What are you doing, P'Singha.

329
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,800
Tracking King’s watch location.

330
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,920
In case he’s still wearing it.

331
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,520
You sick bastard.

332
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,320
You psycho.

333
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,600
Or are you scared.

334
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,000
I’m talking to you.

335
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,520
You’re nothing but a psycho.

336
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,720
- It’s your turn now.
- Your turn, my ass.

337
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,080
You’re an inspector.

338
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,240
Got no manners at all.

339
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,520
People are talking.
Don’t interrupt.

340
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,440
You think you’re tough.

341
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,320
Think being an inspector
makes you tough.

342
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,120
You filthy dog.

343
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,520
You’re just a sick psycho.

344
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,440
Then take a nap, Inspector.

345
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,920
You okay.

346
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,720
Need a break.

347
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,600
I’ll keep watching.

348
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,320
Just a bit dizzy.

349
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,440
Rest your eyes a moment.
That should help.

350
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,320
I can really handle this myself.

351
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,720
You should go rest.

352
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,400
I’m fine.

353
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,280
But I’m not.

354
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,360
You’re unwell.

355
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,600
You should rest.

356
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,880
Don’t make me scold you.

357
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
I’ll…

358
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,920
go wash my face in the restroom.

359
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,720
Then I’ll head back to the condo.

360
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,800
Doctor Darin,

361
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,680
let me go with you.

362
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,920
It’s okay, Lieutenant.

363
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,880
I’m just going to the restroom.

364
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,320
Are you sure.

365
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,440
I can wait outside if you want.

366
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,560
It’s fine.

367
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,800
I’ll be quick and come right back.

368
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,200
(Chanting)

369
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,840
(Chanting)

370
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:48,760
(Chanting)

371
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,080
(Chanting)

372
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,720
(Chanting)

373
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,160
(Chanting)

374
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,320
(Chanting)

375
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,520
Sorry.

376
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,120
It’s okay.

377
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,480
What the hell.

378
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,120
Ghosts aren’t real.

379
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,120
Ghosts aren’t real.

380
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,360
Ghosts aren’t real.

381
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,120
Ghosts aren’t real.

382
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,080
- Damn it, Mi.
- Doctor, what happened.

383
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,920
What happened.

384
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,080
Sey.

385
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,000
Sey.

386
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,200
What happened.

387
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,440
P'Sing.

388
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,080
Darin’s in the bathroom.

389
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,800
Hurry, Dad.

390
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,520
Careful, bro.

391
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,480
Mek.

392
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,719
Mek.

393
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,520
It hurts, bro.

394
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,880
Get up.

395
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,679
Where’s Darin.

396
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,760
P'Sing.

397
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,480
Where’s Darin.

398
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,480
Mek.

399
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,800
Where’s Darin.

400
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,600
I’m sorry, Doctor Sey.

401
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,480
Dad.

402
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,800
Why does it have to be him.

403
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,480
Why not someone else.

404
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,280
It has to be him.

405
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,280
Why, Dad.

406
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,000
We’re almost out of time.

407
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,160
- Anyone is fine, right, someone born on Saturday.
- This isn’t a coincidence.

408
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,720
They ruined the ritual.

409
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,960
So we have to use them as sacrifices.

410
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,280
That’s the only way it works.

411
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,720
Do you understand.

412
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,320
But,

413
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Dad.

414
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,880
I told you to bring them to me.

415
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,880
Just go and get them.

416
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,880
Why are you talking back, asking stupid questions.

417
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,600
Do you want the ritual to fail again.

418
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,200
Go.

419
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,520
Someone has to be helping Bom.

420
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,480
He couldn’t have done this alone.

421
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,920
It’s probably Atikun.

422
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,400
But the other one seems really agile.

423
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,400
If Atikun were still alive,

424
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,320
he’d be very old by now.

425
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,800
I don’t care anymore, bro,
if there’s another one.

426
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,400
Calm down.

427
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,440
They’re still missing Saturday.

428
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,400
No matter what,
they’ll come back to us.

429
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,360
If it’s not me,

430
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,800
then it’s Thup.

431
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,280
I’ve got King’s location.

432
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,240
You’re really going with me, right.

433
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,000
If anything happens,
contact me through this.

434
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,320
No going off plan,
no missing your cue.

435
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,200
No making decisions on your own.

436
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Understood.

437
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,120
Yes.

438
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,680
Test it.

439
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,000
You can stay up there.

440
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,320
Okay.

441
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,400
P'Singha, are you still with me.

442
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,280
Okay, testing again.

443
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,520
Can you hear me.

444
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,240
I can hear you.

445
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Okay.

446
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,800
There shouldn’t be any problem now.

447
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,600
You’ll know I’m with you the whole time.

448
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,800
P'Singha.

449
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,000
Yeah.

450
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,480
Yeah.

451
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
Thup.

452
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
Thup.

453
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,720
Do you want to be my boyfriend.

454
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,000
I can’t wait any longer.

455
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,120
I want to be able to say it out loud.

456
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,400
That you’re mine.

457
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,080
And I want to be yours too.

458
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,520
I’m afraid

459
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,800
I won’t get the chance to ask you.

460
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,720
Not with my own words.

461
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,920
Don’t talk like it’s a bad omen.

462
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,720
You have to be safe.

463
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,240
As long as I’m not dead,

464
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,720
I won’t let my boyfriend get hurt.

465
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,400
So that means,

466
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,320
You’re saying yes, right.

467
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,120
We’re boyfriends now.

468
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,480
Can I ask you for one thing.

469
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,680
You don’t have to protect me.

470
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,840
Or do things for me anymore.

471
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,920
Just live your life for yourself.

472
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,520
And live it with me.

473
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,440
That’s all.

474
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,880
Okay.

475
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,920
I promise.

476
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,240
Please protect me

477
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,600
and the one I love.

478
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,080
And everyone.
Keep us safe from this nightmare.

479
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,520
King’s phone signal

480
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,800
is inside this building.

481
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,440
According to records,
only floors one and two are active.

482
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,800
The upper floors have been closed for years.

483
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,480
Okay.

484
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,160
Let me go with you.

485
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,920
No.

486
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,640
Mek goes.

487
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,920
You stay here.

488
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,320
No.

489
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,520
I’m coming too.

490
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,360
Sey.

491
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,120
I’m coming too.

492
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,600
Okay. Let’s go.

493
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,120
- Thup.
- Let me go with you.

494
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,560
Go. Trust me.

495
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,640
You’re leaving me here alone?

496
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,920
If anything happens,

497
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,800
contact me on this channel.

498
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,920
Lock the door.

499
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,040
Get inside.

500
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,920
What.

501
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,520
Be careful, okay.

502
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,520
Lock the door.

503
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,560
The signal’s right here.

504
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,680
Shit.

505
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,720
But I don’t know which floor.

506
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,160
I’ll check over there.

507
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,040
Sey.

508
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,240
Sey.

509
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,320
Sey.

510
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,160
- Mek, follow him.
- Yes.

511
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,280
- Update me if anything.
- Will do.

512
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,520
Singha.

513
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,200
What if

514
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,440
the one he wants isn’t me,

515
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,720
but someone else.

516
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,680
Thup, stay calm.

517
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,120
He just wants to beat the cops.

518
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,200
Okay, bro.

519
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,640
Where are you right now.

520
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,960
Doctor.

521
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,520
Can you hear me.

522
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,000
Lieutenant.

523
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,000
I’ll check over there.

524
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,400
Doctor, wait for me.

525
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,680
Singha. Hey.

526
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,800
Hello.

527
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,120
Lieutenant Mek.

528
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,520
I feel strange again.

529
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,400
Thup.

530
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,200
I told you to stay calm.

531
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,200
Stay right there.

532
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,800
W-What, Singha.

533
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,200
Singha.

534
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,360
What’s happening.

535
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,920
What was that sound.

536
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,400
P'Singha.

537
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,680
Are you okay.

538
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,600
P'Sing P'Sing.

539
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,320
P'Sing.

540
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,840
P'Sing. Hey.

541
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,680
Are you okay, P'Singha.

542
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,600
Please answer me.

543
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,320
It’s dangerous. Don’t come out.

544
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,360
P'Singha.

545
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,120
Please answer me.

546
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,280
Aisoon.

547
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,000
P'Singha.

548
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,560
What’s wrong with you.

549
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,760
Atikun.

550
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,320
Atikun.

551
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,760
So…

552
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,400
- You’re my father.
- What the hell are you saying.

553
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,720
Took long enough to meet, you little brat.

554
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,280
What kind of father kills his own son.

555
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,760
You’re insane with your rituals, you bastard.

556
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,360
If I hadn’t done those rituals,

557
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,520
I wouldn’t be alive today.

558
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,600
I’ve been hiding for decades,

559
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,800
and a cop like you still finds me.

560
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,720
Once this ritual is finished,

561
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,920
you’ll never find me again.

562
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,880
Take me.

563
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,040
Take me instead.

564
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,840
What would I want you for.

565
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,720
You’re not the one I need.

566
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,200
This damn kid,

567
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,600
was born to ruin my life.

568
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,840
I was born on Saturday.

569
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,280
So was he.

570
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,600
It’s not the same.

571
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:41,960
Damn it.

572
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,640
- Come here.
- Singha.

573
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,200
Thup. Thup.

574
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:28,600
(NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW)
I invite the Seven Mothers to descend here.

575
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,240
It’s Wednesday morning already.

576
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,640
If you don’t stop, I’ll curse you.

577
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,080
Shit.

578
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,800
You’ll repay the debt.

579
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,120
As a son.

580
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,080
Die. Die.

581
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,840
- Die.
- Singha.

582
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,880
Dad, don’t you follow the days anymore.

583
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,120
Kill them all.

584
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,000
(Behind the scene)
Action.

585
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,280
We’ve got King’s location.

586
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,080
- Okay, cut.
- That’s a take.

587
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,800
(All good.)

588
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,160
This scene took five minutes to shoot.

589
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,840
One scene, five minutes.

590
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,520
To be not confirm.

591
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,160
(Everyone cheering.)

592
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,680
I’m afraid I won’t get the chance to ask you.

593
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,680
As long as I’m not dead,

594
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,360
I won’t let my boyfriend get hurt.

595
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,440
I won’t let my boyfriend get hurt.
