1
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,970
(in Korean) I'm telling you,
I saw it with my own eyes.

2
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,472
- You don't believe me?
- What are you saying?

3
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:38,724
Mind your own business.

4
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,270
Did you see? With his bare hands.

5
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,771
Taehoon.

6
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,953
(in Japanese) Bando, Yosebu.

7
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,665
Ah, here you are.

8
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,214
Those Koreans are like roaches.

9
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,883
Every day, they keep multiplying.

10
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,470
When will they stop?

11
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,265
Bando-<i>san</i>!

12
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,734
Tell him I want these aisles swept.

13
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,903
I don't want a speck of dust left.

14
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,780
Make sure he knows that.

15
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,162
He said sweep the floors.

16
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:26,874
Do a good job. He'll be watching you.

17
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,712
He understands.

18
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,340
Back to your place.

19
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,912
- Beer or sake?
- Sake, please.

20
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,173
Sir! Here! Here!

21
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,511
Join us.

22
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,816
Cheers.

23
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,861
Cheers!

24
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:47,204
My father used to say,

25
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,582
"When a man has a drink in his hand,

26
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,627
his joys turn into sorrow,
and the sorrows turn into joy."

27
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,798
Which one is it for you tonight?

28
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,299
Young man,

29
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,678
I don't mean to hurt your feelings,

30
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,556
but I want to drink in peace.

31
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,475
As your elder,

32
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,894
allow me that.

33
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,397
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

34
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,578
Why are you laughing?

35
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,291
I was just thinking of something else
my father used to say.

36
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,129
Come to think of it, he really did have
a saying for everything.

37
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:42,801
And where is your father?

38
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,804
He's passed.

39
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,765
From cholera.

40
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,395
It spared me somehow, but not my father.

41
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,859
When did you get sent over?

42
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:01,987
About a year ago now.

43
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:08,118
They started me in the mines,
but there was an accident.

44
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,582
It won't last forever,

45
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,418
this war.

46
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:22,841
Yes, but will there be anything left
to go back to?

47
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,384
What are you talking about?

48
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,387
We do whatever it takes.

49
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:28,805
That's our country.

50
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,433
I didn't take you for a patriot.

51
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,061
It's nothing like that.

52
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,145
Just…

53
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,815
I know where I belong.

54
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,318
No need to complicate it more than that.

55
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,371
I'll be off then.
I see another seat opening.

56
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,931
I come with great news.

57
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:17,229
I am proud to announce
a most important visitor to our factory.

58
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,147
In two days,

59
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:23,402
one of our Emperor's
distinguished advisors

60
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:27,406
will honor us with his presence

61
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,868
in recognition
of our dedicated war efforts.

62
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,744
Therefore,

63
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:40,252
we must show our most worthy guest
what this factory is truly capable of.

64
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,011
Banzai!

65
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,846
Banzai!

66
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,623
<i>On the morning of August 6th,
shortly after 8:00 in the morning,</i>

67
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,042
- <i>a new bomb hit Hiroshima…</i>
- Taehoon.

68
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,715
I know what you're planning
with that chisel.

69
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,135
It's suicide.

70
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,096
Don't concern yourself.

71
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,933
I don't want to, believe me.

72
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,184
But…

73
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,109
When I look at you,

74
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,403
you remind me of someone.

75
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:35,117
My brother.

76
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:37,995
Isak.

77
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,166
I brought him into this hell,

78
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,254
all because I was so lonely.

79
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,552
And now…

80
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,265
he's gone.

81
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:03,353
I told you about my father.

82
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,772
That disease,

83
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,067
it hit my entire village.

84
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,866
Out of 89 of us,

85
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,997
I was the only one to survive.

86
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:29,630
Why?

87
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:35,469
Why did I live
when all those others died?

88
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,395
Then when I heard
that foreman speak yesterday…

89
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,318
I finally understood why.

90
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,573
For this.

91
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:03,205
No.

92
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,083
It's a sin.

93
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,377
A sin?

94
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:22,015
May your cup always runneth over.

95
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,603
That the love you speak of,

96
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,566
may it nourish you into your old age.

97
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,866
Truly.

98
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,328
I wish it for you.

99
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,643
Our nation thanks you.

100
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,820
Thank you.

101
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,199
Well done.

102
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:22,951
Well done.

103
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,016
Hurry, get back!

104
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,644
- I was just trying to--
- I said, get back now!

105
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:51,772
He has nothing to do with this! Let go!

106
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,607
- Taehoon!
- Sir!

107
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:18,465
<i>We have ordered our government
to communicate to the governments</i>

108
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:22,177
<i>of the United States, Great Britain,
China, and the Soviet Union</i>

109
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:28,433
<i>that our empire accepts the provisions
of their Joint Declaration.</i>

110
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,189
<i>Should we continue to fight,</i>

111
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:38,819
<i>it would not only result in the ultimate
collapse and obliteration of Japan,</i>

112
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,906
<i>but also to the destruction
of human civilization…</i>

113
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,792
Are you awake?

114
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,128
My brother-in-law,

115
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,671
can you hear me?

116
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,045
Calm yourself.

117
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,881
Your family will be back soon.

118
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,134
Who are you?

119
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,637
I am Koh Hansu.

120
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,020
You're…

121
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,440
that family friend.

122
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,529
Taehoon, how is he?

123
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,324
I don't know who that is,

124
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,410
but if he was with you in the factory,
then the odds are not good.

125
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,497
You had fortune on your side.

126
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,583
The truck shielded you.

127
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,139
So can I stay here then?

128
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,476
The war is over.

129
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:39,773
Which side…

130
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,025
Which side won?

131
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,777
Who do you think?

132
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,031
Then our country is ours again.

133
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,534
If you're thinking about
going back to Korea, forget it.

134
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,037
It'll be chaos in the coming years.

135
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,833
Only an idiot would return to that.

136
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,171
You'll stay on the farm
until Osaka is safe.

137
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:04,756
This farm is mine.

138
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,512
Who…

139
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:14,516
Who are you really?

140
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:20,939
As you said,

141
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:23,859
- a family friend--
- You're the father.

142
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:26,695
Aren't you?

143
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:34,077
How dare you hang around here?

144
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:37,623
You have no right to be near him!

145
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,791
I have the right because he is my son.

146
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,336
It was my brother who raised him.

147
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,796
Your brother left him a pauper.

148
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,173
Shut up!

149
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:51,678
Even once more.
If you insult him again, I'll kill you.

150
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,265
Even if it means bursting out of
what skin I have left,

151
00:16:57,226 --> 00:16:58,519
I'll kill you.

152
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,527
You think I don't know
what kind of person you are?

153
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,825
To earn those clothes,
what kind of work you do…

154
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,702
You think…

155
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,458
I would let someone like you
taint my family?

156
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,186
You being the head of this family,

157
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,730
I don't dispute that.

158
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:27,941
But know this.

159
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,655
I saved you,

160
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:36,325
just as I saved the others.

161
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,910
Not out of any goodwill,

162
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,787
but because of Sunja and Noa.

163
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,124
They are mine.

164
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:55,302
The sooner you understand this,

165
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,137
the easier it will be for you.

166
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,939
Mr. Koh Hansu.

167
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,357
Are you leaving already?

168
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:10,901
I left another package on the table.

169
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:15,155
You should know it will be the last.
It's too risky to keep giving it to him.

170
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:16,323
I understand.

171
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,534
I'll get him through this.

172
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,663
Do you want to see
the wasp nest we just found?

173
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:26,792
These wasps are so big!

174
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:28,752
Aren't they, Noa?

175
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:32,548
Brother! Where are you going?

176
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,675
I don't know what's gotten into Noa.

177
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,301
He hasn't been himself lately.

178
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,889
I wonder if it's
the thought of leaving, going back.

179
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:14,798
Enough!

180
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,342
Why are your hands so shaky?

181
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,180
I'll make sure to steady
my hands next time.

182
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,764
Sunja!

183
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:34,526
Are you okay?

184
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,195
I am fine.

185
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,171
I guess this is goodbye then.

186
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,549
I'll see you back in Osaka.

187
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,303
Might be nice to get back.

188
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:06,308
I've even started to miss my father,
though I'll just get sick of him again.

189
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,392
Noa!

190
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:10,729
I should go.

191
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,237
Let's go, Noa.

192
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,863
We need to leave.

193
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:25,494
Brother!

194
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:27,579
We almost forgot to take this!

195
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,918
Mama…

196
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:16,587
It's okay.

197
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,216
Is this the place?

198
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,018
They've got to be here.

199
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:42,070
Be careful.

200
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,616
Don't go too far.

201
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:48,744
Hey, slow down.

202
00:22:53,624 --> 00:22:55,042
How you kids holding up?

203
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,798
We must look like aliens to them.

204
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:06,136
You know what?
I bet these will look way better on you.

205
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:07,846
Catch?

206
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,224
Mozasu, let's go.

207
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:11,475
What is this?

208
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:12,851
No. They're yours.

209
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:18,857
See that?

210
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:20,484
You take care of them, you hear?

211
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:32,704
They're safe.

212
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:19,626
Noa! Mozasu!

213
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,128
Come eat!

214
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,922
Time to get up.

215
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,593
Mozasu!

216
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,263
What are you doing?

217
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:32,431
It's morning.

218
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,905
Take this upstairs.

219
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:49,489
He must be hungry.

220
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:04,630
Look at you.

221
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,549
Always the same.

222
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,094
Why are you always one step behind?

223
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:12,596
Grandmother,

224
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:14,932
what's there to rush off to?

225
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,016
Uncle.

226
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,228
I've brought your breakfast.

227
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:24,858
Please.

228
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:27,194
You're not to lift anything heavy.

229
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:40,791
Good morning.

230
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:48,549
You need to tell Mr. Koh Hansu
he's working you too hard.

231
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,717
His business is booming.

232
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:52,469
It is what it is.

233
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,354
You must be famished.

234
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:04,439
Please, do not bother.

235
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,235
I'm just going to get some sleep.

236
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,960
He says he's not hungry.

237
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:11,715
Where's Tom?

238
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:14,885
He'll be here.

239
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:22,976
<i>I am concerned.</i>

240
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,479
It's about Abe-<i>san</i>.

241
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,857
He's carrying too much debt.

242
00:27:29,775 --> 00:27:31,735
Especially to us.

243
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:37,241
I understand Andrew-<i>san</i>'s concerns.

244
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:40,369
But perhaps we should
approach this more rationally.

245
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:44,206
This all started from rumors.

246
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,125
If we distance ourselves
from Abe-<i>san</i> now,

247
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:50,712
it would worry or alarm
our other clients.

248
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,342
Also, I shouldn't have to remind us,

249
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:59,221
but here at Shiffley's,
we've made almost two billion yen

250
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:01,723
from our ten-year relationship
with Abe-<i>san</i>.

251
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:08,522
Shouldn't such a client be given the time
to overcome his financial difficulties?

252
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:11,400
This is different.

253
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:16,029
There will be no hotel,
not without Colton.

254
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:19,116
Then we'll find another partner.

255
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:20,659
Hyatt's been targeting Tokyo--

256
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,787
Hyatt's not going to touch this either.
The land has lost half its value.

257
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:25,247
It will rise again.

258
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,666
That's your professional opinion?

259
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,376
Your hunch?

260
00:28:31,003 --> 00:28:32,880
And what happens if they find the bones?

261
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:35,090
A priest will hold a memorial service

262
00:28:35,174 --> 00:28:37,176
and let the public know
that the right steps--

263
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:40,220
You really think that past
can be cleared away so easily?

264
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:41,430
Seriously?

265
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:43,015
Enough.

266
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:47,769
<i>So, I've been thinking.</i>

267
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:52,316
It's true that land is tainted,
but it's still worth something.

268
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:58,238
This bottomless appetite of yours,
will it ever be satisfied?

269
00:28:58,322 --> 00:28:59,406
Golf.

270
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,283
Golf?

271
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:04,494
An elite, members-only club.

272
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:09,499
400 billion gross. 300 billion net.

273
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:12,085
Minimal outlay.

274
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:14,671
A legitimate business.

275
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:16,673
Too good to be true.

276
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,259
I don't like it.

277
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:23,347
Even after Shiffley's
calls in that loan,

278
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:28,602
they still need to off-load
that land quickly.

279
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,983
We should bid on it.

280
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:37,402
I'm not getting into the golf business.

281
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:39,613
We know what is to come.

282
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:41,949
All we have to do is set it up.

283
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:47,829
Get the permits going,
presell memberships at 250 million a pop.

284
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,540
The payoff will be huge.

285
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,467
So…

286
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:04,555
Shiffley's won't call in the loan.

287
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:05,681
What? Why?

288
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,015
'Cause of your former colleague.

289
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:10,060
She made a convincing appeal
on behalf of Abe-<i>san</i>.

290
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:12,229
You have to fucking do something.

291
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:14,857
Yeah, I was just trying
to fucking do something, Solomon.

292
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,650
What do you think I was doing in there?

293
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:21,405
What does it matter? We got our money.

294
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:26,285
The point is to put the screws to Abe.

295
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:29,496
Then you have to convince her.

296
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,164
She's your girlfriend, isn't she?

297
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,125
Wow. What--

298
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,501
What's he talking about?

299
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,546
You didn't know?

300
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:44,970
I'm starting to come around
to this idea of yours.

301
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:49,474
At least the profit angle of it.

302
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,855
But your girlfriend
has to change her tune on Abe.

303
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:57,107
You think you can do that?

304
00:30:57,649 --> 00:30:59,568
Yes. I'll handle it.

305
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,320
Good.

306
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,323
Better you than me.

307
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,158
Don't you think?

308
00:31:39,066 --> 00:31:41,026
Sunja, look at this mess.

309
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,403
I had it all in order
before I left yesterday.

310
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,451
Good morning.

311
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:52,079
Goto-<i>san</i>! You are early today.

312
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:53,747
I sure am.

313
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,042
I wake up craving your noodles.

314
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,462
By the way, Bando-<i>san</i>,

315
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:02,548
are the rumors true?

316
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:06,134
You're planning on opening a restaurant?

317
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:12,099
Yes. I hear the Americans
will ease the restrictions soon.

318
00:32:12,182 --> 00:32:14,852
We've saved some money
to get us started.

319
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:18,063
But it's difficult to find a good space.

320
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:21,483
In that case, I know the perfect place.

321
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:22,985
Closer to the train station.

322
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,362
Won't that be too expensive?

323
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:28,031
The owner owes me a favor.

324
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,951
I'll put in a good word for you.

325
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:33,120
Are you serious?

326
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,832
You've always taken
such good care of my belly.

327
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:38,500
Let me do this for you.

328
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:40,794
Goto-<i>san</i>, you are so kind. Thank you.

329
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:43,755
And you, Noa.

330
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:45,424
Entrance exam is coming up soon.

331
00:32:46,341 --> 00:32:47,342
Next week.

332
00:32:47,426 --> 00:32:50,345
I still have so much to study
but I am doing my best.

333
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:51,722
Must be nice, Bando-<i>san</i>.

334
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:55,100
You'll be the envy of the market.

335
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:57,227
A son who is a college boy!

336
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:00,272
But, Goto-<i>san</i>, I need to get in first.

337
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:01,732
What are you talking about?

338
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:03,650
Of course you're getting in.

339
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:05,360
Look at your grandmother.

340
00:33:05,444 --> 00:33:07,696
If you don't,

341
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:09,489
she'll die of disappointment.

342
00:33:10,616 --> 00:33:13,493
I can't understand,
but I know it is trouble.

343
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:24,046
Noa, you'll be late.

344
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,173
Run along.

345
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:37,809
Please come again.

346
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,564
Is that Noa?

347
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,276
- Hello!
- Get over here.

348
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,487
I must get to work.

349
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,115
He really is a mother's joy, isn't he?

350
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,161
Everyone knows how hard you work.

351
00:33:56,245 --> 00:33:57,746
So come by for lunch.

352
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,873
I'll burst your stomach
with all the tofu you want.

353
00:33:59,957 --> 00:34:02,584
All your favorite toppings.

354
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:05,712
I don't get paid
till the end of the week.

355
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:08,841
What kind of talk is that?

356
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:11,969
You need to feed
that smart brain of yours to do well.

357
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:13,887
Just come.

358
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,348
We'll take care of you.

359
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,560
I'll try to get away if I can.

360
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:21,687
Thank you.

361
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:50,799
BABY SON BORN

362
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,135
NEED 100 YEN. SEND AT ONCE.

363
00:34:54,803 --> 00:34:56,096
MOTHER ILL. COME HOME NOW.

364
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:03,979
Did she tell you about us?

365
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:06,899
- No.
- Hey, I'm just a little--

366
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:09,860
little surprised.

367
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:13,071
'Cause the truth is that I f--

368
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:16,116
I fell pretty hard.

369
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:18,368
And…

370
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:20,829
I think she was--

371
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:25,042
I think she was just more
into the transgression of it all.

372
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:29,838
What with her parents being
who they are and all that shit.

373
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:34,718
So…

374
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:39,181
how are you going to get her to back off?

375
00:35:57,157 --> 00:36:00,202
How do you say, "I like you"?

376
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:02,913
I like you.

377
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:06,625
I like you.

378
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,507
I take it that's the quartermaster?

379
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,802
Looks like you don't have to
worry about him anymore.

380
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:18,679
So it seems.

381
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:25,060
Raise the lights.

382
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:33,610
How is he doing? Will he be ready?

383
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:37,197
I can't speak to how much he's learned,
but he barely sleeps.

384
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,202
He could've made it easier for himself.

385
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,538
He's the one who chose this way.

386
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:47,040
He feels the responsibility
of being the eldest son.

387
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:48,834
I think it speaks highly of him.

388
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:52,296
What's with you?

389
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:57,050
You've really become
a part of them, haven't you?

390
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,011
Isn't that what you wanted?

391
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,142
How much longer do I have to do this?

392
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:07,686
I've done more than enough.

393
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:11,315
I would like to move out.

394
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,734
I would've thought

395
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,654
you would have shed
those feelings by now.

396
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,118
Once he's settled at university,

397
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:27,247
you'll be free to leave that house.
Until then, you stay.

398
00:37:28,707 --> 00:37:29,791
What if

399
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,920
- he doesn't get in--
- That's not possible.

400
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:36,507
Because you're going to fix it.

401
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:48,560
I'll do anything for my son,

402
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:51,688
but not that.

403
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:57,903
I need to see for myself
what he is capable of.

404
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:01,782
So once he gets in…

405
00:38:03,158 --> 00:38:04,868
You'll be done with that family.

406
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,499
I understand.

407
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,626
One more thing.

408
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,383
This restaurant idea of Sunja's,

409
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,593
how serious is it?

410
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:24,429
They've been saving every scrap.

411
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:28,851
Noa's tuition is the priority, of course.
But her heart is set on it.

412
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:31,854
Perhaps you can allow her this.

413
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:37,025
You can go.

414
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:39,820
Don't forget to go see Ishida.

415
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,283
Let him know I am not pleased--

416
00:38:44,366 --> 00:38:45,951
I know what I need to do.

417
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:51,331
You no longer need to explain it to me.

418
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:29,661
Look at you.

419
00:39:30,996 --> 00:39:32,915
You can't even keep your eyes open.

420
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:43,300
I'm fine now.

421
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,846
You can't possibly cram
any more in that head.

422
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:50,015
Go to sleep.

423
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:51,892
I can't.

424
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:53,894
I have to study.

425
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:03,487
Noa.

426
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:16,834
As your mother…

427
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:20,587
I'm sorry.

428
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,803
What is there to be sorry about?

429
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,642
It's too much for you,

430
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:39,648
working all day at the telegraph office
and then coming home to study all night.

431
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:47,114
If only I could've made it
easier for you.

432
00:40:50,659 --> 00:40:52,160
Mother.

433
00:40:56,498 --> 00:40:58,292
Do not worry about me.

434
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,460
I must be really tired.

435
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:05,591
That money,

436
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:09,052
I know we could have accepted it,

437
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:13,056
from Mr. Koh Hansu.

438
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:18,645
But, Mother,

439
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:22,858
I didn't want to do it that way.

440
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:27,529
You understand, don't you?

441
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:34,286
I do.

442
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:39,958
Go rest.

443
00:41:40,542 --> 00:41:42,252
You don't need to worry about me.

444
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:44,505
I'm young.

445
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:47,216
This is nothing.

446
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:51,720
But don't stay up too late.

447
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:54,640
I won't.

448
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:28,048
You've come.

449
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:31,051
I'd like to buy some tofu
to bring home.

450
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:39,852
Is business good today?

451
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:43,188
No more than usual.

452
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:47,609
But time seems to pass so slowly.

453
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:49,862
Some days are like that.

454
00:42:50,904 --> 00:42:52,155
For me as well.

455
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,824
Really?

456
00:42:55,534 --> 00:42:57,286
You always seem so busy,

457
00:42:58,328 --> 00:43:00,914
especially with the exam coming.

458
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,417
Yes, the exam.

459
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,335
It's impossible to forget it.

460
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:09,131
It's exciting.

461
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,425
That's plenty.

462
00:43:11,508 --> 00:43:12,885
There's no need.

463
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:14,803
It's not much.

464
00:43:14,887 --> 00:43:17,639
And if it gives you any strength…

465
00:43:28,483 --> 00:43:29,610
Thank you.

466
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:42,039
Did you forget something?

467
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:45,584
What if…

468
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:47,753
I fail?

469
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:51,757
The exam, what if I don't pass?

470
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,510
If I don't get in?

471
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:57,763
They only take
one out of seven applicants.

472
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:00,432
Those odds don't work in my favor.

473
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:07,940
You are Baek Noa.

474
00:44:08,565 --> 00:44:10,067
That's not possible.

475
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:12,152
I don't believe it.

476
00:44:12,236 --> 00:44:14,029
You will not fail.

477
00:44:39,263 --> 00:44:40,764
What is this?

478
00:44:41,515 --> 00:44:44,518
Your father-in-law has
important guests in his room.

479
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:47,563
They arrived an hour ago.

480
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:01,368
Join us.

481
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:07,499
As you all know,

482
00:45:07,583 --> 00:45:09,418
this is my son-in-law.

483
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:15,382
I have the honor today of having
Kurogane-<i>kun</i> as our guest.

484
00:45:16,758 --> 00:45:19,136
I'm told he's a rising star
in the new party.

485
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:21,263
You should get to know him.

486
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,475
It's too early to call it
a political party,

487
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,896
but it seems promising.

488
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:32,482
It's only a matter of time.

489
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:36,111
With men like Kurogane-<i>kun</i>
leading the way,

490
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:39,698
the Liberal Party will be
a force to be reckoned with.

491
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:43,535
Just the political party
Japan needs now.

492
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,081
What is your party's goal?

493
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:51,960
To restore our nation's pride and glory.

494
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:53,962
What else is there?

495
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:57,799
The Americans will be leaving soon.

496
00:45:57,883 --> 00:46:01,553
Your top priority should be
the transition plan.

497
00:46:01,637 --> 00:46:03,764
Speaking of Americans,

498
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:07,434
I hear they are great friends of yours.

499
00:46:08,977 --> 00:46:10,979
We made money with them.

500
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:12,898
That is all.

501
00:46:14,107 --> 00:46:15,108
Right.

502
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:17,653
American whiskey,

503
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:19,863
American spark plugs.

504
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:24,993
I hear you even sell
American toothbrushes.

505
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:29,164
Apparently they sell well.

506
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:32,793
I admit

507
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:36,797
the Americans have their uses.

508
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:41,009
They're useful in rooting out
the Communists.

509
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,305
Though they're mostly Koreans.

510
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:51,103
The Koreans who refuse to leave
are troublesome for our country.

511
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:54,022
It's a good riddance that so many
went home after the war.

512
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:55,107
Tell me,

513
00:46:55,732 --> 00:46:57,150
what is this meeting about?

514
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,781
We are talking about
the resources needed

515
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:05,701
to support the rise of
Kurogane-<i>kun</i>'s political career,

516
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:08,453
so he may steer the country
back in the right direction.

517
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:13,792
I want to see our nation restored
to its former glory with my own eyes.

518
00:47:15,544 --> 00:47:18,463
That is my dream for my final years.

519
00:47:20,716 --> 00:47:21,800
I promise you.

520
00:47:21,884 --> 00:47:23,927
Unlimited support.

521
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:26,346
No questions asked.

522
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:36,959
You're home.

523
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:38,377
I am.

524
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,962
I didn't know you'd be here.

525
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:44,675
I wanted to surprise you
but I fell asleep.

526
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,885
You work too hard.

527
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:49,263
I know.

528
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:51,932
But it's worth it.

529
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:56,186
We need to get you to bed.

530
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,271
What?

531
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:18,709
I'm sorry I'm not so exciting.

532
00:49:19,918 --> 00:49:21,211
That's not true.

533
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:26,216
For me, this is the highlight of my day.

534
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:29,344
Is that true?

535
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:31,138
It is.

536
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:52,868
Stop eating, will you?

537
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:55,120
Noa, you need to get up.

538
00:49:56,788 --> 00:49:58,540
We're going to be late for the exam.

539
00:50:03,545 --> 00:50:04,546
Noa?

540
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:03,230
Minoru, wait for us outside.

541
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:10,988
We are ready to start the exam.

542
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:13,782
Wait for the minute hand
to reach the half-hour mark,

543
00:51:14,283 --> 00:51:17,703
then open your exam book to begin.

544
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,084
Begin now!

545
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:48,192
<i>On the morning of the 25th,</i>

546
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:51,528
<i>the North Korean military crossed
the border and shelled South Korea</i>

547
00:51:51,612 --> 00:51:56,283
<i>from 11 locations
along the 38th Parallel.</i>

548
00:51:56,366 --> 00:52:02,664
