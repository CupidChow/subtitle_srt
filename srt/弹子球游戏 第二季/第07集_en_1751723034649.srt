1
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,059
(My son Noah is going to study at Waseda University)

2
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,106
(Korean) I remember you when you were little
Always running around here

3
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:27,152
Your good father always follows you

4
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,330
I know a dock worker.

5
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,667
He sold everything just to buy a ticket here

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,379
He's probably holding a weapon and fighting those bastards right now.

7
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,422
If he makes it here,

8
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:52,052
I also heard that the road here has become more difficult.

9
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,400
Why are you like this on such a nice day?

10
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,443
So promising

11
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:10,904
Don't cry. His mother didn't cry.

12
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,891
Everyone is here for you.

13
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:41,935
It seems so

14
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,896
Touching

15
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:46,982
You'll get used to it

16
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,692
This is just the beginning

17
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,657
Give

18
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,586
This watch... is where it all started

19
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,383
Open it

20
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,188
The meal is ready

21
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,398
From now on it's yours.

22
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,859
Thank you

23
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,611
Come and sit down

24
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,988
Come eat with us

25
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,033
Walk

26
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:42,329
Shanci, don't stand, sit down.

27
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,920
Pass this to everyone

28
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:51,880
Give me some thanks

29
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:56,552
Eat slowly and wait for others.

30
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:58,345
Today I finally got to eat it first

31
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:06,562
This pork liver is very fresh. Try it.

32
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,334
Let's drink to our Noah.

33
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,344
Did you see that? This is my grandson.

34
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,305
He is going to Waseda

35
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,183
(Adapted from Lee Min-jin's novel)

36
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,953
(Japanese) Please calculate again

37
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,873
Especially in the case of over-allotment

38
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,458
We have counted several times.

39
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,544
Check again

40
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,172
Also check the annual report data

41
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,383
We have worked so hard for so long

42
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,594
I don't want to have to fix errors later.

43
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,638
Please return it by the end of today

44
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,562
Feel sorry

45
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,273
Sorry to bother you.

46
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,817
The director wants you to meet him in the conference room.

47
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,203
Excuse me

48
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,498
- You looking for me?
- Ms. Ishizaki, please take a seat.

49
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,800
We have an urgent matter to discuss.

50
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:25,969
Is this related to the IPO?

51
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,641
Mr. Tom, you explain it.

52
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,727
Some people allege that

53
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,355
You violated safety regulations

54
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,606
Specifically

55
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,401
Leaked confidential customer information about the initial public offering

56
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:46,156
Do you understand what I am saying?

57
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,455
I probably know

58
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,541
So you don't deny it?

59
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,838
I admit that my approach was unprofessional.

60
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,048
I should be more careful

61
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,177
But I assure you that no sensitive information has been disclosed.

62
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,138
There will be no adverse impact on the initial public offering

63
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,976
Our security department is investigating the matter.

64
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,396
Fortunately, we were informed of the situation early on.

65
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,106
Preventing further damage...

66
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,817
No further damage

67
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,779
Because Tom has assured the client

68
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,617
Have you talked to Jinyu?

69
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:35,581
I need to make sure they hear directly from us.

70
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,000
This is the right thing to do

71
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,002
despite this

72
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:43,046
It may still leave a bad impression.

73
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,426
As I said

74
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,428
It was my misjudgment.

75
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,180
It won't happen again

76
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,266
I will call the client immediately

77
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,310
Tell them everything is still on schedule...

78
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,438
You don't seem to understand the seriousness of the problem.

79
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:03,734
Your actions may put the company at serious risk

80
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,069
And your situation

81
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,989
You are one of the few women in management

82
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:11,366
Should have set a good example

83
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,414
I take this responsibility seriously.

84
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,585
But if you mean because I'm a woman

85
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,962
You must not make any mistakes throughout your career.

86
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,380
That's impossible

87
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,717
That's unfair too, isn't it?

88
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,722
Especially when others have a second chance

89
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,027
Please

90
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,072
Please give me the same chance

91
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:53,450
I'm afraid it's too late

92
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,661
We will accept your resignation

93
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,995
Effective immediately

94
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,206
What a shame

95
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,963
Pity for whom?

96
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,189
Done. I just got permission to call the loan.

97
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,482
Abe is now $30 million in debt

98
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,319
How long will it take for Shifley to submit a bid?

99
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,404
We can only wait and see how much resistance Mr. Abe has to loans

100
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,656
But after that, everything was ready.

101
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,283
If you can give us a good price

102
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,785
The auction is just a formality.

103
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,039
- Contact us when there is new information
- Yes

104
00:10:26,335 --> 00:10:28,795
Everything goes according to your plan

105
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,341
I must admit

106
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,970
I didn't expect you to have this ability.

107
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,016
It seems I was wrong.

108
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,567
Who is Isamu Yoshii?

109
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,028
Just some bastard who got lucky.

110
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,239
Helped the right people

111
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:59,284
If we lose those markets, our losses will be huge.

112
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,996
The loss will be huge

113
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,999
But only temporarily

114
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,336
on the contrary

115
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,632
I want you to consider a new subway line

116
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,056
Is the contract committed to us?

117
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,600
We have reached an agreement

118
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:29,022
This is a huge step for us

119
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,987
The rest is up to you

120
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,738
But you already understand

121
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,244
But

122
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,497
There is one condition

123
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:50,878
Mr. Black Iron

124
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,173
He wanted the ceremony to be secret.

125
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,552
He doesn't want to make a big splash

126
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,724
What does it mean to proceed in secret?

127
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:07,811
He hopes

128
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,940
You are not present

129
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,698
this

130
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,783
Unacceptable

131
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,787
I guess you have the same reaction.

132
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,586
But you've agreed

133
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:37,966
indeed

134
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,053
Because that's what needs to be done

135
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:02,658
Hit

136
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:04,451
that's all?

137
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:07,037
Just luck?

138
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,248
Didn't you just see it?

139
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,458
I calculated the time to move

140
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,419
Calculate the right amount of strength...

141
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,257
Do you really think the win was because of you?

142
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,384
This isn't winning.

143
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,511
What is that called?

144
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:25,764
Shall I go exchange the prize together?

145
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,266
I'll stay here.

146
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,207
Is it true?

147
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,209
Hey, take it

148
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:56,170
Give your brother some

149
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:33,225
Be careful to protect the roots

150
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,019
Look

151
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,688
There is life.

152
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,067
But will it survive this transplant?

153
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,612
I've never been good at growing plants.

154
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:50,117
You just need to take good care of them

155
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,413
Make sure there is plenty of sunlight and water

156
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,756
The place you mentioned...

157
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,300
Connecticut

158
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,885
Are there many trees there?

159
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,012
There are many

160
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,639
You won't believe it

161
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:15,475
And they are all very high

162
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,022
I also want to see America with my own eyes

163
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,775
That has always been my dream.

164
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,361
Why not go?

165
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:27,905
Mr. Kato

166
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:32,159
You always say that your time is running out.

167
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,704
It's not as hard to go now as it used to be

168
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,123
That is true.

169
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,669
But unfortunately it's still expensive

170
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,756
At least for me

171
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:50,427
Things are getting more expensive now.

172
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:54,932
It's hard to believe that everyone can make a living

173
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:58,685
But this is reality, right?

174
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,397
Everyone tells us to live longer.

175
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:07,402
But no one taught us how to afford longevity

176
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,869
to be honest

177
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm thinking of moving in with my daughter.

178
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,627
She is in Nagoya

179
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,672
Nagoya?

180
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,174
But that's so far

181
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,387
Now I'm a burden

182
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,647
I'll leave it to you from now on.

183
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,318
Responsibilities of taking care of the family

184
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:49,862
Stop saying that.

185
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:53,198
You said it as if it were you
Disappearing or something?

186
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:56,660
I won't disappear

187
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,455
Tokyo is a hundred times bigger than here

188
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,832
Wait

189
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,419
Next time you go home you'll find

190
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:08,338
Everything here is too small for you

191
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:10,132
Listen to your words

192
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,509
Suddenly I became so wise

193
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:16,555
Then let me ask you, what about yourself?

194
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:18,724
What are you going to do without me?

195
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:21,852
Don't worry about me

196
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,149
I have my own plans

197
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,736
I…

198
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,987
I'm going to the United States

199
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:35,574
I'm serious

200
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,202
When I don't have to study anymore, I will go far away.

201
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,247
What's good about America?

202
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,292
Big Car

203
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:47,628
Big House

204
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,840
There is no need to smell the stench of your neighbor's garbage.

205
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,346
There are also endless sweets

206
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,097
So just for that?

207
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:03,560
Would you want to travel to the other side of the world just to eat delicious food?

208
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:07,648
No

209
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:12,778
In America, people don't look at me the same way as people here

210
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,781
This is why I want to go

211
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,915
He has lived alone for the past few years.

212
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,875
Rarely see family

213
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,545
His financial situation...

214
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:30,963
How much savings does he have?

215
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:34,341
As you suspected, there are no real assets

216
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,927
He worked in a printing company for 30 years and has retired.

217
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,470
He now lives on his pension.

218
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,973
Still carrying a mortgage of 27 million yen

219
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,851
He lives frugally

220
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,728
But in the past few weeks

221
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,398
He often takes my mother out for dinner

222
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,986
I think he wants to pursue her.

223
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:59,324
The question then is what is his purpose?

224
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,370
But there is one thing that puzzles me

225
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:07,124
He had fought in the war

226
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:09,543
His generation was drafted.

227
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,545
Yes, but...

228
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,257
Few people go to trial.

229
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,151
This is a loan

230
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,986
Please think this way

231
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:37,946
What's this?

232
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,783
It's not my son's money.

233
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:45,662
The money I saved from selling the restaurant

234
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:51,126
But why would you give it to me?

235
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:55,339
Because your days are numbered

236
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,092
We both are

237
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,638
I can't accept this

238
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:05,015
I don't need

239
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:21,240
Then maybe we can go together

240
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,286
What do you think?

241
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,830
Would you consider it?

242
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:34,294
I really want to see America with you

243
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,299
God is above

244
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:42,386
We appreciate the food you provided us tonight.

245
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:46,807
And all the other blessings you have bestowed upon us

246
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:51,770
You feed us and keep us safe

247
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,315
I know it's selfish to make further requests

248
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:58,986
But we are preparing for Noah's departure

249
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:03,532
I hope you keep him safe.

250
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:08,662
In that big city where many souls are lost

251
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:15,502
Please guide him so he doesn't get lost.

252
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:18,297
He is a good kid

253
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,966
This is all because of your grace Lord

254
00:22:21,592 --> 00:22:24,678
I am very grateful for this

255
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,348
In the name of the Son we pray

256
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:29,474
Amen

257
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,227
Really beautiful

258
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,479
Well said

259
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:39,443
Brother, do you think there is such delicious food in Waseda?

260
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:46,366
Find a church there and they will help you

261
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:48,619
yes

262
00:22:58,462 --> 00:22:59,922
Joseph

263
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,883
I didn't think you could eat.

264
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,179
My eldest nephew's last night before leaving

265
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,765
Why didn't you invite me?

266
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:12,309
Don’t I get any respect at all in this family?

267
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:16,230
sorry

268
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,639
that's all?

269
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:53,475
Is this how you send him off?

270
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:00,399
Believe me, it's a feast for me.

271
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:17,207
Have you tried this?

272
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:20,669
How can anyone eat this?

273
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,797
You always put too much salt

274
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:24,882
sorry

275
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:28,468
- I'll make you something else...
- No

276
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:29,887
It's the same if you do it

277
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,818
How long are you going to continue like this?

278
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,156
What?

279
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:53,118
Why are you so rude?

280
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:58,207
Is this the result of me neglecting my family for so many years?

281
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:00,667
Listen carefully

282
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,298
If you had studied well with your brother, you wouldn't be like this now.

283
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,424
uncle

284
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:13,138
I know I'm not as good as him

285
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,935
I will never be as smart, kind, or generous as he is.

286
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:19,770
He works so hard, this is what he deserves

287
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,104
I know

288
00:25:22,314 --> 00:25:24,483
But my aunt also worked hard...

289
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,567
Moses, stop talking.

290
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:27,236
Did she do something wrong?

291
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,446
What did we do wrong?

292
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,283
You're not like this because of us.

293
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,576
Moses

294
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,507
He is right

295
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:52,803
Noah

296
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,556
What's wrong?

297
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:58,684
Moses help me

298
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:00,185
What are you doing

299
00:26:00,269 --> 00:26:01,728
We want to help you get out of the house

300
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,605
stop

301
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:05,899
Stop it!

302
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:07,985
- Don't touch me
- Noah

303
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:11,363
Uncle, just do it for me this time.

304
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,157
no

305
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:28,672
Leave him alone

306
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,549
He's not ready yet

307
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:31,675
Then when will it be good?

308
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,179
He hasn't left the house for five years.

309
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,640
How long will we have to live like this?

310
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:39,808
Okay, stop talking.

311
00:26:55,991 --> 00:26:57,075
I'll come

312
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,134
I can do it

313
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:17,930
careful

314
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:56,510
I can't do it

315
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:03,225
sorry

316
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:04,893
But uncle

317
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:06,895
Haven't you been through worse?

318
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:09,439
Joseph

319
00:28:09,523 --> 00:28:10,774
Jingxi

320
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,276
Let him try it.

321
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,009
What is this for?

322
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:39,011
We'll be there soon

323
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,749
Batsman in Position

324
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,961
It's that little one again.

325
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,476
nice shot

326
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,896
This time I'm going to swing the bat.

327
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:41,949
Two strikes

328
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:01,343
Hit

329
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,184
Run!

330
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:12,646
Run fast...

331
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,067
hurry up

332
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:19,570
- Keep going.
- Baseball

333
00:30:25,951 --> 00:30:26,952
Run

334
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:28,912
Be quick

335
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:34,835
- Safety
- Home Run

336
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,256
How did you get this watch back?

337
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,925
pawnshop

338
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,344
I told you

339
00:31:25,427 --> 00:31:27,054
I always knew where you were

340
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:29,765
But why put such a heavy burden on him?

341
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:32,559
Kindness

342
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,938
That watch saved you and it saved me

343
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:38,607
Now it belongs to Noah.

344
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:46,198
You don't have to worry about him anymore.

345
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:49,368
He will thrive, you wait and see.

346
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:55,249
Now

347
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,210
My daughter is the one I need to worry about.

348
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,424
She's marrying a man who despises me

349
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:07,386
That person is Japanese

350
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:16,311
So he despises you?

351
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:19,565
It should be

352
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:23,902
Who can tell the truth about this kind of thing?

353
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:30,284
What is not said may be more important than what is said.
Contains more truth

354
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:36,748
Will he treat her well?

355
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:39,418
I have no idea

356
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,761
You also said

357
00:32:51,722 --> 00:32:53,056
marriage

358
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:58,020
It's just for face.

359
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:01,899
It seems so to you

360
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:05,152
Do you think so?

361
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:13,410
You shouldn't ask me this.

362
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:17,456
I should go in.

363
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:18,957
The kids will be back soon.

364
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:21,835
Kindness

365
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:26,673
do you remember?

366
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:31,178
Those days in the laundry bay

367
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:36,099
How happy we were then

368
00:33:37,768 --> 00:33:39,937
But we were so naive that we didn't understand

369
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,358
But now my heart is slowly decaying

370
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:49,821
The longer I dwell in these shadows

371
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:54,117
The more serious the corruption

372
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:58,539
I can feel it

373
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:03,544
How can I do this?

374
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,263
The slowly decaying part of you...

375
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,684
You have to cut it off

376
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:35,284
Kindness

377
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:45,585
Thank you

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:13,739
(Palawan Prisoner of War Massacre)

380
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:16,700
Why did you do that?

381
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:20,162
Because he is poor?

382
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:22,456
Because we have money

383
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:25,792
I'm sorry it turned out this way.

384
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,671
But wouldn’t it be better to know the truth?

385
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:35,135
What do you think the truth is?

386
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:43,936
His troops massacred 139 American prisoners of war

387
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:45,979
How can you accept this?

388
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,940
Did I say I accepted it?

389
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:53,946
How long did you and Etsuko date?

390
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:59,826
Solomon now has a Japanese girlfriend

391
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:04,706
Why can you two?

392
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:08,043
But I just made a friend...

393
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:10,087
friend?

394
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,506
To friends

395
00:36:17,094 --> 00:36:18,554
Because I'm lonely

396
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:26,186
Too many people I've loved

397
00:36:27,104 --> 00:36:28,605
No longer there

398
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:43,495
Do you understand why you have to listen to the teacher?

399
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:46,540
Come back if you want to eat my cooking

400
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:48,876
I will

401
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:56,258
Okay

402
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:59,386
If mom doesn't leave now, she will miss the train.

403
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:08,645
Can you write home more often?

404
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,564
Otherwise we will be worried

405
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:11,648
I will

406
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,317
I promise

407
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:17,487
You heard what mom said.

408
00:37:17,571 --> 00:37:18,864
Let's go!

409
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,283
We've said goodbye.

410
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:21,635
elder brother

411
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:30,894
Don't go

412
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:33,689
I can't live without you

413
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:38,694
You said you were going to America.

414
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:42,573
You also have your own dreams

415
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:46,702
Fight for your dreams

416
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:48,412
Did you hear that?

417
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:51,164
You just need to do this

418
00:38:57,004 --> 00:38:58,755
Moses looks forward

419
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,260
Always look forward

420
00:40:09,034 --> 00:40:10,661
(Tokyo)

421
00:40:56,373 --> 00:40:57,708
Next

422
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:02,337
- Name?
- Nobuo Bando

423
00:41:08,218 --> 00:41:09,845
Oh, it's you.

424
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:13,432
Hey bring that special post over here

425
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:14,725
Yes Sir

426
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:23,859
Noah, what is this?

427
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:26,069
I don't know either

428
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,075
(Sandoh Nobuo)

429
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:35,245
The one delivered this morning was delivered by a special car.

430
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:36,955
Everyone was surprised

431
00:41:59,478 --> 00:42:01,146
Are you looking for me?

432
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,524
How long have you been hanging around with those idiots?

433
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,985
I assure you they are good people.

434
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:11,114
What did those good people say?

435
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:14,701
We are at a disadvantage in this war

436
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:15,911
"us"?

437
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:18,956
North Korean Army

438
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:27,756
I think…

439
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:30,634
Join the fight

440
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,721
Why would you want to do something so stupid?

441
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:36,306
That's our country

442
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:39,393
They are our compatriots

443
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:42,437
South Korea too

444
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:46,692
A person just happens to be born on one side.

445
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:49,361
There is no God's will

446
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:51,780
I miss my hometown.

447
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:54,867
People like us

448
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,619
There is no hometown

449
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:06,128
Have you made up your mind?

450
00:43:06,712 --> 00:43:07,713
Yes

451
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:16,847
You need to do one last job for me.

452
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,893
Then do whatever you want.

453
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:22,477
who?

454
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:25,689
This time it's not that kind of life

455
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:31,195
You have to help me make a friend this time

456
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:46,251
You should go back and rest.

457
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:49,880
- Mother
- This makes me feel more at ease

458
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,715
don’t worry

459
00:43:52,758 --> 00:43:54,134
I will find the way

460
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:06,438
Noah, your grandpa...

461
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:11,318
He always said he wanted to see me fly

462
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,614
Fly high

463
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:20,744
That way I can see how big this world is.

464
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:29,586
Now it's your turn, Noah.

465
00:44:31,213 --> 00:44:32,756
You must fly high

466
00:44:38,762 --> 00:44:40,931
But can you promise me one thing?

467
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,852
Sometimes I remember...

468
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:49,731
Come back and talk to me

469
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:54,236
I want to know too

470
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:59,491
How big is the world?

471
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:08,542
I will

472
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,417
You packed your bags

473
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:34,336
Are you planning on going anywhere?

474
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,421
Yes

475
00:46:36,505 --> 00:46:39,800
I want to join the fight on the North Korean side

476
00:46:41,677 --> 00:46:43,011
Why?

477
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:46,640
You are not North Korean.

478
00:46:46,723 --> 00:46:49,643
I can't just stay here and do nothing.

479
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:51,979
You mean like me?

480
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,274
You have a family and they need you.

481
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:03,282
I just wanted to say thank you.

482
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,201
Thank you for letting me into this home.

483
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:10,706
You should thank her

484
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:14,459
That's not my decision.

485
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:15,961
But you allowed me to do this

486
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:17,045
Yeah?

487
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:19,715
Do I have any other options?

488
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:34,146
This thing you want to do

489
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:37,232
I don't understand

490
00:47:38,942 --> 00:47:40,152
But to be honest

491
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:45,073
I respect this choice

492
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:50,621
Maybe

493
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:01,632
This is why she loves you

494
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:09,097
I saw how you guys got along.

495
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:12,351
The way she looks at you

496
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,188
No matter how I pray

497
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:20,150
She won't look at me like that.

498
00:48:22,653 --> 00:48:25,072
I never meant to interfere with you.

499
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:26,365
But you did intervene

500
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:35,415
I'm sorry

501
00:48:47,135 --> 00:48:48,720
I hope you stay

502
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:55,143
Because if you leave

503
00:48:56,812 --> 00:48:57,980
She will collapse

504
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:02,776
She's stronger than you think.

505
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,778
I don't need that kind of strength

506
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:09,366
I don't need a martyr for love

507
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:12,619
I don't want to be her prison.

508
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:14,288
she…

509
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,166
She deserves more

510
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:21,253
More than I could give her.

511
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:24,298
She deserved better from the beginning.

512
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:30,053
so

513
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,190
Tell her

514
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:46,195
She is free

515
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:48,197
Did you hear that?

516
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:53,160
I won't be a wall that holds her back.

517
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:56,914
I can't do this

518
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:04,922
Can't do it this way

519
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:06,924
When you are in this situation

520
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:50,300
Mr. Jin

521
00:50:53,136 --> 00:50:54,388
Joseph knew

522
00:50:56,723 --> 00:50:57,933
You don't need to worry

523
00:50:59,017 --> 00:51:00,602
He has accepted

524
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,271
He said

525
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:04,481
He will set you free

526
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:09,653
Jingxi

527
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:18,287
Say something, Jingxi

528
00:51:19,371 --> 00:51:21,790
So you two have decided my future?

529
00:51:23,083 --> 00:51:24,334
is that so?

530
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:28,130
No

531
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:30,132
That's negotiation?

532
00:51:30,924 --> 00:51:32,551
No, of course not.

533
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:34,928
You know how I feel about you

534
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,099
I haven't changed since that night on the farm

535
00:51:39,892 --> 00:51:42,269
I just always felt that we couldn't

536
00:51:50,485 --> 00:51:51,653
Jingxi?

537
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:55,574
That night

538
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,368
I broke my oath

539
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:00,704
A few hours later

540
00:52:02,372 --> 00:52:04,499
My husband almost died.

541
00:52:05,751 --> 00:52:07,586
You wouldn't think it's because we...

542
00:52:07,669 --> 00:52:10,005
I know it's irrational to think this way

543
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:16,345
I accepted it early on.
I have no weight in this world

544
00:52:17,387 --> 00:52:19,056
But when I learned about the explosion

545
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:21,099
I stayed up all night praying

546
00:52:21,183 --> 00:52:23,519
Pray to God to save his life

547
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:25,896
I made a contract

548
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:33,403
My husband finally came back

549
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,995
But I love you

550
00:52:43,872 --> 00:52:45,666
I know you love me too

551
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:49,878
That Love

552
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:52,965
It scares me

553
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:00,138
There you go

554
00:53:03,475 --> 00:53:06,186
Fight and you will survive.

555
00:53:07,938 --> 00:53:08,939
You must survive

556
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:16,321
Because I live in a world without you

557
00:53:16,405 --> 00:53:17,990
I can't bear it

558
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:29,376
Please come back to us when you are finished

559
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:35,674
Bring your wife and lovely children

560
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,177
You will do it, right?

561
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,185
Don't do this

562
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:13,003
Down with America

563
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:18,717
They promised to learn our culture and traditions

564
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:23,347
But it makes us become pawns of their imperialist aggression.

565
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:26,433
Their evil plans have infiltrated our campus.

566
00:54:27,017 --> 00:54:30,938
It's time to stand up and resist

567
00:54:31,021 --> 00:54:32,439
tell me

568
00:54:32,523 --> 00:54:35,859
Are you brave enough to join us?

569
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:39,112
Ask them to end their heinous crimes

570
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:42,115
Will you stand up with us?

571
00:54:43,325 --> 00:54:45,244
Then join our resistance

572
00:55:04,096 --> 00:55:06,098
Why do you want to see me?

573
00:55:09,309 --> 00:55:10,602
Who are you?

574
00:55:10,686 --> 00:55:12,104
Please forgive me for giving you a reminder

575
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:14,106
I am Yoshii Isamu

576
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:19,361
I'm here to thank you for your help with the market.

577
00:55:20,237 --> 00:55:21,572
How did you get in?

578
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:23,323
I came in through the entrance

579
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:26,910
Where is the Han River?

580
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:29,413
Where is he?

581
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:32,624
He is watching us

582
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:29,449
