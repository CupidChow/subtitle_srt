1
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,768
- (Japanese) Cheers
- cheers

2
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,651
This wine is strong.

3
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,613
But it tastes good, right?

4
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,491
Margaritas?

5
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:33,575
Yes

6
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,544
Eat it with corn chips

7
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,763
- tasty
- Yes, it's delicious.

8
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,312
Hello

9
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,939
Long time no see

10
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,112
(Korean) I'll give it to you.

11
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,614
Why does it take so long?

12
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,993
The food is almost gone.

13
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,412
Thank you for your visit

14
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,998
Grandma, please give me a cinnamon

15
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,165
Come

16
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,175
Chinese buckwheat noodles

17
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,140
This is salsa

18
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,350
- Salsa
- Salsa

19
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,190
Thanks

20
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:50,569
Did you see it?

21
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:55,574
I don't even need to move a finger

22
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,639
I'll do it

23
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:30,484
It feels so strange

24
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,029
And the body is hot

25
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,158
Maybe I shouldn't have had that second margarita.

26
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,118
We might be a little drunk.

27
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,372
How can you say that?

28
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:51,755
You also treated us to dinner that day

29
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,174
I invite you today.

30
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,136
Your next adventure is up to you

31
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,143
- How much?
- 3326 yen

32
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,777
- Do you accept credit cards?
- yes

33
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:19,032
Can you give me a receipt?

34
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,246
The wait is so painful

35
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,334
But I don't know if I want tomorrow to come soon

36
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,752
Or never come

37
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,547
Don't talk nonsense

38
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:35,883
He passed the exam

39
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,677
Noah is going to study at Waseda University

40
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,470
But how can you be so sure?

41
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,598
Even someone like me who knows nothing knows

42
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,766
That child studies so hard...

43
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,435
Stop talking

44
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,062
What's the point of worrying about these?

45
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,858
Why keep talking when we can't do anything?

46
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,531
We'll know the result tomorrow.

47
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,327
We can't control anything.

48
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:12,127
Chinese buckwheat noodles are affordable and welcome to visit us

49
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:17,716
Chinese buckwheat noodles at affordable prices, welcome to patronize

50
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:19,134
Delicious noodles

51
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,263
They just want us to work hard.

52
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,556
That's right

53
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:32,606
We paid with sweat and blood
To build their failed empire

54
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,278
Even so they still demolished our school

55
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:41,448
Force us to register on the government register

56
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,576
We are isolated and helpless

57
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,869
you're right

58
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,705
Shameless

59
00:04:52,251 --> 00:04:56,505
We have to fight for our existence

60
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:02,010
Maybe their war is over.
But our war continues
Maybe their war is over.
But our war continues

61
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:08,350
Not only here, but also in our home country

62
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:12,563
The corrupt capitalist class there
Our country is divided

63
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:17,276
- Yes.
- See what happened in Jeju Island

64
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,945
Jeju…

65
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,155
We have the right to be angry

66
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,782
That's right

67
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:28,620
How can we not be angry when an entire village is massacred?

68
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,707
Our children were killed

69
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:38,380
Our ancestors died at the hands of their own countrymen.

70
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,096
However, we should not blame our fellow North Koreans.

71
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,642
They were poisoned by the evil Americans.

72
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:53,520
Those who claim to have liberated us

73
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,814
That's right

74
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,233
It's time to stand up and resist

75
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,111
- We must resist
- For the Motherland
- We must resist
- For the Motherland

76
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,239
We must stand up and resist

77
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,034
For our fellow Koreans

78
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,620
North Koreans must save themselves

79
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,997
For a country

80
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,501
Let's shout together

81
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:20,797
- Long live North Korea...
- Long live North Korea...

82
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,217
- Long Live North Korea
- Long live North Korea

83
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,854
(Adapted from Lee Min-jin's novel)

84
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,397
Mr. Jin, please listen to me...

85
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,482
It's you

86
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,987
You also know my wife's condition. She is still ill.

87
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,657
I don't know what else to do

88
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,368
Please

89
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,177
(Philopon)

90
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,762
- Hey
- Yes, sir.

91
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,764
Send this to the back.

92
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:18,267
Count them to make sure they are all there.

93
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,351
Yes Sir

94
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,320
Sit down

95
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,322
If there is nothing else, I will go to bed first.

96
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,615
I asked you to sit down

97
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,296
This is the last point.

98
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,049
I think you must have other business.

99
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,343
I'm not worried about you

100
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,638
What do you think will happen after the Americans withdraw?

101
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,473
There will be fewer prostitutes on the streets

102
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,560
There will never be a shortage of prostitutes on the streets
There will never be a shortage of prostitutes on the streets

103
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,396
But anyway

104
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,858
This country has no choice but to stand on its own feet.

105
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,444
Why should I care what this country does?

106
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,112
Don't say such stupid things.

107
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,031
You also know

108
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,450
What is sunset?

109
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,536
Maybe everything will return to the pre-war era.

110
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,079
It wasn't much better then.

111
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,750
Never go back to that time

112
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,463
But this is an opportunity for us

113
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,052
The black market is ours and I have my own plans

114
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:37,346
I've made plans for you too.

115
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:41,517
You won't always be my deputy.

116
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,479
I understand

117
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,483
- Yuki
- I don't need it

118
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,401
You are not a saint

119
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,741
Take good care of him

120
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,744
Help him forget his troubles
Help him forget his troubles

121
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,672
Mr. Sugihara

122
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,883
I'm sorry to bother you.

123
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:43,096
Mr. Yoshii asked me to bring you a message.

124
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,359
What is it?

125
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,947
Mr. Yoshii apologizes to you

126
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,996
But he thinks it's better for you to know your situation

127
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:10,707
This is his idea

128
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,167
My situation?

129
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:27,683
His name is Kunisaki Tsuyoshi

130
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,019
He is the eldest son of the Kunisaki family.

131
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,234
so…

132
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,821
Is it your ex-boyfriend?

133
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:44,783
No, this photo was taken a few days ago.

134
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,287
That's right

135
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:51,999
Mr. Yoshii guess you don't know

136
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:56,795
I suggest you ask her what her plans are for tonight.

137
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,088
Mr. Yoshii told me

138
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:02,217
He has severed ties with his grandfather's world.
He has severed ties with his grandfather's world.

139
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:07,306
Do you think only gangsters resort to such dirty tricks?

140
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:11,810
Taking advantage of others’ misconduct
It is also common practice in your industry to use it as a weight.

141
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,481
Human nature is like this

142
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,445
Who are you?

143
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:35,792
My Korean is not as good as yours

144
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,796
In fact, I just reluctantly say

145
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,466
Are you a Korean living in Japan?

146
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,761
Just like your family

147
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,890
My grandfather's generation came to Japan before the war.

148
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,351
but

149
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,271
This is probably the only thing we have in common.

150
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,567
listen to me
listen to me

151
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,696
Mr. Yoshii and I have known each other for many years.

152
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,575
He is not a fickle person or a gambler.

153
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:12,663
He also doesn't like confusion or uncertainty.

154
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:17,209
Once he gets suspicious, he'll get rid of you.

155
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:21,797
If he feels threatened

156
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,676
The consequences will be more serious.

157
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,390
Mr. Yoshii wants that golf course

158
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:51,326
Miyazaki Tsutomu was arrested last week

159
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,329
He brutally murdered four young women

160
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:56,874
Cut off the head of one of them

161
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,751
- Hello?
- It's me

162
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:03,046
Just want to hear your voice

163
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,882
I miss you

164
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,258
I miss you as well

165
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:10,429
But this time the publishing process took much longer than expected.

166
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:12,139
You need a break

167
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,850
How about having a simple dinner together tonight?

168
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:21,231
I'd like to, but I want to wait until the documents are printed.

169
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,443
How about this weekend?

170
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,028
See you then.

171
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,156
I have to keep working.

172
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,491
I'll call you back later.

173
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,207
(Urgent)

174
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,917
(CCI International Bank)

175
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:55,724
(Payment of late payment penalty)

176
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,019
Moses

177
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:02,773
I brought you takeaway from your favorite noodle shop
I brought you takeaway from your favorite noodle shop

178
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:04,608
Aren't you hungry? Eat it.

179
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:10,446
I'm not hungry after today's lunch

180
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,366
I think I could go without eating for a few days.

181
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,243
What did you have for lunch?

182
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:18,579
I went to a Mexican restaurant with a friend.

183
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:21,208
Mexican restaurant? You?

184
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,876
Right, I

185
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:25,712
Is it necessary to be so surprised?

186
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,089
Which friend is it?

187
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,679
Friends who feed birds with me

188
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,347
You won't understand

189
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:37,099
bird?

190
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:41,979
What are you talking about? Are you socializing with people?

191
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,940
I met him at the grocery store.

192
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,943
He is a very nice person

193
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:52,322
But you really should try that Mexican restaurant

194
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,199
The food there is very spicy

195
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:57,369
And that margarita...

196
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:59,621
It's really intense

197
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,040
I'm going to clean up the back.

198
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:14,428
You can come in from here...

199
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,223
Don't push others

200
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,476
Queue up well

201
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,482
What about the child?

202
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:29,401
He should be here now.

203
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:32,821
Didn't you say there was nothing we could do but wait?

204
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,745
He will be here soon.

(Freshman Course)

210
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,787
I'm so proud of you

211
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,164
This is the course list for first-year students

212
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,666
What am I nervous about?

213
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,339
European and American history, Romanticism

214
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:17,467
- Government Bond Theory
- Uh, that sounds torture.

215
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:19,428
Are you sure you want to read?

216
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,764
Stop talking, eat now

217
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:25,559
You can't say anything good with that mouth of yours.

218
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,812
Maybe I should run away to Tokyo with you.

219
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:33,317
Even your boring classes are better than
It's better to stay here and be tortured

220
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,444
What did you say?

221
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,572
What happened to Noah?

222
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,284
Here is a list of other expenses

223
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:45,120
Which ones?

224
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,372
Admission Fee

225
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:50,501
Books, Student Activities

226
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,629
Internship, equipment costs...

227
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,422
What is the total amount?

228
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,926
About 2,400 yen

229
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,848
Do you mean excluding tuition and accommodation fees?

230
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,978
What should we do?

231
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,775
Maybe we can ask Mr. Gao for help

232
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:18,320
No, I don't want to owe anyone money.

233
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,741
Noah, we will all pay it back.

234
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:26,036
There must be a telegraph office near the school.

235
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,121
I can find a job

236
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,206
No

237
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:32,668
I see how hard you've worked these past two years.

238
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:34,545
You must devote yourself to your studies

239
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:38,173
- But the mother's expenses...
- We will find a way to pay for it.

240
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,968
I won't borrow money from Mr. Gao.

241
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,344
Is there any way?

242
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,972
You don't have to worry about that.

243
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:48,350
Eat now. The food is getting cold.

244
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,271
Yes, eat it.

245
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,314
Come eat some of this

Good evening

248
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,726
I'm not sure if I'm in the right place

249
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,812
May I ask your name, sir?

250

252
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:03,253
What are you doing

253

Mother

254
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:11,970
What's going on?

255
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:16,808
I remember I still have some candy left from the ones I bought a few months ago.

256
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:20,395
Should be enough to make some candy.

257
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:24,274
If it sells well I can get some more candy

258
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:30,364
We can open a second stall near the bus station

259
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:34,117
Many young people and families take that line

260
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:42,459
What about your restaurant?

261
00:25:50,008 --> 00:25:51,385
Wait a few more years

262
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,762
Wait for Noah to graduate

263
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:57,724
We'll see when the time comes.

264
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:12,447
Mother

265
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:14,283
You go to sleep, I'll be here

266
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:17,286
Do you think I can sleep?

267
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:23,417
Give it to me quickly

268
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:42,436
I swear if I knew you didn't know this

269
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:44,813
Then I won't do that.

270
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:48,775
But we heard that you and your family
We are withdrawing from the black market business.

271
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:50,903
Who told you that?

272
00:26:51,612 --> 00:26:53,113
Everyone says so

273
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,286

What’s your name?
What’s your name?

275
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,337
Are you afraid of him?

276
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,381
I've heard some rumors

277
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:14,301
Please, I don't want to get involved.

279
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,312
I swear I only know this much

280
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:36,114
Find out everything about this person

281
00:27:36,615 --> 00:27:39,993
I want to know all the information

282
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:07,437
How long have you been dating him?

283
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:09,398
It's not like that

284
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,692
What is that?

285
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,488
Our two families are old friends.

286
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:20,242
Since we were little

287
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:23,787
Our parents firmly believed that we were a match made in heaven.

288
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,331
Does he think so too?

289
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,711
He thinks what his parents think.

290
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,716
What about you?

291
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:41,305
I once tried to convince myself

292
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,851
But that's in the past

293
00:28:47,227 --> 00:28:48,854
But you...

294
00:28:50,022 --> 00:28:51,523
No resistance

295
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:53,817
They are my parents after all.

296
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:55,444
What can I do?

297
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:59,740
I know what I should tell you

298
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,327
You should tell me

299
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:13,212
Is there no room for redemption?

300
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:20,469
Can you promise me that you won't betray me again?

301
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:22,471
Never

302
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,974
Can you do it?

303
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:29,311
I want to work hard

304
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:34,149
This is not enough

305
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:41,865
In another world, maybe.

306
00:29:43,116 --> 00:29:46,203
Or in a place where you are not you

307
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,665
I am not my world

308
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,752
Isn’t it?

309
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:15,858
I need you

310
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:22,030
Calling on Mr. Abe for his loan

311
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:24,867
Mr. Abe?

312
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,827
Why?

313
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,501
No

314
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:37,629
You were the one who leaked the news about the burial?

315
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:39,548
I didn't mean to involve you.

316
00:30:40,716 --> 00:30:41,717
You must believe me

317
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:45,554
But now it’s not only about money

318
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:47,306
I need him to know

319
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:48,891
no

320
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:52,853
I need everyone to know I'm here

321
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:54,271
Even if you say so...

322
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:55,898
I have to ask please

323
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:57,524
You can't ask me to do this

324
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,113
Even if this can destroy Mr. Abe
But what I did to him will get out.
Even if this can destroy Mr. Abe
But what I did to him will get out.

325
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:04,865
The whole industry will know

326
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,450
Sorry I can't do that.

327
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,535
You understand this

328
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:17,127
I'll find a way, you know I will.

329
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:24,718
And I have no choice but to stop you

330
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:41,795
Do you want to see me?

331
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:02,107
Take this away

332
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,117
What does the new doctor say?

333
00:33:13,285 --> 00:33:14,912
I don't care about that anymore

334
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:26,798
We have been honest with each other, right?

335
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:35,182
You taught me the power of speaking your mind.

336
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:38,310
I am grateful for this

337
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,896
Yes

338
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:45,275
Everyone has a lot of opinions these days

339
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:49,029
chatter

340
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:52,866
But the Americans will leave soon.

341
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:56,703
Then it's your turn as a rising star.

342
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:59,289
Mr. Black Iron

343
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:02,668
You made it clear that you don't like him.
You made it clear that you don't like him.

344
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:06,046
But he knew what needed to be done

345
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:10,801
He is still young but has a bright future ahead of him.

346
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:12,636
He is ambitious

347
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:18,308
I think you are confusing the two.

348
00:34:20,018 --> 00:34:21,770
The party is still in its infancy

349
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:25,482
Someone will change their position

350
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:26,483
Exactly

351
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:30,237
So it should be more...

352
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:36,577
My plan is to rely on marriage

353
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:45,085
Even you expressed your loyalty through marriage.

354
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,924
He is willing to accept Sachiko even though she is only half Japanese

355
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:55,637
It shows his belief in our family.

356
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,054
I do not agree

357
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:59,141
She is my daughter

358
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:06,148
Now I have assumed the role of my daughter's father.
It's too late

359
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:11,153
You and I both know

360
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:15,866
You only recognize that one son

361
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:19,536
That secret life

362
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:22,206
Don't you forget

363
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:25,459
For your sake

364
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:30,005
I didn't touch that family.

365
00:35:31,173 --> 00:35:35,260
Don't make me change my mind.

366
00:35:54,238 --> 00:35:55,572

367
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:58,116

368
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:00,410
Why did you come down so early?
Why did you come down so early?

369
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:07,125
I want to tell you something

370
00:36:08,544 --> 00:36:09,962
What's up?

371
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,505
Are you not feeling well?

372
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:16,593
I won't go to Waseda anymore.

373
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:19,972
I told you don't have to worry about money

374
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,057
I'll find a way

375
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:23,976
I don't want

376
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:27,312
I can't let you give up your dreams

377
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,231
I can't do this

378
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:33,527
Noah

379
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:39,992
The dream of opening a restaurant is a gamble

380
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,286
I understand now

381
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:43,871
I don't believe you

382
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:46,415
It's my responsibility to take care of this family.

383
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:49,668
Isn't it a responsibility to go to college?

384
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:55,799
Noah, this responsibility should not be borne by you alone.

385
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:59,094
We all have to bear the responsibility together

386
00:37:00,429 --> 00:37:01,889
I'll be away from home for several years.

387
00:37:01,972 --> 00:37:04,183
So wait a few years.
We've been through so much, what the...

388
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:05,726
I can't stand it

389
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:09,104
Leaving you alone to bear such a heavy burden...

390
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:10,439
Enough

391
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:14,193
I have your grandmother and aunt

392
00:37:17,779 --> 00:37:18,989
I know you're disappointed...

393
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:20,782
I'm disappointed for you

394
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:22,993
You deserve a better life

395
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:25,329
I can let go

396
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,291
This is my home

397
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:31,919
I want to stay

398
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:33,712
Noah

399
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:35,422
Noah

400
00:37:45,516 --> 00:37:47,768
He was worried about the cost and didn't want to keep us here...

401
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:49,228
What are you talking about?

402
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:52,856
He must go to Waseda

403
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:54,691
Let him understand this

404
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,362
You think I didn't try to convince him?

405
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:03,867
He doesn't want to change his mind

406
00:38:04,368 --> 00:38:06,245
Because the child doesn't understand

407
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:10,207
We have been hungry for so many years.

408
00:38:11,792 --> 00:38:15,921
To cheat my stomach I gnaw on my father's fingers

409
00:38:17,673 --> 00:38:19,258
I do not accept

410
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:21,718
He must go to study

411
00:38:21,802 --> 00:38:24,263
I understand, but how?

412
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:26,056
Let him understand clearly

413
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:30,060
Let him open his eyes

414
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,898
See the world as it really is

415
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,317
If you can't convince him, let me come.

416
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:54,960
Are you sure she won't waver?

417
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:57,504
She refused to give in

418
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:00,424
Ok so what now?
Ok so what now?

419
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:03,302
I can't convince the directors with her in the way.

420
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:08,473
So we have no choice but to get rid of her, right?

421
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:11,059
What are you talking about?

422
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,816
Four Leaf Finance

423
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,610
Financial misconduct

424
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,197
You know the rules of the game, Tom.

425
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,255
(Kato Tatsumi)

426
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:32,599
No, this is not a missing persons

427
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,185
I know where he is

428
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:41,650
I need you to find out everything about this guy.

429
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:44,653
Once again, his name is...

430
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:49,283
Kato Tatsumi

431
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:51,743
He is Japanese

432
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:54,872
Find out everything you can

433
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:56,456
yes

434
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,500
Very important

435
00:40:58,584 --> 00:41:00,711
I will pay extra
I will pay extra

436
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:03,672
See you later

437
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:34,786
Mother

438
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:52,429
Ever since you brought that tofu home

439
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:55,766
I've always wondered how they did it.

440
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:05,609
Miss

441
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,697
I've always wanted to see

442
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:12,282
I heard Noah comes here often.

443
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:15,369
I'll prepare two dishes for you.

444
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:17,704
Don't bother

445
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:20,791
Not at all

446
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,752
- Please take a seat.
- OK

447
00:42:33,428 --> 00:42:35,514
Mom, why did you bring me here?

448
00:42:36,723 --> 00:42:41,562
I want to see for myself what else you're worried about.

449
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:45,899
It's not what you think

450
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,444
Look at her hands.

451
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:53,240
Still soft and smooth

452
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:06,837
Seeing her reminds me of when I first came here

453
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:10,132
I never thought I'd live here for so long.

454
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:16,972
Your father asked me to come with him even though we were still strangers.

455
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:22,311
We came here knowing nothing about the real world.

456
00:43:23,937 --> 00:43:25,314
Especially me

457
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:28,108
Yeongdo was my whole world.

458
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:35,699
So when your father told me about his faith

459
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:38,702
I just find it weird

460
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:43,916
At first I couldn't understand

461
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:52,633
But then he told me about heaven

462
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,929
I understand it all.

463
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:01,475
When I...

464
00:44:03,852 --> 00:44:07,731
When I think of heaven, Yeongdo-gu comes to mind

465
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:13,862
I don't know what your heaven is.
But I know where my heaven is

466
00:44:15,197 --> 00:44:16,823
Not here

467
00:44:17,658 --> 00:44:19,409
If you stay

468
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:26,875
You'll sit there and the memories will burn your soul

469
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:31,421
I can't allow this to happen.

470
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:34,091
I made a promise to your father.

471
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,013
anyway

472
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:44,685
You and your brother must thrive.

473
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,278
I will keep this promise

474
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:02,911
Sorry for the long wait.

475
00:45:05,873 --> 00:45:08,041
Hope you like it

476
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,835
I'll try it

477
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:14,965
Really delicious

478
00:45:15,048 --> 00:45:17,759
I can taste your intentions

479
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:18,844
Thanks

480
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:24,141
Tokyo's tofu must be more delicious

481
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:26,018
It's a big city after all.

482
00:45:29,646 --> 00:45:34,776
But I hope you'll remember us when you eat tofu

483
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:39,573
I can't imagine any tofu being better than this.

484
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:43,744
When I went to Tokyo

485
00:45:45,078 --> 00:45:46,914
I'm gonna miss this taste.

486
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:00,571
