00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:13,347
Japanese dialogue subtitled in blue.
Korean dialogue subtitled in yellow.

2
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,030
(in Japanese) Ready?

3
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:33,909
Here we go.

4
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,500
I've got this, but stay close.

5
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,129
Hurry now!
There'll be no room on the train.

6
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,725
Shh. They're coming.

7
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,019
Get them!

8
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,274
Don't let them escape!

9
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,517
Boom! Boom!

10
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:48,859
But I aimed for your heart,
and I got you on the first shot!

11
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:53,363
- Yeah, I saw it!
- The hell! We blew you to bits first!

12
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,325
And it's my turn to wear the gas mask.

13
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,534
Hand it over!

14
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,411
It's that man again.

15
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,007
That's my house.

16
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:19,765
Mother?

17
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,778
I'm going home.

18
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,863
You guys as well.

19
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:49,336
His father's body...
Will they ever get it back?

20
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:55,884
I think it depends on
how much of the body is left.

21
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,852
But, Mozasu,
remember what Pastor Hu says.

22
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,062
God is watching over us.

23
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,147
You believe that, don't you?

24
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,693
Look who it is.

25
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,445
Bandooooo.

26
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,965
(in Korean) Mozasu.

27
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,885
Come quickly.
Help me gather the laundry.

28
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,098
Auntie, why do you
always only call on me?

29
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,058
Never Noa!

30
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,186
Because all you do is play around.

31
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,729
Now hurry!

32
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,149
<i>"We must remember to purify our language</i>

33
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:56,403
<i>from the taint of American imperialism.</i>

34
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:01,992
<i>What we once called 'beruto'
we now call 'waist rope.'</i>

35
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,996
<i>This is what our scholars
should devote their studies to."</i>

36
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,942
Auntie!

37
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,863
Are you okay?

38
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,077
Can you-- Can you understand me?

39
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,540
Is that you, Noa?

40
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,048
- Noa...
- Did you call me?

41
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,177
Noa.

42
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,556
What is this? Who is he?

43
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,140
I think...

44
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,687
I think... it's him.

45
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,692
Isak?

46
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,955
I've come back, Kyunghee.

47
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:34,960
I...

48
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,338
I'm home.

49
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,015
I'm back.

50
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,307
Hennessy. Neat.

51
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,018
Splash of water.

52
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,898
What are you doing here?

53
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:06,904
I came to beg for mercy.

54
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,953
Tell me, what can I do?

55
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:23,629
Perhaps you and I are two of a kind.

56
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,424
Both your father and mine

57
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,887
achieved much financial success.

58
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,602
And like you,
when anyone stood in my way,

59
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:44,024
I dug in and worked harder, dirtier.

60
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,445
I had to prove to the world

61
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:53,534
that I was not an inconsequential man.

62
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,036
And now?

63
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,124
Japan Businessman of the Year.

64
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:08,423
Awarded by the very people
who once tried to destroy me.

65
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,179
From the moment I met you,

66
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:18,517
I knew you'd get in my way.

67
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:23,522
Your failure is now on me.

68
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,319
So there will be no mercy.

69
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:36,243
Because I'm using you
to send a message to this town.

70
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:43,125
Mess with me and I will smite you down.

71
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,776
Where is he? Is he in there?

72
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:13,822
Sunja.

73
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,034
You must prepare yourself.

74
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,534
Who is that?

75
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,662
It's me.

76
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,382
It's me.

77
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,260
Sunja.

78
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,637
Yes, it's me.

79
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,893
Now what is this?
Startling everyone like this.

80
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,777
I have prayed for you
every day and every night.

81
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,197
It must've been so hard for you.

82
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:44,454
We were lucky compared
to so many others.

83
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,500
I am very grateful to your brother
and sister-in-law.

84
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:51,587
They have been good to us.

85
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:57,509
I hear my brother has gone far away.

86
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:03,724
I so very much want to see him.

87
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:18,155
I don't want you to see me like this.

88
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,781
Or the boys.

89
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,287
Why worry about such a thing?

90
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,708
You must get better first.

91
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,379
Yes.

92
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,590
It is so tiring.

93
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,180
Get some sleep.

94
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,188
Don't leave me.

95
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:54,942
Sunja.

96
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:59,238
I'm going to fetch the doctor.

97
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,907
You'll get better in no time.

98
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,848
He needs to see a doctor right away.

99
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,268
But where are we supposed to find one?

100
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,354
From what I understand,
they've been sent to the front lines--

101
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,189
There must be a few still left
at the hospitals.

102
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:36,316
We must find one.

103
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,195
Sunja!

104
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:47,452
What if...

105
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,247
What if it's too late?

106
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,125
Shouldn't you be at his side?

107
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,879
You don't know
how much longer you have with him.

108
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:02,384
Kyunghee, have you forgotten?

109
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:05,846
He has beaten death before.

110
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:10,642
If he can get a doctor's care,
he can beat it again.

111
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,020
I know it.

112
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:34,958
You again! Why are you here?

113
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,252
Do you know what time it is?

114
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,880
- <i>Halmoni.</i>
- Piss off!

115
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:42,049
I have nowhere else to go.

116
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:44,343
No one else to turn to.

117
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,098
<i>Halmoni.</i>

118
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,324
GET OUT!!

119
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:13,163
<i>I need to tell you something first.</i>

120
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,418
Your house is like this

121
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:20,921
because of me.

122
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,300
You--

123
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,513
After I told you not to sign,
Shiffley's fired me.

124
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,933
So my visa was revoked.

125
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,227
I'm stuck here now.

126
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,021
Not only that, Abe-<i>san</i> is making--

127
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,858
Enough. What about my house?

128
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,574
I made a deal with someone.

129
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:53,954
He used his connections
to try to force you out.

130
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:58,917
We were going to buy this plot,

131
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,338
sell it back to Abe-<i>san</i> and Shiffley's.

132
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,925
I needed that money to get by.

133
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:11,138
- I was desperate--
- You call that an excuse?

134
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,895
But isn't that how it goes?

135
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:24,109
We all turn on each other
for the sake of our own survival,

136
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,654
not realizing
we're doing the work for them.

137
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:31,992
This is what they want.

138
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,453
Forcing us to beg for mercy.

139
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:43,837
Finally.

140
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,132
You figured it out.

141
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,127
It's me. Noa.

142
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:42,980
Noa, go and bring me Sexton Hu--

143
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,315
He's our pastor now.

144
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,527
Pastor?

145
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:53,240
Yes. Pastor Yoo passed away
a few years ago.

146
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,076
I see.

147
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,333
Go.

148
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,962
Bring me Pastor Hu.

149
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:10,924
Quickly. Can you do that?

150
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,427
Yes.

151
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:24,688
Noa, run along to the telegram office.

152
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,441
We need to get a message to your uncle.

153
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:32,362
But, Auntie, Father asked me
to bring Pastor Hu to him.

154
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,782
I see.

155
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,994
He must want to pray together.

156
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,662
- Go on then.
- Yes.

157
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,916
What about me?
I can go to the telegram office.

158
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:50,631
You understand how important this is?

159
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,216
I can do it.

160
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,718
I'll make sure Uncle receives
the message.

161
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,462
Excuse me, I need to send
a telegram to my uncle in Nagasaki.

162
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,382
It's very important.

163
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:42,015
Can you read it?

164
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,526
Twenty-one characters.

165
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:53,610
Eighty sen.

166
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,034
Check the text
to make sure it is correct.

167
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,250
ISAK HAS COME HOME.

168
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,294
HE IS DYING.

169
00:20:23,182 --> 00:20:24,892
Pastor! He's back!

170
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,226
Noa.

171
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:30,189
After all these years,
my father is finally home.

172
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:34,026
But he's very sick.

173
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:39,156
Please help him. I know you can.

174
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,326
Could you excuse us for a moment?

175
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,246
My father's finally come back.

176
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,874
Please, come with me.

177
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:50,459
Pray for him.

178
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,295
Ask God to make him better.

179
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,048
I don't think my prayers are enough.

180
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:59,551
I know he'll listen to your prayers.

181
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:02,262
Noa, you know it's not that simple.

182
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,972
But it has to!

183
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,229
I've been good,

184
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,272
haven't I?

185
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,609
I've tried so hard to be good.

186
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,614
The Lord cannot look away this time.

187
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,660
Not again.

188
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:31,708
I'll grab my things.

189
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:51,311
He needs a doctor.

190
00:21:52,521 --> 00:21:54,022
That's why I've come.

191
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,817
Your priority is to get
you and the boys out of the city.

192
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,903
You didn't even have to ask
who it was for.

193
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:01,280
You knew.

194
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:03,907
So tell me.

195
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,203
Could you have gotten him out earlier?

196
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:13,041
I managed to get him out now

197
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,169
because I promised a prison official

198
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,880
safe passage out of the city
for him and his family.

199
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:21,300
Everyone's clawing to get out.

200
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,343
Everyone but you.

201
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:29,892
You must be desperate

202
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,102
to come to me.

203
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:33,687
I am.

204
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,324
Here's the deal.

205
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:47,951
I'll get you a doctor.

206
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,370
The best the city has left.

207
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,538
In exchange,

208
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:56,585
you and the boys must come with me.

209
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,172
With or without him.

210
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:03,967
Promise me.

211
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:52,891
How easy it is to forget
how hard those years were.

212
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:55,060
But now look.

213
00:23:57,521 --> 00:24:00,774
Back when I bought this plot
after the war,

214
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:03,902
they were practically giving it away.

215
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:05,863
What?

216
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:07,781
I'm not kidding.

217
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:10,409
How else could I have afforded this?

218
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,453
I wonder why.

219
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:17,749
There were always some strange rumors
about this land.

220
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:19,877
What kind of rumors?

221
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,257
Such is my fate to feed another mouth.

222
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:28,343
That stomach is an endless pit.

223
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:35,684
<i>Halmoni</i>, wait. What kind of rumors?

224
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,770
Who can remember all the details?

225
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,691
Something about the military school
that used to be here.

226
00:24:44,443 --> 00:24:46,778
The trucks started coming one day.

227
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:48,822
Loaded with corpses.

228
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:56,538
Why would they bring corpses
to a military school?

229
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:58,665
Who knows?

230
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:03,045
It was during the war
so no one questioned them.

231
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:07,049
Is that all?
That was the extent of the rumors then?

232
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,136
Eat slowly or you'll get sick again.

233
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,347
- <i>Halmoni.</i>
- What?

234
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,307
You still have more questions?

235
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,017
I already told you!

236
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,478
It was a long time ago.

237
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:23,023
Disturbing the dead...
What's the point of that?

238
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:34,952
But could those bones still be here?

239
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,835
<i>Halmoni.</i>

240
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,341
I had to forget.

241
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,219
Understand?

242
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:55,430
I tried so hard to forget.

243
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:58,809
Or how could I possibly live here?

244
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:03,897
But these bones,
perhaps they can give us something.

245
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,192
What are you talking about?

246
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,112
Don't you see?

247
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,364
This is how we fight back.

248
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:19,788
With this,
we stop them from coming after us.

249
00:26:24,251 --> 00:26:27,504
See! When he was small like me,

250
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:31,842
he broke a record
doing push-ups in his own home.

251
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:34,428
I bet he's super rich now.

252
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:40,142
And is being rich that important to you?

253
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:46,940
Of course! If we were rich,
I would get the best doctors for you

254
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,276
and buy us a bigger house.

255
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,696
And if we have any money left,

256
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:58,368
Auntie can buy sugar at the black market
and make candies.

257
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:05,959
Are you okay?

258
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:17,304
I too once grew up in a big house

259
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:21,016
with many rooms.

260
00:27:22,518 --> 00:27:25,270
Though we weren't allowed
in most of them.

261
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,357
I surely would've snuck in.

262
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,360
I'm sure you would have.

263
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:38,659
But my point is,
I do not miss that big house,

264
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:42,829
only the people who lived in it.

265
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,041
True wealth, Mozasu...

266
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:49,670
It is to be loved.

267
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:55,050
But, Father, why does it have to be
one or the other?

268
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,971
I want to be both loved and rich.

269
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,854
What's happening?

270
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,355
Just another blackout.

271
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,024
We have them almost every night now.

272
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,526
I'll light a lantern.

273
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:21,034
Here.

274
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:27,583
So you aren't scared.

275
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:43,390
Thank you, my son.

276
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:48,896
They're here!

277
00:28:49,897 --> 00:28:50,981
Father.

278
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:03,744
It brings me joy
to see you again, my brother.

279
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:06,872
Pastor, you've come.

280
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:08,665
Of course I had to.

281
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,542
To see him home finally--

282
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,878
I must have a private word
with the pastor.

283
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,009
Come now.

284
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:21,386
Noa can stay.

285
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:24,348
Father.

286
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:28,018
Mozasu, help me with the lanterns.

287
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,694
But, <i>Halmoni</i>, if what you say is true,

288
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:41,698
a company like Colton
would never touch this land.

289
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:44,076
How can you think of that again?

290
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:45,744
I ask that you hear me out.

291
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,956
After we sell this plot to Abe-<i>san</i>,

292
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:51,917
we spread the rumor about those bones--

293
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,294
We don't even know
if they're still here!

294
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:59,925
It doesn't matter. A rumor like this
will send Colton packing.

295
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:02,511
I'm sure of it.

296
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:07,891
And without them, Abe-<i>san</i>
would be left holding a substantial loan.

297
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:12,563
How could you think
of exploiting the dead?

298
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:16,733
I'm not responsible for that past.
I had nothing to do with it.

299
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:18,652
Enough!

300
00:30:28,537 --> 00:30:31,164
So what was it all for then?

301
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:34,251
All that tireless work?

302
00:30:38,297 --> 00:30:41,508
It was you, wasn't it?

303
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:46,305
You're the one who turned me in.

304
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:54,354
Pastor?

305
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:58,775
Yes. You're right.

306
00:31:00,152 --> 00:31:01,361
It was me.

307
00:31:03,488 --> 00:31:07,701
I had long suspected you disliked me.

308
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,539
Why?

309
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:17,878
I didn't dislike you.

310
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:25,052
I despised you.

311
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:32,142
For you, it was so easy to be loved.

312
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:35,187
But for me...

313
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:41,151
even my own parents abandoned me.

314
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,989
It was Pastor Yoo who took me in

315
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,408
when everyone else
just wanted to toss me.

316
00:31:49,034 --> 00:31:52,746
He raised me as his own, loved me

317
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,873
until you came along,

318
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,918
and then his love dampened.

319
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:14,017
So I reported you to them.

320
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:21,900
But the satisfaction
I thought I would feel...

321
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:24,611
it did not come.

322
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:30,492
I prayed fervently for your release.

323
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:34,997
Do you think I am here because of you?

324
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:39,751
No doubt your family prayed as well,

325
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:42,880
but I promise you
my voice was part of that chorus.

326
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,174
Just as I tried to make my amends

327
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:49,052
not only to God,
but to your family and to Noa...

328
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:03,775
With all my heart, I tried.

329
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:12,993
I understand I have no excuse.

330
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:14,995
You'll never forgive me--

331
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:16,622
I forgive you.

332
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,587
I forgive you.

333
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:24,671
You can't.

334
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:28,133
You can't forgive him. Never!

335
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:31,011
All these years--

336
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:33,138
Because of him--

337
00:33:33,138 --> 00:33:34,932
You must believe me, Noa.

338
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:38,268
I know what I have stolen from you.

339
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:41,188
Get out! Stay away from us!

340
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,106
- Noa!
- I am sorry, Noa.

341
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,316
Truly, I am sorry!

342
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:47,444
Pastor, what is going on?

343
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:49,196
Noa.

344
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:56,745
Father.

345
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:02,251
Why?

346
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:10,509
I know. Who am I to talk?

347
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,638
What do I know about true suffering?

348
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:20,476
The thought of going to sleep
on an empty stomach...

349
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:24,481
it's unimaginable to me.

350
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:32,281
I've lived a pathetically easy life.

351
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:37,452
It's understandable
for you to loathe me.

352
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:43,917
When I see the way you look at me...

353
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:47,963
The way my grandmother looks at me...

354
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:52,384
How can you not ask yourself...

355
00:34:55,721 --> 00:35:00,350
"Did I really live through all that
for this?"

356
00:35:05,898 --> 00:35:06,982
No?

357
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,903
Surely you would say
it was all pointless.

358
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:21,121
I'm sorry to keep you up so late.

359
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:28,128
I won't come back. I promise.

360
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:34,176
I have no regrets about how I lived.

361
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:41,850
It was a life lived well.

362
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:46,647
<i>My sons, a broken body
with a broken bones...</i>

363
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:49,441
This is all I have to give you.

364
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:53,195
But even so, remember this:

365
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,782
That pastor's fate and ours...

366
00:35:58,075 --> 00:36:00,577
we are together in the same lot.

367
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:06,708
Noa,

368
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:14,007
mercy is neither a gift nor a power.

369
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:18,637
Mercy is an admission.

370
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:24,685
Survival comes at a cost.

371
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:34,486
There is so much
I want to say to you both.

372
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:38,031
But know this one thing.

373
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,952
No matter what...

374
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:50,294
you are my sons...

375
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:55,174
and I am your father.

376
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:07,895
I've come!

377
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:12,191
I've brought the doctor.
He's going to help us.

378
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,318
It will be okay now.

379
00:37:16,028 --> 00:37:19,740
- Father!
- This is not good. Clear the room.

380
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:22,492
The doctor will help him.

381
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:24,953
Mozasu, Noa, come.

382
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:18,006
Mother!

383
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:27,307
I will be frank.

384
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:32,271
Your husband's lungs,
they're filled with mucus.

385
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,233
We could drain them in a hospital,

386
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,069
but more concerning,

387
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:42,322
he has sepsis.

388
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:44,241
I do not believe...

389
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:49,621
he has much time left.

390
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:57,212
But there must be something you can do.

391
00:38:58,463 --> 00:38:59,882
Please.

392
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:02,467
If it's the money, do not worry.

393
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:05,512
Tell him.

394
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:08,557
I'll pay whatever it costs.
He doesn't need to worry.

395
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:11,018
I'll-- I'll get the money.

396
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:14,605
Your husband, at most,

397
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,733
he has a few hours left.

398
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:30,704
What they did to him...

399
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,956
It is a terrible thing.

400
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:35,083
I am sorry for him.

401
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:58,607
<i>Forgive me.</i>

402
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:02,611
I didn't know

403
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:06,406
it would cost us this.

404
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,784
There's nothing to forgive.

405
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:14,039
In the years you have been gone,

406
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:20,045
so many have come to me
to speak of your kindness.

407
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:24,633
You sacrificed for others.

408
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:29,596
That's the man I met 14 years ago,

409
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:32,558
and it's the man I see now.

410
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:36,478
The world may have changed...

411
00:40:38,856 --> 00:40:41,316
but you have not.

412
00:40:46,572 --> 00:40:52,411
I want to see the boys grow up.

413
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,125
Sunja...

414
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:04,173
My wife, I want to hold you.

415
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:07,509
I...

416
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:13,223
I want to live.

417
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:17,686
So much.

418
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:23,567
I am dying to live.

419
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:35,245
When I am gone...

420
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:41,043
you must find someone.

421
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:46,006
Do not say such things.

422
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:53,472
You have so much love to give.

423
00:41:55,098 --> 00:41:56,308
I know that.

424
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:03,065
To be loved by my husband,

425
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:06,360
to be honored by you...

426
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:12,574
it has been everything.

427
00:42:17,538 --> 00:42:22,668
But how will you go on?

428
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:31,593
Do not worry about us.

429
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:36,139
I promise you.

430
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:39,893
Our children...

431
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,939
will live good lives.

432
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:48,652
Noa and Mozasu...

433
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:52,948
they will thrive.

434
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:58,138
<i>There will never be
another man like your father.</i>

435
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,267
<i>You are not to forget that.</i>

436
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:05,479
<i>Never.</i>

437
00:45:57,049 --> 00:45:58,759
What are you doing here?

438
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:00,135
The deal's done.

439
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:03,180
She'll sell to Abe and Colton
for 1.4 billion yen.

440
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:06,642
We'll get a 10% fee.

441
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:10,646
But know this.
That hotel will never be built.

442
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:13,649
Because we're going to sink it.

443
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:16,026
And Abe-<i>san</i> will know

444
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:20,864
I'm the one who did this to him.

445
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:47,724
It's not a drill! It's a real air raid!

446
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,601
Hurry to the bomb shelter!

447
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:52,729
- Hurry, run!
- Hurry!

448
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:54,189
What are you doing? We must go!

449
00:46:54,189 --> 00:46:55,315
Run! Let's go!

450
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:57,818
- Wait, my mother--
- Mother!

451
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:58,902
Sunja!

452
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:01,196
- But my husband!
- Run!

453
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:04,408
No, I can't leave my husband!
