1
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,010
(Japanese) This is the wheel of history

2
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,555
The endless cycle of cause and effect

3
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,935
It's exhausting actually.

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,022
Tolstoy also viewed history in this way

5
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:24,983
He realized that the wheel of history could move forward in this way

6
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,944
Because of the labor of the common people

7
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,613
This is what makes this novel so inspiring.

8
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,823
He told the truth

9
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,578
What do you think, Bando-san?

10
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,539
Do you agree?

11
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,464
I agree that Tolstoy's intention was
Try to describe the subject

12
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:54,179
But he lacks execution.

13
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,933
Nakazono-san didn't see this.

14
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,603
In the novel

15
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,524
The character is aristocratic or has close ties with the upper class

16
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,110
The novel lacks colorful

17
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,114
Real human experience

18
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,950
Lack of perspectives different from those of the privileged

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,910
Many people in this room see the world in the same way.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,498
On the contrary, novels should portray

21
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,585
A world where all beings struggle to survive

22
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,631
Indeed, the topic of the novel is very good.

23
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,051
But the actual portrayal is not ideal

24
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,930
In my opinion

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,976
This book is a failure.

26
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,856
Bando-san said it very well

27
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,234
Once again you see the deeper meaning of the text

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,987
Other students should learn from him.

29
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,491
Let's talk about the ninth book.

30
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,167
(One year later)

31
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:11,131
(Tokyo, 1951)

32
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,639
Can't be here

33
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,890
Will be seen

34
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,768
I don't care if they see it.

35
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,610
But I really have to go to class.

36
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,372
(Adapted from Lee Min-jin's novel)

37
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,322
Moses, hurry up!

38
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,909
Look

39
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,994
See, it really works. You succeeded.

40
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,670
- It's nothing.
- It's too easy.

41
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,551
Some more to come.

42
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,445
That one

43
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:28,036
Do you really think you can get away with it?

44
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:30,706
Mr. Goto

45
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,084
I didn't know you were here

46
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,295
- I thought you were on Thursday...
- Shut up

47
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,046
Listen carefully

48
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,884
I love your mother's noodles.

49
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,304
So I will go easy on you.

50
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:48,640
Follow me

51
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,395
(Korean) Did you really do this?

52
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,771
Look at me

53
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,357
sorry

54
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,863
I will punish him

55
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,489
I promise you

56
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,074
We will compensate you for your losses

57
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,534
Punish him

58
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,161
What's the point?

59
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,330
What's next?

60
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,291
We will be more strict

61
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,168
Make sure he goes to school...

62
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,879
Reading is not for him

63
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:26,094
But he needs to go to school

64
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,890
What else can be done?

65
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,941
Let him work for me.

66
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:40,317
In the game room

67
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,111
That's solid work.

68
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,990
And he won't get into trouble there.

69
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,659
I will make sure of this myself.

70
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,246
He is too young.

71
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,207
Mrs. Bando, you didn't listen to me.

72
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,751
He is different from his brother.

73
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,706
(Loan Settlement Notice)

74
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:41,003
I received a letter saying my loan was paid off.

75
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,297
Something must have gone wrong.

76
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:46,508
A payment is recorded here

77
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,928
It was wired and the full amount was paid three days ago.

78
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,431
But...

79
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,267
Can I see who paid?

80
00:07:55,267 --> 00:08:00,147
It seems to be from Tokyo.

81
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,358
Solomon Bai He is the account owner

82
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,238
Are you sure?

83
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,782
I am sure

84
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,453
OK

85
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,413
Thank you

86
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,373
Best wishes

87
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,925
Who knows about the pinball arcade?
What happens in that kind of place every day?

88
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,138
I'm as worried as you are.

89
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:38,434
But Mr. Goto assured me

90
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,568
He is not from our family.

91
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,405
He would not take care of Moses as his own child.

92
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:54,743
So what should we do?

93
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:59,540
Keep deceiving yourself into thinking he'll leave
The same path as Noah?

94
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,845
Things were different during the war

95
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,139
We must do everything we can to survive

96
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,599
Everyone is like this

97
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,143
But now it's different

98
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,939
Do you really think our hard times are over?

99
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,650
But why choose the game room?

100
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,112
There must be more respectable jobs.

101
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,201
I wouldn't be surprised if it was my uncle who said this.

102
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:38,120
But I didn't expect you to say that.

103
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:04,146
(Recipient: Joseph Bando, Osaka, Japan)

104
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:10,736
(Sender: Kim Chang-ho, Pyongyang, North Korea)

105
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,641
You don't like this book?

106
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,894
I like it not because of this

107
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,312
What is that?

108
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,233
Read so many stories of suffering

109
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,152
There are so many desperate people...

110
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,405
Makes me hungry

111
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,116
I know it's weird

112
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:02,746
What does it come from? This feeling of hunger

113
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,290
What do you think?

114
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:12,214
This book is not about you.

115
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,342
You never have to worry about having no food to eat

116
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:18,220
Or living in poverty

117
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,099
But you want to fill your stomach

118
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:28,021
Just because you need to prove it to yourself
You will never be penniless.

119
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:35,028
Even so, although your belly is bulging

120
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:40,659
But you realize you don't really taste the food

121
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:46,456
You ate so much but it tasted like wax

122
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,089
Take me to your room.

123
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,384
I want you

124
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:01,346
Feel sorry

125
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:07,186
I have a weekly dinner date to go to.

126
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,481
Ah, your mysterious sponsor.

127
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,027
Don't call him that.

128
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,029
But is it really true?

129
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,156
He pays for your accommodation...

130
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:24,203
I do this for both of us.

131
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:25,746
I want to see him

132
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:29,666
I told you it's impossible

133
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,585
But what's wrong with him?

134
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:34,213
Is he some kind of monster?

135
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,262
We've been dating for a few months

136
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,307
Have I ever refused to give you anything?

137
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,686
- No but...
- Please listen to me on this matter.

138
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,523
This is the only thing I ask of you.

139
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,693
You can never see him, understand?

140
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,624
Then you promise me one thing

141
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,213
You go to meet this mysterious man tonight

142
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,340
While you were eating that expensive dinner

143
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,219
You have to savor every bite carefully

144
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,264
Until your stomach is about to burst

145
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,017
Noah

146
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:34,022
You and I we have it all

147
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:48,328
We are indeed dreaming

148
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:54,710
But we are turning this dream into reality

149
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,547
The membership price will be capped at 500

150
00:13:58,547 --> 00:14:01,133
Just 20 minutes ago

151
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:05,637
Only 47 positions left

152
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,980
We expect to break ground within 90 days.

153
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:19,818
We plan to open the golf course next summer.

154
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:25,240
How do you plan to deal with this?
Recent labor shortages?

155
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,909
There are many engineering projects in the city.

156
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,745
I heard that finding human resources has become a problem.

157
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,622
I promise you

158
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:36,168
Our partners are in control

159
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:40,964
We will not face any labor shortage

160
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,343
Ask a Question

161
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,804
There are rumors of a possible real estate crash

162
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,682
What do you think about this?

163
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,068
My opinion?

164
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,621
I think this rumor is funny.

165
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:18,335
Because history tells us that since the end of World War II

166
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:23,590
Land prices in Japan have never fallen

167
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:29,137
In Tokyo, real estate is king

168
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:31,890
In the short term

169
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,434
Japan will surpass the United States

170
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,479
Become the world's largest economy

171
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,399
Think about it

172
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,943
America becomes second

173
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:48,031
So really, what do we have to worry about?

174
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:56,456
So who wants to hear about our water bath facilities?

175
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:03,255
It will be built of the finest Italian marble.

176
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:07,467
So I guess there won't be any problems in the future?

177
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,678
Thanks to your generous support

178
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,181
The rest of the legislature changed its position.

179
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,683
There won't be any more obstacles.

180
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,352
very good

181
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:19,146
What about the price?

182
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,231
40 million yen

183
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,651
I know this is different from what you expected.

184
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,904
But still a good price...

185
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:27,988
Thirty million yen

186
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,074
No more

187
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,828
But Mr. Gao...

188
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,289
Although you said so

189
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,375
But it is not easy to convince other members of parliament

190
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:45,214
Do you have guests?

191
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:48,550
Yes, a VIP

192
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,927
I don't mean to disturb

193
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,304
I can wait in the lobby downstairs

194
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:53,597
unnecessary

195
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:56,225
I hope you guys get to know me

196
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,393
Join us

197
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,147
This is Mr. Black Iron.

198
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,903
I know who you are. I've read about you in the newspapers.

199
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:10,071
Depends on which newspaper

200
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:13,116
I am either the future of this great country or

201
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,703
Otherwise it's the root of evil

202
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,579
Believe me, everything I read was very positive.

203
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:21,750
Who is this young gentleman?

204
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,878
He is one of the most talented of the next generation.

205
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:31,176
It's a pity that he is too modest

206
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:34,388
We can correct this.

207
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:36,056
What do you do?

208
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,517
I'm a sophomore

209
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,519
In Waseda

210
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,021
- What are your plans for your studies?
- politics

211
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,899
Good choice

212
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,236
If you are as talented as Mr. Gao described

213
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:54,575
I think I'll see your name in the newspaper soon.

214
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:58,078
What is your last name?

215
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,080
white

216
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:02,624
Noah White

217
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,676
We will definitely meet again

218
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,432
I should say goodbye.

219
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,351
Please stop for a moment

220
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,911
I hope the number will be 30 million next time we meet.

221
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,792
You will find more today than ever before

222
00:18:47,336 --> 00:18:49,671
I heard you got married and moved into a new home.

223
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,510
Just consider it as my gift

224
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:11,944
Are you going out again?

225
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,200
I want to get some fresh air

226
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:30,671
Anything else?

227
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,103
What's this?

228
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,525
He gave it to me.

229
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:02,870
Feel sorry

230
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,582
I hide it so you won't see it.

231
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:41,385
Let's try the strawberry flavor today.

232
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,513
It's good to try new things

233
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,148
What happened?

234
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,030
My son...

235
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:06,243
He suspected you were approaching me.

236
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,665
It's for my family's money.

237
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,835
So he hired a detective to investigate you.

238
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,594
He what?

239
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:26,430
He shouldn't have done that.

240
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:31,935
But he means well.

241
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:35,939
He is worried about me

242
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:40,527
So he found out something.

243
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,244
war

244
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:55,209
That was a long time ago

245
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,716
You were young and...

246
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:04,092
I...

247
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,512
I am a murderer

248
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,105
What are you doing here?

249
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:24,530
It seems you are still here.

250
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,115
Still helping him clean up the mess

251
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:31,036
Mr. Yoshii asked you a question

252
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,413
Please let us talk privately

253
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,166
Don't worry, Sugihara

254
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,585
This isn't the first time I've dealt with him, is it?

255
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,385
I'm here to make things clear.

256
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:51,473
Stay away from my son and cut off contact with him.

257
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,891
impossible

258
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,938
Your son will make me a lot of money.

259
00:23:59,314 --> 00:24:01,525
Haven't you taken enough from me?

260
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,236
Is this how you see it?

261
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:05,696
interesting

262
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:08,657
I never wanted your grandfather's love

263
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,826
I never asked for

264
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,327
He chose it himself...

265
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:15,205
You're here to talk about Solomon.

266
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:16,999
What I want to tell you is

267
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,835
He made a choice

268
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,962
Just like you many years ago

269
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:26,049
If you have a problem with it, talk to him.

270
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:30,596
Because whatever cracks there are in your relationship

271
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,599
That's not my problem.

272
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:45,194
You and I both know

273
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:48,739
I could have destroyed you.

274
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:51,700
But I showed mercy to you.

275
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,286
So listen to me now

276
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:58,582
If you dare to lay a finger on my son
I won't show mercy anymore

277
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,084
You know my ability

278
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,253
Do you understand?

279
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:34,243
Hey

280
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,497
Give me two boxes of marbles.

281
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:39,665
And cigarettes

282
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:41,917
You can keep the change.

283
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:48,882
He wants two boxes.

284
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:55,264
Hey

285
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,349
I'll do it

286
00:25:57,975 --> 00:25:59,226
You continue cleaning

287
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,654
Mr. Yoshii, welcome

288
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:13,031
I brought Xiao Shou with me today.

289
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:28,505
Do you really work here?

290
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:32,467
But how old are you?

291
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:34,970
15 years old

292
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,055
And you?

293
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:38,974
Seven years old

294
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,770
Is that your grandpa?

295
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:49,526
Don't you know who he is?

296
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,446
I have no idea

297
00:26:54,198 --> 00:26:55,616
Komori

298
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,345
Have you finished reading The Brothers Karamazov?

299
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,014
certainly

300
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:20,390
What do you think?

301
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:22,559
Have you read it?

302
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,187
I have read all the books you read, Noah

303
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:27,272
All required reading for your course

304
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:31,193
Why? Mr. Gao, you are a busy man.

305
00:27:33,195 --> 00:27:35,072
Because I never had this opportunity before

306
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:40,661
Noah, I am inspired by your love of books.

307
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:44,248
But your future is not in the book

308
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:51,880
I won't go into politics.

309
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:54,550
I want to be a teacher

310
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,847
You fought all the way to the rice fields just to become a teacher?

311
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:02,724
This is ridiculous

312
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:06,061
There are many doors open to you.

313
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,437
You just haven't realized it yet

314
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,231
I realized

315
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,402
But I was determined to go my own way

316
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:36,884
Who are you?

317
00:28:36,884 --> 00:28:40,512
Sorry to bother you, I'm here to see a friend.

318
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,892
What are you doing here?

319
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:46,685
Who is this?

320
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,230
I am Akiko Nakazono

321
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:53,275
I am Noah's friend.

322
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:55,194
He invited me here.

323
00:28:55,194 --> 00:29:00,032
I didn't expect to have guests but please take a seat. The food is sufficient.

324
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,335
Zhongyuan...

325
00:29:12,002 --> 00:29:16,215
Your father is not Nakazono Jin, is he?

326
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,217
Deputy Foreign Minister?

327
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,844
Yes, that's my father.

328
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,071
Noah, sit down.

329
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:54,211
Do you know who I am?

330
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:57,798
Of course Noah always speaks highly of you.

331
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:03,887
We were just talking about his future.

332
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:05,430
His future?

333
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:07,766
Such a serious conversation

334
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:12,187
I think he will have a bright future.

335
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:14,106
I felt it when I first met him

336
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:18,402
But he must first want such a future

337
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:22,739
Maybe you can help him

338
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,707
To the future

339
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:38,881
Goodbye, Shifli.

340
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:41,508
Hey buddy

341
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:43,886
When will you return home?

342
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:45,512
I won't go back to the US

343
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:47,806
Macao

344
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:51,810
- Mr. Yoshii offered me a position
- do what?

345
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,939
He is in charge of running his new casino.

346
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:57,357
Where are your children?

347
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,318
Who am I kidding, bro?

348
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:04,573
They have lived through so many years without me.
And it's been good

349
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:07,534
Yeah, maybe at the beginning.

350
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:10,287
But are you serious?

351
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:11,455
yes

352
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:14,374
But Macau?

353
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,584
Why not?

354
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,712
I made it through Tokyo was just another stop on the road

355
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:22,925
And you and I both know that the market here will collapse sooner or later
You should also consider

356
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,516
I still remember the first lie you told me

357
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:32,893
Which one?

358
00:31:33,936 --> 00:31:35,437
“I won’t stay long”

359
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,112
By the way, when you start to believe your own lies

360
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:46,865
That's when the trouble really comes.

361
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:48,367
Thanks

362
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,495
Give him another drink.

363
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,207
It wasn't a lie

364
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:58,293
But thanks to Abe, I got this far

365
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,089
That guy must be furious right now.

366
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,884
I think it's good

367
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:08,220
As long as he curses my name, it's fine.

368
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:13,392
You don't have any sympathy for that guy?

369
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:16,436
No I can't afford sympathy

370
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,568
Thanks

371
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:32,286
Fuck everything

372
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:41,628
He is not the monster you say he is.

373
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:43,755
It has nothing to do with that

374
00:32:44,923 --> 00:32:45,924
Is that because of me?

375
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:51,013
Are you worried that I'll embarrass you?

376
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,349
I told you not to get involved.

377
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:58,979
I want to be a part of this

378
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,689
I won't apologize

379
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:06,195
Do you think I'm someone you can manipulate at will?

380
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:10,490
A toy that pleases you

381
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:12,826
Just because you are a simple and ignorant rich girl...

382
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:14,995
How dare you speak to me like that?

383
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,291
You think I can't see?

384
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:24,171
How much you enjoy eliciting emotional responses from others

385
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:27,007
You and your Korean boyfriend

386
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,884
What a scandal!

387
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,470
You crave attention so much

388
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:35,015
It's just pathetic

389
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:38,894
I don't care what others think of me

390
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:41,063
This is the difference between me and you

391
00:33:41,563 --> 00:33:43,982
You let others define you

392
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,276
Think about it.

393
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,154
- Who is the sad one?
- roll

394
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,407
I don't

395
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:55,285
I won't let you go

396
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,792
I don't want to be with you anymore

397
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:09,591
Because I know the truth?

398
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:11,802
Is it because of this?

399
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:19,685
What do you think you know?

400
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:22,103
You know nothing

401
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:32,864
Oh but you knew that, right?

402
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:44,042
That man is your father

403
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:45,918
- Gao Hanshui is...
- I told you to shut up

404
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:10,694
(suite)

405
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:16,033
I must see Gao Hanshui immediately

406
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:19,369
- It's getting late...
- Let him in

407
00:35:30,214 --> 00:35:32,007
I'll call you if I need you.

408
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:39,014
Sit down

409
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:40,933
You shouldn't have seen her at all.

410
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:45,562
Qiuzi broke her promise to me

411
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:48,690
So when I tried to end the relationship

412
00:35:49,233 --> 00:35:51,318
She said something absolutely ridiculous to me.

413
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:53,820
That's totally...

414
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:57,282
Doesn't make sense

415
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:00,994
Although her words are not worth worrying about

416
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,332
But I want to hear your reaction.

417
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:07,501
What did she say?

418
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:11,421
She said

419
00:36:15,425 --> 00:36:16,552
Who are you...

420
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,932
my father

421
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:34,403
Tell me this isn't true

422
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:48,625
It's true

423
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,555
I was a fishmonger at the time.

424
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:04,850
I travel back and forth between Osaka and Busan

425
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:10,272
I haven't been back to my hometown for almost 16 years.

426
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,236
I don't think it will affect me.
But that's not the case

427
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:20,866
Did you force her?

428
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:23,535
Of course not

429
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,455
But you took advantage of her

430
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:29,208
Definitely

431
00:37:29,208 --> 00:37:31,084
Do you hope so?

432
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:35,714
I played with a poor country girl?

433
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:39,426
Instead of accepting the fact that she loves me...

434
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:40,594
That's impossible

435
00:37:43,222 --> 00:37:44,681
You are a mean person

436
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,517
Forgetting righteousness when seeing profit

437
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:48,268
And selfish

438
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:52,397
What about you?

439
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,777
Because of the blood flowing in my body

440
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:00,364
It flows in your body

441
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:06,036
Not the one you've had for so many years
Call it father's trash

442
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:09,039
Why do you say I'm mean?

443
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,791
I see you

444
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:13,961
That night on the farm

445
00:38:13,961 --> 00:38:15,337
What's wrong?

446
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:17,965
What did I tell you?

447
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:21,385
Looking forward

448
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:22,886
Noah

449
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,557
Always look forward

450
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:37,025
That day

451
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:40,696
I know you heard me

452
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:44,783
You didn't look back

453
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:50,205
You are my child

454
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:55,419
Noah

455
00:38:57,963 --> 00:39:00,132
We can finally stop hiding.

456
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:03,719
Go home and rest

457
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:06,305
You'll figure it out tomorrow morning when you wake up.

458
00:39:06,889 --> 00:39:08,515
Everything will be different

459
00:39:10,434 --> 00:39:12,186
They will bow down to us

460
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:17,649
I will make sure of this

461
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:57,397
They are the enemy

462
00:39:58,106 --> 00:39:59,650
That's what we heard

463
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:06,573
They were going to come and rape our women
Destroy our homes

464
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:10,702
I believed them

465
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:18,252
I think of my wife

466
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:21,713
Our unborn child

467
00:40:22,923 --> 00:40:24,716
And my parents

468
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,054
They were still alive at that time

469
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:37,688
Everyone is exhausted

470
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:39,439
Hungry

471
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:49,867
High temperature

472
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:56,623
Insects use us as food

473
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:06,550
We were like zombies for those few months

474
00:41:09,678 --> 00:41:14,057
We have almost no humanity in that situation.

475
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:22,733
So I thought, "This is how we're going to die"

476
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:27,196
That's what I thought at the time

477
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,494
Then

478
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:38,415
After the military order was issued

479
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:45,130
My soul has left my body

480
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:50,677
I obeyed the order

481
00:41:57,184 --> 00:42:00,103
But that is not the final order.

482
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:02,397
There is another one

483
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:10,489
"Forget everything"

484
00:42:12,324 --> 00:42:14,159
They told us this

485
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:18,914
I obeyed that order.

486
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,258
We are all idiots

487
00:42:30,551 --> 00:42:33,387
I thought the past could be forgotten

488
00:42:35,681 --> 00:42:37,641
So what else can we do?

489
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:44,147
Living in that shackles for the rest of my life?

490
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:12,009
Wish you all the best

491
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:52,966
so

492
00:43:52,966 --> 00:43:57,763
No doubt

493
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:03,727
But why is there such confusion?

494
00:44:03,727 --> 00:44:08,273
Five hundred years together?

495
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:11,818
Is this

496
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:18,700
A trick of fate?

497
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:22,162
My Future

498
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:29,670
Now it is bleak

499
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:33,090
So there is no doubt

500
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:51,191
Noah

501
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:53,569
Why did you come back?

502
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:54,653
Mother

503
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:58,448
What's wrong? What happened?

504
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:00,325
only...

505
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:02,786
I want to see you

506
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,000
Did anything happen at school?

507
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,626
Homework too difficult?

508
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:10,752
no

509
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:13,547
I like reading

510
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:16,133
First time in a long time

511
00:45:17,092 --> 00:45:19,511
I feel like I can do anything

512
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:22,890
So why...

513
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:24,516
tell me

514
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:26,393
Why did you come back?

515
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:28,812
I already said

516
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:31,148
I want to see you

517
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:39,865
I'm going back now

518
00:45:40,574 --> 00:45:41,575
So fast?

519
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:44,620
You just got home

520
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:47,206
Stay tonight

521
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:48,665
You can leave tomorrow morning.

522
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:50,667
no

523
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,211
I have to go

524
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:54,463
I have a date with my friends

525
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:00,928
Then I'll take you to the train station.

526
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:02,012
It doesn't matter

527
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,766
I know you had a hard day today.

528
00:46:05,766 --> 00:46:07,851
I hope you rest mom

529
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:12,648
take care of yourself

530
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:15,484
Noah

531
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,695
Mom, everything is fine.

532
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:55,816
Noah

533
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:57,693
Noah

534
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:00,112
Have you seen my son?

535
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:12,624
Noah...

536
00:47:35,355 --> 00:47:37,024
Breaking News

537
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:41,945
Masaru Abe, CEO of Viagra
Shocking news of suicide

538
00:47:41,945 --> 00:47:45,782
It caused a stir in elite financial circles

539
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:47,659
Mr. Abe is an important figure

540
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:52,331
But his latest development has been mired in controversy.

541
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:57,419
His body was found this morning.
Found in Chubu Sangaku National Park

542
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:00,923
Witnesses on the mountain trail

543
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:05,928
The description says that a man fell from the top of a cliff

544
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:10,349
When the police searched the area

545
00:48:10,349 --> 00:48:14,686
Mr. Abe's shoes were found but no suicide note

546
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,773
Investigation ongoing

547
00:48:18,732 --> 00:48:19,816
Next news...

548
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:25,489
He has no money and no one to turn to.
Where can I go?

549
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:27,533
My men are still looking for him.

550
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,451
Search nationwide

551
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:31,078
It's been a few weeks.

552
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:33,664
We searched everywhere

553
00:48:33,664 --> 00:48:34,998
No sign of him

554
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:38,669
I'll find him anyway.

555
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:41,421
I won't give up

556
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:45,759
See us

557
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:48,720
It's our fault

558
00:48:50,472 --> 00:48:52,599
Sooner or later it will become like this

559
00:48:53,642 --> 00:48:54,768
Stop talking nonsense.

560
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:56,353
It's true

561
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:58,730
We destroyed him.

562
00:48:58,730 --> 00:48:59,815
No

563
00:49:01,233 --> 00:49:04,778
Shanci, you have made so many sacrifices.

564
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:06,280
I have committed so many sins

565
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,949
It's all for him

566
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:12,202
He said he didn't want

567
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:16,540
I should have known.

568
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:32,931
That night

569
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:37,561
He came back to say goodbye

570
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:44,818
Let me not worry about him needing to say that

571
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:52,451
He is soft-hearted

572
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:19,561
He left

573
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:24,441
There is no trace of him

574
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:32,407
Kindness

575
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:54,573
Mr. Gao

576
00:51:54,573 --> 00:51:59,286
Why didn't you tell me you were back in Osaka?

577
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:02,623
cheers

578
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:06,752
Oh no

579
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:10,589
I'm drunk

580
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:18,889
Mr. Gao, do you want to have some fun?

581
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,225
Mr. Gao?

582
00:52:22,893 --> 00:52:23,977
Get out of here

583
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:49,211
Go ahead

584
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:41,597
When I was a kid

585
00:53:42,431 --> 00:53:47,728
My father would tell me about the horses that used to run freely in Yeongdo.

586
00:53:49,563 --> 00:53:51,148
Maxima

587
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:54,985
They run day and night

588
00:53:55,527 --> 00:54:00,365
The speed is so fast that even my own shadow can't keep up

589
00:54:00,365 --> 00:54:03,660
Their bodies will separate from their shadows.

590
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:13,212
Moses

591
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:15,380
I...

592
00:54:16,798 --> 00:54:18,884
Sometimes I wonder

593
00:54:20,469 --> 00:54:23,597
Why do some people survive in this world?

594
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:26,183
Some people can't?

595
00:54:27,601 --> 00:54:30,062
Because some people discovered their own shadows

596
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:32,731
Didn't some other people notice it?

597
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:37,778
Because if a body

598
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:41,657
You can't live without a shadow.

599
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,578
Our shadows make us understand

600
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:50,457
Where are you?

601
00:54:57,422 --> 00:54:59,216
anyway

602
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:04,096
You and I are still here

603
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:08,475
Even though so many people we loved are gone

604
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:10,561
We are still

605
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:13,105
Sit at this table

606
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:20,237
Solomon is also

607
00:56:04,364 --> 00:56:09,953
(Nagano)

608
00:56:27,137 --> 00:56:29,014
Excuse me

609
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:30,891
Do you need workers?

610
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:35,312
I'm looking for a job

611
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:43,403
You are not Korean?

612
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:45,113
no

613
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:46,990
I am not

614
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:50,244
I work very hard

615
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:52,496
I promise

616
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,627
So

617
00:56:58,627 --> 00:57:00,212
Let's see how you do.

618
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:11,3 06
I forgot to ask your name

619
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:18,730
My name is Ogawa

620
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:22,526
Ogawa Port

621
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:14,304
