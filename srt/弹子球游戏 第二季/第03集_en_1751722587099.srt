1
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:13,805
Japanese dialogue subtitled in blue.
Korean dialogue subtitled in yellow.

2
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:43,836
(in Korean) Noa!

3
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:46,505
Sunja, we're here.

4
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,303
There he is!

5
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,852
I see him!

6
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:02,771
Where have you been?

7
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:04,188
We need to leave at once.

8
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,778
My husband is dead.

9
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,532
Sunja, who are these men?

10
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,952
This is Koh Hansu, a family friend.

11
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,371
He's found us a place
in the countryside.

12
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,624
Our instructions are
to go to the shelter.

13
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:24,585
Those shelters will not protect you.

14
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:27,337
But my husband is not here.

15
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:29,006
We can't just leave
without his permission.

16
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,633
By the time you get it,
you will all be dead.

17
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:35,304
Once the bombing starts,
the Americans will be relentless.

18
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,722
You must go.

19
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,225
I know this is all very sudden,
but we can trust them.

20
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,311
Mr. Koh will keep us safe.

21
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,314
Go inside. Pack only what you need.

22
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,232
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

23
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,531
Noa, pack another blanket!

24
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,000
What are you doing? There's no time.

25
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,794
I can't just throw these away.

26
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:12,174
These are our family heirlooms.
My husband and I--

27
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,092
Do you not understand what is happening?

28
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,011
I am not that stupid!

29
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,681
But these have been with us
for generations.

30
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,767
I will not lose them.

31
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,896
Move aside.

32
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,232
Go finish packing. I'll do this.

33
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,153
Hurry now.

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,075
Mozasu, where's your hat?

35
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,576
I already packed it!

36
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,319
Hurry and get in.

37
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,240
Quickly.

38
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:42,931
Jiyun…

39
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,434
She has no one.

40
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,604
That's not possible.
We can't stop the car now.

41
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,397
Otherwise, we'd never get out.

42
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,237
I'm sure she and the children
are already safe in the shelters.

43
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,031
We'll meet her again.

44
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,451
(in Japanese) Fill the buckets!

45
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:19,259
Get in! Get in! Quickly! Cover the top!

46
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,227
Let us in!

47
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,479
Take mercy on us!

48
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,190
My daughter! She's sick!

49
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:36,568
Let us in!

50
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,269
You're up.

51
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:36,522
We're finally here.

52
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,779
Mozasu, be careful.

53
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,210
Sunja, are we really meant to stay here?

54
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,503
Is that what is happening?

55
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,048
I've called some men
to get this place in order.

56
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,092
They'll bring the necessary supplies.

57
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,427
Blankets and such things.

58
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,679
But it's a dirt floor.

59
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,514
And there's no kitchen.

60
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:54,683
When will we be able to go back home?

61
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,560
The war must end first.

62
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,646
I doubt your home is
even standing now.

63
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,024
I've asked Kim Changho
to stay with you as well.

64
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,028
That's impossible.

65
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,405
That man is a stranger to us.

66
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,325
Sunja, you know Yoseb
would never allow this. Never.

67
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,659
She's right.

68
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,245
How could we live
with a man we barely know?

69
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,955
Don't say such ridiculous things.

70
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,208
Do you think this is the city?

71
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,751
You must think of the children.

72
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,003
You are forgetting
that I grew up in the country.

73
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,214
- As did I.
- With all due respect,

74
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,132
you had servants
to see to all of your needs.

75
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,259
And you…

76
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,720
You haven't been in the country
in nearly 14 years.

77
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,306
In times like these, people change.

78
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:37,392
You don't know
what desperate people can do.

79
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,311
Listen to me.

80
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,190
He stays. I trust him.

81
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:46,860
There's much to be done.

82
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:51,865
Noa, help me unload the car.

83
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:55,327
Kyunghee, I know
this is not what we expected--

84
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,079
Hear me on this.

85
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,123
It's not the squalor I fear.
I'm fine with that.

86
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,376
Nor am I scared of the hard work.

87
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,877
I promise you that.

88
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,800
But seeing all this--

89
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,719
Knowing that I am no better
than an animal…

90
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,849
And with Yoseb so far away…

91
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,823
Is there really nowhere else to go?

92
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:33,907
There isn't.

93
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,660
Not for the likes of us.

94
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,873
I'll do my best
to make this more comfortable for you.

95
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,875
I do not want that.

96
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,710
Nor do I want you to misunderstand me.

97
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,088
Though I am grateful
for all that you've done,

98
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,425
I want nothing more from you.

99
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:56,346
To accept my help,
is that so unbearable to you?

100
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,267
- To help both of you--
- It frightens me.

101
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,147
You don't need to worry.
He'll never know.

102
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,440
He's a clever boy.

103
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,860
- He'll sense something--
- He will never suspect.

104
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,570
It's something he can't even imagine.

105
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:12,863
It's dangerous.

106
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,490
Do you think I would do anything
to jeopardize my son?

107
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,454
How am I to know?

108
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,790
You speak as if we know one another.

109
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,752
We do not.

110
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,588
That's not true.

111
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,675
Fourteen years.

112
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,179
I am no longer that girl at the cove.

113
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:42,351
I am now…

114
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,158
I'm a widow now.

115
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,994
Like my mother.

116
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,312
Sunja.

117
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,081
I have a mind to ask
the foreman if it's true.

118
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,417
Don't bother.

119
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,336
Just look at them!
Look how fat they got.

120
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,715
It's obvious
they're getting more than us.

121
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,302
Ignore them.

122
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,221
How can I? They never stop talking.

123
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,684
I wish you would tell me
what they were really saying.

124
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,853
What good does it do you?

125
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,566
They said I was fat, didn't they?

126
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,401
At least I understood that word.

127
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,029
We do the same work,

128
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,281
but they make it seem
like we're lazing around.

129
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,366
It's not the first time
you've heard this talk before.

130
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,910
Why are you so bothered?

131
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,079
It's the pretty one who pisses me off.

132
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,415
Look at her!

133
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,292
Thinking she's better than us.

134
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,296
Really, who is she to put on airs?

135
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,257
Move your hands like your mouths,

136
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,092
and you might actually be done already.

137
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:47,304
Look!
Everyone else picks up the slack.

138
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,348
Who are you to tell us what to do?

139
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,143
We don't work for your kind!

140
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:58,982
You sure about that?

141
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,653
What's all that chatter?

142
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,322
Get back to work.

143
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,335
Got a problem?

144
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,722
Go! Get outta here!

145
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:31,890
She's getting away!

146
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:32,975
Help me!

147
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:34,852
She wants to be free!

148
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,062
Keep going! Don't let him catch you!

149
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,317
Hurry, run away!

150
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:45,487
- Mozasu, she's getting away!
- Keep going! Go!

151
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:46,572
Help!

152
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,451
- Help us.
- Go!

153
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:53,579
Mr. Kim, here, here!

154
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,498
Got her.

155
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,418
Not fair. It was two against one.

156
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,003
No thanks to you.

157
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,462
Okay to bring her back?

158
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,095
This is so much more fun than school.

159
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,847
Don't you agree?

160
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,516
I hope we never go back.

161
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,645
The war's not going to last forever.

162
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:23,317
Besides, is this really
what you want to do with your life?

163
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,862
Chase after chickens
and clean their shit?

164
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,907
Sounds okay to me.

165
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:35,162
What if Koh Hansu
hadn't brought us here?

166
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,373
We're so lucky, aren't we?

167
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:39,958
But it wasn't fair of Mother.

168
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,878
What took her so long
to introduce Koh-san to us?

169
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:47,132
Think of all the candy
we could've eaten.

170
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,384
What a waste.

171
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,560
Excuse me.

172
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:05,233
You probably don't remember me.

173
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,444
I was here the other night.

174
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:10,989
I remember.

175
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,659
I was worried.

176
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,368
Your grandson,

177
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,746
how is he?

178
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:25,921
He should not have said
what he did that night.

179
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,590
It was not like him.

180
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:32,469
No, I disagree.

181
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:38,058
The man behind the counter,
he was out of line.

182
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:42,312
It took courage
for your grandson to speak up.

183
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,902
I see that I am making you
uncomfortable.

184
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,613
That is not my intention.

185
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,198
I apologize.

186
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:36,658
What do you want, Solomon?

187
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,498
The landowner, she wants to sell.

188
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,126
And it's for real this time.

189
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,630
Man, you must be really desperate.

190
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,090
Of course you are.

191
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,885
Heard about that fund
you tried to put together.

192
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,095
Sorry it didn't work out for you.

193
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:02,726
Abe. He's the target.

194
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,443
Get out of here. You haven't changed.

195
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:13,737
But I have.

196
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,991
And with only three months left
in my bank account,

197
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,702
you could say you're looking
at someone with nothing to lose.

198
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,454
No? But you need my help, right?

199
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,456
- I do.
- Okay.

200
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,791
Why would I do that?

201
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,046
Because this thing you've got here,

202
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,132
sweating it out behind that desk,

203
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,260
playing the good rank-and-file soldier,

204
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:40,097
that's not the Tom Andrews
who once reigned on the leaderboard

205
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,557
for eight years running.

206
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,937
Then again, you didn't have
their crosshairs on your back, did you?

207
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,856
What are you talking about, Solomon?

208
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,400
I'm talking about
the real reason why you're here, Tom.

209
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,112
Why New York sent you away.

210
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,838
You heard about my gross negligence
of clients' assets, huh?

211
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,516
Not that I need to explain myself to you,

212
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,230
but it was one guy--
one fucking guy who was out to get me.

213
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:35,569
'Cause I had the nerve to tell him
he didn't have the Midas fucking touch.

214
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,487
And then he just went
on a rampage against me,

215
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:41,825
and he dug through
every single fucking one of my trades.

216
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:44,453
Guess what did it?

217
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:46,955
Baldwin United.

218
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,291
Who the fuck is that? Doesn't matter.

219
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,542
It doesn't matter, Solomon.

220
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,753
There were irregularities on the forms.

221
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,463
Not that I filled them out.

222
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:57,633
Of course not.
That was some dipshit analyst, like you.

223
00:20:57,716 --> 00:20:59,259
But the firm cleared you.

224
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:00,385
Eventually, yeah.

225
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,304
Still banished me.

226
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:09,228
Hello, Tokyo, my prison sentence.

227
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:15,734
So what do you want, Tom?

228
00:21:21,073 --> 00:21:24,034
I want to see my kids
more than once a year.

229
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:28,664
I would settle for
them just not hating my guts.

230
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:31,166
No, what I really want

231
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,671
is for my ex-wife
just to nail a rich, new husband

232
00:21:35,754 --> 00:21:37,297
so she'd leave me the fuck alone.

233
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:38,924
That would be so nice.

234
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,474
No, that's not what you really want, Tom.

235
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:50,978
You want to go home.

236
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:52,813
Isn't that really it?

237
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:08,954
What if I told you that
this time next year you could be home?

238
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,832
Out of this firm,

239
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:14,585
set up with your own comfortable fund
to start your next gig,

240
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:18,589
to show the world
that Tom Andrews hasn't lost it.

241
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,387
I'm serious. It can happen.

242
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:29,558
Of course, there are strings attached.

243
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:56,460
Mama! I knew he would come!

244
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:57,711
Mozasu!

245
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:00,297
Hey, wait!

246
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,804
Mr. Koh!

247
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,436
Mama, look!

248
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,814
I didn't realize
how much I missed the music.

249
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,234
Sunja, listen to that.

250
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,362
It's nothing,
but I am glad you are pleased.

251
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:25,906
What else have you brought us?

252
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,991
- Mozasu!
- There.

253
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,369
Wow!

254
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:33,038
Look, Noa! I told you he'd bring some.

255
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,414
My favorite.

256
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,333
Noa, those are for you.

257
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:39,336
I want you to read them. Carefully.

258
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,964
You want me to translate them for you?

259
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,800
I know how to read them.
What I want to know is if you can.

260
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,760
I'm not talking about the language,

261
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:49,596
but what is said and what isn't.

262
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,892
In other words,
you must learn to read what is not there.

263
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,771
Wow, there's so much here.

264
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,068
What is this?

265
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,112
Go easy with that.

266
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,072
Have you flown a kite before?

267
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:08,699
No, never.

268
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:12,661
Then shall we see how you both do?

269
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:13,954
Yes!

270
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,833
- Let's go.
- Let's go down to the river.

271
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,543
It'll be perfect!

272
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:20,627
Come!

273
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:23,797
What are you doing?

274
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:29,344
Sunja, every boy should know
how to fly a kite.

275
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,519
Boys.

276
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,066
You know, you should be careful.

277
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:47,738
I heard the guy who used to
have this office didn't do so well.

278
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:51,783
Do you think he failed
because of the office?

279
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,493
I don't know about that.

280
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,370
But I heard he was…

281
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:59,082
a bit too much.

282
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,421
Rather full of himself.

283
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,510
I heard he thought he was American.

284
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,096
That might explain it.

285
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:18,602
Why are you here?

286
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,896
I came to tell Tom the good news.

287
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,191
The landowner has decided to sell.

288
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,487
And you had a part in this, I assume.

289
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:30,656
I did.

290
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:33,158
- What's your share?
- Five percent.

291
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:37,579
I see.

292
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:40,874
Congratulations.

293
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,000
Thanks.

294
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:49,883
Is there anything else?

295
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,305
I want you to know…

296
00:25:57,224 --> 00:25:59,810
you should be the one
running this place.

297
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:08,443
You work harder than anyone here.

298
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:10,487
You're smarter too.

299
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:15,701
Knowing this must drive one crazy.

300
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:21,832
Because that day will never come,

301
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,918
and we both know it.

302
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,885
No matter how much you deserve it.

303
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:37,472
I'm sorry for that.

304
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,153
I'm rooting for you.

305
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:53,572
I mean it.

306
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,543
One moment.

307
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,826
Would you like to have dinner?

308
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:44,373
You mean like a date?

309
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,544
Is that how Americans do things?

310
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:51,797
Define everything?

311
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,301
No. I just want to know
whether to shower first.

312
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,973
Please shower.

313
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:06,103
One condition.

314
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,771
What's that?

315
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:10,399
I choose the spot.

316
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:00,991
Here you go.

317
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,955
They're gobbling all the food today.

318
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,875
You would think
they haven't eaten in days.

319
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:15,005
Hardly true.
Since I fed them their fill yesterday.

320
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:18,884
So you come every day?

321
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:21,011
Except the weekends.

322
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:23,972
Too many kids on the weekends.

323
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,518
You don't like kids?

324
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,144
No, I love kids.

325
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:31,021
Well, not all of them.

326
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:34,858
But they're scared of the kids.

327
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:39,154
Take some.

328
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:48,497
Oh, I don't like that one.

329
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:52,042
He's stealing all the food.

330
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,002
Why do you assume it's a he?

331
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:55,963
That's a she.

332
00:29:57,673 --> 00:29:58,799
Really?

333
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,678
But watch out for that one.

334
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:06,181
Once he starts,
he doesn't know when to stop.

335
00:30:07,766 --> 00:30:10,561
They're worse than
the pigs in the Ikaino Ward.

336
00:30:12,271 --> 00:30:14,648
Is that where you grew up?

337
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:16,859
No.

338
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:20,028
I was born in Yeongdo.

339
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:23,365
Yeongdo? Where is that?

340
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,872
It's not here.

341
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:35,419
I have much to do.

342
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:37,087
I should be off.

343
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:45,596
My grandson.

344
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:46,763
He's a good boy.

345
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:51,643
But he's struggling at the moment.

346
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,191
It must be a hard time.

347
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:02,362
Not easy.

348
00:31:03,405 --> 00:31:08,202
For him, I had hoped
things would be different.

349
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,539
When I was his age,

350
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:18,086
I stood in ration lines,
and trained in air raid drills.

351
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,882
We thought the Americans
would come slaughter us.

352
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:31,767
You can't blame him

353
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,102
for not living in a world gone mad,
can you?

354
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:40,567
But doesn't that mean
things should be easier for him?

355
00:31:41,944 --> 00:31:42,945
No.

356
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:47,991
No matter the times, life is never easy.

357
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,452
Unless we're gods.

358
00:31:58,043 --> 00:32:00,462
Time for you all to fly away!

359
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:21,942
Go higher!

360
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:23,235
There you go!

361
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:25,904
Faster, faster!

362
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:29,283
Make it go higher.

363
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:30,742
Keep going!

364
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:34,538
- Don't let it drop!
- Faster!

365
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:37,958
More! There we go!

366
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:42,504
Mozasu, be careful not to trip!

367
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:45,841
This is fun! Wait for me!

368
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:06,028
Noa! Mozasu!

369
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:08,572
Noa!

370
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:14,703
Mama!

371
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:17,789
- Mozasu, come to me.
- Mama.

372
00:33:38,018 --> 00:33:39,978
They're heading north.

373
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:43,774
If they were aiming for Nagasaki,
they would've gone the other way.

374
00:33:46,652 --> 00:33:48,445
Those planes are not for your husband.

375
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:57,871
- Kyunghee!
- I would leave her be.

376
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:19,935
There. All done.

377
00:34:22,771 --> 00:34:27,693
My brother-in-law is lucky
to get such a blessed package.

378
00:34:28,819 --> 00:34:30,904
They must all envy him.

379
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:32,906
I hope so.

380
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:34,949
I hope it fits.

381
00:34:36,827 --> 00:34:38,328
I'll go drop them off.

382
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,621
It's late. Go in the morning.

383
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:43,083
The foreman told me
he's going to the post tomorrow.

384
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,210
I want to send these off
as soon as possible.

385
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:49,755
Besides, I don't know
if I'll get much sleep tonight.

386
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,094
Kyunghee,

387
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,391
I'm sure he's fine.

388
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:03,937
I know.

389
00:35:07,441 --> 00:35:08,859
But what about tomorrow?

390
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:11,528
Or the day after?

391
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:20,037
You can't promise me
he'll always be safe.

392
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,330
It's not possible.

393
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,667
We're all together…

394
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:28,587
And to think of him all alone…

395
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:32,132
It doesn't seem fair.

396
00:35:51,527 --> 00:35:52,528
Noa.

397
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:56,240
Enough of that.

398
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:57,407
Go to bed.

399
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:09,086
You…

400
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:13,131
Your father,

401
00:36:14,383 --> 00:36:16,051
you mustn't forget him.

402
00:36:16,927 --> 00:36:18,178
You know that?

403
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,474
How could I?

404
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:46,081
I knew it. We have a thief!

405
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:49,585
Someone's stealing the eggs!

406
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:52,671
What is it?

407
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:54,298
For the past few days,

408
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:56,592
I've been finding
fewer and fewer eggs.

409
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:59,011
When I told the foreman,

410
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:01,013
he said I was right.

411
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:03,932
He was so mad.

412
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:07,853
But I promised him
we would catch the thief.

413
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:10,022
Why would you promise him such a thing?

414
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:11,481
How will you catch him?

415
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:15,986
I was thinking we could lay a trap.

416
00:37:16,945 --> 00:37:18,864
- A trap?
- What is that?

417
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,657
That's not going to work.

418
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:24,661
If you really want to get this thief,
you need to do a stakeout.

419
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,496
Catch him in the act.

420
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,706
That's right!

421
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:30,209
Mama, can I do it? Please.

422
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,755
Is it safe?
What if it's someone dangerous?

423
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:37,966
I think between the two boys and me,
we have enough muscle.

424
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,134
Whoever it is.

425
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:42,554
Better to nab the fella right away
nip this in the bud.

426
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:45,933
Mama, he knows these things.

427
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:47,809
You can tell just by looking at him.

428
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,104
- You're sure it's okay--
- Then it's a plan.

429
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:52,731
Go tell your brother.

430
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:56,568
After dinner, we'll go find
the perfect spot to stake out.

431
00:37:56,652 --> 00:37:59,446
- How's that sound?
- I love this plan.

432
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,114
I'll let my brother know.

433
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:03,700
This place gets better and better.

434
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:06,703
Are you sure?

435
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,664
Do not worry.

436
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:12,251
Probably just some hungry villagers
snooping around.

437
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:16,088
Would it be okay if I came along?

438
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:19,925
You want to come with us?

439
00:38:20,008 --> 00:38:22,886
This is the first time
I've heard about a stakeout.

440
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,179
It sounds exciting.

441
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:29,977
But if I'm going to be in the way--

442
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,979
I'm sure the boys
will be happy to have you.

443
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:46,493
You've had yakitori before, haven't you?

444
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:47,578
Of course.

445
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:50,873
Welcome!

446
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,084
Two beers, please.

447
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:10,475
The food's good here.

448
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:12,936
And it's cheap.

449
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,564
Perfect for my situation.

450
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:20,152
Thank you.

451
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:36,752
You know…

452
00:39:39,171 --> 00:39:42,716
I get that things haven't been easy
between us.

453
00:39:44,927 --> 00:39:47,304
That's mostly my fault.

454
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:52,518
But this is where I am now.

455
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,479
I'm done pretending.

456
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:01,443
If this doesn't work for you…

457
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:04,780
you're free to walk away.

458
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:07,824
No hard feelings.

459
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:13,121
But I want you to know this.

460
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:19,378
I'm not always going to be this low.

461
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:22,214
I'm smart.

462
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:23,674
Hungry.

463
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,095
I know the rules of the game now.

464
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:33,350
And I won't make it at the expense
of those who don't deserve it.

465
00:40:35,185 --> 00:40:36,854
But those who do…

466
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:43,360
they're fair game.

467
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:51,743
As I said, if this doesn't work for you,

468
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:55,247
I'll understand.

469
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:16,810
Cheers.

470
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:24,818
Cheers.

471
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:36,413
It's been hours.

472
00:41:37,623 --> 00:41:40,042
How much longer do we have to wait?

473
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:42,628
It's only been two hours.

474
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,047
And be quiet.

475
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,924
You're going to scare away any thief.

476
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:48,425
Mozasu.

477
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:50,677
We might not catch anyone tonight.

478
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:53,597
If he's clever,
he'll stay away for a few nights.

479
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:57,184
You mean tonight could be a bust?

480
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:58,894
Who's to say?

481
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:07,736
Mr. Kim, where did you meet Mr. Koh?

482
00:42:09,238 --> 00:42:10,239
Noa.

483
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:12,407
That's disrespectful.

484
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:13,784
It's fine.

485
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:18,455
I can tell you've been wanting to ask
for some time now.

486
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,253
I met him down at the docks
15 years ago.

487
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,296
I was working there then.

488
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,550
Taking whatever jobs I could find

489
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:32,010
and getting into a lot of trouble.

490
00:42:32,845 --> 00:42:34,263
What kind of trouble?

491
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:36,807
Getting into fistfights.

492
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,058
I was stupid.

493
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:41,144
Ignorant.

494
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:42,646
Angry as well.

495
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:45,232
A dangerous combination.

496
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:47,776
Why were you angry?

497
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:03,041
Back in Korea,
my father had a small farm.

498
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,670
It wasn't much, but he kept us fed.

499
00:43:07,504 --> 00:43:09,381
But when the Japanese came in,

500
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:13,844
the farmers were ordered
to register the size of their land.

501
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:19,057
A clerk made a mistake,
reported my father's land too large.

502
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:26,940
When the tax bill came,
my father couldn't afford to pay it.

503
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:31,570
The land was taken from him.

504
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:35,365
Eventually,

505
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:40,787
my younger siblings were sent away
to various family members.

506
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:46,126
My mother cried many bitter tears
over that.

507
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:51,673
And the love she had for my father,

508
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:54,551
it soured.

509
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:03,227
One morning,
my father went out into the fields.

510
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:06,897
The fields that were once his.

511
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,985
He did not come back.

512
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:19,284
I buried him there…

513
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:25,123
where his potatoes once grew.

514
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:30,003
And I left home shortly after that.

515
00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:46,603
Look there!

516
00:44:48,605 --> 00:44:50,732
Just how many of them are there?

517
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:56,947
Man the gates.

518
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,289
Busted! Run!

519
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,958
- Go, go!
- Brother, are you okay?

520
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,168
They're getting away!

521
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:10,711
Don't worry about them.

522
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:13,046
I got one.

523
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:19,261
It's him!

524
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:22,181
You know this boy?

525
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:24,892
He's the one
who tormented Noa in school.

526
00:45:24,975 --> 00:45:27,895
Please. If the teachers at the temple
find out, they'll beat me.

527
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:30,606
You're one of the evacuees?

528
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,693
Why are you stealing our eggs?

529
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:37,279
There's not enough food
for the 20 of us.

530
00:45:38,113 --> 00:45:39,615
We're always starving.

531
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:43,952
So what do you want to do with him?

532
00:45:47,164 --> 00:45:48,165
Me?

533
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:52,753
You decide.
I can let him go with a warning.

534
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:57,508
Or I take him back to the temple,
leave it to whatever happens.

535
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:07,809
Let him go.

536
00:46:07,893 --> 00:46:11,104
But he did so many mean things to you!

537
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:15,817
Go. Before Noa changes his mind.

538
00:46:18,654 --> 00:46:19,655
Hey!

539
00:46:29,498 --> 00:46:31,959
Make sure to share with the others.
You got that?

540
00:46:38,215 --> 00:46:40,175
How could you just let him go?

541
00:46:40,259 --> 00:46:41,802
You could've gotten back at him.

542
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:44,179
Your brother did the right thing.

543
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:47,891
Better to have an enemy owe you
than the other way around.

544
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,311
I bet Noa already knew that.

545
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:52,563
Really?

546
00:46:52,646 --> 00:46:54,731
I need to remember that.

547
00:47:00,112 --> 00:47:01,446
Let's go. It's late.

548
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:04,032
Wasn't that exciting, Auntie?

549
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:06,326
Too much so.

550
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:09,454
It's a wonder if
we'll be able to sleep tonight.

551
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:19,756
Hello?

552
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,175
<i>It's done.</i>

553
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:24,303
<i>The property now belongs to Abe-</i>san<i>.</i>

554
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:30,517
<i>We're all in now. This better work.</i>

555
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:33,645
It'll work. I know it.
