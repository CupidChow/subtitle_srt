1
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,393
(in Korean) Another one?

2
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,395
Just how many of them
are coming after us?

3
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:24,191
Don't you know how huge America is?

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,693
They must have, like,
thousands of soldiers.

5
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,655
And are they all coming here?

6
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,406
(in Japanese) Who knows?

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,284
But better to be ready than be sorry.

8
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,452
Don't you think?

9
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,413
That's right. You have a point.

10
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,047
But where's your brother?

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,174
I'm surprised he's not
on this mission with you.

12
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,386
Probably wandering around somewhere.

13
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,346
If he's not with that jerk,

14
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,891
then he's reading one of those
boring books from Koh Hansu.

15
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,853
Really, he's become no fun!
Really, he's become no fun!

16
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,022
I see you're feeling sore about things.

17
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:08,527
I mean, what's the point in living here

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,696
if you're not going to
have any fun, right?

19
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,491
But you must know this.

20
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,327
Your brother is
the head of the house now.

21
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:20,247
That's as much of a burden
as it is a privilege.

22
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,207
Where's the burden?

23
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,751
He always gets the first in everything.

24
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,086
He does,

25
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,172
but when he's older,

26
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,341
the burden of taking care of the family
falls on him.

27
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,470
No room for failure, not for the eldest.

28
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,641
You may not understand
what that means now,

29
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,061
but believe me,
yours is the easier life.

30
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,522
I know this well.

31
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,150
All right, get back at it.

32
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,203
I got it!

33
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,622
You had the better angle.
You had the better angle.

34
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:05,042
Excuses of a coward.

35
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,089
There's more snakes around here.

36
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,053
I'll show you who the real coward is.

37
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:24,895
You know, if the war keeps on like this,

38
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,981
we could live out here forever.

39
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,817
I wouldn't mind that.

40
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,570
Don't you want to get home?

41
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,031
I guess.

42
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,492
But I don't want to go back to school.

43
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,994
But you were so popular.

44
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,581
I suppose it's not school
as much as my father.

45
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,920
He's never passed an exam in his life,

46
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,799
but if I don't get the highest marks,
he's out for my blood.

47
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,302
And with you
at the top of the class this year,

48
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,263
I was always in trouble with him.

49
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:06,103
You should have seen his face
when my brother told him you were Korean.

50
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,230
He used both fists on me that night.

51
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,528
Hey!

52
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,614
Imagine if Ogawa-sensei saw us now.

53
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,535
He'd rub his eyes,
thinking there must be a mistake.

54
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,621
What's wrong?

55
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,168
So we're friends now?

56
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:34,381
Listen.

57
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,718
I know I was terrible to you.

58
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,596
And, well,

59
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,222
I'm sorry for it.

60
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,393
Can we be friends now?

61
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,359
Here.

62
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,497
Leave them alone.
They're about to break out of their skin.

63
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,084
To become what?

64
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,545
Who knows?

65
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:17,089
But they'll reveal themselves soon.

66
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,721
They're creepy.

67
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,114
Thank you. But--

68
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:42,991
Is there a problem?

69
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,204
None of your business. What do you care?

70
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,040
Mr. Kim is right to scold me.

71
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,502
I should get back to my work.

72
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,715
Fertilizer's on the truck.

73
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,468
Unload it before I get back.
Unload it before I get back.

74
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,461
Sunja, what is it?

75
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,508
Mother.

76
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:56,453
…students threw rocks,
temporarily holding off the army.

77
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,748
But shortly after 1:00 a.m.,
when the excitement of the crowd reached…

78
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:06,463
I'm away from the phone.
Please leave a message.

79
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:08,799
Solomon, are you there?

80
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,426
It's been a while
since I've heard your voice.

81
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,554
Call me when you're not busy.

82
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:17,057
Oh, it's your grandmother.

83
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,671
Grandmother, was the boat really big?

84
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,549
No, not that big.

85
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,427
Did it at least have a sail then?

86
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,679
No.

87
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,264
No sail either.

88
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,058
The boat was actually quite small.
The boat was actually quite small.

89
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:04,396
Especially when you consider
how many of us were on it.

90
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,317
All of us crammed so tightly
against one another

91
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,528
with those strong swells
crashing over us.

92
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,156
That journey hereâ€¦

93
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,035
it was difficult.

94
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:24,791
I really want to ride on a boat.

95
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,793
Why?

96
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,587
Where would you go?

97
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:31,924
Africa.

98
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:33,675
Africa?

99
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,304
Is that far?

100
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,014
So far.

101
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,268
In one of my manga books,
I saw a picture of a lion.

102
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,854
It looks so ferocious.

103
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,815
I really want to see one for myself.

104
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,192
A lion?

105
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,611
Lion.

106
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,405
Lion.

107
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,949
Lion.

108
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,290
Noa.

109
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,417
Mozasu.

110
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:15,634
You must not forget that you are Korean.

111
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,887
Korean to the bones,
that is who you are.

112
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,516
If we weren't Korean,
then who would we be?

113
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,770
You're right. So right.

114
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,738
Mozasu, sit. Let's eat.

115
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:40,492
Noa, will you pray tonight?

116
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,415
Dear Heavenly Father,

117
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:49,251
we thank you for
the meal you have provided us.

118
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:54,923
And we thank you for bringing
our grandmother safely over from Busan.

119
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,551
In Jesus' name we pray.

120
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,720
- Amen.
- Amen.

121
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,519
It's too much. Give some to the boys.

122
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:08,645
Eat.

123
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,397
Eat.

124
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,113
Grandmother, in your honor,

125
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:24,036
Auntie asked the foreman if we could
slaughter one of his chickens.

126
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,495
And he said yes.

127
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,498
I saw Mama twist the neck.

128
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,000
She was really good at it.

129
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,461
Your mother started when she was young.

130
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,588
Eat.

131
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,759
Mr. Koh Hansu!

132
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:44,223
All that you have done for usâ€¦
How could we possibly repay you?

133
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,683
There's no need. Please, sit.

134
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,062
When he couldn't find me
at the boardinghouse,

135
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,272
he sent his men to search for me.

136
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,900
It was no easy task.

137
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,988
Would you like to join us?

138
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,450
I've had my dinner,

139
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,994
but may I sit?

140
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,539
Please.

141
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,088
We will eat well tonight. Thank you.

142
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,309
See? Always first!

143
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:47,327
Be right there!

144
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,458
Just a second.

145
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:04,052
Grandmother. What are you doing here?

146
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,307
Didn't you get my message?

147
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,854
When's the last time you cleaned?

148
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:16,565
I did today.

149
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,486
But, Grandmother, why are you in Tokyo?

150
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,160
I had a dream.

151
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,915
A dream? About me?

152
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,209
I don't remember the details,

153
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,003
but when I woke up--

154
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:40,839
Are you expecting someone?

155
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:43,675
I was supposed to have dinner
with a friend.

156
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:45,135
She's here to pick me up.

157
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,975
- Did you see this?
- Naomi--

158
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,186
They're saying there are bones
beneath that land.

159
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,396
Who is that?

160
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,610
My grandmother.

161
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,324
She had some last-minute business
in Tokyo.

162
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,535
Ichizaki-san.

163
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,495
We used to work together at Shiffley's.

164
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,205
It is nice to meet you.

165
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,791
I apologize for my outburst.

166
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,793
Nice to meet you.

167
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,795
Is this a date?

168
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,339
Grandmother,
why are you embarrassing me?

169
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,591
Sorry to change our plans
at the last minute--

170
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:25,759
Do not worry.

171
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,219
You came so far.

172
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,179
I hope you enjoy your visit.

173
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,181
Were you going out for dinner?

174
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:33,976
Nowhere special.

175
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,186
Just the pasta place down the street.

176
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,647
Goodness.

177
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,525
Look at her. She's too skinny.

178
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,069
I'll call you later.

179
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,780
- Come in!
- It's okay.

180
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,490
You came all this way.

181
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:51,368
Please, I'll be fine.

182
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,121
You should see how much galbi-jjim
I brought from home.

183
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:57,916
And Solomon's favorite banchan.

184
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,835
Come.

185
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,298
Put on slippers!

186
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,383
His floors are dirty.

187
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,385
You really don't have to.

188
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,472
I'd love to take you up on your offer.

189
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,820
Last last night, 60 B-29s

190
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:32,492
indiscriminately firebombed
the city centerâ€¦

191
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:35,204
Your grandmother and I
used to fight so bitterly

192
00:16:35,287 --> 00:16:37,122
about me wanting to go to school.

193
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:41,835
It was a different time then.

194
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,925
Mother, I can teach you if you want.

195
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,843
To read?

196
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,180
It's too late for that now.

197
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,516
You're the one who needs to do well now.

198
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,850
Understand?

199
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:07,569
Goodness.

200
00:17:07,653 --> 00:17:10,781
How can one sleep in this heat?

201
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,160
I'm going to get some air.

202
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,244
Yes.

203
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:36,807
Kyunghee?

204
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:52,823
Is everything okay?

205
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,137
Why are you out so late?

206
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:17,598
I couldn't sleep.

207
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,600
But why are you still here?

208
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,728
- I was looking for the foreman.
- Is something wrong?

209
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,938
No.

210
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:26,815
Just something I need to deal with.

211
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:27,858
Wellâ€¦

212
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,238
I want to thank you again.

213
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,616
It was nothing.

214
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:36,700
That's not true.

215
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,661
I know it cost you a great deal.

216
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,374
I'll go now.

217
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:49,755
Sunja.

218
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,553
Have you ever driven a car?

219
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:00,807
A car?
A car?

220
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,019
Would you like to?

221
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,773
Are you joking?

222
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:10,192
I'm serious.

223
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,028
Get in.

224
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,739
Everyone should drive a car
at least once in their life.

225
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:19,826
Come now.

226
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,386
Release the brake gently.

227
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:39,930
Go.

228
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,479
Hello.

229
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,314
You wanna hear some good news?

230
00:19:49,857 --> 00:19:51,024
One moment.

231
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,152
I have to take this.

232
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,661
Try holding it like this.

233
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,916
These are too thin.

234
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,004
I don't cook much these days.

235
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:13,839
I can tell.

236
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,717
Just look at your hands.

237
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:22,139
What is it?

238
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,225
Just as you said.
Colton Hotels. They're balking.

239
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:29,479
- So they're pulling out?
- That's what it looks like.

240
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,149
This means
the ball's in your court now, Tom.

241
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:33,817
I know.

242
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,403
But before I go ahead, I have to ask.

243
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,863
Are you sure about this?

244
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,616
'Cause when Abe-san finds out it was you,

245
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,327
well, let's just say
no one's gonna envy you.

246
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:47,039
That's okay.
I don't need people to envy me.

247
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,083
Call in the loan.

248
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:56,465
I used to always help make dinner
when I was younger.

249
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:03,305
Every night, my mother would
set the table with a feast.
Every night, my mother would
set the table with a feast.

250
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:08,310
Then, my brother and I,

251
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:10,812
we would wait with her
for my father to come.

252
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:16,568
But he didn't come home much.

253
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:28,705
For so much of my life,

254
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:33,544
cooking was how I made my living.

255
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:38,549
But it's different.

256
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,761
The food you make for others

257
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:47,099
and the food you make for your family.

258
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,893
You can taste the difference.

259
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:59,027
Your mother's cooking,
I'm sure it was delicious.

260
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:14,960
He really struggled.

261
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:19,298
At Shiffley's.

262
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:23,886
With all of those people
hoping he would fail.

263
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:29,183
Perhaps I did as well.

264
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:34,396
But what he did on that land deal…

265
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:41,361
I've never seen anyone

266
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,657
take a stand like that before.

267
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:48,744
I was…

268
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,748
It empowered me.

269
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:04,718
Everything okay?

270
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:06,678
Of course.

271
00:23:07,346 --> 00:23:09,056
Why would you ask such a thing?

272
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:13,477
They should be thicker. Like this.

273
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,853
Let her be!

274
00:23:14,937 --> 00:23:16,813
She knows what to do.

275
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:35,249
I told you, you can't step on the gas
and clutch together.

276
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,636
You're really terrible at this.

277
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,399
There you go.
There you go.

278
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:03,193
You're doing well now.

279
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,713
People are sleeping.

280
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,090
Why are you here so late?

281
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:27,551
Follow me.
There's something I have to show you.

282
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,054
I can't. My mother will be back soon.

283
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:32,848
Trust me.

284
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,559
You'll regret missing this.

285
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:40,856
Hurry! Come on, Noa.

286
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:43,734
Noa!

287
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:48,989
Wait!

288
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:51,617
Wait for me!

289
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,298
It's delicious.

290
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:09,551
She'll like you now.

291
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:13,180
What are you talking about?
As if I wouldn't like her.

292
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,060
You must work long hours.

293
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:20,687
Do you enjoy the work?

294
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:24,608
Mostly, I'm proud of it.

295
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:28,403
Especially when the days are tough.

296
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:30,531
Are there many of those?

297
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:33,951
Honestly, too many to count.

298
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:38,038
But it's slowly getting better.

299
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:43,585
Actually, there's this deal
I'm working on.

300
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:45,796
It's the deal I've been waiting for.

301
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:47,506
What is it?

302
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:52,344
I've been tracking this company
for some time now.

303
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:56,348
- Yotsuba Finance.
- The personal lender?

304
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,978
I've convinced them to finally
let me take them public.
I've convinced them to finally
let me take them public.

305
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:03,772
Wow, that's amazing.

306
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,777
Has the prospectus gone out yet?

307
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:09,736
Next week.

308
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,154
What's the valuation range?

309
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:13,115
Between 30 to 50 billion yen.

310
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:15,659
What's the free float?
Will they go for 25%?

311
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,703
No, only 10% now.

312
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:22,040
I'm trying to convince
the founders to raise it,

313
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,586
but they're skittish.

314
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:27,212
That's the real money.

315
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,548
I know. I'm hoping to persuade them.

316
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,552
But this is strictly confidential.

317
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,431
It's company regulations.

318
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:39,600
Who am I going to tell?

319
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:43,353
All I know is that you seem so excited.

320
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,065
I have a good feeling about this.

321
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:50,068
This is the big one.

322
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,702
To tell the truth,

323
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:02,247
you showed me the way.
you showed me the way.

324
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:05,834
You mean I'm the cautionary tale.

325
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:13,342
You stood your ground,
and you got the deal done.

326
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:17,221
That halmoni sold? When?

327
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,974
We closed the deal a few days ago.

328
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:26,104
But didn't she say
she would never sell?

329
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:29,233
Why did she change her mind?

330
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,027
Did you go back to her?

331
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:34,404
It was her choice.

332
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:37,241
She made a lot of money.

333
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:39,868
She has no regrets.

334
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,873
Grandmother, don't look at me like that.

335
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:48,085
I didn't take advantage of her.

336
00:27:49,211 --> 00:27:50,546
Believe me.

337
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:55,092
The zucchini is good.

338
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,637
Not bad for your first time.

339
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:02,140
I was only helping your grandmother.
I was only helping your grandmother.

340
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,067
I should be getting back.

341
00:28:12,651 --> 00:28:14,653
Sunja will be worried about me.

342
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:17,739
If we were in Korea,

343
00:28:19,241 --> 00:28:22,035
I wouldn't even be able
to speak to someone like you.

344
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:26,915
But here…

345
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:31,545
you and I share a barn.

346
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:42,472
Will we ever return?

347
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,102
We'll return no matter what.

348
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,064
I won't die here.

349
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,109
I don't want that either.

350
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:00,073
And perhaps if we were to return…
And perhaps if we were to returnâ€¦

351
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:04,453
some of your sadness would be lifted.

352
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,416
My sadness?

353
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:11,752
It's in your eyes.

354
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,423
It oppresses me.

355
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,010
Because there's nothing
I can do about it.

356
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:26,892
I've spoken out of turn again.

357
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,522
Just because we have told
one another some stories,

358
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:34,316
let us not presume a friendship.

359
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:52,876
Watch out!

360
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,051
Are you okay?

361
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:02,636
I'm fine.

362
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:21,905
We'll have to push it out.

363
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:24,157
I can run and get Mr. Kim and Noa.

364
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:26,869
It's fine. The two of us can do this.

365
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,082
Push on three.

366
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:33,917
One, two, three!

367
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,588
Hurry, we'll miss it.

368
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,475
So many.

369
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:06,783
This is amazing.

370
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:14,458
I caught one!

371
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:17,586
One last time.

372
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:26,803
It's moving.

373
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,057
That's it.

374
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:31,975
That's it! That's it!

375
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,479
Enough.

376
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,822
We did it.

377
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:33,996
It's nothing.

378
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,247
We can't be doing this.

379
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,498
Sunja.

380
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:41,962
The two of us-- This is right
no matter what anyone says.

381
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,172
I know this.

382
00:32:46,216 --> 00:32:48,802
You have a family,
and I just lost my husband.

383
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:51,054
He's gone. You owe him nothing.

384
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:52,306
You're wrong.

385
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,100
I owe him everything.

386
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:58,812
And for how long?

387
00:33:00,314 --> 00:33:01,315
Tell me.

388
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,776
How much longer
must you serve that grave?

389
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,198
You deserve happiness as well.

390
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:11,366
You don't have to give everything up.

391
00:33:14,244 --> 00:33:16,330
Everything I do is for you.

392
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:17,998
For you and Noa. All of it!

393
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:23,545
In your heart, I know you feel it.

394
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:27,424
My heart-- It's too late.

395
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,933
Sunja.

396
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:17,641
Is it the heat keeping you up?

397
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,309
It's him, isn't it?

398
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,228
He's the father.

399
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,161
What's that?

400
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:46,795
Sunja, you know,

401
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:51,632
that boy must never know.

402
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:56,889
I know.

403
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:01,935
Whatever is happening
between the two of you,
Whatever is happening
between the two of you,

404
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,646
- you must be discreet--
- Mother.

405
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:10,402
You do not need to worry.

406
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:14,239
I remembered myself.

407
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,084
Let's wash you.

408
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:32,799
We must get that mud off you.

409
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,388
What's wrong, Koh-san?

410
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:39,473
Get out.

411
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,017
What are you doing?

412
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:47,272
You think you can steal from me
and I won't find out?

413
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:49,525
I don't know what you're talking about--

414
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,321
You think I'm that stupid?

415
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:55,239
Stay down.

416
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,207
Stop! Stop!

417
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,416
Please.

418
00:36:18,303 --> 00:36:21,598
Stop. Please!

419
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:24,935
Enough. Stop!

420
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:32,901
But it was just a few chickens.

421
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:34,027
Forgive me!

422
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:01,346
Noa!

423
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:06,852
Noa.

424
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:13,775
Noa!

425
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:56,652
Solomon, listen now.

426
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:02,783
Whatever it is you are doing,
whatever scheme you have in mind,
Whatever it is you are doing,
whatever scheme you have in mind,

427
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:06,286
I won't ask you about it anymore.

428
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:09,414
I don't want to hear your lies.

429
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:11,667
Instead,

430
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:14,503
I'll ask you one thing.

431
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,508
Do not forget who you are.

432
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:22,469
Can you do that?

433
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:25,931
I want to.

434
00:40:15,082 --> 00:40:16,250
Hello.

435
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:18,585
This is Kato.

436
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:22,381
Who is this?

437
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:27,177
Kato-san, this is Kim Sunja calling.

438
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:32,391
I'm just realizing how late it is.

439
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:36,395
Should I call back in the morning?

440
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:42,943
It's fine.
I've been waiting for your call.

441
00:40:43,861 --> 00:40:45,153
Waiting?

442
00:40:45,237 --> 00:40:47,531
I was beginning to lose hope.

443
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:52,286
I am in Tokyo.

444
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:55,622
To see my grandson.

445
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:57,165
I was worried for him.

446
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:01,670
But he had a date.
But he had a date.

447
00:41:03,672 --> 00:41:04,840
A girlfriend?

448
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:10,304
Who knows these days?

449
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:12,890
What is she like?

450
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:17,352
She's Japanese.

451
00:41:18,645 --> 00:41:19,646
I see.

452
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:23,275
Is that a problem?

453
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,198
It is what it is.

454
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:33,076
As you said,

455
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:39,875
you and I, we have seen too much.

456
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:43,754
That is true.
Neither of us are young anymore.

457
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:47,257
But I do know,

458
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:50,010
with the little time I have left,

459
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:54,223
I get to choose what I see.

460
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:59,478
Have we not earned that right?

461
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:13,427
Noa, help bring the rice inside.

462
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,388
A few more sacks over here.

463
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:39,555
Mama!

464
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:43,517
- What's that sound?
- What's happening?

465
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,061
- Go outside.
- Is it an air raid?

466
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:47,354
Are they coming?

467
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,067
What is it?

468
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:54,862
It's the rice shed.

469
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:36,880
Kyunghee!

470
00:46:42,427 --> 00:46:44,054
Kyunghee, wait!

471
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,224
Kyunghee!

472
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:51,937
Stop!

473
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:03,323
We worked so hard.

474
00:47:04,408 --> 00:47:05,617
All those months!

475
00:47:06,618 --> 00:47:08,537
How can it all just be gone?

476
00:47:10,914 --> 00:47:12,958
How can this happen?

477
00:47:14,543 --> 00:47:16,170
I don't know.

478
00:47:16,712 --> 00:47:18,130
Why are you here?

479
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:21,133
Did I ask you to follow me?

480
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:24,261
You know why.

481
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:36,648
You believe in the life after,
but I do not.

482
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:40,819
Why are you telling me this?

483
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,825
Because this is it for me.

484
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:51,997
This one life.

485
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:54,875
And if the Americans are to come today…

486
00:47:57,753 --> 00:47:59,963
If they are to unleash their bombs
upon us…

487
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:04,092
hereâ€¦

488
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:08,722
could I really say
that I have lived a good life?

489
00:48:10,724 --> 00:48:12,267
A life well-lived?

490
00:48:15,395 --> 00:48:16,563
Could you?
