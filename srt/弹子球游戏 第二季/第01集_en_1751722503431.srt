Japanese dialogue subtitled in blue.
Korean dialogue subtitled in yellow.

2
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:06,149
(in Japanese) Koh-san! Welcome home.

3
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,070
- Unload the cargo.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,822
Unload now.

5
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,326
It seems your trip was fruitful.

6
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,704
Who will it be then?

7
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:21,415
The Soviets or the Americans?

8
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,710
It's still not clear.

9
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,213
I need you to stay behind.
Watch the men.

10
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,633
Make sure no one thieves.

11
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,595
Everything will be as you instructed.

12
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,096
Do not worry.

13
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:22,518
<i>"We are showing the world
our nation's great might.</i>

14
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,189
<i>Our brave soldiers
storming the battlefields..."</i>

15
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,982
You better not lose on purpose!

16
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,401
<i>"...our cowardly enemies
retreating in fright."</i>

17
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,541
Mozasu!

18
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,839
(in Korean) Brother!

19
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,965
Come on!

20
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:00,055
Come, get a taste of home!

21
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,350
- Good morning!
- Brother! Wait!

22
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,019
Try it with your ration rice!

23
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,313
Tastes better, stomachs feel fuller!

24
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,733
Come, get a taste of home!

25
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,695
- Kimchi! Delicious kimchi for sale!
- I won!

26
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,406
- No fair! Brother!
- Noa...

27
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:21,201
- You always win.
- I told you not to drop your guard.

28
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,995
Why are you encouraging him?

29
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,707
Mother, if I don't do this,
I don't get him out of the house on time.

30
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,001
May I get some kimchi?

31
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:33,005
Mr. Kim, so good to see you.
It's been too long.

32
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,131
Yes.

33
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,010
I was worried you went elsewhere.

34
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,472
How could I possibly go elsewhere?
No one's kimchi compares.

35
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,017
Have you been busy?

36
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,477
Yes, quite a bit.

37
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,275
You're running low.
I hope that means sales have been good.

38
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,195
If only that was true.

39
00:03:56,195 --> 00:04:00,073
Cabbages have been in short supply.

40
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,535
This is my last batch.

41
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:08,290
My sister-in-law scours the markets
for anything to pickle, but...

42
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,792
What will you do then?

43
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,171
We'll manage somehow.

44
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,756
We always do.

45
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:19,635
Here.

46
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:23,222
You look like someone
who can handle his money.

47
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:26,016
That's good news.
I plan on being very rich.

48
00:04:27,643 --> 00:04:29,811
You have a son you can count on.

49
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,272
- Thank you. Be well.
- I'll come again.

50
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,066
Goodbye.

51
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,408
That man's definitely
a spy or something.

52
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,329
Even in jest,
you must not say such things.

53
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,414
Who's listening?

54
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,584
You never know. Not in times like this.

55
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,004
- Look at that!
- What's that? Up there!

56
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,348
- Mama?
- American planes!

57
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,566
Mother, look!

58
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,276
Something's falling.

59
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,335
Got it! What is it?

60
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,963
What does it say, Noa?

61
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,215
"To the people of Japan,

62
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:44,678
petition your emperor
to halt this brutal war.

63
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,433
If Japan does not surrender,
the situation will worsen.

64
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,729
We strongly urge you
to accept the consequences

65
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,609
and begin the work of building a new,
better and peace-loving Japan."

66
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,611
What does that mean?

67
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:02,905
How will things get worse?

68
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:07,409
Mama, don't you get it?
The Americans are coming.

69
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,998
With 500 million yen in funding

70
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,459
from wise investors like you,

71
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,753
I can put my previous experience
to work.

72
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,881
How much have you raised so far?

73
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,841
I've almost reached my goal.

74
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,801
Investors are enthusiastic.

75
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,764
With modest investments, limited risk,

76
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,142
especially in a runaway market
like this,

77
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,394
the potential returns are substantial.

78
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,397
You plan to manage the fund on your own?

79
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,024
It will keep overhead low.

80
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:45,984
Besides,

81
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,403
I'm neutral.

82
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:51,698
Whether the dollar or the yen
come out on top,

83
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,242
it makes no difference to me.

84
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:57,538
But you certainly weren't neutral
at Shiffley's.

85
00:08:58,247 --> 00:08:59,873
We heard.

86
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:05,546
You were compromised because of
your sympathies with that landowner.

87
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:12,803
That deal fell apart because
we were all too emotional about it.

88
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,975
That woman, she was never going to sell.

89
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,103
Not to Abe-san. Not to Colton Hotels.

90
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,523
What I'm trying to say is

91
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:28,527
it's dangerous to do business
based on loyalties.

92
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,201
Your relationship with Mamoru Yoshii...

93
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:38,829
We have our concerns.

94
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,708
To be frank,

95
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,960
his associations.

96
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,677
Tokyo is now a metropolis
of 11 million people,

97
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,639
and yet it still feels like a village.

98
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,311
You do not need to worry.

99
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:05,314
I have nothing to do with that man.

100
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:35,761
Brock, listen. It's not hype.

101
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:38,388
I mean, look at the Nikkei!

102
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,475
Come on, man.

103
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,019
Would you even be sitting
in that cushy Goldman Sachs chair

104
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,855
if it wasn't for me hauling your ass
through college?

105
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,568
I-- I'm not asking for a huge investment.
It ju--

106
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:58,825
Listen, I don't know
which story you've been told, but--

107
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,164
Talk soon, yeah.

108
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,132
Hey!

109
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,553
What stinky food are you eating today?

110
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:17,070
Listen up! You need to learn this too.

111
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,740
This is beoseot gangjeong.

112
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,742
It's usually spicier,

113
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,911
but there's no more chili peppers.
Still...

114
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,961
Delicious. I could eat 100 of them.

115
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,756
Neulgeun hobakjeon.

116
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:40,427
Last fall, my aunt
went to a farm in the country

117
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:44,598
and bought a huge pumpkin.

118
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:48,602
Five times the size
of my brother's head!

119
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:53,482
She said we had to make it last
the whole winter so enjoy every bite.

120
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,192
And I do!

121
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,658
Bando-kun! Get off your desk now!

122
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:05,994
Get down!

123
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:09,748
To the wall!

124
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,013
Hey, Bando.

125
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,099
Is it true?

126
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,602
The gossip about you.

127
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,607
Hey, garlic breath.

128
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,651
I'm talking to you.

129
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:45,826
I hear your family lives with pigs.

130
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,454
And the pigs sleep inside your house.
Is it true?

131
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,876
Look, he's not denying it!

132
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,004
If it wasn't true, he'd deny it. Right?

133
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:07,764
He just lets that bully come after me!

134
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:11,310
I know the jerk is
just trying to get my goat,

135
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,978
but come on!

136
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,064
I'm gonna smash his face in one day--

137
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,191
Noa.

138
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,944
I know how you're feeling.

139
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,324
You're not the only one.
We all live feeling that rage.

140
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,867
Especially here.

141
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,912
Look around you.

142
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,790
Angry husbands shouting terrible things
at their wives.

143
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,128
Tired mothers snapping at their children.
Brothers hating on brothers.

144
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,463
But, Noa,

145
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:44,301
that anger, it comes
from feeling so powerless here.

146
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,721
That's just how it is.

147
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,098
If you don't like it...

148
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,102
don't be Korean, Noa.

149
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,898
Even if it's only in your imagination.

150
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,666
Cheers!

151
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,168
I hope you are satisfied now.

152
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,672
With our major contribution
of military supplies.

153
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:24,550
Yes. Everyone is pleased.

154
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:30,305
Does this mean in our next contracts,

155
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,932
our loyalties will be rewarded?

156
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,101
If we don't,

157
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:38,021
we risk displeasing you, Koh-san.

158
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:42,067
It seems everyone in Osaka knows
what happens when you are displeased.

159
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:46,113
Speaking for myself,
I prefer to keep all of my limbs.

160
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:54,746
Rather than worry about pleasing my
son-in-law, let us all enjoy ourselves.

161
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,793
After all, his generosity is
just as well-known. Please, enjoy.

162
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:06,717
Inoue-san. We have all this rice
piled up in our colonies,

163
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:09,344
but it's impossible
to get it shipped to us now.

164
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,429
Yes.

165
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:14,224
I say we strap the rice on the back
of the Koreans, make them swim it over.

166
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,811
Serve those lazy cockroaches right.

167
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,617
Go and see where those two guests are.

168
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,746
They've been gone too long.

169
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,630
So it's happening then?

170
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,840
It's not confirmed yet.

171
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:49,760
But some messages have been intercepted.

172
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,347
There are whispers
that the bombings are imminent.

173
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,640
Imminent?

174
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:56,558
Within days.

175
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,312
Quickly get your family out of the city.

176
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,693
I've already sent mine to the country.
I'm following in the morning.

177
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:13,659
But first, we can't leave
without eating all that splendid food.

178
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:19,830
That Koh-san is impressive.
How he manages to find all that food.

179
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,385
You really kicked the hornet's nest.

180
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,595
Abe-san is on the warpath.

181
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:35,889
Believe me, I feel it.

182
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,600
Tonight is his big award ceremony.

183
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,812
Japan's Businessman of the Year.
It's quite the honor.

184
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,481
Give him my best.

185
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,952
So, tell me honestly.

186
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:58,620
How much of the fund have you raised?

187
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,500
No way. Zero?

188
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,754
- Zero.
- Yellowtail.

189
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,261
You should have asked me.

190
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:16,763
What are you talking about?

191
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,307
I don't want your pity.

192
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,601
I want to help you.

193
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:22,936
You serious?

194
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:27,774
And to think I was once jealous of you.

195
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,112
You don't need to
open old wounds, Tetsuya.

196
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,572
I realize it's petty of me.

197
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,783
That was always your specialty,
being petty.

198
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,538
200 million.

199
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,502
After all, you're my oldest friend.

200
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,712
I still remember

201
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:53,717
when I was transferred to the school,
you were good to me.

202
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:58,430
You could've been cruel
like the rest of them.

203
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,850
The new kid is always an easy target.

204
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,269
But you...

205
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,942
You never played that game.

206
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,318
It's a stupid game.

207
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:13,612
So it is.

208
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,245
Thank you.

209
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,247
Abalone.

210
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,133
Ready?

211
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:38,679
One!

212
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,141
Two!

213
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,561
Three!

214
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:50,440
When those American bastards
set foot on our soil,

215
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,360
they'll plunder and desecrate
our great empire,

216
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,320
turning it into a sea of flames!

217
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:59,992
So we'll have to take a stand
against those devils, won't we?

218
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,922
Very good.

219
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:18,552
Now, listen carefully.

220
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,265
We're not just stabbing a straw dummy.

221
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,185
This is the enemy!

222
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,479
Those bastards will torch our houses,

223
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,191
steal away our children,

224
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:37,571
and who knows what other horrors
they'll subject us to?

225
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:39,740
So I ask you,

226
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:43,744
will you let those beastly Americans
come for you?

227
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,120
No!

228
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:49,708
Are you going to just let them
tear your family apart?

229
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,959
No!

230
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,295
Then charge!

231
00:21:00,344 --> 00:21:04,139
Why are you destroying it?
We won't be able to use it again.

232
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,516
But, Mama, that's the point!

233
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:09,394
Take the enemy down
so they won't be able to get up again.

234
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:12,814
Away you go.

235
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:25,244
Concentrate on the target! Concentrate!

236
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,293
Truthfully, I've been curious about you.

237
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:40,467
How you're doing,
whether you have it good or not.

238
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:46,181
You married a pastor, isn't that so?

239
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,225
The sickly one.

240
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:51,061
He recovered from his illness,

241
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,648
and we had some good years.

242
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:57,943
But then...

243
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,155
the police took him away.

244
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:04,241
Really, for what?

245
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:07,911
For helping the laborers
fight for better wages.

246
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:13,750
That was seven years ago now.

247
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:19,464
Then how are you managing?

248
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:26,013
I still consider myself lucky.
I have my brother-in-law.

249
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:30,809
He was drafted to work in a munitions
factory in Nagasaki last year.

250
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:36,982
The money he sent was a godsend,

251
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:40,194
but lately, they've been paying him
in promissory notes.

252
00:22:41,612 --> 00:22:45,282
And I'm on my last batch of kimchi now.
Once I sell it...

253
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,205
Then there's my mother.

254
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,374
Why? Has something happened
to your mother?

255
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,753
It's been three months
since her last letter.

256
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,089
My mother...

257
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,761
she's all alone.

258
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:12,226
It's a struggle, isn't it?

259
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:16,605
Even so, I keep smiling.

260
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,693
If I don't, my children,

261
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,905
they will only see a mother's tears.

262
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:27,574
I do not want that.

263
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:34,706
But, Sunja...

264
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:45,592
I heard a few women here make rice wine
to sell at the black markets.

265
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,553
Perhaps you and I could--

266
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:49,721
But isn't that illegal?

267
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:55,185
You said so yourself.
You have nothing to sell.

268
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,231
And no one has any money
to pay me for their laundry.

269
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:06,280
Sunja, I'm...

270
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,618
I'm desperate now.

271
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,126
Do not get me wrong.

272
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,172
I am not scolding you,

273
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:24,756
but given my situation--

274
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,133
Never you mind.

275
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,895
Your boys are growing up so well.

276
00:24:57,998 --> 00:25:00,000
GRAND OPENING

277
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:16,767
Grandma!

278
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:18,602
You've come!

279
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:21,480
At least you arrived before the opening.

280
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:25,275
You should've at least ironed it.

281
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,738
And you wonder why I worry.

282
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:31,990
- Solomon!
- Father!

283
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:35,577
- How do I look?
- You look sharp!

284
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,829
You both do!

285
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,206
Don't we?

286
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,959
Shiny new business with shiny owners.

287
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,460
Perfect, right?

288
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:45,212
Congratulations.

289
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:49,091
Somehow, it all worked out.
I'm relieved.

290
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,970
So, how's the fundraising going?

291
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,098
I just caught a big fish today.

292
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:58,433
Remember Tetsuya?

293
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:03,021
That crybaby who was always
picking his nose?

294
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,649
He doesn't pick his nose anymore.

295
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,193
He just proved he's a true friend.

296
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:12,197
For someone like him to invest,
it makes it all real.

297
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:13,282
Is that so?

298
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,325
Look.

299
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:19,413
Your grandmother and I
have been talking.

300
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:25,752
We don't want to miss out
on a real gold rush.

301
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,470
What is this?

302
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,930
Just open it.

303
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,313
$700,000

304
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,944
Where'd you get this kind of money?

305
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:54,615
I took out a mortgage
with this place as collateral.

306
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:59,077
You took on more debt then?

307
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:01,496
What does it matter?

308
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:04,917
The banks are practically
giving money away these days.

309
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:06,585
The interest is almost nothing.

310
00:27:07,961 --> 00:27:10,839
But it's still a debt.

311
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,090
What is this?

312
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:15,552
We do this for you
and all you do is complain?

313
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,346
It's not that.

314
00:27:18,013 --> 00:27:21,892
But if anything were to happen--
If I were to fail, this money--

315
00:27:21,892 --> 00:27:23,977
You are my son.

316
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,899
If I can't believe in you,

317
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:32,402
then who will?

318
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:38,617
Just do your best. You'll do well.

319
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,039
Tanaka Akio. Yoshida Isamu.

320
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:47,459
In second place, Nakamura Minoru.

321
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,462
And in first place...

322
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:53,465
Bando Nobuo.

323
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,598
We will pick up
where we left off last week.

324
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,700
Bando.

325
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:22,327
A word.

326
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:36,383
What book are you reading in class?

327
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,762
<i>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.</i>

328
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:42,848
An American book?

329
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,934
You know it is forbidden.

330
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:48,353
I am sorry.

331
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:53,525
Try putting some effort into your work.

332
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,110
Your mind...

333
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:57,779
it can open many doors for you.

334
00:28:58,572 --> 00:28:59,698
What kind of doors?

335
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:03,118
A chance to escape these wretched slums.

336
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,245
University, perhaps.

337
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:08,290
I went to Waseda in Tokyo--

338
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,917
But I don't want to get out.

339
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:14,129
I want to stay here. Become a pastor.

340
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:22,012
I hear your father is no longer at home.

341
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:23,222
He's coming back.

342
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:25,224
Excuse me?

343
00:29:26,892 --> 00:29:27,893
My father,

344
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:30,103
he's coming home.

345
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,148
That's why I need to be here.

346
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:38,612
And what if he doesn't?

347
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,822
I told you.

348
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:42,324
I won't leave.

349
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:57,798
Here.

350
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:02,344
I don't need it anymore.

351
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,680
WASEDA UNIVERSITY
ENTRANCE EXAM PRACTICE TESTS

352
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,682
But I'm not...

353
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,017
You know.

354
00:30:10,018 --> 00:30:11,812
I know what you are.

355
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:15,399
Noa Baek.

356
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:33,375
THIS BOOK BELONGS TO
OGAWA EIICHI (GO YOUNG HO)

357
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,272
It's bootlegging.

358
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:57,858
But, Kyunghee, what choice do we have?

359
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:01,195
Our savings are gone,
and there's no money coming in.

360
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:03,906
Sunja, if anything
were to happen to you--

361
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,115
I'll be careful.

362
00:31:05,908 --> 00:31:10,078
I'm hearing the Economic Police
have informers there.

363
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,539
I'm sorry, but it's too dangerous!

364
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,416
I won't allow it.

365
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,960
Should we starve to death then?

366
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,631
Do you have any idea
who does those things?

367
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:21,965
Hungry people.

368
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:25,594
And parents with hungry children.

369
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:30,807
Kyunghee...

370
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:39,858
I heard Mozasu's stomach growl
while he slept last night.

371
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,365
Our children are hungry too.

372
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:56,333
Do you think I don't know that?

373
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:04,591
The other day, I found worms
in the ration rice. Worms!

374
00:32:09,346 --> 00:32:11,014
Even worse than that,

375
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:17,229
I considered leaving them,
with the hopes of filling their bellies.

376
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,900
There's no shame in that.

377
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:25,779
But we're not there yet.

378
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:31,034
Kyunghee.

379
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:37,082
For now, shouldn't we try to avoid
feeding our children worms?

380
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:46,008
Promise me one thing.

381
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:51,680
Every night, you must come home to us.

382
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,435
You know I will.

383
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,146
You know I will.

384
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,815
It's just a practice drill.
Let's keep working.

385
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:18,076
Run along.

386
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,620
Don't worry.

387
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,079
I'll take care of these.

388
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:23,165
I'm sorry to make you go alone.

389
00:35:23,165 --> 00:35:25,709
It's fine. I'm good at selling.

390
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:28,629
But hurry now
before your husband gets angrier.

391
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:35,093
Don't forget.

392
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,846
Show only your smiles.

393
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:00,327
- <i>Solomon?</i>
- Oh, Tetsuya. I'm in Osaka now.

394
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:01,411
What is it?

395
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:03,121
<i>Abe-san...</i>

396
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,793
<i>He heard about my investments.</i>

397
00:36:10,045 --> 00:36:11,088
But...

398
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:13,549
<i>He's threatening to destroy us both.</i>

399
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:15,384
<i>He claims you're conning me.</i>

400
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,553
What are you saying, Tetsuya?

401
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:21,598
<i>I'm sorry. I can't.</i>

402
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:23,892
<i>Solomon?</i>

403
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:27,354
- <i>Are you still there?</i>
- Don't worry.

404
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:30,065
I understand.

405
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:31,608
<i>I'm sorry, Solomon.</i>

406
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:32,943
I know.

407
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:42,494
Solomon. What are you doing there?

408
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:44,538
Come to the store with me.

409
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,917
- What?
- The grocery store down the street.

410
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:50,544
The cake will be ready now.

411
00:36:50,544 --> 00:36:51,962
We need some cups too.

412
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:55,090
I told your father
not to serve grape juice.

413
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,638
Why are you just standing there?

414
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:03,307
I'm going.

415
00:37:57,569 --> 00:38:01,198
Maybe the person who
took your order couldn't understand you.

416
00:38:02,324 --> 00:38:04,284
They couldn't understand "50"?

417
00:38:04,284 --> 00:38:06,203
Grandma, what's going on?

418
00:38:06,787 --> 00:38:10,666
I ordered a cake for 50,
but this is what he gives me.

419
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,919
Isn't this your mistake?

420
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:17,297
Listen, this is a custom order.

421
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,174
It's written here.

422
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:21,260
But this isn't what we ordered.

423
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:24,638
In any case,

424
00:38:24,638 --> 00:38:28,225
don't blame me for not understanding
half-assed Japanese.

425
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:29,518
Half-assed?

426
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,730
I'm just saying,
if you're going to live in this country,

427
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:37,067
you should learn our language properly.

428
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:41,280
Let's just go.

429
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,449
This isn't about the cake, is it?

430
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,702
I don't know what you're implying,

431
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:48,787
but if you don't like our service,

432
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:50,956
please take your business elsewhere.

433
00:38:50,956 --> 00:38:54,209
There are stores for people like you,
isn't that so?

434
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:56,628
What did you just say?

435
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,676
Don't walk away. Answer my question.

436
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:05,804
Who the hell do you think you are? Huh?

437
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,350
I was born here, just like you.

438
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:14,188
I went to Yale University. You get it?

439
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:17,983
I made your monthly salary
in a single day!

440
00:39:17,983 --> 00:39:21,820
You are in no fucking position
to put us down! You idiot!

441
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:50,599
Anyone home?

442
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,853
There was a raid at the black market.

443
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,316
Sunja got arrested.

444
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:01,860
They took her away!

445
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,945
What?

446
00:40:04,154 --> 00:40:08,033
Where is she now?
Where must they have taken her?

447
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:19,545
Let's hope we get
the older judge. At least he's fair.

448
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:23,423
Just hope we don't get the young one.

449
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:25,717
That man is cruel.

450
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:18,478
Solomon, you scared me tonight.

451
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:23,108
I'm sorry I scared you.

452
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:25,402
But, Grandma...

453
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:30,490
Now...

454
00:41:32,534 --> 00:41:33,994
It's just too hard now.

455
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:38,957
I can't do it anymore.

456
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:41,043
I--

457
00:41:43,587 --> 00:41:48,217
I can't live
always feeling sorry for you.

458
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:32,010
Time to wake up.

459
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:37,933
Auntie, what did the police say?

460
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:45,899
No news yet,
but the officer promised to look into it.

461
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:56,535
Could we stay home today
and wait with you?

462
00:42:59,454 --> 00:43:02,249
Your mother would want you
to go to school.

463
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:04,251
You know that.

464
00:43:20,475 --> 00:43:22,728
Mozasu, wake up.

465
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:30,402
He's coming. Get ready.

466
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:31,778
What's happening?

467
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:33,405
He's here.

468
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:45,959
Name?

469
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,294
Ryu Kimiko.

470
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:51,715
Your third offense, I see.

471
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,551
He tried to run off without paying me!

472
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:56,053
Two months' sentence.

473
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:57,179
Two months?

474
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,600
- Name?
- Hayashi Asuka.

475
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,894
First offense. Three weeks' sentence.

476
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,481
Name?

477
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:11,902
Bando Nobuko.

478
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:18,367
Oh. It's you.

479
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:25,165
You may go.

480
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:38,679
Don't count on your luck next time.

481
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,519
Remember that.

482
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:53,026
Next.

483
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:55,320
Name?

484
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:10,252
It's a great honor to accept this award.

485
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:13,130
I am humbled

486
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:18,385
to think I have done
anything worthy of such a tribute

487
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:22,890
from so many of my fellow countrymen
whom I admire.

488
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:40,073
As I was saying,

489
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:43,243
it's an honor to receive this award.

490
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:48,290
Thinking back on
what we had to overcome to be here today...

491
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:52,294
A nation once reduced
to burned-out ruins.

492
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:57,424
But from those ashes, we rose...

493
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,057
Mr. Kim.

494
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:09,144
I went to the station,

495
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:11,563
but they said you were already released.

496
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,360
But how did you know I was there?

497
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:19,530
I ask that you come with me.

498
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:24,826
You want me to get in the car?

499
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:27,788
Where would you take me?

500
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:30,874
I am not at liberty to say.

501
00:48:28,825 --> 00:48:31,787
A mineral found
in the bowels of the earth.

502
00:48:31,787 --> 00:48:33,288
It's called tungsten.

503
00:48:33,288 --> 00:48:36,124
Once processed,
it's resistant to corrosion.

504
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:42,548
Useful for airplanes and missiles,
grenades and such.

505
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:45,926
This makes the war possible.

506
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:54,852
How did you find me?

507
00:48:57,437 --> 00:49:00,566
I didn't have to look for you.
I never lost you.

508
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:05,946
Mr. Kim, he works for me.

509
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:10,909
I tasked him years ago
to watch over you and the kids.

510
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:12,452
Noa especially.

511
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:18,667
He's a clever boy,

512
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:21,670
but he's not applying himself.

513
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:29,469
What do you want?

514
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:35,475
The bombs are coming.

515
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:37,811
We've been hearing that for years.

516
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:39,229
It's real this time.

517
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:41,982
And it'll happen soon.

518
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:45,736
Not just the smaller bombs
targeting the factories.

519
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:47,738
They'll carpet-bomb the entire city.

520
00:49:48,488 --> 00:49:50,949
The Americans want all this to burn.

521
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,493
How can you be so sure?

522
00:49:57,414 --> 00:49:59,333
How did I know
you were making rice wine?

523
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:04,838
Or that Noa's teacher is a Korean
who pretends otherwise?

524
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:08,133
It's my job to know what others do not.

525
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:11,178
It's how I learned to survive.

526
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:12,596
You must do the same.

527
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:16,600
I've arranged for you,
your sister-in-law

528
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,727
and the two boys
to shelter in the countryside.

529
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:22,231
I won't leave my husband to rot in jail.

530
00:50:22,231 --> 00:50:23,690
Do you understand what I am saying?

531
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:28,487
The Americans are sending in
their planes to destroy this city!

532
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:31,365
Everything you know will be gone.

533
00:50:32,491 --> 00:50:34,326
You think you understand
what that means.

534
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:37,454
No.

535
00:50:38,497 --> 00:50:39,581
You don't.

536
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:42,084
I do.

537
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:43,961
I told you.

538
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:46,755
It's not possible.

539
00:50:47,673 --> 00:50:52,427
Are you willing to risk your children
for an imbecile who got himself arrested?

540
00:50:52,427 --> 00:50:54,221
I'm not going to leave him.

541
00:50:56,265 --> 00:50:57,307
I won't.

542
00:51:03,146 --> 00:51:04,147
You...

543
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:09,236
You actually care about him.

544
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:12,990
Don't you?
