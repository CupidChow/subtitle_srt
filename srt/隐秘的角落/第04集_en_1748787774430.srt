1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
Okay!

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,200
I'm ready to split.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,480
I can't get down at night like this.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,640
Let us walk around and relax!

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,760
Let us see how heartwarming you are right now.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,000
What are you singing, then?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,600
I heard that a song called

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,400
Least Good Night

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,480
from this young lady.

10
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,440
Leave a comment.

11
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,560
Let's just talk about it.

12
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,360
What's the midnight sound?

13
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,560
Let us hear this.

14
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,560
Ok.

15
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,600
Let's have a talk.

16
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,680
Letting a dance is moreICA.

17
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,800
You can go in.

18
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,000
My suggestion is

19
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,060
Yini's inside enemy company

20
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,240
in the dark.

21
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

22
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

23
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

24
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

26
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

27
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

28
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

29
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

30
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

31
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

33
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

34
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

35
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

36
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

37
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

38
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

39
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

40
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

41
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
I'm not sure if I can do it.

42
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,240
Let's get down.

43
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Let's make a diner.

44
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,480
Wait.

45
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
You were the one who posted on the camera.

46
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,240
I'm done.

47
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,240
Let's not talk on the road.

48
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Let's find a quiet place, okay?

49
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
We're not going anywhere.

50
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Just say it here.

51
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,240
Do you know about this?

52
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,240
Except us, no one knows.

53
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Why don't you tell them?

54
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
My mom...

55
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
It's none of your business.

56
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,240
We recorded the video.

57
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
If you dare to touch us, we'll call the police.

58
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
If you want to call the police,

59
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
you should have already handed the camera to the police.

60
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Isn't that right?

61
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Why did you write me a letter?

62
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
What do you want?

63
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Money?

64
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
I can buy this video first.

65
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
Don't come over.

66
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
You're so weird.

67
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
You wrote me a letter and threatened me.

68
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Why didn't you tell me what you wanted?

69
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,240
You said you could give us some money.

70
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,240
We can discuss this.

71
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,240
But I have to watch the video first.

72
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
What if you lie to me?

73
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,240
Tao Yao, go get the phone.

74
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,240
It's okay.

75
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,240
How can he treat us?

76
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,240
Come, have a drink.

77
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Sit down.

78
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Are you relatives or classmates?

79
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,240
I've told you. It has nothing to do with you.

80
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,240
How do you sing this song?

81
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,240
I'm afraid of the sky.

82
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,240
I'm afraid of the sky.

83
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,240
I'm afraid of the sky.

84
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm afraid of the sky.

85
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,240
How about this?

86
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
I'll give you 10,000 yuan.

87
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,240
You can hide it.

88
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
It's not easy to find out.

89
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
We want 300,000 yuan.

90
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
What?

91
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
300,000 yuan.

92
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,240
How about this?

93
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,240
Let's discuss this.

94
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,240
I'm not a rich man.

95
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,240
300,000 yuan is not a small amount for me.

96
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
I'll leave you a number.

97
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
You've made it clear.

98
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Call me anytime.

99
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Zhu Shaoyang,

100
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,240
you're the only one who's right in the final question.

101
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
But there's a better result.

102
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
See you next time.

103
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
Hello, I'm almost home.

104
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,240
What do you want to eat? I'll make it for you.

105
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,240
I have a stomachache.

106
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
I'm not going back after dinner.

107
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Don't forget to take the medicine.

108
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Put it in your bag.

109
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
I see.

110
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Just take it.

111
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,240
Are you really going to make a deal with Sha Ren Fan?

112
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,240
We need money.

113
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
He let himself out.

114
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Why?

115
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,240
But if he takes away the camera,

116
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,240
he will never prove that he killed someone.

117
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
That would be so bad for the old man.

118
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
The old man is no longer able to save him.

119
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
But if he has money,

120
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,240
we can at least save my brother.

121
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Am I right?

122
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,240
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
I'll take care of it.

124
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Then I'll go back to the office.

125
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
I'm sorry.

126
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,240
I'm sorry.

127
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,240
I'm sorry.

128
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,240
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm sorry.

130
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,240
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,240
I'm sorry.

133
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,240
It's not that.

134
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,240
I just haven't decided what to do next.

135
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Next,

136
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,240
shouldn't it be that we called him and he gave us money?

137
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,240
Yang Liang, you can't forget.

138
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,240
He is a murderer.

139
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,640
What's wrong with killing people?

140
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,680
You're afraid I can't beat him.

141
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,800
You can't solve the problem by fighting.

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Who said that?

143
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,240
You didn't beat him.

144
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,720
Come, I'll teach you.

145
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,920
What are you doing?

146
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,520
I'm looking for you to fight.

147
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,120
Come on, don't be so anxious.

148
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,640
Someone will beat you later.

149
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,000
You have no way of counting.

150
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,320
Come on.

151
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,680
I'll gather my hands like this.

152
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,920
Like this?

153
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,480
Like a tiger.

154
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,120
Don't think of anything else when you go out.

155
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,960
Just fight like this.

156
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
I can't do that.

157
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,960
I don't know how to do that.

158
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,880
How long will it last?

159
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,760
It's urgent.

160
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,680
Come again when you get up.

161
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,080
What's wrong?

162
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,320
We can't let go of the body.

163
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,080
Otherwise, we'll give the opponent a chance.

164
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,200
Why are you beating Brother Chao Yang?

165
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,640
I didn't beat him.

166
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm teaching him.

167
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,080
Get up, Chao Yang.

168
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,880
You're right.

169
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,360
We can't give the opponent a chance.

170
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,800
Brother Chao Yang has learned to fight.

171
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
That's enough, Chao Yang.

172
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,480
Come on.

173
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,240
No, no.

174
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,120
I won't beat him.

175
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,400
I won't beat him.

176
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
Wait for me.

177
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,080
Let's go.

178
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,280
What are you doing?

179
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,200
Come on.

180
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,480
I know you can't beat him.

181
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,160
I know.

182
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,760
Thank you for your hard work.

183
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Don't worry.

184
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Don't worry.

185
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
Let's go.

186
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Go home.

187
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,400
I'll send you upstairs.

188
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
No.

189
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,120
He's still here.

190
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,360
You've made up your mind.

191
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,320
What's the point of being so serious?

192
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,400
Give me some time.

193
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,280
My parents' business

194
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,160
has been going well.

195
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,520
I want to spend some time with them.

196
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
No.

197
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,720
I'll stay with you

198
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,680
in Guangzhou this time.

199
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,960
Your dad said

200
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,920
he wants to give you a birthday present.

201
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Do you want to go?

202
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,920
Do you want me to go?

203
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,800
No.

204
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,240
I want to go, but you can't.

205
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,480
I won't let you go.

206
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,200
Your dad said I'm your dad.

207
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,360
Let's go together.

208
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
I'll forget it.

209
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,920
But you should have seen your dad more recently.

210
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,680
Zhu Jingjing's business has been going well.

211
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,040
She can find some comfort in your place.

212
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,680
Uncle,

213
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,680
I'll get some gifts for someone else.

214
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,920
Let's give her a pen.

215
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,480
She loves to study.

216
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
She'll use it.

217
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,880
This is good.

218
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,680
She'll remember it later.

219
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
It's not moving.

220
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm checking if it's cheaper.

221
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,320
Uncle,

222
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,760
it smells like food.

223
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,000
Move it inside.

224
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,240
You're blocking the way.

225
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,880
Uncle, help yourself.

226
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,160
We can't park here.

227
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,640
We need to fill the van later.

228
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,440
I can't watch TV alone.

229
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,320
It's not cheap.

230
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,160
How about we go to another shop?

231
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,040
I'll help you.

232
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,920
Help me.

233
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,760
Move it inside.

234
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
Don't go.

235
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,960
I'll move it inside.

236
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,320
You?

237
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,520
I don't want money.

238
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,720
I'll give you the pen.

239
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,520
Okay, I'll move it.

240
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,720
Thank you.

241
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,480
Thank you.

242
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,480
Little friends,

243
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,760
please take more food.

244
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,520
Nice work, aunt.

245
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,120
Thanks, aunt.

246
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,240
Thanks, aunt.

247
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,400
Keep drawing

248
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,120
Just stop

249
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,960
Stop, I'll do it

250
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,120
None of that matters.

251
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,120
It's just that...

252
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,920
Okay, then I'll be right over here.

253
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,320
Jia Yan, Dad is in a hurry to go out.

254
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,520
I can't eat with you anymore.

255
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,520
Your birthday red bun.

256
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,720
Here, try it.

257
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,720
Eat.

258
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Thank you, dad.

259
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,720
I'll order the dishes for you.

260
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,920
You can order them yourself.

261
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,720
Hello, your dishes are ready.

262
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Hello, your dishes are ready.

263
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,120
Thank you.

264
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,320
Your dad told me that if it's not enough, you can order them again.

265
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,120
He'll come to pick up the bill.

266
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Can you come back later and eat?

267
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,720
I understand your wife's feelings.

268
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,520
But the time of the physical presence is really over.

269
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,320
The investigation result of the Public Security Bureau hasn't been released yet, right?

270
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,320
The results of the public security agencies' previous cases, you all recognized it.

271
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Now the fire department has no impact on the investigation of the subsequent case.

272
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,520
Take a seat.

273
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,720
The investigation has been completed.

274
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,720
The investigation has been completed.

275
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
The investigation has been completed.

276
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
The investigation has been completed.

277
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,720
The investigation has been completed.

278
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,720
The investigation has been completed.

279
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,720
The investigation has been completed.

280
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
The investigation has been completed.

281
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
The investigation has been completed.

282
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,720
The investigation has been completed.

283
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,720
The investigation has been completed.

284
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
The investigation has been completed.

285
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
The investigation has been completed.

286
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Three, two, one.

287
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Two, three.

288
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Mr. He!

289
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Don't get up.

290
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,720
I hope that I will be able to start this day from now on, every day.

291
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Let's go to the cake shop.

292
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Mr. He,

293
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
our relationship,

294
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
can I consider to move on?

295
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
We are all rational,

296
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
not something that doesn't reach him.

297
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
And then we are all in a daze.

298
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,720
I have been making a lot of trouble.

299
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
I have said that

300
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,720
I don't want to burden Chaoyang with anything.

301
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
I think it's good.

302
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
If I take care of you,

303
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,720
we can end it anytime.

304
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
I don't mean that.

305
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,720
Chaoyang and I are a lot of kids.

306
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,720
You can ask him if you can find a chance.

307
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,720
Let's talk about it later.

308
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,720
I'm going back to the car.

309
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,720
Let me go upstairs.

310
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Brother Chaoyang,

311
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,720
happy birthday.

312
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Thank you.

313
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
This is the happiest birthday I've ever had.

314
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
Let's go first.

315
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
Yan Liao.

316
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
I've decided

317
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,720
to deal with Zhang Luo Sheng with you.

318
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
I'll leave you to it.

319
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
Mom.

320
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
You are back, son.

321
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
What did your dad bring you for dinner?

322
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,720
Just a simple meal.

323
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
Nothing much.

324
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Can you eat it?

325
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
I'll make you some noodles.

326
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
Sure.

327
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
I'm home.

328
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
I'm going to work.

329
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
I'll be back in a minute.

330
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Bye.

331
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
Bye.

332
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Bye.

333
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Bye.

334
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Bye.

335
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
Bye.

336
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Bye.

337
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
Bye.

338
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Bye.

339
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Bye.

340
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
Bye.

341
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Bye.

342
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Bye.

343
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
You're back only next week.

344
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
What time?

345
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
I'll drive you home.

346
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
No, I'll go with Teng Shi.

347
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
Go to bed.

348
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
I'll tell him.

349
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
Don't be late.

350
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
I'm leaving.

351
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
I'll be back.

352
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Bye.

353
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
Bye.

354
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
Bye.

355
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Bye.

356
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Bye.

357
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Bye.

358
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
Bye.

359
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Bye.

360
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Bye.

361
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Bye.

362
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Bye.

363
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Bye.

364
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Bye.

365
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Bye.

366
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
I'm here to keep him.

367
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
I'll go get some soup.

368
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
Tomorrow,

369
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,720
I'll ask Zhu Jingxing's parents to check the surveillance.

370
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
See if they know each other.

371
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
And see if they've seen each other.

372
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
Ye Chenmin,

373
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
stop writing.

374
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
Go out and play.

375
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,720
I've never seen you be a father.

376
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
They're all playing with the kids.

377
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
You're stopping me from learning.

378
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,720
My daughter.

379
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
When will you give me the newspaper?

380
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
It's been so long.

381
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
I can't follow you if you don't go.

382
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Okay.

383
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
I'll be busy for a few days.

384
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
I'll take you there.

385
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
I'm not a talker.

386
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,720
I think I missed a lot of good movies.

387
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
Where did I say that?

388
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
Grandma.

389
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
What are you doing?

390
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
The surveillance.

391
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
Give me the newspaper.

392
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Hello?

393
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Hello?

394
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
It's us.

395
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,720
Say it.

396
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
It's three hundred thousand.

397
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
One point is not enough.

398
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
Okay.

399
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Tomorrow at two o'clock,

400
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
go down to the north road,

401
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
and then go to the second floor of the building.

402
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,720
Six o'clock.

403
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
Okay.

404
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,720
I'll be there.

405
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
Okay.

406
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Okay.

407
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Let's go.

408
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Okay.

409
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Okay.

410
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Let's go.

411
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Okay.

412
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Okay.

413
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,720
Okay.

414
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Okay.

415
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
Six o'clock.

416
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Don't forget to bring the camera.

417
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
Okay.

418
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,720
Then prepare the money.

419
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
Is this his address?

420
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Okay.

421
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Tomorrow we can't go to his house.

422
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
To ensure safety,

423
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
when we're trading,

424
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
we only go to two people.

425
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
One person takes the camera outside.

426
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,720
If two people go out,

427
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
the other person will call the police.

428
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
This way,

429
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,720
he will not dare to go to the two people.

430
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,720
Yanliang,

431
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,720
you take the camera tomorrow,

432
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
and shoot the door.

433
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
Wait for me.

434
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,720
If I and my mother

435
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,720
haven't come back before four o'clock,

436
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,720
you go to the police you know.

437
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,720
If he doesn't believe me,

438
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,720
you use the camera to show him the video.

439
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
If everything goes well,

440
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
we'll bring him to you

441
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
when we get the money.

442
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,720
At that time,

443
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
we'll give him the camera.

444
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Okay.

445
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
Come in.

446
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
Come in.

447
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
You're in the wrong.

448
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
No.

449
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Give us the money.

450
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,720
I can't give you this much money.

451
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,720
Come and sit down.

452
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
Sit down and talk.

453
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
Please sit down.

454
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Why are you two alone?

455
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
Where's that boy?

456
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
He's outside.

457
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
We're the same.

458
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
He's not like a student.

459
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
Are you from a school?

460
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
None of your business.

461
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
You have to study and study.

462
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,720
You should study well.

463
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
If you want to study,

464
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
I can teach you free of charge.

465
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,720
Are you doing this for murder?

466
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Are you

467
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,720
afraid of losing something?

468
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Sometimes,

469
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
for these things,

470
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,720
we'll do things we're not willing to do.

471
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
I'm sorry.

472
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
Brother Chuan,

473
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,720
let's go.

474
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,720
I know you're smart.

475
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Give me the camera first.

476
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
Why are you talking so slowly?

477
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
We don't want to talk.

478
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Give us the money.

479
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
Where's the camera?

480
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,720
The camera is not on us.

481
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,720
Give us the money first.

482
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
Let's go to a safer place.

483
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
I'll give you the camera.

484
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
If we don't go back today,

485
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,720
the police will arrest us.

486
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,720
We'll meet again

487
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,720
every day.

488
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
As long as we're alone,

489
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
as long as we're alone,

490
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,720
the police will arrest us.

491
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
So,

492
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
don't do anything to us.

493
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Let's go back.

494
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Let's go back.

495
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Do you think this is your idea?

496
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
Give us the money.

497
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
We'll give you the camera.

498
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
I don't have the money.

499
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
I've told you.

500
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
I'm not a rich man.

501
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,720
It's impossible to spend 300,000 yuan

502
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
on such a short time.

503
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Why don't you say it on the phone?

504
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,720
Didn't you say you didn't bring the camera?

505
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,720
What do you think?

506
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
This card costs 30,000 yuan.

507
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
The password is the six-digit number.

508
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
You can check it yourself.

509
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
I'll save 30,000 yuan

510
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,720
for every week.

511
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,720
It's 300,000 yuan

512
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,720
after the summer vacation.

513
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
Then you can't lie to us.

514
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,720
I have my evidence.

515
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
It's not good for me

516
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
to lie to you.

517
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
Take it.

518
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,720
It's been a long time

519
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
for you to spend 30,000 yuan.

520
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
I'll give you the money.

521
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
Let's go.

522
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,720
Done?

523
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
Yes.

524
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
Qiang.

525
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Officer Cheng.

526
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,440
I'm sorry.

527
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,080
Cheng Guan Sheng!

528
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,920
I'm sorry.

529
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,760
Liang Liang,

530
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,520
follow me.

531
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,160
I'm in a hurry.

532
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,880
No, no, no.

533
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,480
I'm in a hurry.

534
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:51,880
No, no, no.

535
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
You, you, you,

536
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,960
you, you, don't catch me.

537
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,000
What's the matter?

538
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,640
Say it. Say it.

539
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,880
Nothing.

540
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,040
Oh, no.

541
00:37:59,200 --> 00:37:59,960
He went in.

542
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,200
I don't have time.

543
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,880
Hurry up and go with me.

544
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,560
Where are you going?

545
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,400
Tell me.

546
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,240
What's the matter?

547
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,640
What's wrong?

548
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,000
Actually, I'm fine.

549
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
I just came to see you.

550
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,200
You came to see me?

551
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,400
I'm here to report to you.

552
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,400
Right.

553
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,200
You should have come to report to me.

554
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,720
Go.

555
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:31,760
It's not good today.

556
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,480
I have something to do today.

557
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,200
What?

558
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,680
It's not good today.

559
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,480
I have something to do.

560
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,320
What's the matter?

561
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,120
Go, go, go.

562
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,160
Go.

563
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:41,920
Hurry up.

564
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:42,800
I'll go with you.

565
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,320
I'll go with you.

566
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,840
I'll go with you.

567
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,560
I'll go with you.

568
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,440
What's the matter, Puff?

569
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,840
Let's go back first.

570
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,040
Get on.

571
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,240
Gear yourself up.

572
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,400
Stop right there.

573
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:25,720
Give it to me.

574
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,280
Get in.

575
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,680
Right.

576
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,000
Change your shoes first.

577
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,620
It's my shoes.

578
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,040
Hey.

579
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,600
Bro.

580
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,380
The cold.

581
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,060
Ok

582
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,520
You步

583
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,380
Are you hungry?

584
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,800
Who is his child?

585
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,360
Where is it from?

586
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,260
It's so Father-in-law

587
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,580
You chose a rich do marketplace

588
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,220

589
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,440
We betterп both.

590
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,340
We better.

591
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,420
What, Weng, when do you take a bath, okay?

592
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,040
Out.

593
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,040
Dad!

594
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,040
Dad!

595
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Dad!

596
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,040
Dad!

597
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,040
Dad!

598
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,040
Dad!

599
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,040
Dad!

600
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,040
Dad!

601
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,040
Dad!

602
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,040
Eat more.

603
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,040
You're so thin.

604
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,040
This kid

605
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,040
looks like Yan Wenbin.

606
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,040
Your dad is thin.

607
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,040
I'm full.

608
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
You're full?

609
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
Fang,

610
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,040
call the police.

611
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,040
I'll send you tomorrow.

612
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
Right.

613
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
They're here.

614
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,040
Okay.

615
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,040
That's it.

616
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,040
Can you send me back later?

617
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:27,040
Can you send me back later?

618
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,040
You're not allowed to.

619
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,040
I'm sorry, Dad.

620
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,040
Where is my dad?

621
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,040
We'll talk about it.

622
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
What did you do?

623
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,040
Why did you borrow money?

624
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
I didn't borrow money.

625
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
I didn't borrow money.

626
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,040
You didn't borrow money.

627
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,040
Zhang Jinlin called the police and arrested you.

628
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,040
Chen Guosheng, I'm going to borrow money.

629
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
I'm not trying to.

630
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,040
You're so mean.

631
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,040
I said it's all your fault.

632
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,040
If it weren't for your dad,

633
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,040
I would have sent you back.

634
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,040
Don't mention my dad.

635
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
If you didn't catch my dad,

636
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,040
I could go to the welfare center.

637
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,040
My dad is not a bad guy.

638
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
Is your dad a bad guy?

639
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,040
He's a judge.

640
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,040
You're not my judge.

641
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,040
Dad.

642
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Okay, okay.

643
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,040
Come on, come on.

644
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
Come on.

645
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,040
I'm standing.

646
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
Come on.

647
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
What should we do?

648
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,040
The police must have taken him back.

649
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,040
Yanliang.

650
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,040
Yanliang.

651
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,040
Yanliang, are you okay?

652
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,040
I'm fine.

653
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,040
I was just staying at his house.

654
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,040
What's wrong with you two?

655
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,040
He wants to lie to us and give the camera to him.

656
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,040
He can't get that much money.

657
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,040
You bastard.

658
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,040
I'll take the camera to you.

659
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,040
The camera seems to have been called by the Chen family.

660
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
Why are you so careless?

661
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,040
I was running around.

662
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,040
What if the police see it?

663
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
They'll catch Zhang Zeng.

664
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,040
If they don't, you'll be in trouble.

665
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,040
I can do it myself.

666
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,040
Yanliang.

667
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
I'm going home.

668
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,040
The insurance company has 600 million body parts.

669
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,040
What's wrong?

670
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
What's going on?

671
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,040
What's going on?

672
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
What's wrong?

673
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,040
What's wrong?

674
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,040
What's wrong?

675
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
Are you okay?

676
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,040
Come on.

677
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,040
I'm going to find this.

678
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,040
I'm going to find this.

679
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,040
There's a camera.

680
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,040
Come on.

681
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,040
Let's take a picture.

682
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
It's gone.

683
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,040
Don't cry.

684
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:15,040
It's over there.

685
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
Yanliang is back.

686
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,040
He's grown up.

687
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,040
He's changed a lot.

688
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,040
No.

689
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,040
No.

690
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,040
He really wants to see you.

691
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,040
No.

692
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,040
No.

693
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,040
No.

694
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,040
No.

695
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,040
I'm going to run.

696
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,040
Let's go.

697
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,040
Wait here.

698
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,040
No.

699
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,040
No.

700
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,040
Director.

701
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,040
Those who are in the early morning may be taken by the police.

702
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,040
Today I invited you here.

703
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,040
I just want to ask you to identify if there are any people who are familiar or suspicious.

704
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,040
Thank you.

705
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,040
It's my duty.

706
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,040
Wait.

707
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,040
Hong.

708
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
Yes.

709
