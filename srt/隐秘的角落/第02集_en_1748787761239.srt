1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I love people who have something to do today.

2
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,600
So I brought them here alone.

3
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,200
My father used to be a high school student.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,400
So at the beginning,

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I didn't want them to go up.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But my father was very happy today.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
He insisted on going up.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I was so happy.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I was so happy.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He insisted on going up.

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,000
He said it was a good sign.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He wanted to win against my mother.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So I went up with them.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How did they fall down?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't know.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't know how to use that device.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I heard my father say that

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I was too nervous to use that device.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
When my mother called me, I was too nervous.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
They fell down.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The two of you are here.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's make a good match with him.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sign a letter on the pen.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You need to go to the scene with us later.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's all my fault.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's all my fault.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Except for us,

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
no one else can see your son-in-law, right?

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Except for us,

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
there's no one else.

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I have to report it.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hello, the 119 is reporting you.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What's the matter?

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Hello, I want to report it.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't take it.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Don't touch me.

44
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't touch me.

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What's the point of being sorry?

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's okay.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Please tell me the details.

52
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
When I and my friends went up to the shooting,

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
then saw...

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why are you here?

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,200
Who is that crazy guy?

56
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,200
What did you say?

57
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,360
I said

58
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,400
you are my little student.

59
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,040
He is your friend.

60
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,240
We can't go back.

61
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,960
Why?

62
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,920
Hello, this is 110.

63
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,680
Did you call the police?

64
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,680
Hello?

65
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,800
He is my brother.

66
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,840
He is playing around.

67
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,280
I can talk to him.

68
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,720
We can't call the police.

69
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,440
You know?

70
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,720
It's dangerous.

71
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,480
Sorry, auntie.

72
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,760
I won't call you again.

73
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm sorry, brother Chang'an.

74
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,040
It's all because of me.

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,880
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
This is my brother Yuexin.

77
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,680
After my parents died,

78
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,120
I went to the welfare hospital.

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,520
Xinxin was adopted.

80
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,720
Last year, he was diagnosed with white blood disease.

81
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,400
I want to visit him.

82
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,880
I thought I could help auntie

83
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,000
to pick up her brother.

84
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,760
But I didn't.

85
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,880
You...

86
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,120
What's wrong with you two?

87
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,000
The doctor said

88
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,680
if Xinxin can get a surgery early,

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,520
there might be a chance to cure him.

90
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,600
But his father and mother

91
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,280
don't have the money to do the surgery for him.

92
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,320
So we can't go back now?

93
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,960
Sure.

94
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,840
Mother.

95
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,680
We should bring sister over.

96
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,600
Our family will beOf us of love.

97
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,640
Right?

98
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,480
Do you倭 wei want to see her?

99
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,600
I don't want you to let me see them.

100
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,360
She is tenho.

101
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,520
Have you called anyone?

102
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,640
Please inform other people.

103
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,600
I will speak to them now.

104
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,440
Thank you, auntie.

105
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,440
I can't help but hold him tight.

106
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
That person is so scary.

107
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Even his parents are all fools.

108
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm just worried

109
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
if he will do anything bad again.

110
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
Let's warn him.

111
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,440
If he knows someone saw him killing him,

112
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
he wouldn't dare to do anything bad again.

113
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Just warn him?

114
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
Yes.

115
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,440
I don't know where he is.

116
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
I saw his car in the parking lot.

117
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
His car's license is like this.

118
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
It looks like a chef's hat.

119
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Chef's hat?

120
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
It's a crown.

121
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,440
My dad saw that car.

122
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,440
He has a pink hat in his car.

123
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Let's go find it.

124
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
If we can find it,

125
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
we can write it a warning letter.

126
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
How?

127
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,440
We'll write it like this.

128
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Hello, killer.

129
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
We've seen

130
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,440
what you did.

131
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
I hope you can change the rules.

132
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
If you don't hurt anyone,

133
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
if you dare to do anything bad again,

134
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
let's just say it out loud.

135
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Your family and friends

136
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
all know that you're a bad guy.

137
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Let's write it like this.

138
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
I...

139
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
I...

140
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
I...

141
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm scared.

142
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
I'm scared.

143
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
I'm not.

144
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
How did you know?

145
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
I'm not.

146
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
I'm not scared.

147
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
Wan'er,

148
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
he's so sad.

149
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
You couldn't go.

150
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Is there any place where?

151
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
We can go last Wednesday.

152
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
No need to have that.

153
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Hello?

154
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,800
I went to the office to integration.

155
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,840
Oh...

156
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,120
Have some fish, I'll see you later.

157
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,440
-She's going back, right?

158
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,320
Alright.

159
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,680
Let's go eat in the hot spring.

160
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,920
Hey.

161
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
I'll be back in the room later.

162
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Is there anything else in the afternoon?

163
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,920
Where are you going?

164
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,920
I'm looking for a place.

165
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
I'll go first.

166
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,920
I'll look for a place.

167
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,920
I'll go first.

168
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
I'll be back in the room later.

169
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
I'll be back in the room later.

170
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
I'll be back in the room later.

171
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,920
Boss, it's cold.

172
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,920
I won't be in the same place.

173
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,920
I don't need money.

174
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,920
I can find a place to live.

175
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
There's a private room behind.

176
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
One bed for 10 yuan.

177
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
What's the number?

178
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
440119.

179
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
1991 072513.

180
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,920
Where's the next one?

181
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
18.

182
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
I'll go find a place to live.

183
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,920
I'm hungry.

184
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Son, time to eat.

185
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Right away.

186
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Hurry up.

187
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
I made you a fish today.

188
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
You're eating fish?

189
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
No.

190
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
I'm not.

191
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Mom, how are the two in the police station?

192
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
They're dead.

193
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,920
They're so tall that they can only live.

194
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
But the police station doesn't have any responsibility.

195
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,920
I'm not used to it.

196
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
Anyway, I have to pay a lot.

197
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
What are you doing these days?

198
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Did you do your homework?

199
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
I haven't started to write.

200
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
I've been reading books lately.

201
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
You rarely read those books.

202
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,920
You study them.

203
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Actually, that's not a book.

204
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
He's a math student.

205
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
I'm the one who's thinking about it.

206
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Anyway, he's a genius.

207
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
It's not like my son.

208
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
You're a genius in his eyes.

209
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,920
I'm not compared to him.

210
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Why not?

211
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
We're better than anyone in my eyes.

212
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,920
You're talking about that genius with mom?

213
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
That genius is called Dikar.

214
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
He's not just a math student.

215
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,920
He's a math student.

216
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
When he was 62,

217
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
he pursued a princess.

218
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,920
And he became a math teacher.

219
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
But he was discovered by the king.

220
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
The king left him.

221
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
He died in prison.

222
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Another version says

223
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
he pursued the princess,

224
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,920
but the princess didn't care about him.

225
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
Dikar wasn't in prison.

226
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
He was sentenced to death.

227
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Eat less.

228
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Eat less.

229
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Eat less.

230
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,920
I know you're sad.

231
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
You can beat me or scold me.

232
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
As long as you can be better.

233
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,920
Fighting.

234
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,920
My family is under our Fujian Shalash.

235
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,920
We've been contacted.

236
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,920
I'll arrange a meeting tomorrow.

237
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Take a good rest at home.

238
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
I'll arrange a meeting tomorrow.

239
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,920
I'll arrange a meeting tomorrow.

240
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
I'll arrange a meeting tomorrow.

241
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
It will be fine.

242
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,920
It will be fine.

243
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
It will be fine.

244
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Yan Lan, did you fall asleep?

245
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
No. I'm just a account.

246
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
What account?

247
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,920
I'm just thinking that if I can work,

248
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
I can pay the bill to be paid by Xin Xin.

249
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Thank you, Yan Lan.

250
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,920
I'm sorry.

251
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
I'm sorry.

252
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
I'm sorry.

253
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
I'm sorry.

254
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
Thank you.

255
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
Isn't your brother my brother?

256
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
I really want to change Xin Xin.

257
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,920
As long as she can live well.

258
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
Don't say that again.

259
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Your parents want to see you two live well in the sky.

260
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Don't worry.

261
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
When I find my dad, he must have a way.

262
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Don't think about it. Go to bed early.

263
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
I'm sorry.

264
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
Yan Lan, you're a good boy.

265
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Yan Lan, you're a good boy.

266
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Yan Lan, you're a good boy.

267
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
You're a good boy.

268
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
You're a good boy.

269
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
How's she feeling?

270
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Xu Jing.

271
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Jing Jing.

272
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Let her take a bath.

273
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Okay.

274
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,920
What's wrong?

275
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,920
She's bleeding.

276
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,920
She's in trouble.

277
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Take the medicine.

278
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
Let me go.

279
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Give it to me.

280
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Give it to me.

281
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Come on.

282
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Give it to me.

283
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
What are you talking about?

284
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm talking.

285
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
Hurry up.

286
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
What are you doing?

287
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
I'm going to kill you.

288
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Don't come near me.

289
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,920
Don't move.

290
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,920
Don't hit me.

291
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
Don't come near me.

292
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,920
Don't come near me.

293
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
Don't come near me.

294
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Don't come near me.

295
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Don't come near me.

296
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Don't come near me.

297
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
You're going to die.

298
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Don't come near me.

299
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Don't come near me.

300
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,940
What are they doing?

301
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Don't shoot!

302
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,280
Moذait regime!

303
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,240
What is it?

304
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,540
What is it?

305
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,940
Sneaking in Internet and waiting for me

306
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,360
Stop.

307
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,780
It's true.

308
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,720
It's all right.

309
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,900
It's all right.

310
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,440
Mom!

311
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,520
You're not done yet?

312
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,440
Mom, I'll go to the grocery store.

313
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,400
I forgot to book this

314
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,400
for a month this morning.

315
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,760
Can't you just do it again?

316
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,760
I'm not hungry.

317
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,760
I'm going to the store to buy some food.

318
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Why are you still running out of the store?

319
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,760
Wait a minute.

320
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,760
I have a tent.

321
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
Take it out.

322
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Do you have money?

323
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
No.

324
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Your dad hasn't given you money recently.

325
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
I don't have money.

326
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
I don't have money.

327
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
I don't have money.

328
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
I don't have money.

329
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
You go away first.

330
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Do you know, the Kind Heifer?

331
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Go back soon.

332
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,760
Okay.

333
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,760
Chang'e.

334
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,720
It's okay.

335
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,520
I saw someone bullying me.

336
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
So I hit him.

337
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,040
Don't be so impulsive.

338
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,920
If anything happens to you,

339
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,800
who will take care of you?

340
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,800
It's okay.

341
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,840
I'll do it.

342
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,120
But it might hurt.

343
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,640
You stay calm.

344
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,480
I'll go.

345
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,280
My mom is still at home.

346
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,920
Let's find a place to stay for a while.

347
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,800
So many books.

348
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,320
I've been here.

349
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,840
I can read books.

350
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,280
I feel dizzy when I read books.

351
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,120
Chaoyang.

352
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,720
Do you have any money?

353
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:11,840
Yes.

354
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,760
What for?

355
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,680
Do you have a public telephone booth nearby?

356
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,600
Call me.

357
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,840
Take them all.

358
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,520
There's a restaurant outside.

359
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,880
There's one at the door.

360
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,360
The house is for the kids.

361
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,080
The kids are for the kids.

362
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,880
Li Ling.

363
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,000
The house is for the kids.

364
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,680
Where's the key?

365
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,440
I don't have the key.

366
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,560
Thank you.

367
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,120
Okay.

368
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,040
Let me help you.

369
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,160
I haven't finished talking.

370
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:43,880
Xiaofeng.

371
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,360
Come.

372
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,560
Is it the sound of the bell?

373
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,520
It's me.

374
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,400
Who are you?

375
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,120
Yan Liang.

376
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,320
Yan Liang.

377
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Where are you?

378
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,640
You don't have to tell me where I am.

379
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,760
I'm just asking you.

380
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,520
Do you know where my dad is?

381
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,400
Do you know that

382
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,080
after you left Fulin,

383
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,840
we were sent to the left?

384
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,200
Why are you talking so much?

385
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,200
Tell me where you are.

386
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,240
I'll go find you.

387
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,400
And I'll take you to your dad.

388
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,000
Okay?

389
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,360
You still call me a kid?

390
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,200
If I tell you where I am,

391
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,560
will you come to arrest me right away?

392
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,200
Just like you did to my dad.

393
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:17,840
Okay.

394
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:18,560
Forget it.

395
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,320
I'll go find it myself.

396
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,240
Hello.

397
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,880
We're here to pick you up.

398
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,480
Can I sit here with you?

399
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:27,880
There's no need.

400
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,120
Takerà, sit.

401
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,280
You're sh号 are including 0,

402
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,800
100 or 100.

403
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,320
It's 2020,

404
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,760
and you're ..

405
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,560
thì figure out the result?

406
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,000
No.

407
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,920
ortonight is 120子's

408
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,920
I'll try to solve it one more time.

409
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Still one more time?

410
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Something's wrong.

411
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Let me see.

412
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,920
You're right. It's the answer.

413
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,920
Brother Chang.

414
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
The killer.

415
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,920
What?

416
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
The one on the six mountains.

417
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Brother Chang.

418
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
Wait for me here.

419
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
What are you doing?

420
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
Uncle.

421
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
Hello.

422
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
You're awake.

423
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Remember to take the medicine.

424
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,920
I put it on the window.

425
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
I'm on my way back.

426
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
I'll take it.

427
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
I'll take it.

428
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
I'll take it.

429
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
I'll take it.

430
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
I'll take it.

431
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
I'll take it.

432
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
I'll take it.

433
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
I'll take it.

434
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
I'll take it.

435
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,920
I'll take it.

436
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,920
I'll take it.

437
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Stop.

438
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Are you laughing at me?

439
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
What's wrong?

440
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Uncle.

441
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,920
I'm here to register for the book store.

442
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Can you help me?

443
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Why did you come to work

444
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,920
when you're so young?

445
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
You should go to school now.

446
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,920
You know?

447
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Go back.

448
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Can I keep your phone number?

449
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
Uncle, it's the meeting.

450
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,920
Are you okay?

451
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
I'm sorry.

452
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,920
I'll help you.

453
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Okay, thank you.

454
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,920
Uncle.

455
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
How did you find him?

456
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
He was in the book store.

457
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Is it him?

458
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,920
I'll drive his car.

459
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,920
What should we do now?

460
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,920
Whose phone is this?

461
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,920
It's a murder.

462
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,920
Okay, Yan Liang.

463
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
Let's leave here first.

464
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
He lost his phone.

465
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
I'll definitely find it later.

466
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Let's go.

467
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
No.

468
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
I can't open it.

469
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
The password is 10,000.

470
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
It's a waste of time.

471
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Hello?

472
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Hello?

473
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
This is my phone.

474
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
Can you give me a place

475
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
where you are now?

476
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,920
I'll get it myself.

477
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,920
Okay.

478
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
I'll go to the book store.

479
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Okay.

480
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,920
I'll go to the book store.

481
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
Okay.

482
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,920
I'll go to the book store.

483
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,920
Okay.

484
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,920
I'll go to the book store.

485
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
Okay.

486
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Okay.

487
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Okay.

488
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
I'll get it myself.

489
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
Don't worry.

490
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,920
I'll definitely thank you.

491
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
You should be the guy

492
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,920
who hit me at the book store today.

493
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,920
I don't know what money

494
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
the second-hand phone is.

495
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
Look, if it's not like this,

496
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
give me back my phone.

497
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
I'll give it to you as a price.

498
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
Think about it.

499
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
If you don't give it back to me,

500
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
I'll call the police.

501
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Hello?

502
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
What if he calls the police?

503
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Hello?

504
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:51,920
Xiao Zhang.

505
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,920
Hello?

506
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Are you in the New Year's Day?

507
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Yes.

508
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
I have a meeting with the office tomorrow.

509
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,920
Can you help me with the class?

510
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
It's still 1.30 p.m.

511
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,920
I'll be there...

512
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
I'll be there...

513
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,920
I'll be there.

514
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Okay.

515
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,920
I'll be there.

516
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
I'll be there.

517
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:17,920
I'll be there.

518
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
I'll be there.

519
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
How did it go?

520
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
I think it's a dead body.

521
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
It must be a work of art.

522
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
I'll take a warning letter tomorrow

523
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,920
to his office.

524
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
I'll bring him the warning letter

525
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
when I get the chance.

526
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
But he met you today.

527
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,920
I'm careful.

528
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
He won't notice me.

529
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,920
Let's go with you.

530
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
We'll go together.

531
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,920
It's easier to notice.

532
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,920
It's okay.

533
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Don't worry.

534
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,920
Let's go down first.

535
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Let's go.

536
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
Does it look like it?

537
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
It does.

538
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
But it seems to be a little bit closer.

539
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
Let's go up.

540
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,920
Okay.

541
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,920
Wow.

542
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
That's how it looks.

543
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
Pu Pu.

544
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
We'll stay here for a while.

545
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
You stay down.

546
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,920
I'll put it on you.

547
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Okay.

548
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,920
If you have anything to do,

549
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
ask me.

550
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Let's go up and see.

551
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,920
Let's go.

552
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:19,920
I'm a police officer.

553
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Don't move.

554
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,920
It's an operation.

555
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,920
You need time to remember these clears.

556
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,920
Want to take a break?

557
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
Go on.

558
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,240
I'm not going to stay here.

559
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
Where should I stay?

560
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,640
Where should I stay?

561
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,400
My mom is also from Pugnian.

562
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,360
Grandpa,

563
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,920
how many days do we want to stay here?

564
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,160
No, I'll stay here for a while.

565
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,520
I'm not going to stay here for a while.

566
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,680
I'm not going to stay here.

567
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,280
Grandpa,

568
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,400
my parents are not here.

569
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,160
We don't have a place to stay.

570
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,920
Can you help me?

571
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,040
I'm going to die.

572
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,880
I'm going to stay here.

573
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,240
I'm not going to stay here for a while.

574
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,760
I'm not going to stay here for a while.

575
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,920
Have a seat.

576
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,400
Uncle,

00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,040
what did he say?

578
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,280
He said he was talking about Chaozhou.

579
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,480
My mom is talking about Jiaxian.

580
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,920
Okay, uncle.

581
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,760
You're going to talk about Chaozhou?

582
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,600
How do you say thank you?

583
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,760
Have a seat.

584
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,600
Cheers.

585
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,480
Excuse me.

586
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,320
Excuse me,

587
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,040
蔣字時志.

588
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,200
Excuse me.

589
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,400
If you dare If you dare

590
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,560
what's on your mind

591
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:31,840
why don't you try

592
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,760
Then come in

593
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,400
Why are you like this

594
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:53,920
Chaoyang

595
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:54,760
mom

596
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,960
Why don't you sleep

597
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,960
Chao Yang, tomorrow afternoon, Mom has something to go out for.

598
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Then she'll go back to the police station.

599
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,960
There are dumplings and grilled rice in the fridge.

600
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,960
She even cooked dumplings this afternoon. Remember to eat them.

601
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
I know, Mom.

602
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Chao Yang.

603
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Mom, what's wrong?

604
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,960
It's okay. You can sleep.

605
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
You guys are here.

606
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
The nurse said she was really happy to see you.

607
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
We won't let you in. Just wait outside.

608
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,960
You must be careful. If anything happens, we'll go in and help.

609
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,960
There won't be any trouble. There are so many workers.

610
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,960
It's too hot. You guys go to the book store.

611
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Okay.

612
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,960
I'll go in first. We'll book another meeting later.

613
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,960
Chao Yang, is that your little kid?

614
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Who?

615
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
It's the one Chao Yang wrote.

616
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
And his pulse.

617
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,960
I've seen his photo.

618
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,960
I'm fine. I'll go in first.

619
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,960
You go to class later. I'll pick you up.

620
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,960
It's late. Mom's hot.

621
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
Okay, three.

622
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,960
Brother Yan Lan, I'm a little thirsty.

623
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,960
Okay. I'll buy you some water.

624
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,960
Boss, two bottles of ice water.

625
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Okay.

626
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,960
Come here.

627
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
They're paying.

628
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
Hurry up.

629
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,960
Hurry up.

630
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
Hurry up.

631
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,960
Hurry up.

632
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Sorry.

00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
Hurry up.

635
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,960
What are you doing?

636
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
Why are you opening the door so early?

637
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:54,960
What are you doing?

638
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
I'm in the bathroom. Of course, I'm the teacher.

639
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
What else can I do?

640
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
Let's go.

641
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
You're not going to charge water.

642
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,960
I'm sorry.

643
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,960
No.

644
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,960
What are you doing?

645
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
I'm going to drive you out.

646
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
I'm going to drive you out.

647
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
Why should I drive you out?

648
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
Drive me out?

649
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
You drive us out.

650
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,960
I'm serious.

651
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,960
If you're serious, you can talk to me later.

652
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
I didn't do anything. Why did you arrest me?

653
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,960
How could the police arrest me?

654
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
I'll send you back when you're out.

655
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,960
This is my job. Do you understand?

656
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
No. I don't understand.

657
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,960
