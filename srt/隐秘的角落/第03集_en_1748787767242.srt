00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Hello, everyone. I'm the temporary teacher of the Shuqi House.

30
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
My name is Zhang Dongsheng.

31
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Hello, teacher.

32
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,720
First of all, welcome everyone to attend this class.

33
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,720
It's my most desired thing to see more people like math.

34
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,720
I'm very happy to see you all.

35
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,720
I'm very happy to see you all.

36
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,720
I'm very happy to see you all.

37
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,720
In the short time of the human civilization,

38
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
there is such a huge space.

39
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,720
The biggest achievement is the improvement of mathematics.

40
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Mathematics is the foundation of all science.

41
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,720
Does anyone know who invented the earliest指ing?

42
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,720
It's the famous mathematician of France, Li Karl.

43
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,720
The famous指ing is also called the DeKarl.

44
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,720
There are many versions of DeKarl's story.

45
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Some say it's a dream.

46
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Some say it's for the sake of a young and beautiful princess.

47
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,720
This is a simulation test.

48
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Our goal for this class is not only to improve the performance of mathematics,

49
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,720
but also to develop a kind of mathematical thinking.

50
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
I'll give you a small hint.

51
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,720
The final theme is the way to combine mathematics.

52
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,720
How do you feel?

53
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Not bad.

54
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Let's do a couple of things.

55
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
I'll pick up the kids later.

56
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Hurry up.

57
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Mr. Zhu, who are you?

58
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
I'm...

59
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
They asked me to come to you.

60
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Who are they?

61
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
They are the people in the class.

62
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
They asked me to come to you.

63
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Let's go.

64
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
That's a good thing.

65
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,720
This is a test class.

66
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,720
If you are not interested in mathematics,

67
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
you can register for the class.

68
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
A book?

69
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
What book?

70
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
What about the book?

71
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
What book do you have?

72
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,720
I'm going back to class.

73
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,720
You can't leave.

74
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Who are you? What are you doing?

75
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
I just want to tell you.

76
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Don't bully others.

77
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
What are you talking about?

78
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
What bully?

79
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Who am I bullying?

80
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Think about it.

81
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
You know who you are bullying.

82
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,720
What are you doing? Let me go.

83
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
I'm warning you.

84
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
My mother will pick me up later.

85
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
If you don't let me go,

86
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
she will beat you up.

87
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,720
I did something.

88
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
It's okay.

89
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Just let me go.

90
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Then you are sure about it.

91
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,720
You agree with me not to bully others anymore.

92
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,320
I'm here, teacher!

93
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Teacher!

94
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,320
What's going on, Uncle?

95
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,320
I just want to ask Gao Tai

96
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
not to bully you again.

97
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,120
Okay, Uncle and Yao.

98
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,920
So you two are just a couple.

99
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,920
You're the one who bullied me.

100
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,520
No, Chu Yin Yin.

101
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
You misunderstood.

102
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,920
You two know each other.

103
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,520
You're the one who bullied me.

104
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,520
You two wait.

105
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
I'll go call my dad

106
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,120
and let him beat you to death.

107
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,920
That's his dad.

108
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,520
I'm sorry, Uncle.

109
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,320
I just want to leave.

110
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,720
I'm going to catch you two.

111
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,320
Teacher, help me!

112
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,120
Someone beat me!

113
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,320
Who beat you?

114
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,520
I'll let you go.

115
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,920
You two are the most useless people in this world.

116
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
I'm sorry, sister.

117
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,920
Don't make fun of me.

118
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,720
I just want everyone to see you bully me.

120
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,120
We're not that bad.

121
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Don't you want to help me?

122
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
You're dreaming.

123
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,320
Tell me.

124
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,120
He's just a couple.

125
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,520
I don't like you at all.

126
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,520
You're lying.

127
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,720
Say it again.

128
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,520
Uncle said he hates you.

129
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,520
He hates you.

130
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,720
You're sorry?

131
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,520
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,720
I'll leave you alone.

133
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,720
I won't leave you here.

134
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,920
I'm sorry.

135
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,920
Brother Cheng.

136
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,520
Brother Cheng.

137
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,200
but since we're behind you,

138
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,680
can you let us meet again?

139
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,400
No.

140
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,280
This is the method.

141
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,800
Leave it for me.

142
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,560
I forgot it.

143
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Take it.

144
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,960
It's pretty far.

145
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,600
We're beyond that.

146
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,380
If K makingですね,

147
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,960

00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,960
Come a bit.

149
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,760
How about that?

150
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,520
This is their house.

151
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,840
The authority said that

152
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,060
if Xiao Ke asks the government to make a pure ¤10

153
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,040
煒 ¤20.

154
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,040
I'm the general manager of the hotel.

155
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Okay. I'll be in charge of the security.

156
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Okay, you guys come quickly.

157
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
Don't look! Don't look!

158
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Let's go! Let's go!

159
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Don't look!

160
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Okay! Don't look! Don't look!

161
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Brother Lei!

162
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Madam!

163
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
Where did you go, Madam?

164
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,040
I'm sorry, Brother Yang.

165
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,040
What are you sorry for? What happened?

166
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
Let's go away.

168
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Brother Lei.

169
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
Brother Lei.

170
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
What's up, Brother Lei?

171
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
How are you, Brother Lei?

172
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
I'm on kitchen sale to show that

173
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,040
there are 16 retail populations

174
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
in the new sector.

175
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Excuse me.

176
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Hello.

177
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,340

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,040
Hey, chef Xiang.

179
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,860
You know

180
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,540
let me help you clean up.

181
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,860
I need the toothbrush.

182
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,860
I can't climb up.

183
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,620
He's still on the 4th floor.

184
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,620
Why did he come here?

185
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,420
He told me to go to the toilet.

186
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,420
Then he didn't come back.

187
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,300
I took him

188
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,460
from the warehouse.

189
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,540
I wanted to tell him

190
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,460
that you shouldn't bully him anymore.

191
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,780
Then he saw

192
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,060
Chaoyang's brother.

193
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,060
He kept scolding us

194
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,140
and climbing up the window.

195
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,860
Then he

196
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,860
didn't know what happened.

197
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,020
He fell down.

198
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,340
Since he fell down,

199
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,100
it has nothing to do with you.

200
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,300
But will they believe me?

201
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,980
If they don't say anything,

202
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,300
they will say no more.

203
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,900
The police can believe me.

204
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,020
Can my dad believe me?

205
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,780
Chaoyang.

206
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,300
Even my dad can believe me,

207
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,220
Zhu Jianjin is the one

208
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,340
who fell down because of me.

209
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,980
Can he forgive me?

210
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,060
And Pu Pu?

211
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,780
Do you want him to be happy?

212
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,860
I'm sorry, Chaorou.

213
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,300
It's all my fault.

214
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,540
I gave you a surprise wordscaping too...

215
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,940
Are they on me?

216
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,060
No, they didn't.

217
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,140
That's great.

218
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,100
Just tell me who you want to通 IXDo.

219
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,960
Thank you.

220
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,960
I'm lonely here.

221
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,520
Before you go,

222
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,140
Thank you.

223
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,100
It's a rumor.

224
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,140
Bring me the tea and water I made.

225
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,740
Brother, you're too fierce today.

226
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,940
I'm sorry.

227
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,580
I didn't do anything wrong.

228
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,740
I was wrong about it.

229
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,140
I brought tea and water again.

230
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,860
If her father knew about this,

231
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,900
how would he think of her?

232
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,860
Will he be like us and not his father?

233
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,060
I know.

234
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,740
Eat first.

235
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,300
The first day of the trip

236
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

237
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

238
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

239
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

240
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

241
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

242
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

243
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

244
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

245
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

246
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

247
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

248
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

249
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

250
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
I'm going to have a drink with you.

251
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
Didn't you know that I'm a good mother?

252
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,300
You're dreaming.

253
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,300
You told me that

254
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
you're a good mother.

255
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,300
Chaoyang, you're a good mother.

256
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Chaoyang, you're a good mother.

257
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,300
Chaoyang.

258
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,300
Mom.

259
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
Why are you back?

260
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,300
I'm wearing a good clothes.

261
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,300
Why are you going out?

262
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,300
Where are you going?

263
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,300
To see your dad.

264
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
Where are your dad?

265
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,300
Mom, he's gone back to court.

266
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Mom.

267
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Mom.

268
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,180
Mom.

269
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,300
Mom.

270
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,820
I don't know.

271
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,580
Chaoyang's mother, why are you here?

272
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,420
She's Chaoyang's father.

273
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,700
Chaoyang,

274
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,740
go and see your father.

275
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,260
Go to the kitchen,

276
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,900
and see your father.

277
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,420
Hurry.

278
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,300
I will go there to located my death order.

279
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,840
Father.

280
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,820
What are you thinking?

281
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,820
Have you got a prize?

282
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,620
I can't even tell you the winner and yes.

283
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,700
How can you call the enemy just say that?

284
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,700
You just want to rape me

285
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,980
If I'm thatiration,

286
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,620
then will you be mine?

287
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,660
Even you are an encyclopedia,

288
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,420
you'll never find anything

289
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,860
Also, I'll be your guide

290
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,580
Just follow me

291
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,260
I've got the fool

292
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,260
Add the egg white and the egg yolk

293
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Add the egg yolk

294
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
Add the egg yolk

295
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,260
Add the egg yolk

296
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,260
Add the egg yolk

297
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,260
Add the egg yolk

298
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,260
Add the egg yolk

299
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,260
Add the egg yolk

300
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,260
Add the egg yolk

301
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,260
Add the egg yolk

302
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,260
Add the egg yolk

303
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,260
Add the egg yolk

304
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,260
Add the egg yolk

305
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,260
Add the egg yolk

306
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,260
Add the egg yolk

307
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,260
Add the egg yolk

308
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,260
Add the egg yolk

309
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,260
Add the egg yolk

310
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,260
I'm going to bed

311
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,260
Zhao Yang

312
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,260
You are so good

313
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,260
I'm going to bed

314
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,260
I'm going to bed

315
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
What is this?

316
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,260
There is a star and a moon in the sky

317
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
Who said that? What if one day?

318
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,260
And we can't see the moon

319
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,260
even if we are standing here

320
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,260
I'm going to bed

321
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,260
What's the meaning of this?

322
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,260
Hey, come down

323
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,260
I saw you talking about the brush and the brush

324
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,260
And you jumped up and down so fast

325
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
It's interesting

326
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,260
I'm going to bed

327
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,260
I'm going to bed

328
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,260
I'm going to bed

329
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,260
Hello

330
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,260
Mr. Ye, the report is out

331
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,260
Tell me

332
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,260
The girl has a blood pressure and a small skin disease

333
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,260
It's not her

334
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,260
It means that she has a lot of problems

335
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,260
It shouldn't be an exception

336
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,260
Now the report is ready

337
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,260
It's doing DNA testing and evaluation

338
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,260
Okay, I know

339
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,260
Don't be idle

340
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,260
Check the family relationship and social relationship

341
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,260
You go and check Zhu Jingjing's school route

342
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,260
Let Xiaoli

343
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,260
Confirm the security problem with Shao Tiankong

344
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,260
Okay, I know

345
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,260
Mr. Ye, how can you be so quiet?

346
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,260
I'm not quiet

347
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,260
You are a kid

348
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,260
Are you okay?

349
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,260
I'm fine

350
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,260
Dongsheng

351
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,260
Help me organize the report of the Australia class

352
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,260
I didn't expect

353
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,260
such a big thing would happen on the first day of the summer

354
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,260
What's going on?

355
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,260
Mr. Yu is a student of the birthday class

356
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,260
He fell down from the fifth floor

357
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,260
Isn't the birthday class on the fourth floor?

358
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,260
I don't know how the kid went to the fifth floor

359
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,260
from the morning

360
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,260
He fell down from the morning

361
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,260
I have a meeting

362
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,260
If you organize it, you can put it on my desk

363
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,260
I got it back

364
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,260
The school is under control

365
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,260
I got it back

366
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,260
This is the new building

367
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,260
The building is not fully open

368
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,260
There is only one

369
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,260
Is there any foundation for the staff?

370
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,260
There is

371
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,260
But the first day of the summer class

372
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,260
Many parents brought the kid to the class

373
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,260
It's a big place

374
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,260
and the staff is very small

375
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,260
So the staff didn't make any foundation

376
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,260
I can have a lot of tea

377
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:49,960
If you don't have any

378
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,760
I discussed with Pu Pu

379
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,260
We are going to leave for the office

380
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,260
Qiaoqiao's road.

381
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,260
Qiaoqiao's road is through the road.

382
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,260
It seems to be my mother.

383
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,260
Go to the balcony.

384
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,260
Go.

385
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,260
Qiao Yang.

386
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,260
Mom.

387
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
Uncle Ye is here.

388
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Uncle Ye is here.

389
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
Hello.

390
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,260
It's okay.

391
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
I just want to ask you a few questions.

392
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Is Qiao Yang still eating?

393
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,260
Or you can finish it.

394
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,260
I'm done.

395
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,260
Come, sit here.

396
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,260
Okay.

397
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,260
Sit with Uncle Ye.

398
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,260
Let me.

399
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,260
Do you still remember Uncle Ye?

400
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,260
I'm your father.

401
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
I remember you, Uncle Ye.

402
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,260
Relax.

403
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,260
Don't be nervous.

404
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,260
I want to know some things.

405
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,260
When was the last time you saw Zhu Jingjing?

406
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,260
I haven't seen her for several times.

407
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,260
The last time she was my father

408
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,260
when she was buying me a shoe.

409
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,260
I think it was last week.

410
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
Last week?

411
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,260
You know what happened to the young man?

412
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,260
I know.

413
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,260
My mother took me to the hospital.

414
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,260
I mean the day when the young man was there.

415
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
Didn't you go?

416
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,260
I went to attend the audition class of the Australian class.

417
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,260
I left in the afternoon.

418
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,260
Qiao Yang likes math.

419
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,260
The next question from uncle.

420
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
You may feel uncomfortable.

421
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,260
Didn't you see Zhu Jingjing?

422
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,260
When I was in class,

423
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,260
I saw a bunch of people in the yard.

424
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,260
I didn't know what to do.

425
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,260
I went home.

426
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,260
My mother knew I didn't like to watch the heat.

427
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:29,260
Then I realized

428
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,260
that Zhu Jingjing is the one who is in the other side.

429
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,260
He's mad.

430
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,260
Qiao Yang.

431
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,260
Qiao Yang.

432
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,260
About the young man,

433
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,260
if you remember something,

434
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,260
you should contact uncle Ye.

435
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
Officer Ye.

436
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,260
You're done asking.

437
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,260
I have to go back to the police station.

438
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,260
It's far away.

439
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,260
I'm afraid I can't get on the boat.

440
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,260
It's almost done.

441
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,260
Sorry.

442
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,260
Sorry.

443
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,260
Qiao Yang.

444
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,260
Because it's a fixed procedure,

445
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,260
I might need to take a step back.

446
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:28,260
I'll contact you when I get there.

447
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,260
Goodbye, uncle Ye.

448
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,260
Goodbye.

449
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,260
Don't eat these rubbish videos.

450
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,260
They're all in the fridge.

451
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,260
You don't eat them.

452
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,260
The carbonated drinks are not good for your health.

453
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,260
I know.

454
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
I'm leaving.

455
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,260
Put your clothes on.

456
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,260
Goodbye, mom.

457
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,260
Don't stay up late.

458
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,260
Go to bed early.

459
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,260
The child is pregnant.

460
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,260
He has to take responsibility for his health.

461
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,260
Get off.

462
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
I'm leaving.

463
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,260
I'll be back.

464
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,260
The police are suspecting you.

465
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,260
I don't know.

466
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,260
We'll clean up the boat.

467
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
We'll set off early tomorrow morning.

468
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Call me when you get to the H10.

469
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,260
Go back.

470
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
Here.

471
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,260
Take it.

472
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,260
Don't be hungry.

473
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
Thank you.

474
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Chang.

475
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
When my brother is well,

476
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
I'll bring him to see you.

477
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,260
Don't forget us.

478
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,260
No.

479
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,260
We're friends.

480
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Zhou Chaoyang.

481
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,260
We meet again.

482
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
