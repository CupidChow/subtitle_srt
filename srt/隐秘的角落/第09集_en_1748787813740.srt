1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I'm not going to care.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Who killed my daughter?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Who can bear it?

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You are a thief!

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Did you kill her?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not going to care.

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not going to care.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Brother Lian Lian.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why don't we go to Brother Changhang's house?

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's send him home.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Brother Lian Lian.

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Brother Lian Lian.

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Why don't we go to Changhang's house?

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's send him home.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay.

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What's wrong?

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let's go.

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't let go of my brother.

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's go.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Lian Lian.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's go.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Changhang, let's go to Uncle's house.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's go.

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's go.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Lian Lian.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Uncle.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are you tired?

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't come over.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Do you know how to kill people?

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Stop!

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It has nothing to do with you.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Put down the bottle.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Put down the bottle.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Go away.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Go away.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Go.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Uncle.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
How are you, Uncle?

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How are you?

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm fine.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm dead.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hello?

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Someone is injured.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let go of me.

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Changhang, let go of me.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Uncle Chang.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Uncle Chang.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let go of him.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let go of him.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Get in the car.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If you don't get in the car, you can't catch up.

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That person is...

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Why did he catch Zhu Chaoyang?

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't know it either.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I've never seen him.

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can get in the car anytime.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So if you want me to help you,

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you'd better answer my question.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll get in the car.

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to take you to the hospital.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll get you back to the hospital.

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll take you to the hospital.

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm going to take you to the hospital.

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll get you to the hospital.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll get you back to the hospital.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll get you back to the hospital.

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't listen to me.

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Then you'd better tell the truth.

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Why do you still go to the hospital?

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why do you need so much money?

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Old Chen, hold on.

74
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Zhou Chao is coming.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You brat.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're a real man.

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I told you not to care about it.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You insisted on it.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Why did you sing a song?

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm your guardian now.

81
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I shouldn't have been your guardian.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Old Chen.

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Old Chen, how are you?

84
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Old Chen.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Old Chen.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let me go.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If you want me to save him,

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
just promise me to wait in the car.

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Old Chen.

90
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't want to see you anymore.

91
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What are you doing?

92
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I didn't think about it.

93
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I really don't know about your business.

94
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay.

95
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll get you married now.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll keep you company.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yue Yue.

98
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Please don't tell me.

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm a man of the world.

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then...

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Then you'll kill him.

102
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I didn't.

103
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I killed myself.

104
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You told me just now.

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Now tell your dad.

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I didn't.

107
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I didn't.

108
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Zhong Ping.

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Wang Lin.

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I want to tell you something.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Wang Lin.

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What are you doing?

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't come back.

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Dad, I've been in the car for a long time.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Come back to save me.

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I said forget it.

117
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Come on.

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Is he a patient?

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes, he's my client.

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay, wait outside.

121
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Mr. Zhang.

122
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Mr. Zhang.

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Help me.

124
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Mr. Zhang.

125
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Mr. Zhang.

126
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Mr. Zhang.

127
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Mr. Zhang.

128
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What is it?

129
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He has helped you before.

130
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This is a misunderstanding.

131
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I am his mentor.

132
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Mr. Zhang, are you okay?

133
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Listen to me.

134
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't know what's going on between of you.

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Get up.

136
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Get up.

137
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Listen to me.

138
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
My money is in his bag.

139
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Kneel down.

140
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
My money is in his bag.

141
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Just in the car.

142
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Let me go.

143
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't want it.

144
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I don't want it.

145
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I didn't see anything.

146
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Let me go.

147
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I didn't see anything.

148
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I didn't see anything.

149
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I didn't see anything.

150
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I didn't see anything.

151
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Let me go.

152
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
He hung up.

153
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Keep fighting.

154
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hurry.

155
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Why don't you see him?

156
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Why?

157
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Wait a minute.

158
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't worry.

159
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Wang Yang,

160
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll give you the money.

161
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What do you want?

162
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why do you want to fight Chaoyang?

163
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let him answer the phone.

164
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hurry.

165
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Do you hear me?

166
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'll tell him.

167
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He hung up again.

168
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I really don't know how he would do this.

169
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't care about you.

170
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Wang Yang,

171
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
if anything happens to Chaoyang,

172
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
what kind of bastard will you kill?

173
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'll let your brother die.

174
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
How can you let me die?

175
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Do you hear me?

176
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Hurry.

177
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Call him.

178
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Come here.

179
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Answer the phone.

180
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Don't do this, okay?

181
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Answer the phone.

182
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Chaoyang.

183
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Chaoyang.

184
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Chaoyang.

185
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Chaoyang.

186
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What's wrong?

187
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Where are you?

188
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm just here to talk to you.

189
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What's the matter?

190
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I just came to ask you.

191
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What's the matter?

192
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why don't you answer the phone?

193
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Chaoyang!

194
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Chaoyang!

195
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Chaoyang!

196
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
Chaoyang!

197
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,680
Chaoyang!

198
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,560
Why are you here?

199
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,760
I'm not here.

200
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Chaoyang!

201
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Chaoyang!

202
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,560
Chaoyang!

203
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,320
Come down right away!

204
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,040
I'm not done with him.

205
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,800
Okay, I got it.

206
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,800
You get lost!

207
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,560
Be careful!

208
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,720
You Ping!

209
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,120
Where's Brother Chang?

210
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,240
Zhu Cheng, are you okay?

211
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,320
Don't worry.

212
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,720
Thank you.

213
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,440
Are you okay?

214
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,760
I'm fine.

215
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,240
Open the door!

216
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,600
Are you okay?

217
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,560
Find Wang Li!

218
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,440
Call me!

219
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,400
Wang Li, I'm fine.

220
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm fine.

221
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,920
I'm fine.

222
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,760
I'm fine.

223
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,560
I'm fine.

224
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,320
I'm fine.

225
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,160
I'm fine.

226
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,960
I'm fine.

227
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,760
I'm fine.

228
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,760
I'm fine.

229
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
I'm fine.

230
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
I'm fine.

231
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
I'm fine.

232
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,760
I'm fine.

233
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
I'm fine.

234
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
I'm fine.

235
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,760
I'm fine.

236
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
I'm fine.

237
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,760
I'm fine.

238
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,760
I'm fine.

239
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,760
I'm fine.

240
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,760
I'm fine.

241
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,760
I'm fine.

242
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
I'm fine.

243
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
I'm fine.

244
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
I'm fine.

245
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
I'm fine.

246
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
I'm fine.

247
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,760
I'm fine.

248
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
I'm fine.

249
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
I'm fine.

250
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,760
I'm fine.

251
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
Shimo,

252
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
don't worry.

253
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Shimo, I'm fine.

254
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Don't worry.

255
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
Okay.

256
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
How is Chen?

257
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Right.

258
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,020
He's injured.

259
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,520
He's injured a little bit.

260
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
He's in a good mood.

261
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
But he's in danger now.

262
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Who sent him here?

263
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
A boy.

264
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
But he's gone.

265
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Okay.

266
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
You watch Chen.

267
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,520
We'll go to the scene.

268
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,520
Okay.

269
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Chen, call us.

270
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Okay.

271
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
I ask you this,

272
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,520
what happened today?

273
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
What did you do to my son?

274
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Well,

275
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,020
I'll sleep in the tent.

276
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,020
I'll tell you after I wake up.

277
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,760
Wang Yao you and your family

278
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,020
have been together for so many times.

279
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,520
Let me tell you.

280
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,760
If my son has a three-stage Liang Duan,

281
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,760
I'll never let you off.

282
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,720
I will let you go.

283
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
I must investigate this matter thoroughly.

284
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,560
This is a misunderstanding.

285
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,720
Zhao An is also a flower.

286
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
How can I be so ungrateful?

287
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,120
Don't be angry.

288
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,720
The doctor said there is nothing to be sad about.

289
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Nothing to be sad about?

290
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
What do you mean there is nothing to be sad about?

291
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Is Duan Ge not a dead body?

292
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Okay, you go.

293
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Don't disturb my son's rest.

294
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,720
He is too deep.

295
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

296
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

297
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

298
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

299
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

300
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

301
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

302
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

303
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

304
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

305
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

306
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

307
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

308
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
The number you have dialed is busy.

309
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,720
What questions did you get?

310
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,720
No!

311
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,720
No questions?

312
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,720
Yes!

313
00:21:51,720 --> 00:22:13,720
Louder!

314
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Hey, hey, hey.

315
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
What are you doing here?

316
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,520
Fortunately, Zhou Shuang Mu went out.

317
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,520
If he sees you,

318
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,720
you two will be in a hurry.

319
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,120
Let's go.

320
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,120
Is Chao Yang awake?

321
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,320
What for?

322
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,320
Can you tell Chao Yang?

323
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,120
What?

324
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,320
Can you not tell Wang Lin?

325
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,520
As long as Chao Yang agrees,

326
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,120
I can apologize to him.

327
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
It's okay.

328
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,920
You don't need to apologize.

329
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,720
It's okay with you.

330
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,920
It's your brother's problem.

331
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,320
Yong Ping.

332
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
I'm begging you.

333
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
Chao Yang is not awake yet.

334
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,120
You go back first.

335
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,120
Yong Ping.

336
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Let it go.

337
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,320
Exactly.

338
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,240
What happens if you stay up?

339
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,040
And get up?

340
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,080
What's the situation?

341
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,260
Sorry, but just have another drink warn you...

342
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,900
Telling First Brother to come.

343
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,900
When your dad was sick, my grandpa told me to drink.

344
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,020
It's my turn.

345
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
He's so stupid.

346
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,520
Don't worry.

347
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,560
Dad is here.

348
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,120
Don't worry.

349
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,680
I'll catch him

350
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,880
and tie him up.

351
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,240
I'll teach you

352
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,920
the right and wrong.

353
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,360
Yongchun.

354
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,800
I'll torture him.

355
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,680
How is it?

356
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,160
When he was asleep,

357
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,880
his aunt came.

358
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,200
He said he wanted to apologize to you.

359
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,080
He's like this.

360
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,080
He's a grown-up.

361
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:20,880
It's okay to apologize to him

362
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,880
when he's rich.

363
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,600
He's his brother.

364
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,120
Right?

365
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,360
Aunt Wang said

366
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,000
after you were discharged,

367
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,680
he would bring Wang Li to you

368
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,440
and give you a kneel.

369
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,280
He would apologize to us.

370
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,840
If

371
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,600
we tell the police about this,

372
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,760
Wang Li will have to

373
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,400
sentence him for three to five years.

374
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,000
Dad.

375
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,760
What do you want to say?

376
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,920
Yangyang.

377
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,320
Aunt Wang's aunt

378
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,280
is just a brother.

379
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,640
She knows she's wrong now.

380
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,560
Can you

381
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,120
please

382
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,520
not tell the police?

383
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,120
Dad.

384
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
Don't you think I

385
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,960

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,080
You're Cha Yang's father, right?

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,440
Yes.

How is it?

398

Is it better?

399
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,160
Your mom said you were sick.

400
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,920
Teacher Zhang,

401
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,720
is there anything wrong with you today?

402
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,880
It's like this.

403
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,480
We're going to decide

404
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,520
to go to Guangzhou

405
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,840

It's a difficult opportunity.

00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,600
Yes.

411
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
Cha Yang is my favorite student.

412
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,280
Do you want to participate?

413
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,520
Yes.

414
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,720
Great opportunity.

00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,520
Cha Yang.

416
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,960
Do you want to challenge yourself?

417
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,480
Dad,

418
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,120
I'm a little hungry.

419
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,280
I'll buy you a wonton.

420
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,480
Teacher Zhang,

421
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,520
sorry.

422
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,600
I just came.

423
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,320
I'll go.

424
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,280
Next time, please eat.

425
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,560
Hurry up and catch this teacher.

426
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,440
OK.

427
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,920
I didn't tell anyone

428
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,120
about what happened last night.

429
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,040
I know.

430
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,440
If you say it,

431
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,920
I won't come here.

432
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,960
Thank you.

433
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,520
Don't thank me.

434
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,320
I'm going to the fridge

435
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
not only for you.

436
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,520
Why are you here?

437
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,600
I need the key.

438
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,440
The key to the fridge.

439
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,720
The body is still in the fridge.

440
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,760
I'll be with you at any time.

441
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:04,760
Thank you.

442
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,760
I found it.

443
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,920
After they found me,

444
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,160
they found you.

445
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:14,960
The same.

446
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
They found

447
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,840
your two friends.

448
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,040
Pupu asked me to save you

449
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,560
and told me a lot about you.

450
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,360
I can understand you.

451
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,720
Actually, we're the same.

452
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,640
We want to go back to normal.

453
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
We don't want to lose anything.

454
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,280
Don't worry.

455
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,840
I owe them.

456
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,920
They should be on the boat now.

457
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,640
When this is over,

458
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,760
I'll continue to be my employee.

459
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,200
What about you?

460
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,680
Continue to be your good son

461
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,800

462
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,800
This book

463
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,280
can finally be over.

464
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
I don't have the key.

465
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,720
The key is in my dad's.

466
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,000
I got you a report form

467
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,200
from Mr. Tang.

468
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,480
If you want to participate,

469
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,320
you can tell him.

470
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,840
We can't go back to normal.

471
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,720
What should we do?

472
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,320
We can't go back to normal.

473
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,320
What should we do?

474
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,320
We can't go back to normal.

475
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
The police are there.

476
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,520
If we get caught, we'll be dead.

477
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,560
Listen to them.

478
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,520
Boss, is there a money?

479
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,720

00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,980
What's wrong with you?

485
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,100
I'm sorry.

486
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,460
I think it's all my fault.

487
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,260
If it weren't for me,

488
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,900
there wouldn't be so many things happening.

489
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,900
Don't think about it.

490
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,500
We can beg Xin Xin tonight.

491
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,460
You should take good care of yourself.

492
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,380
Wait for the typhoon to stop.

493
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,460
What's the matter? Is the typhoon getting closer?

494
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,460
The main room is getting closer.

495
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,460
Let's see.

496
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,460
Why is there a door that's not open?

497
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,460
Who are you two?

498
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,460
Who is it?

499
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,460
Who is it?

500
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,460

Who is it?

506
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,460
Who is it?

507
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,460
Who is it?

508
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,460
Granny.

509
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
Granny.

510
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,460
What's wrong, Brother Ye Liang?

511
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,460
It's nothing.

512
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,460
We should go.

513
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,460
Where should we go?

Sure.

519
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,420
Do you like boys or girls?

520
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,460
Girls.

521
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,820
Girls with big eyes.

522
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,380
They look like a sheep.

523
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
