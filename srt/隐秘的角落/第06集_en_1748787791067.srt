00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
No.

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
No.

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
No.

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No.

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
No.

20
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No.

21
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I just walked in.

22
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is the man who took me to this place.

23
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Thank you, grandpa.

24
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Thank you, grandpa.

25
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Are you okay?

26
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Take her home.

27
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Goodbye, grandpa.

28
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Goodbye.

29
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The generation is stronger than the generation.

30
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The second generation of the man-made battery of the man-made battery

31
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is about to start.

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Next week.

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The next year.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Next week.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Next week.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Next week.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Next year.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Next week.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Next week.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Thank you.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Next week.

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Next week.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why aren't you drunk?

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I think I'll drink it later.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll drink it later.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll drink it later.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Drink it.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's not hot.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Drink it and go to bed early.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not good to wash your cup.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is it hot?

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Isn't it good?

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's not good to drink cold water.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll drink it myself.

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll drink it.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're grown up now.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can take care of yourself, right?

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You blame mom for not taking care of you, right?

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Mom, I didn't blame you.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If your dad is a responsible man,

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
if he didn't abandon us,

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
nothing would happen today.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Mom.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Actually, you didn't tell me anything.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What did I tell you?

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You know nothing about adults.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You should take care of yourself now.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Go to bed early and grow up.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You'll be fine when you grow up.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Mom, mom will be at the city to take care of me.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
She won't go to the police station.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Then you can go to the new house every day.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Go to the teeth.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Go to the teeth.

75
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Go to the teeth.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's go in and try it.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's wait for the sun.

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't know how to use this.

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're good, Yan Yang.

80
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're out, right?

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You dare to take the police phone?

82
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You took the camera, too, right?

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Tell me where you are.

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Aren't you a police officer?

85
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
How do you know where I am?

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm telling you.

87
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You'll report to me right now.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You'll be the one to do it.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't scare me.

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The camera is mine.

91
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll give you back the phone.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll be right back.

93
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hey, hey, hey.

94
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You're a rabbit.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Brother Chaoyang.

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How is it?

97
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Have you been waiting for me?

98
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I've been waiting for you. Let's go.

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hurry up.

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let's go out.

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Go out.

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Let's go out.

103
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Let's go out.

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's go.

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,280
Why don't you set up the line,

106
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,960
transfer the Squid핳,

107
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,080
and make some money from it?

108
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,500
I wanted to clean up the enamorate of remodeling the world.

109
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,140
Did you happen to see the 256 miles ДĒ neo?

110
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,780
Dad.

111
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,940
After all, we've been together for so many years.

112
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,420
I still want to give it some time.

113
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,220
You're back.

114
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,580
Where did his purse come from?

115
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,700
Let's talk.

116
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,260
Is this dragon too small?

117
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,140
You should change it to bigger one.

118
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,380
Let's talk about it.

119
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,540
What are you talking about?

120
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,820
I've already made the agreement.

121
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,940
If you want to see it, sign it as soon as possible.

122
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,420
You must do this.

123
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,900
I'll call the hospital.

124
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,380
They told me

125
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,140
that you haven't been to Guangzhou to study education.

126
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,980
Shi Jing,

127
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,580
I won't treat you so well in this world.

128
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,060
I'll give you everything I have.

129
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,260
I'll keep it safe.

130
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,020
I have nothing but you.

131
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,900
Nothing.

132
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,860
As long as you don't leave me,

133
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,860
I can accept anything.

134
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,860
I don't love you anymore.

135
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,580
Does that mean you accept it too?

136
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,020
So you still have me,

137
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,380
and I'm at your side?

138
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,460
Okay.

139
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,020
Before 5 p.m.,

140
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,020
Brother Yan An is still a bit fierce.

141
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

142
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,020
If you don't have your 60,000 yuan

143
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
before 5 o'clock tomorrow afternoon,

144
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,020
you'll be arrested by the police.

145
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,020
That's all.

146
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,020
I can't use the police's machine gun.

147
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
I'll go get it.

148
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,020
Hello?

149
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Let me tell you.

150
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
If you don't have your money

151
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,020
before 5 o'clock tomorrow afternoon,

152
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,020
the police will arrest you.

153
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,020
I only have 30,000 yuan for you.

154
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,020
There's not much left.

155
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,020
We've already paid 30,000 yuan.

156
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,020
Why don't you give the machine gun to the police?

157
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,020
Don't sell it to me. I won't buy it.

158
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,020
But I have to remind you.

159
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,020
You've already received the money.

160
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,020
In the court, it's called beating and beating.

161
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,020
You're also criminals.

162
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
The police can send you to the police station.

163
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,020
So I advise you

164
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,020
to give the machine gun to me

165
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,020
after 30,000 yuan.

166
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
Think about it.

167
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,820
What's wrong, Yan Liang?

168
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
What did he say?

169
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,020
Chen Huo.

170
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,020
Why didn't you answer the phone?

171
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,020
The travel bureau has a job.

172
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,020
I have to attend the job.

173
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,020
So I won't be in trouble these days.

174
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,020
I told Cha Yang that

175
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,020
we'll go to the play on this Saturday.

176
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,020
You said he wouldn't go last time.

177
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,020
I promised my mom

178
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,020
to take him back to the county on Saturday.

179
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,020
It's okay.

180
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,020
It's okay next Saturday.

181
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,020
Next Saturday?

182
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,020
I have to go back to pick him up.

183
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,020
Excuse me.

184
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,020
You treated me like aormal guy.

185
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,540
your country.

186
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,520
Don't be afraid ofbrother-in-law.

187
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,120
You'll suffer.

188
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,400
Do I dare you?

189
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,680
Dad,

190
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,160
this one

191
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,520
is about

192
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,360
someone

193
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,380
previous income of our family

194
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,380
It's time to get married.

195
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,140
I'm sorry, Cheng Hong.

196
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,840
Must be really hard to go to school off work these days.

197
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,140
Why don't you bring me to school?

198
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,920
Li Qing's is the best.

199
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,640
What?

200
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,340
I'm afraid she doesn't love me.

201
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,420
These are real interests, not a real family.

202
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,140
Section director,

203
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,240
why did you only?

204
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,940
I don't understand but you do understand.

205
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,020
What do you understand?

206
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,720
Don't be sad.

207
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,480
Please spare me,

208
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,740
sir.

209
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,120
Will she really be framed for arresting us?

210
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,680
If the police finds out about it actually,

211
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,080
it's no wonder I enjoyed being that charged,

212
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,080
I'm the one who made the decision.

213
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,080
I want the money.

214
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,080
This $30,000 should be on my head.

215
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,080
But you want this money only because of me.

216
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
Stop arguing.

217
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
I'm not afraid.

218
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
Don't cry.

219
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
Time to work.

220
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
RecBeifall work.

221
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,060
I'm working to send you the document.

222
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
Do you want to carry out your works.

223
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
Okay.

224
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
You're busy.

225
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Okay.

226
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
Get some rest.

227
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,080
Chen Jingguan.

228
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
I'm asking you something.

229
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Why are you so polite?

230
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,080
Don't you think it's your style?

231
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,080
Is it a serious crime to kill a rat?

232
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,080
Kill a rat?

233
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
Who killed a rat?

234
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Liang, tell me clearly.

235
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
What do you mean?

236
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,080
You're a rat.

237
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,080
I'm a rat.

238
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,080
I'm a rat.

239
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,080
I'm a rat.

240
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
What do you mean?

241
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,080
Hello?

242
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,080
Talk to me.

243
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,080
Hello?

244
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
Talk to me.

245
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,080
Don't be so agitated.

246
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,080
It's not me.

247
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
It's just a rat.

248
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,080
For example, you see someone hitting someone.

249
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
You see someone stealing things.

250
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,080
But you didn't call the police.

251
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,080
But you ask the thief for money.

252
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
You stole things, didn't you?

253
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
Tell me.

254
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
What's going on?

255
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
I didn't steal anything.

256
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
I just want to ask you.

257
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Forget it.

258
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
I can't tell you.

259
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
You bastard.

260
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Come on.

261
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Show me your book.

262
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
It's late.

263
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
Don't do it.

264
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,080
It's late.

265
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Do it again tomorrow.

266
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,080
Rest first.

267
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,080
I can't sleep.

268
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Go to sleep.

269
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
Do you want me to buy you some sleeping pills?

270
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
This is Jin Jin's performance uniform.

271
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
It's just changed.

272
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
How about changing your room?

273
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Jin Jin likes this.

274
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
I will go to the factory first.

275
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
I will go to the factory.

276
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,080
Don't be so agitated.

277
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
I will go to the factory.

278
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,080
I will go to the factory.

279
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,080
I will go to the factory.

280
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,080
I will go to the factory first.

281
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,080
I will go with you.

282
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
I will go to the factory.

283
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
I will go to the factory.

284
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,080
What should I do?

285
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
Go to the factory.

286
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Brother Lin.

287
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
It's time for the meal.

288
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,080
Brother Lin.

289
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
Did your wife and child come down to eat?

290
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
It's so early.

291
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,680
Who can tell me what this is?

292
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Love.

293
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,280
Love.

294
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,280
We call it the new line.

295
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,280
About the new line, there is a beautiful story.

296
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
It's about Deacar.

297
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,680
Deacar and the beautiful Princess of Rui Dian are in love.

298
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,080
Because they are over 30 years old.

299
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,680
When the king knew, he turned his back on him.

300
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,280
And he let Deacar go.

301
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:21,280
Deacar wrote a letter to the princess before he left.

302
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,280
He wrote this letter.

303
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,080
When the princess received this letter,

304
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,680
Deacar was already dead in the prison.

305
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,780
The princess didn't get married.

306
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:51,280
And the image of this palace is the new line.

307
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,880
Isn't it romantic?

308
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,780
But the truth is that it's always more than the same.

309
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,380
This story has another version.

310
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,780
The princess doesn't care about Deacar.

311
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,280
Deacar is not sick,

312
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,580
but betrayed.

313
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,580
So is the truth or the same?

314
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,380
It's your choice.

315
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,880
Just like using the way to solve this question,

316
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,380
it's also your choice.

317
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,280
Quick.

318
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,980
Suddenly,

319
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,180
What's up, Galactic Bei?

320
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,180
I thought he was dated.

321
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,180
I'll call you.

322
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Hello.

323
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,180
Hey, He Chen.

324
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,180
Why don't you answer my phone?

325
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,180
I'm not answering your phone.

326
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,180
I'm not answering your phone.

327
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,180
I'm cold.

328
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,180
It's a late night.

329
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,180
What's the matter?

330
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,180
It's like this.

331
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,180
Did you see the first few people who were on the way to the hospital?

332
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,180
I saw it.

333
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,180
That's Yan Wenbin's release.

334
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,180
It may be this month.

335
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,180
Or next month.

336
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,180
But I have to cooperate with the prison.

337
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,180
Which hospital are you in now?

338
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,180
I'll send you the information.

339
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,180
I'm not in the way now.

340
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,180
Where are you going?

341
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
I'll send you the information.

342
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,180
Okay.

343
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,180
Then we'll...

344
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,180
We'll have a little bit of time.

345
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,180
We'll have a little bit of time.

346
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,180
I'll check with the prison now.

347
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,180
I'll check with the prison now.

348
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,180
I'll check with the prison now.

349
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,180
I'll give you a little bit of time.

350
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,180
How is it, Yan Leng?

351
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,180
How is it, Yan Leng?

352
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,180
I'm afraid I'll be released.

353
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,180
Uncle.

354
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,180
Old Ji You is not far from here.

355
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,180
What are you waiting for?

356
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,180
People are waiting for you to come back.

357
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,180
If anything happens in Chang'an,

358
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,180
call me immediately.

359
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,180
You're not going to tell Yan Leng?

360
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,180
But what if they recognize you as a fake?

361
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Who is Yan Leng?

362
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,180
No one can catch me.

363
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,180
Keep an eye on him.

364
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,180
Don't learn anything.

365
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
I'll be back soon.

366
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
Don't run away.

367
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,180
Don't run away.

368
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,180
Ten dollars.

369
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,180
Don't run away.

370
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,180
Hey.

371
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,180
I met him again.

372
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,180
What are you doing?

373
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,180
Don't run away.

374
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,180
I know him.

375
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,180
I know him.

376
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,180
Let's go.

377
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,180
You're really a kid.

378
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,780
Where are you going?

379
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,180
What are you doing?

380
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,380
You're not done yet? You're already here, aren't you?

381
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,080
You're not cruel enough.

382
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,780
Guo Gei, who told you to take my dad to the door?

383
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,180
I'll give you a lesson.

384
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,580
Sorry, I'm late.

385
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,280
I know you still hate me.

386
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,780
I couldn't take you to the hospital.

387
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,480
Your dad must go to the prison.

388
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,680
He can't take care of you at all.

389
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,780
If you really want your dad to think about it,

390
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,680
go back to the hospital.

391
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,180
Don't make a fuss about it.

392
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,580
What's the fuss?

393
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,180
What's the fuss?

394
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,980
I didn't do anything bad.

395
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,780
Do you believe it?

396
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,180
Okay. I believe it.

397
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,380
After you finish eating,

398
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,980
I'll send you back to the prison.

399
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,380
I'll arrange for your dad's business. Okay?

400
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,180
Understand?

401
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,980
Don't think about running away.

402
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,180
Everyone is my colleague. Take one mouthful.

403
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,780
I want to see why my dad is so hard to take care of.

404
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,180
He needs so many reasons.

405
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:59,180
Is he dead?

406
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Is he dead?

407
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,180
If he's dead,

408
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,180
just tell me.

409
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,180
Your dad isn't dead.

410
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,180
But he's not in prison.

411
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,180
He's in the hospital.

412
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,180
I'll arrange for a detective's time.

413
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,180
I'll take you to see him.

414
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,180
After the detective's done,

415
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,180
you can go back to the prison.

416
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,180
Can you do it?

417
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,180
Yes.

418
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Can you?

419
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,180
Yes.

420
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,180
And,

421
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,180
before the detective's done,

422
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
you can take me to the prison.

423
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,180
Don't do anything illegal.

424
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,180
Otherwise, you won't have a door.

425
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,180
Can you do it?

426
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,180
Yes.

427
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,180
Here.

428
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,180
This is my wife's phone.

429
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,180
I'll call you.

430
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,180
You need to answer it.

431
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,180
Got it?

432
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,180
Okay.

433
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,180
What are you doing?

434
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,180
Go.

435
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
Eat.

436
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,180
Have some vinegar.

437
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,180
Brother Yan Lan, why are you back?

438
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,180
You're in a hurry.

439
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,180
Why are you here?

440
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,180
I saw you didn't come back.

441
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,180
I was afraid something happened to you.

442
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,180
What time is it?

443
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,180
Bad news.

444
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,180
The boat is about to break.

445
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,180
Hurry up.

446
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,180
Bye, teacher.

447
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,180
Teacher Jiang.

448
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,180
What's wrong?

449
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,180
Did you hear anything?

450
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,180
I'm here to find you.

451
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,180
It's not because of this.

452
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
Okay.

453
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,180
Did you take the camera?

454
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,180
No.

455
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,180
Did your little friend

456
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,180
give you the phone number

457
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,180
without the phone number?

458
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,180
Don't scare us.

459
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,180
I can't call the police.

460
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,180
If the police ask,

461
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,180
we'll be in danger.

462
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,180
We'll tell the police the truth.

463
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,180
And the money will be mine.

464
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,180
The bank card is the real one.

465
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,180
You think the police is next to you?

466
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,180
Anyway, you killed two people.

467
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,180
It must be you.

468
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,180
You haven't left yet?

469
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,180
Yes.

470
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,180
You're so anxious.

471
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,180
How much money can you give?

472
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,180
You don't need to care.

473
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,180
You're smarter than them.

474
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:20,180
How about this?

475
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,180
Give me the camera.

476
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,180
I'll give you all the money.

477
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,180
You don't need to give me the money.

478
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,180
I don't want money.

479
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,180
Why don't you do it?

480
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,180
For your friend.

481
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,180
For your friend?

482
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,180
For your friend.

483
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,180
Your friend

484
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,180
will give you the money

485
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,180
without me.

486
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,180
But you're so reckless.

487
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,180
I trust them.

488
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,180
I trust that

489
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,180
they'll pay the price.

490
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,180
Fine.

491
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,180
I'll give you the money

492
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
in the next three days.

493
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,180
Mr. Zhang.

494
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,180
Which one do you trust?

495
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,180
What do you trust?

496
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,180
The story

497
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:24,180
of the bank card you mentioned.

498
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,180
Yang Yang.

499
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,180
Yang Yang.

500
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,180
You just graduated?

501
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,180
Yes.

502
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,180
Why did your friend

503
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,180
come out so early?

504
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,180
I didn't know that.

505
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,180
I went to change my teacher.

506
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,180
Did you learn it?

507
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,180
Awesome.

508
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,180
Stand up.

509
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,180
Is it good?

510
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,180
You love sweet food.

511
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,180
It's rare for your dad

512
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,180
to regret eating it.

513
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,180
He only eats this.

514
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,180
Your mom knows

515
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,180
you're a sweet eater.

516
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,180
You're a little bit clumsy.

517
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,180
Yang Yang.

518
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,180
A while ago,

519
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,180
your mom and dad

520
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,180
came to explain to you

521
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,180
earlier.

522
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,180
I'm fine.

523
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
Your sister

524
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,180
is more important to her.

525
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,180
She can't accept it now.

526
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,180
But don't worry.

527
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,180
She won't do it again.

528
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,180
The situation at our house

529
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,180
is very bad.

530
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,180
Your dad sometimes

531
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,180
makes it hard for me

532
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,180
to stay in the middle.

533
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
When you grow up,

534
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,180
you'll understand.

535
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,180
Dad,

536
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,180
I'm fine with you.

537
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,180
Do you still have a girlfriend?

538
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,180
Not for a long time.

539
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,180
I bought you

540
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,180
the one from Yongjing

541
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,180
and I bought it for you.

542
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
I'm not sure

543
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,180
if you want to change your mind.

544
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,180
You're so excited.

545
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,180
Here's the imported one.

546
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,180
I'll give it to you.

547
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,180
Thanks.

548
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,180
Do you like it?

549
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,180
I do.

550
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,180
Dad,

551
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
if you ask me something wrong,

552
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,180
don't be angry.

553
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,180
Okay.

554
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,180
Did you follow her

555
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,180
on your sister's birthday?

556
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,180
You think it's me?

557
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,180
It's not.

558
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,180
It's just the net.

559
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,180
Right?

560
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,180
When Sister Jingxin's birthday comes,

561
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,180
I'll tell her

562
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,180
that I didn't follow her

563
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,180
on my birthday.

564
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,180
Dad Qi said

565
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,180
if you follow her,

566
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,180
I want to ask

567
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,180
what suspicious people you see

568
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,180
so that we can tell the police.

569
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,180
So that we can

570
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,180
take the murderer back as soon as possible.

571
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,180
Do you have any questions?

572
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,180
No, no, no.

573
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,180
I'll just...

574
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,180
Dad,

575
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,180
what about Aunt Wang?

576
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,180
She said

577
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,180
when you look at her,

578
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,180
your eyes always turn back.

579
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,180
Sometimes, you run away.

580
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,180
I thought she was suspicious.

581
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,180
You know what?

582
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,180
But...

583
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,180
Wait a minute.

584
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,180
Can you tell me

585
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,180
the reason?

586
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,180
Dad,

587
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,180
I didn't run away.

588
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,180
I didn't look back.

589
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,180
She hit me.

590
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,180
Can you tell her to hit me?

591
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,180
Yes.

592
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,180
So,

593
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,180
I told her

594
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,180
she was suspicious.

595
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,180
Don't say that.

596
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,180
I saw her.

597
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,180
I wanted to run away.

598
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,180
Dad,

599
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,180
if you just want to ask this,

600
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,180
you don't have to be so mean.

601
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:29,180
No, I really want to give this to you.

602
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,180
I'm sorry.

603
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,180
Let me wipe it for you.

604
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,180
No, no, no.

605
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,180
Where's your toilet?

606
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,180
The toilet is over here.

607
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,180
I'll give it to you.

608
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,180
You go first.

609
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,180
What is the meaning of your death,

610
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,180
of your life?

611
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:06,180
I didn't kill her.

612
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,180
Don't think too much.

613
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,180
Take it.

614
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,180
Dad is so serious.

615
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,180
I think he got the pants.

616
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,180
I'm not going to ask you again.

617
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,180
This is the last time.

618
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,180
Okay.

619
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,180
Come, eat something.

620
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:38,180
Dad.

621
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,180
Yes.

622
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,180
Do you know why I keep thinking about eating?

623
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,180
I don't know.

624
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,180
You want to go to the amusement park after eating, right?

625
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,180
Dad.

626
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,180
I'm not going to eat.

627
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,180
I'm going to eat.

628
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,180
I'm going to eat.

629
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,180
Dad.

630
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:59,180
I remember when I first came here,

631
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,180
you brought me here.

632
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,180
I brought you here?

633
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,180
I was about the same size as Jingjing's sister.

634
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,180
After you brought me to the amusement park,

635
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,180
we went to the amusement park.

636
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,180
Is it this one?

637
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,180
Yes.

638
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,180
Yes.

639
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,180
Yes.

640
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,180
When you got divorced,

641
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,180
I didn't know what happened.

642
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,180
I thought we could still play basketball together.

643
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,180
You could still take me with you.

644
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,180
I understood later.

645
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:42,180
I also knew how much my sister and dad were with me.

646
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,180
How sad Mrs. Wang was.

647
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:50,180
Although my mom and Mrs. Wang were very upset,

648
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,180
she often cried alone in the middle of the night.

649
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,180
But she still had me.

650
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,180
Who?

651
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,180
Did you accompany your mom?

652
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,180
I tried to learn.

653
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,180
But I didn't know how to play basketball.

654
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,180
I didn't know how to play basketball.

655
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,180
I was so worried.

656
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,180
I thought I was not good enough.

657
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,180
I thought

658
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:37,180
if I had been so understanding,

659
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,180
would you two not have been apart?

660
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,180
You silly kid.

661
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,180
Dad, you didn't do well.

662
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,180
I doubt I was not important.

663
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,180
I often talked to my sister.

664
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,180
It doesn't matter if I die.

665
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,180
At least you won't be so sad.

666
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,180
You have one more bowl.

667
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,180
It's delicious.

668
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,180
It's delicious.

669
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,180
I'm full.

670
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,180
Dad, you have some tea.

671
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,180
Dad, let's go back early.

672
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,180
It's late. My mom is in a hurry.

673
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,180
I'm so worried.

674
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:38,180
Go back.

675
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,180
It's late. My mom is in a hurry.

676
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,180
Let's go.

677
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,180
Thank you, dad.

678
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:09,180
What?

679
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,180
What we're going to talk about tonight

680
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,180
is our secret.

681
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,180
We won't mention it again.

682
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,180
Dad, I'm going back.

683
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,180
Go back after you finish eating.

684
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:38,180
Go back.

685
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:50,180
I'll be a good dad.

686
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,180
I'm going back.

687
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,180
Dad, when will you take me to the swimming pool?

688
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:27,180
Go.

689
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,180
Go.

690
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,180
Mom.

691
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,180
Why are you still awake?

692
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,180
I went to dinner with your dad last night.

693
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,180
Mom, I can't drink anymore.

694
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,180
You can't drink anymore.

695
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,180
Mom.

696
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,180
Dad, what's wrong with your voice?

697
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,180
I suspect I'm not awake.

698
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:43,180
I'm not going to sleep with you anymore.

699
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:48,180
It's okay if I'm awake.

700
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,180
I can't sleep like that.

701
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,180
Dad.

702
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,180
Dad.

703
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,180
Go back.

704
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,180
Did you drink water?

705
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,180
I drank a little.

706
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,180
Is it 30 bottles?

707
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:06,180
50 bottles.

708
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,180
Take a break.

709
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,180
Go.

710
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,180
Take a break.

711
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,180
Come on, drink some water.

712
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,180
Don't catch a cold.

713
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:21,180
No.

714
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,180
Just a few more bottles.

715
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,180
Okay.

716
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,180
You can do it.

717
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,180
You've improved a lot.

718
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,180
You almost catch me.

719
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,180
Wait for another two years.

720
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,180
Drink with dad.

721
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,180
Dad, I can't drink.

722
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,180
You can't drink?

723
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:40,180
Here.

724
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,180
You like swimming so much?

725
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,180
Come here every week, okay?

726
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,180
Okay.

727
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,180
Can you swim in the dance circle?

728
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,180
Yes.

729
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,180
I'll help you move the box up first.

730
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,180
The key is on the table.

731
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,180
I'll help you move the box up first.

732
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,180
I'll help you move the box up first.

733
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,180
Okay.

734
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,180
Can you put it down?

735
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,180
Yes.

736
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,180
Okay.

737
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,180
I have a chance.

738
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,180
We'll go.

739
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,180
Are you going to leave?

740
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,180
No.

741
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,180
Xu Jing.

742
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,180
Be careful on the road.

743
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,180
Be careful on the road.

744
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,180
So,

745
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,180
what do you believe?

746
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,180
What are you talking about?

747
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,180
What did Zhang Dong say?

748
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,180
I believe in the fairy tale.

749
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:20,180
Why?

750
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,180
The fairy tale is beautiful.

751
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:28,180
Close your eyes.

752
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,180
Three,

753
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:36,180
two,

754
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:37,180
one.

755
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,180
Okay.

756
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,180
Go.

757
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:10,180
Go.

758
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,180
Go.

759
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,180
