00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You should tell me your attitude.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Why do they buy so many houses and do so many family business?

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Can they manage it?

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Can you leave me alone?

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm doing this for your sake,

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
not to let you repeat your father's mistake.

13
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Boss,

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
get me a drink of water.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Here.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Here.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Boss,

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
have you seen this kid?

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Have you seen him?

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Look.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's this tall.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's dark and thin.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What's wrong with this kid?

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm just looking for you.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Have you seen him?

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This kid is looking for you.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Sometimes, it's hard to get them.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The kid is not good at managing the house.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In the future,

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
you'll have to eat a lot

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
to get the society.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You should manage it well.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can go to the beach.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Look.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's summer now.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The kids are over there.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What's wrong?

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You're wearing a hat.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hello?

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I've prepared the money.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How can I give it to you?

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The washroom.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Two o'clock in the afternoon.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll go to the beach.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Okay.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Okay.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
See you later.

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Have you seen this kid?

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No.

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He's tall?

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Thank you.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're welcome.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's so dirty.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll go.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Okay.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Look at the kid.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He's a bad boy.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Remember me?

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Go away.

81
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're a bad boy.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
How dare you?

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Get out of here.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll go.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't beat around the bush.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Go.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Go.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Go.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Go.

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Go.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Go.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Go.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Go.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Go.

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Go.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Go.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Go.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Go.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Go.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Go.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Go.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Go.

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What are you doing?

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What are you doing?

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What are you doing?

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't beat around the bush.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Go.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Go.

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What are you doing?

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Go.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What did you say?

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're just a liar.

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're still fighting?

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You want to be like your dad?

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm not saying you're my dad.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What did you say?

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're not allowed to be my dad.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay.

121
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Go to the police station with me.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Go.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Are you a police officer?

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You're dead.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're still fighting with me?

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What's your relationship with me?

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What right do you have to control me?

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What right do you have to control me?

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Can you control me?

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why do you have to soot me?

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Enough.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why don't you answer the ghosts,

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
ok?

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ok.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,060
You're protecting the

136
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,000
items.

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,200
Sister Bei, here you go.

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You're here.

139
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,320
The monthly salary is 10%.

140
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,200
It's 24% per month.

141
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,320
Is there a problem?

142
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,520
No.

143
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,400
What are you taking?

144
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,120
I have a house on the way to the border.

145
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
I brought the house back.

146
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,160
How long do you want to stay?

147
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,760
Three days.

148
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Three days?

149
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,400
We're all from the three months.

150
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,120
I'm just a temporary transfer.

151
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,760
Why do you move?

152
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,680
How about this?

153
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,040
I'll count you as a month.

154
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,960
I'll pay you back first after three days.

155
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,360
I'll pay you back in a month.

156
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,360
I'll pay you back after you're over the period.

157
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay.

158
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
Let's make a toast.

159
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
For Xin Xin.

160
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,080
Thank you for taking my moment.

161
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,640
I'm almost完 up!

162
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,640
For him!

163
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,600
Escaped.

164
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,560
Lied.

165
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,000
I was like that,

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
simple feeling.

167
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,840
But still the быстр Oreo Nietzsche's

168
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,920
dream gold eventually come true now.

169
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,880
I want to stay in the same place as her,

170
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,040
I'm fine now.

171
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,640
I can have another friend.

172
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,640
I wish you a long and healthy life.

173
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,800
Thank you, Brother Chuan.

174
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,200
Do you want to eat?

175
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,520
You want to eat?

176
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,120
I'll give you all.

177
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,440
I'll give you all.

178
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,040
I'll kill you if you don't want to eat.

179
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
You don't need to eat.

180
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
You can eat the smoke.

181
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Oh, yes.

182
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
How much?

183
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
This.

184
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
How much?

185
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
How much?

186
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Brother Chuan, which one?

187
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
Brother Chuan, that one is cold.

188
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Yes, I'll eat it.

189
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
I'll eat it.

190
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
I'll eat it.

191
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
I'll eat it.

192
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Chen Kaiji.

193
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Yes, boss.

194
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Don't you need to work tomorrow morning?

195
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Yes.

196
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Have a rest.

197
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Have you eaten?

198
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
Yes, boss.

199
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
Yue.

200
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Yes.

201
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Your wife doesn't want you to go home?

202
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
Yes.

203
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
It's so late.

204
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
She's going to make soup today.

205
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
It's so late.

206
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,040
I still have two more hours to go.

207
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
That's enough.

208
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Brother Chuan.

209
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
What are you going to do tomorrow?

210
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
I'm going back to drink soup.

211
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Which one?

212
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,040
I'll go back to drink soup.

213
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,040
You go ahead.

214
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Let's go.

215
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
Let's go.

216
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Let's go home.

217
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Go back first.

218
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,040
I have something to do.

219
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
What else do you have?

220
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
I'll accompany you.

221
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
No need.

222
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
I'll sleep here tonight.

223
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
I'll sleep here, too.

224
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
Can you let me pass on my breath?

225
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Only your son can make you pass on your breath now.

226
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
That's his purpose.

227
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
You don't believe me.

228
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
You don't believe me.

229
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
You don't believe me.

230
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
What do you believe?

231
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
What you said

232
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
is that Zhu Chaoyang killed Jin Jing.

233
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
I don't care.

234
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
I'll let anyone know

235
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
who killed my daughter.

236
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
You're a thief!

237
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Hello.

238
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,040

242
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040

246
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,040
The old man is here.

247
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
He's here.

248
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,040
He's here.

249
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040

250
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040

251
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,040

Please take your seat.

254
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
Yu Hao,

255
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
the kid just bought a ticket.

256
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
What?

257
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,040
I bought a ticket and he's the same.

258
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,040
The ticket is canceled.

259
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Did you buy the ticket?

260
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
Did you come to the store?

261
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
I'll see Xixin soon.

262
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Let's go back first.

263
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Something's wrong with my ticket.

264
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Hello,

265
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
please send my voice message.

266
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,800
I'll write down if I am not touching you.

267
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:59,100
Don't be

268
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,680
whatever i am.

269
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Come, drink some water.

270
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,680
Slow down.

271
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,280
Why are you so angry?

272
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,280
I can't be angry with you.

273
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,880
After a few days of retirement,

274
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,280
I have some new feelings.

275
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,680
What's your feeling?

276
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,480
Tell me.

277
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,680
Don't you think we are bored with our retirement life?

278
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,280
No.

279
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,680
I take care of Lele every day.

280
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,880
I'm busy with shopping and cooking.

281
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,680
But what if Lele is taken to school by her parents?

282
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,680
What if she goes to school?

283
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
You are focusing on dancing in the square?

284
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,480
You are training your body and taking care of your parents.

285
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,280
Come with me.

286
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,880
Okay, I'll dance with you.

287
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,680
I'll learn. Okay?

288
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,480
Come.

289
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,080
I'll tell you.

290
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,280
Other than dancing in the square,

291
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:26,080
can we do something more youthful and lively?

292
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,280
What do you want?

293
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
Wait a minute.

294
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,280
I want to ask you to be a strict guardian.

295
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,880
He's leaving now.

296
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,280
Come.

297
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,080
deteriorate my drinking vulnerable drink.

298
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,780
Okay.

299
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,780
How did you get it?

300
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,360
Your sister got it from the bank.

301
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,700
The water production market's mountains are still here to collect your photos?

302
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,860
How dare she? She knows that I'm your brother-in-law.

303
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,860
She hasn't been here before.

304
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:49,660
Where's Qingqing? Did she sleep?

305
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,780
Alright.

306
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,220
What are you gonna do with the evidence?

307
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,900
Your brother-in-law doesn't believe that I did this.

308
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,260
It's just that I have doubts.

309
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,840
It doesn't show any proof.

310
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,980
How long has it been?

311
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,380
One minute and a half.

312
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,620
I'll tell you.

313
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,980
You've been practicing for a minute and a half.

314
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,380
Then we can go to Henghua and Shujiang.

315
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,380
I'll help you.

316
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,380
What help?

317
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,380
Water.

318
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,380
Okay, I'll buy you some water.

319
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,380
You continue practicing.

320
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,380
Okay.

321
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,180
Don't be afraid.

322
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:41,980
I'll help you.

323
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,180
I'll help you.

324
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,980
Okay.

325
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,980
I'll help you.

326
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,780
I'll help you.

327
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
I'll help you.

328
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
I'll help you.

329
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,780
Okay.

330
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,780
I'll help you.

331
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,780
I'll help you.

332
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,780
I'll help you.

333
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,780
I'll help you.

334
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,380
Don't steal it.

335
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
Really?

336
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,780
Zhu Shaoyang.

337
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,780
Zhu Shaoyang?

338
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,180
Zhu Yunjun, did you kill him?

339
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,180
Dad.

340
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,780
Did you kill him?

341
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,780
Dad.

342
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,780
What are you doing?

343
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
Dad.

344
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,780
Dad.

345
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,780
Dad.

346
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,780
Are you sick?

347
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,780
Dad.

348
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,780
Are you sick?

349
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,780
Are you crazy?

350
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,780
Get up.

351
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,780
Are you okay?

352
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,780
Are you having fun?

353
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,780
I'll tell you the truth.

354
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,780
Are you okay?

355
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,780
Are you okay?

356
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,780
Do you want to go in with me?

357
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,780
No, dad.

358
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,780
Do you have money?

359
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,780
Yes.

360
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,780
Okay.

361
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,780
Go home early.

362
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,780
Go.

363
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,780
Dad.

364
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,780
What's wrong?

365
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,780
What's wrong?

366
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,780
You're still in a bad mood today.

367
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,780
You're not a romantic person, right?

368
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,780
Zhu Shaoyang.

369
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,780
If you have a dad, don't be afraid of anything.

370
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,780
Go home early.

371
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,780
Zhu Shaoyang.

372
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,780
What's wrong?

373
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,780
Nothing.

374
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,780
Don't worry.

375
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,780
I've seen it.

376
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,780
Dad.

377
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,780
Dad.

378
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,780
Dad.

379
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,780
Uncle.

380
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,780
I want to go to the second floor.

381
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,780
Stop!

382
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,780
Someone stole the book!

383
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,780
What's wrong?

384
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,780
Someone stole the book!

385
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,780
You went there?

386
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,780
Dad.

387
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,780
Where's that kid?

388
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,780
I can't find him.

389
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,780
Have you seen that girl before?

390
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,780
No.

391
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,780
Go back.

392
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,780
Have you made up your mind?

393
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,780
What?

394
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,780
Why?

395
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,780
It's over.

396
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,780
Hello.

397
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,780
Do you think this book is yours?

398
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,780
Thank you.

399
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,780
It's so dirty.

400
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,780
I'll wipe it off.

401
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,780
It's okay.

402
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,780
We can handle it ourselves.

403
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,780
Thank you.

404
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,780
Okay.

405
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,780
Mr. Zhang.

406
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,780
Mr. Zhang.

407
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,780
What a coincidence.

408
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,780
Hello.

409
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,780
Hello.

410
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Are you here to buy books?

411
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,780
Yes.

412
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,780
Mr. Tang asked me to come here.

413
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,780
To practice.

414
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,780
By the way,

415
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,780
did you finish the book I left you?

416
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,780
Mr. Zhang.

417
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
About last time,

418
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,780
I went home to discuss with my mother.

419
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,780
She said that

420
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,780
there are few days left for the summer vacation.

421
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
She wants to have more rest.

422
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,780
So...

423
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,780
Yes.

424
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
I should work hard.

425
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,780
I don't have much time with the kids.

426
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,780
You don't have to teach her.

427
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,780
I'm sorry.

428
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,780
It's okay.

429
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,780
Ye Shimin is a good student.

430
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,780
She's fine.

431
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,780
Mr. Zhang.

432
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,780
I won't disturb you.

433
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,780
Let's go upstairs.

434
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,780
Mr. Zhang, bye.

435
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,780
Bye.

436
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,780
Ye Shimin.

437
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,780
Stop.

438
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,780
I'll help you choose a few books.

439
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,780
It's too basic.

440
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,780
Okay.

441
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,780
Thank you.

442
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780

00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,780
Who has been in the factory for days?

446
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,780
You've been abandoned by your sister.

447
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,780
I apologize to your mother.

448
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,280

00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,320
has absconded me now.

00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,660
Look.

I won't eat it.

458
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,060
I need to go to the clinic later.

459
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,060
I'll just fill a bowl today.

460
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,440
Aren't you excited, so just eat when I'm here.

461

Let's go.

488
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,480
It's safer than here.

489
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,280
No problem.

00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,580
I'll bring money tomorrow.
