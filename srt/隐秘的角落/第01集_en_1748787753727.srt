Episode 1

3
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,620
Hey, can you take care of others slowly?

4
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,620
I can't walk anymore.

5
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:34,620
You said you want to climb mountains.

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,620
It's high and tiring.

7
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,620
Then what should we do? Let's go down.

8
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,620
Dad, mom, we're here.

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,620
Let's stay here for a bit longer.

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,620
Here.

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,620
Here, mom.

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,620
I'll look at this.

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,620
It's so high. Be careful.

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,620
Here.

15
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,620
Dad, lean closer to mom.

16
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,620
Mom, lean closer to her.

17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,620
Don't move.

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,620
Let me try.

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,620
Try this way.

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,620
What's wrong?

21
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,620
Hurry up.

22
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,620
Let me help you.

23
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,620
Put this here.

24
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,620
Mom, let me hold your feet.

25
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,620
This is for Xia Er.

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,620
It's done.

27
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,620
It's done.

28
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,620
Dad!

29
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,620
Dad!

30
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,620
Dad!

31
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,620
Dad!

32
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,620
Dad!

33
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,620
Dad!

34
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,620
Dad!

35
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,620
What are you doing?

36
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,620
I'm playing basketball.

37
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,620
What?

38
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,620
Give me back my ball.

39
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,620
Don't take it for yourself.

40
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,620
Get up.

41
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,620
Keep playing.

42
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,620
Get up.

43
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,620
Get up.

44
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,620
Get up.

45
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,620
Get up.

46
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,620
Don't go.

47
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,620
Keep playing.

48
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,620
You're so angry next time.

49
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,620
You think I can't get up?

50
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,620
She's here. Don't say anything.

51
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,620
What are you doing?

52
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,620
Sorry, there's a blind date in the school.

53
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,620
Forget it. Let's go.

54
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,620
Let's go.

55
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,620
Let's go.

56
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,620
Give me 200 yuan for the school.

57
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,620
200?

58
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,620
Okay.

59
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,620
How do I open this?

60
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,620
This way.

61
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,620
Thanks.

62
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,620
Thanks.

63
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,620
Here.

64
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,620
Here.

65
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,620
Thanks.

66
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,620
What are you doing?

67
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,620
Don't touch me.

68
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,620
Don't touch me.

69
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,620
Don't touch me.

70
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,620
Don't touch me.

71
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,620
How is it?

72
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,620
It's still hot.

73
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,620
It's still hot.

74
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,620
Is it easy to eat?

75
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,620
Is it almost there?

76
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,620
Almost there.

77
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,620
It's hot.

78
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,620
It's hot.

79
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,620
Who is it?

80
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,620
Is it Uncle Zhang Jinlin?

81
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,620
It's me.

82
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,620
Uncle Zhang, I'm Yan Liang.

83
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Do you remember me?

84
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,620
Yan Wenbin is my father.

85
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,620
Yes.

86
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,620
What's the matter?

87
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,620
Do you have time now?

88
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,620
I want to talk to you.

89
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,620
Master,

90
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,620
I want to say that you went to the hospital to take a film.

91
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,620
I'm sorry.

92
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,620
I'm sorry.

93
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,620
I'm sorry.

94
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,620
I'm sorry.

95
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,620
I'm sorry.

96
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,620
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,620
I'm sorry.

98
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,620
I'm sorry.

99
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,780
I want to talk to your family.

100
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,420
kanan

101
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,620
is a big accident.

102
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,620
The brother he wants a girl.

103
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,620
Is she pregnant?

104
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:11,620
She isn't pregnant.

105
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,820
We need more work for the period of prenatal home

106
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,540
She is Lobby egg

107
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,620
and child care.

108
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,620
She doesn't have ocell pumpkins.

109
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,620
I didn't go to the hospital with a baby.

110
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,620
Does the family like him?

111
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,900
I just wanna talk I like you

112
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,500
Who's Shenzhen

113
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,580
My master

114
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,580
In the morning he called to say

115
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,220
Yan Liang's kid

116
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:41,980
He ran from the culinary bureau

117
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,140
Wanted us to go looking for him

118
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,100
In Gouhan內

119
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,620
We met before

120
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,460
You know

121
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,620
He was in the market before, right?

122
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,020
This is his son.

123
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,620
Leave this to me.

124
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,220
I'll go find this boy.

125
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,420
Wait for me here.

126
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,620
What's wrong?

127
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,620
Uncle Zhang.

128
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,620
Yan Liang.

129
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,620
Sit down.

130
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,620
Come on.

131
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,220
What are you ordering?

132
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,820
Don't bother, Uncle Zhang. I've already eaten.

133
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,420
Well...

134
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,420
Look.

135
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
Zizong Abin.

136
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,420
He's your father.

137
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,220
After he died,

138
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,220
I think...

139
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,020
I've never seen him before.

140
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,820
He's my father.

141
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,620
He's no other person.

142
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,820
After he's been caught,

143
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,220
I'll send him to the welfare hospital.

144
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,420
I'll never see him again.

145
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,020
Good for you.

146
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,420
You're doing well.

147
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,820
How's your welfare?

148
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,220
Are you going to leave now?

149
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,220
Uncle Zhang.

150
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,820
To be honest with you,

151
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,420
I came here to see my father.

152
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,620
I've been wanting to see my father.

153
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,620
I wanted to borrow some money from you.

154
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,220
My father said that

155
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,620
he'd come to you when he's busy.

156
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,420
You'll help him.

157
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,420
No problem.

158
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,420
Here.

159
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,020
What's that?

160
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,420
Take it.

161
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,420
Uncle Zhang, you misunderstood.

162
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,420
I have a friend in the welfare hospital.

163
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,820
He has something to do at home.

164
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,220
He needs to use a lot of money.

165
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,220
I want to see

166
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,820
if he can help me.

167
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,820
Then...

168
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,220
How much is your ring?

169
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
300,000.

170
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,620
Don't worry, Uncle Zhang.

171
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,020
I'll pay you back.

172
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,620
Maybe...

173
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,220
It'll take a while.

174
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,420
I can take the money.

175
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,620
I know.

176
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,820
Look.

177
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,020
This...

178
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,620
I'm your father.

179
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,620
This relationship is so good.

180
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,620
You're in trouble now.

181
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,220
I should help you, right?

182
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,020
But...

183
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,620
But the business is bad.

184
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,620
You said that

185
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,620
you can't take the 300,000.

186
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,420
Right?

187
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,420
Uncle Zhang.

188
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,220
How much can you borrow?

189
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,620
I'll pay you back.

190
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,620
I'll try my best.

191
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,220
Thank you, Uncle Zhang.

192
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,220
Well...

193
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,220
Uncle Zhang.

194
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,220
Do you know where my father is?

195
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,220
I'm not sure.

196
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,620
How about this?

197
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,020
I'll ask you.

198
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,020
Thank you, Uncle Zhang.

199
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,220
How about you sit down?

200
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,020
I'll go buy some cigarettes.

201
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,220
You eat first.

202
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,820
How about I borrow some?

203
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,420
No, no.

204
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,220
Thank you, Uncle Zhang.

205
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,020
Wait for me.

206
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,220
Okay.

207
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,220
How about it, Uncle Zhang?

208
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,620
He promised to help me.

209
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
He's not going to help me.

210
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,620
Where are you going?

211
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:28,820
Let's go.

212
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,620
He's here.

213
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,420
He...

214
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:32,820
He...

215
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,820
He ran out of the lake.

216
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,220
I'm so happy.

217
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,420
My cousin

218
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,620
the one with the picture.

219
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:51,620
I will thank you

220
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,620
for the chance to marry him.

221
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,820
I will come back to see you.

222
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,220
Your wedding ducks of calls,

223
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,320
to say here is my sister.

224
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:13,920
Bye-bye.

225
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,940
the internal relationship.

226
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,580
I hope that this class

227
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,300
will let everyone be a little bit interested in math.

228
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,660
What do you say that we'll eat in the afternoon?

229
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,780
Let me tell you.

230
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,820
Let's eat hot pot.

231
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,580
We'll have a meal together.

232
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,380
Okay.

233
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,140
Teacher Huang.

234
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,300
This is the evaluation of the table tennis class.

235
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,260
Okay.

236
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,580
Dongsheng.

237
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,860
Everyone is going to the lunch break.

238
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,660
Celebrate the holidays.

239
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,620
You should go with me.

240
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,940
I won't go.

241
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,100
I'm at home alone.

242
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,260
It's hard to rest.

243
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,220
Okay.

244
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,620
You're a good man like Brother Zhang.

245
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,180
You're getting less and less now.

246
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,460
You should learn from him.

247
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,860
Next time.

248
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,260
I'll invite you next time.

249
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,580
Okay.

250
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,860
Let's go then.

251
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,060
I'm hungry.

252
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,580
Let's go.

253
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,100
Let's go.

254
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:04,740
Let's go.

255
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,500
Let's go.

256
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
Don't do that.

257
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,940
Let's not go out that night.

258
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,500
I'm so sad.

259
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,940
I'm sorry.

260
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,940
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,940
Don't think about it.

262
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,940
You can't talk.

263
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,940
I'll go back and talk.

264
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,940
Don't bother me.

265
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,460
I can't talk.

266
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,980
I can't talk.

267
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,380
Mom and dad are here.

268
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,060
I'll go out and smoke.

269
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,500
I just bought the food.

270
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,180
I'll eat at home in the afternoon.

271
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,060
No.

272
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,980
We'll leave in a while.

273
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,460
Where did you buy the eggs?

274
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,580
It's the eggs from

275
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,860
the cousin's house in Man Yue.

276
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,860
Where's the girl?

277
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,220
You have something to do, right?

278
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,020
Let's go.

279
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,060
Don't be so grumpy.

280
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,780
Let's go.

281
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,460
Let's eat and then go.

282
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,180
No.

283
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,940
Take care.

284
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,420
The cousin's house is in Man Yue.

285
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,860
Don't forget it.

286
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,100
Go there early.

287
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,460
I got it.

288
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,260
Come.

289
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,260
Let's go.

290
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,780
I bought chicken and sardine.

291
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,780
I'll make soup for lunch.

292
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,620
No.

293
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,020
I'll go swim.

294
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,420
Didn't you borrow it?

295
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,580
Why did you draw it again?

296
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,220
Have you thought about it?

297
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,500
Is this what your parents do?

298
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,020
Hurry up.

299
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,380
I don't want to drag it anymore.

300
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,780
I'll go.

301
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,700
What's your parents' opinion?

302
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,780
Do they agree?

303
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,380
I said

304
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,580
this is our business

305
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,340
and it has nothing to do with them.

306
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,580
How can it be?

307
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,220
We need to think about

308
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,460
how parents feel.

309
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,460
They'll be happy.

310
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,300
What did reefs do?

311
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,100
I want to shake my head

312
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,500
and swim if I semolina.

313
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,800
Don't freeze up.

314
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,220
Today,

315
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,100
we have some examinations

316
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,100
to pull out the scissors

317
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,140
not blood blood Oh

318
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,860
and we can't guarantee 100%

319
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,820
the final score.

320
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,220
So, please,

321
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,260
from now on,

322
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,100
you have to work hard

323
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,220
to prepare for the second round.

324
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,460
Now, let's start the final round.

325
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,500
The first one we've chosen

326
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,460
is Zhu Chuyang again.

327
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,700
Not only that,

328
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,660
he's also the first one

329
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,940
in our grade.

330
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,220
He's honored

331
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:32,460
for us.

332
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
Please applaud him.

333
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,340
The second one we've chosen

334
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,540
is Ye Chi Min.

335
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,620
The gap between the first one

336
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,380
is getting smaller and smaller.

337
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,020
Keep going.

338
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,500
If you have any questions,

339
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,820
you can ask me at any time.

340
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,140
Please, everyone,

341
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,100
try your best

342
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,340
to cooperate with the teacher

343
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:56,980
and make the kids

344
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,500
better grades.

345
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,620
Then, today,

346
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
you can go back

347
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,460
to your classmate.

348
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,100
Okay.

349
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,460
Bye.

350
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,620
Hi, mom.

351
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,700
Hi.

352
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,620
Let's continue.

353
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,100
Okay.

354
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,780
How long has it been?

355
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:16,940
This way.

356
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,460
Hi.

357
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,180
The first grade is in the red.

358
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,380
It's straight.

359
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,180
I'm not worried

360
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,900
about the grades of the kids.

361
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,300
But the current quality education

362
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,740
is fully developed.

363
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,540
Is he a teacher?

364
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,740
No.

365
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,820
He's smart.

366
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,540
He's also very confident.

367
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,420
But I noticed that

368
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,180
he's a little introverted.

369
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,060
He rarely comes to school

370
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,780
with other classmates.

371
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,860
Teacher Wang, what do you mean?

372
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,660
Chaoyang is a kid.

373
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,740
He's not good at football.

374
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,540
Other classmates

375
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,060
don't like to play with him.

376
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,060
He's a school kid.

377
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,300
He's a group after all.

378
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,700
Teacher Wang.

379
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,020
Students should learn from you.

380
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,140
To make friends

381
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,260
is to enter the society.

382
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,500
Actually, I'm really afraid that

383
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,020
Chaoyang will play with some bad kids

384
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,420
and make me learn.

385
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,460
Chaoyang's mom,

386
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:13,980
I'm looking for you.

387
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,420
It doesn't mean anything else.

388
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,900
It's just that

389
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,020
there are some differences between the classmates.

390
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,340
Other classmates envy Chaoyang.

391
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,940
In fact, he should study hard like him.

392
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,420
Instead of giving teacher a small report,

393
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,060
the students who are bad at school

394
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,100
are also in trouble.

395
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,100
Teacher Wang,

396
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,980
should you also

397
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,460
find their parents to talk about it?

398
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,500
Chaoyang's mom, I'm saying this

399
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,660
for Chaoyang's good.

400
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,380
I know you're doing this for her.

401
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,100
Teacher Wang.

402
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,980
I'm really sorry.

403
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,180
I'm too busy with the unit.

404
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,380
I know.

405
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,180
It's okay.

406
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,100
I know you're busy with your work.

407
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,980
It's okay.

408
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,740
Please forgive me.

409
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,860
Thank you.

410
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,700
Chaoyang's mom,

411
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,740
Chaoyang is so good.

412
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,940
She's always the best.

413
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,900
I'm going to ask her

414
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,180
how to educate her.

415
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,580
I'm usually very busy.

416
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,980
I often live in the unit dormitory.

417
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,140
I don't care about her.

418
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,500
The child is independent.

419
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,060
I don't need to educate her.

420
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,380
I know it myself.

421
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,180
You see, she doesn't let me

422
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,100
give her a report and take her class.

423
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,980
Students should learn from her

424
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,100
and not care about others.

425
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,780
Right, Teacher Wang?

426
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,580
Yes.

427
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,420
Right.

428
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,300
Xiaobin, what's wrong with you?

429
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,020
Did Chaoyang

430
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,980
clean the toilet?

431
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,660
Didn't you make a mess?

432
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,460
I didn't.

433
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,700
You said you didn't.

434
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,540
I saw it with my own eyes.

435
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,420
You...

436
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,300
What are you doing?

437
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,140
Isn't the toilet good?

438
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,500
I'm satisfied.

439
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,580
I'm not satisfied.

440
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,700
Xiaobin.

441
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,620
Chao.

442
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,580
I'm sorry.

443
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,500
Xiaobin is just tempered.

444
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,740
It's okay, Uncle.

445
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,460
She didn't mean it.

446
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,500
Good boy.

447
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,020
Xiaobin.

448
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Mom.

449
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,180
I have to go back to the police station.

450
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,780
I have a night shift in the future.

451
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,460
There's a new bag of steamed dumplings in the fridge.

452
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,420
Remember to eat it yourself.

453
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,900
I also bought you a chicken.

454
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,740
50 yuan for you.

455
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,420
You must drink milk in the morning.

456
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,460
Don't buy those fried food.

457
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,060
You're not well.

458
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,260
Remember to take a nap.

459
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,260
Got it?

460
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,700
Okay.

461
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,180
Mom will be back in the day.

462
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,860
I'll make you a meal.

463
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,980
Mom.

464
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,460
What did I tell you?

465
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,580
Nothing.

466
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,380
Don't talk about others.

467
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,180
Just study.

468
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,780
It's not important.

469
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,140
I'm not a good girl.

470
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,940
I'm just a good girl.

471
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,700
I'm not a good girl.

472
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,300
I'm just a good girl.

473
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,020
I'm not a good girl.

474
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,860
I'm just a good girl.

475
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,580
I'm not a good girl.

476
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,340
I'm just a good girl.

477
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,140
I'm just a good girl.

478
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,820
I'm just a good girl.

479
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,580
I'm just a good girl.

480
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,180
I'm just a good girl.

481
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,780
I'm just a good girl.

482
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,300
I'm just a good girl.

483
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,740
I'm just a good girl.

484
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,660
I'm just a good girl.

485
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,660
I'm just a good girl.

486
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,940
很久以前了 But you defined

487
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,180
you didn't need to look at the shape.

488
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,020
If you had a little chance,

489
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,300
here would be an easy task.

490
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,100
Okay.

491
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,360
Cool down.

492
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,180
But he never told me he wanted

493
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,260
Four sisters from alternate breeding or veterans from the army.

494
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,020
Zhu Chaoyang

495
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Long time no see

496
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,820
Do you still remember me?

497
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,780
Yanliu

498
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,060
Pu Pu

499
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,980
This is Zhu Chaoyang

500
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,420
My son-in-law's friend

501
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,100
Brother Chao Chang

502
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,140
My name is Pu Pu

503
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,620
Hello

504
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,020
How do I know you?

505
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,340
Please come in

506
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:45,820
Understand?

507
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,260
What?

508
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,300
I didn't know you

509
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,860
Hold Du Shenggui's hand

510
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,900
安全

511
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,260
Say it.

512
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,260
Why didn't you wear a uniform today?

513
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,260
It's weekend.

514
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,260
Okay, okay.

515
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,260
Come, come.

516
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
Have a drink. It's weekend.

517
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,260
Drive.

518
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,260
Yes, I don't drive when I drink.

519
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,260
I'm driving.

520
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,260
What have you been doing lately?

521
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,260
You're trying to trick me?

522
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,260
I'm now...

523
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,260
a law-abiding person.

524
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
You're here.

525
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
Is this Ben's house?

526
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,260
He came to see me yesterday.

527
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,260
I'm sitting there.

528
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,260
I bought two oil strips for him.

529
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,260
He came to borrow money from me.

530
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,260
What did he say?

531
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,260
He said...

532
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,260
he was helping a friend.

533
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,260
You just call the police to arrest him.

534
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
But he ran out of the welfare hospital.

535
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,260
Of course he should call the police.

536
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,260
The salary is quite high.

537
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
Thank you.

538
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,260
Thank you.

539
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,260
Have you eaten?

540
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,260
Wait for me.

541
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,260
Brother Yan Lang.

542
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,260
I want to call Xixian.

543
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,260
Xixian.

544
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,260
Can I borrow your phone?

545
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,260
Sure.

546
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,260
Thank you.

547
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,260
Hello.

548
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,260
Aunt Liu.

549
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,260
I'm Yue Bo.

550
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,260
Can I borrow your phone?

551
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,260
Yan Lang.

552
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,260
Eat.

553
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,260
If you see him again,

554
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,260
call me.

555
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,260
I have a phone.

556
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,260
I have.

557
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,260
I'll call you tomorrow.

558
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,260
I'm at home.

559
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,260
Who are you?

560
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,260
When A Bin was in the civil service,

561
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,260
he was so angry.

562
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
It was a big deal.

563
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,260
The law is so clear.

564
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,260
How did you come here?

565
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,260
I was a little bit sad.

566
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,260
I left the sweat on the floor.

567
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
I was at home in the morning.

568
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,260
I was busy.

569
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,260
I was caught by the police.

570
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,260
Did the welfare hospital

571
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,260
go to you?

572
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,260
The one who hid the East and West is

573
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,260
the one who is in trouble.

574
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,260
Zhang Yang.

575
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,260
If aunt doesn't come back today,

576
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,260
can we stay here?

577
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,260
It's okay.

578
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,260
If it's not convenient,

579
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,260
let me stay here for a night.

580
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,260
But I'm afraid my mom...

581
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
Don't be like that.

582
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
I'm brother Chang'an.

583
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,260
Anyway, I have nothing to do.

584
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,260
Let's go.

585
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,260
Ye Liao.

586
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,260
Don't go.

587
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
My mom will come back soon.

588
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Thank you, Chaoyang.

589
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,260
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

590
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,260
Thank you, brother Chang'an.

591
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,260
Hurry up.

592
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
The center of the event

593
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,260
starts at 9 o'clock.

594
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,260
I'm going to the center.

595
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,260
I'm going to the center.

596
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,260
I'm going to the center.

597
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,260
The center of the event starts at 9 o'clock.

598
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
Why don't you eat?

599
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,260
You started to cry from yesterday.

600
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,260
What's wrong with you?

601
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,260
Yan Liang came back from the welfare training.

602
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,260
Who?

603
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,260
Yan Liang.

604
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,260
Yan Mingbin's son.

605
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
I know.

606
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,260
That kid is pitiful.

607
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,260
Why did he run away?

608
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,260
I don't know.

609
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,260
The welfare training is coming.

610
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,260
Let me check it for you.

611
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,260
Did he run to Ningzhou?

612
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,260
You're going to retire soon.

613
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,260
Don't torture him too much.

614
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,260
What do you mean?

615
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,260
I haven't retired yet.

616
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,260
Wen Tian.

617
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,260
I won't go to the activity center later.

618
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,260
I'll go to the kid.

619
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,260
What are you torturing him for?

620
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,260
I've bought you all the food.

621
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,260
He said

622
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,260
you have to adapt to the old age.

623
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,260
Otherwise, you'll get sick.

624
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,260
When Yan Wenbin came back,

625
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,260
he reported to my family

626
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,260
that I didn't take care of him.

627
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,260
That's why I made a mistake.

628
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,260
That's why the kid was so greedy.

629
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,260
You're a little girl.

630
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,260
How can you let the whole world

631
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,260
have seven children?

632
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,260
You should retire safely.

633
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,260
It's okay.

634
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
Dance with me.

635
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,260
Let's see how good you are.

636
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,260
Don't be a little girl.

637
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,260
I'm going to retire.

638
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,260
I won't dance with you.

639
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,260
I'm sorry.

640
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,260
I'm sorry.

641
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,260
I'm sorry.

642
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,260
I'm sorry.

643
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,260
8 blah, blah.

644
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,260
Call me to drink.

645
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,260
I don't drink anymore,

646
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:17,260
so I think it's just to make you a baby.

647
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,260
Mum...

648
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,260
Let's go.

649
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,260
I'm going to稀 cake with snacks first.

650
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,260
You can have arm,

651
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,260
Mom, why are you back?

652
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,260
I'll be back after you change your work with Auntie Li.

653
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,260
Let's go.

654
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,260
What did you buy?

655
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,260
There are many home-made dishes in this bread.

656
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260
I don't want to buy them.

657
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,260
Let's go.

658
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,260
Let's go and make something delicious for you.

659
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,260
I'll go and make something delicious for you.

660
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,260
You're going out?

661
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,260
You're cleaning my room?

662
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,260
Alright, go to study.

663
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
I'll cook some wontons for you, okay?

664
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
Sure.

665
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:27,840
Fine.

666
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,460
Take some milk first.

667
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,220
Okay.

668
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,500
I'm sorry.

669
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
I'm sorry.

670
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,300
It's alright.

671
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,180
OK.

672
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,760
I'm an expert yet I can run.

673
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,980
But you can do it, not forget.

674
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,060
I think...

675
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,940
pottery might be the wrong town to use then.

676
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,080
I need you to take care of it urgently.

677
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,940
I'm going to talk with the chef.

678
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,340
Hello?

679
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,960
Hello?

680
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,220
Mom, I'm looking for you.

681
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,220
Hello.

682
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,220
I just arrived home.

683
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,220
I understand that he has something to do next week.

684
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,220
What's that little thing?

685
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,220
No one told me.

686
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,220
Can I not go?

687
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,220
I've been coming back and forth.

688
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,220
You're not aware of the cost of the flight.

689
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,220
I'll think about it.

690
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,220
Mom, what's wrong?

691
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,220
I have to go back to the scene.

692
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,220
It's okay, mom. You go ahead.

693
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,220
I can cook by myself.

694
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:22,220
Mom, my dad asked me to go to his place last night.

695
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,220
Go ahead.

696
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,220
Come back early.

697
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,220
Bring your flight ticket.

698
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,220
Okay.

699
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,220
Mom, I'm going to the airport.

700
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,220
I'll be there in a minute.

701
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,220
Okay.

702
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,220
I'll be there in a minute.

703
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,220
Okay.

704
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,220
I'll be there in a minute.

705
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,220
Okay.

706
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,220
I'll be there in a minute.

707
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,220
Okay.

708
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,220
I'll be there in a minute.

709
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,220
Okay.

710
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,220
I'll be there in a minute.

711
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,220
Okay.

712
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,220
I'll be there in a minute.

713
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,220
Okay.

714
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,220
Okay.

715
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,220
Okay.

716
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,220
Okay.

717
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,220
Okay.

718
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,220
Okay.

719
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,220
Okay.

720
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
Okay.

721
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,220
Where did you go?

722
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:50,220
We just need to charge.

723
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,220
I said you're not here.

724
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,220
We can't stay at your place.

725
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,220
We won't cause you any trouble.

726
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,220
Come in.

727
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,220
Sit.

728
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,220
Drink some milk.

729
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,220
Here.

730
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,220
Thank you.

731
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,220
I'll go wash my face.

732
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,220
Chaoyang,

733
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,220
do you have a camera at home?

734
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,220
No.

735
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,220
Why do you need a camera?

736
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,220
I want to take some photos.

737
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,220
It's okay.

738
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,220
Forget it.

739
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,220
I'll take a photo.

740
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,220
Okay.

741
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,220
Hello.

742
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,220

00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,220

00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,220

746
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,220

00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,340
I'm not that good at this, you know?

769
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,340
I'll tell you, the first row is a bit like a water fountain

770
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,340
It's a rich house, and it's placed in the south

771
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,340
This is my place, it's for the south

772
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,340
It's a water fountain, and it's a garden

773
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:23,340
It's so simple

774
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:25,340
Mr. Zhu, you're not a talent, right?

775
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:27,340
You're a housewife, right?

776
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,340
My daughter told me that she's a good cook

777
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,340
She's a cook, and she's a cook

778
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,340
She's the best cook

779
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,340
Really?

780
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,340
How come I don't know?

781
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,340
You're not a parent

782
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,340
You're not a classmate's father and your daughter

783
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,340
I'm not interested in her being a student

784
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,340
Because she's the best every time

785
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,340
You're so mean

786
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,340
Dad, congratulations

787
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,340
Come here, come here

788
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,340
I have a big task for you

789
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,340
Come, help me open the door

790
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,340
I don't know

791
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,340
You don't have to

792
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,340
Open it, open it

793
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,340
You said 9 o'clock

794
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,340
Hurry, hurry, hurry

795
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,340
Open it, open it

796
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,340
I'm in the high school

797
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,340
What?

798
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,340
Don't bite

799
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,340
I forgot, what can I do?

800
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,340
Come, come, come

801
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,340
Open the door

802
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,340
You can open it

803
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,340
Chaoyang, my brother and I just came to your dad's face

804
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,340
He praised you, so you're the first

805
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,340
Thank you, uncle

806
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,340
Don't be the first

807
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,340
Have you brought the grades?

808
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:32,340
I've done it

809
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,340
Look, look, look, this is very troublesome

810
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,340
Let me see

811
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:38,340
Which one is yours?

812
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,340
This one

813
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,340
I'll see, Chaoyang

814
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,340
Yuwen, I'll see

815
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,340
Yuwen is 95 points, the math is 100 points

816
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:48,340
95 points, 97 points, 96 points, total is 483 points

817
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,340
Class rank, first place

818
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,340
The first place in the year is also the first place

819
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,340
What are you doing?

820
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,340
You've made these uncles and aunties

821
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,340
They don't have any space

822
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,340
Next, next

823
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,340
Awesome, awesome

824
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,340
Liu, come

825
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,340
Come

826
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,340
Where's the face?

827
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,340
Take it

828
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,340
Dad, I don't need it so much

829
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,340
Slow down, take it

830
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,340
Your dad doesn't need to give you money

831
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,340
That's right

832
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,340
But my mom doesn't let me take it

833
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,340
Look, this mom's family name is good

834
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,340
No way

835
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,340
To be honest, look

836
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,340
Your son's clothes are almost white

837
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,340
And, he's old

838
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,340
You don't even go out to shop

839
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,340
You bought new shoes

840
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,340
I want you to say

841
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,340
Why did I ask him to come today?

842
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,340
I'm going to bring him to shopping

843
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,340
You know what?

844
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,340
Go

845
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,340
Go buy shoes

846
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,340
Dad, I'm so tired

847
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,340
What are you doing? I'll talk to uncle later

848
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,340
See you later

849
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,340
Bye

850
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,340
Bye

851
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,340
Bye

852
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,340
You're so beautiful

853
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,340
You're so handsome

854
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,340
Dad

855
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,340
Dad

856
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,340
Yang Yang

857
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,340
Dad is looking at you

858
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,340
No

859
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,340
You used to like to ride a car

860
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:19,340
Why are you sitting behind now?

861
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,340
It's too noisy

862
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,340
Do you remember

863
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,340
When I was buying cars

864
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,340
I'm not doing this.

865
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:33,820
How's your school?

866
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:35,900
It's great.

867
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,020
It's important to have a relationship with your teacher and classmates.

868
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,860
You are in class now.

869
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,980
You will be your teacher after you grow up.

870
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:46,780
Your people are important.

871
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,780
You know?

872
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,540
Can you lend me this camera?

873
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,540
I don't need it.

874
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,740
Why do you want to take a photo with me?

875
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,540
It's because...

876
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:04,340
I have a new artist recently.

877
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,740
I'm taking photos with him.

878
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,540
You don't have a show?

879
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:08,540
Can you take photos for me?

880
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,140
No.

881
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,140
Take it.

882
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,740
This camera is old.

883
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,740
Will you use it?

884
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:19,940
Yes.

885
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:20,940
Thank you.

886
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,340
It's okay. I'll buy you a new one.

887
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:25,740
No need.

888
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:26,740
It's good.

889
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,340
Hello.

890
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,540
Hello, did you go out?

891
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,540
I'm out.

892
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,740
They are still playing cards.

893
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,540
Yue said you went to the shopping street.

894
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,340
Yes.

895
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,340
But your son is shopping at the mall.

896
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,340
Don't waste time on me.

897
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:47,940
I'll buy you a dress today.

898
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,140
I'll go there now.

899
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,140
Wang Yao, like this.

900
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,140
Yang Yang.

901
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,140
Yes?

902
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:59,740
Wang Yao's aunt knows I'm going to buy you a pair of shoes.

903
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,740
She said she'll be here soon.

904
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,740
She wants to pick a pair for you.

905
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,140
Her sight is better than mine.

906
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,940
I know.

907
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,540
Your sister heard you were here.

908
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,540
She's very happy.

909
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,740
She said she'd come to you.

910
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,340
How many pairs of shoes do you wear?

911
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,740
43 pairs.

912
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,340
It's even bigger than me.

913
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,940
When I was in elementary school,

914
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,340
I had white shoes like this.

915
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,340
I wore them for years.

916
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,340
I wanted to buy new ones.

917
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,340
I didn't have money to buy them.

918
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,340
My grandpa would give them the money.

919
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,340
They would all be white.

920
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,740
Like a new one.

921
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,740
It's raining.

922
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,340
It's raining and it's windy.

923
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,340
It's all white.

924
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,340
I can't even keep it.

925
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:50,340
I'm so tired.

926
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,340
I'm so tired.

927
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:52,340
I'm so tired.

928
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,340
I'm left with no white shoes.

929
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,340
This is quite comfortable.

930
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:58,340
I'll walk around.

931
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:02,340
Let's go.

932
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,340
I'm scared.

933
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,340
I'll teach her a lesson.

934
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,340
Do you have any elastic bands?

935
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,340
Is it comfortable?

936
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,340
It's comfortable.

937
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,340
Dad!

938
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,340
Baby, what are you doing here?

939
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,340
What?

940
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,340
You're so beautiful. Why do you always look at me like that?

941
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,340
Because... I'm the one who's going to be the representative.

942
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,340
Hello, Auntie.

943
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,340
That lady, wrap it up and leave it here.

944
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,340
Just throw it away.

945
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,340
Okay, okay. Hurry up.

946
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,340
Where should I put it?

947
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,340
So hurry?

948
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,340
Yes, go ahead.

949
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,340
Your house.

950
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,340
Okay, come on.

951
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:55,340
My daughter wants to buy a pair of shoes.

952
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:56,340
A pair of shoes?

953
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,340
This is our best.

954
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,340
Auntie,

955
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,340
help me put it on.

956
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,340
Hurry up.

957
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,340
What do you want to eat?

958
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,340
I'm hungry.

959
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,340
I want to eat some.

960
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,340
I'll eat some.

961
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,340
Okay.

962
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:18,340
What do you want to eat tonight?

963
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,340
seafood.

964
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,340
Okay?

965
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,340
Okay.

966
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,340
Wait for me. I'll go take a taxi.

967
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,340
Dad.

968
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,340
I'm going back first.

969
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,340
Why are you going back?

970
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:26,340
I want to eat seafood tonight.

971
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,340
Wait for me.

972
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,340
I'll go get the car.

973
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,340
Isn't the living fee enough?

974
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,340
Enough.

975
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,340
Didn't your mom buy you new clothes?

976
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,340
Look, the gift is all off.

977
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,340
Jingjing,

978
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,340
why did you take off your shoes?

979
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,340
Hurry up and apologize to her.

980
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,340
I'm not apologizing.

981
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,340
I didn't mean to.

982
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,340
You're not like you.

983
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,340
You have new shoes.

984
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,340
Yes.

985
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,340
I'm going to ask my mom.

986
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,340
Don't go too far.

987
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,340
She didn't mean to.

988
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,340
Mom,

989
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,340
tell my dad that I'm leaving.

990
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,340
Okay.

991
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,340
What are you doing?

992
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,340
What are you doing?

993
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:37,340
I'm going to take a shower.

994
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,340
I'm going to take a shower.

995
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,340
Dad, dad.

996
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,340
Are you okay?

997
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:44,340
I'm fine.

998
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:45,340
I told Xu Jing.

999
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,340
Where's the family?

1000
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,340
Hello, aunt.

1001
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,340
Hello, aunt.

1002
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,340
You're late.

1003
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,340
You can have three cups of wine.

1004
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,340
Okay.

1005
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,340
I'll change the dishes.

1006
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:01,340
Congratulations.

1007
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:09,340
Don't drink.

1008
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,340
What's wrong?

1009
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,340
I'm thirsty.

1010
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,340
Dongsheng,

1011
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,340
didn't you say you're not coming?

1012
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,340
Brother-in-law, congratulations.

1013
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,340
I haven't seen you for a while.

1014
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,340
You can't run away.

1015
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,340
Come on, have a drink.

1016
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,340
Come on.

1017
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,340
Drink some wine.

1018
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,340
I've had three cups of wine.

1019
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,340
Xu Jing,

1020
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,340
let's drink together.

1021
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,340
Congratulations.

1022
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,340
Congratulations.

1023
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,340
Congratulations.

1024
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,340
Come on, sit down.

1025
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,340
Let's eat and chat.

1026
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,340
Cheers.

1027
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:50,340
Cheers.

1028
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:51,340
How's the kid?

1029
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,340
My parents came to have fun with him.

1030
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,340
Here.

1031
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:57,340
Cheers.

1032
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,340
That's so kind of you.

1033
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,340
Dongsheng,

1034
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,340
how many years have you been here?

1035
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,340
Eight years.

1036
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:06,340
It's been so long.

1037
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,340
It's really hard

1038
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,340
to get out of the house

1039
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,340
after such a long time.

1040
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,340
How's your work?

1041
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,340
I'm in the youth club.

1042
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:19,340
You're also a teacher?

1043
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,340
I'm not a teacher.

1044
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:23,340
I'm just a teacher.

1045
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:25,340
I'm a teacher.

1046
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,340
So you're not a teacher?

1047
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,340
I'm not.

1048
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,340
You're not a teacher.

1049
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,340
I'm not.

1050
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,340
You're a good teacher.

1051
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,340
Dong Sheng,

1052
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,340
I'm telling you,

1053
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,340
the youth club is very important to men.

1054
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,340
Men don't have ambition.

1055
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,340
It's not easy.

1056
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,340
We don't talk about work today.

1057
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,340
Let's eat.

1058
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,340
I'm not hungry.

1059
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,340
I'm hungry.

1060
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,340
Sit down.

1061
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:57,340
Dong Sheng,

1062
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,340
have a seat.

1063
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,340
Here.

1064
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,340
I'll teach you how to be a teacher.

1065
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,340
Thank you.

1066
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,340
Thank you.

1067
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,340
Dong Sheng,

1068
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,340
Old man drinks more than a little,

1069
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,340
so he likes to talk more.

1070
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,340
Don't mind him.

1071
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,340
I understand.

1072
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,340
Just be happy.

1073
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,340
I said you have time.

1074
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:08,340
You should go out more.

1075
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,340
Walk around.

1076
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,340
Don't worry.

1077
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,340
The change in the 6th and 3rd is good.

1078
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,340
It's good to go to the 3rd floor.

1079
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,340
Tomorrow is a good day.

1080
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,340
Let Jingjing take you there.

1081
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,340
I can't go tomorrow.

1082
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,340
I can't go to the hospital.

1083
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:24,340
I won't go there.

1084
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,340
It's okay.

1085
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,340
We can go to the roundabout.

1086
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,340
I'm fine tomorrow.

1087
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,340
I'll take my parents there.

1088
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:37,340
The roundabout is too tight.

1089
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,340
Drive my car.

1090
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,340
Okay.

1091
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,340
Why don't you tell your dad?

1092
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,340
I don't want him to think I don't know anything.

1093
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,340
You have a good temper.

1094
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,340
I'll go up there.

1095
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:58,340
Are you used to it?

1096
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,340
Chuan Yang.

1097
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,340
I found your change is quite big.

1098
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,340
You used to talk a lot.

1099
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,340
I didn't want to talk to you.

1100
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,340
I didn't want to talk to you.

1101
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,340
I'm sorry.

1102
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,340
I'm sorry.

1103
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:12,340
I'm sorry.

1104
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,340
I'm sorry.

1105
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,340
I'm sorry.

1106
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,340
I'm sorry.

1107
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,340
I just got into the training.

1108
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,340
I can't keep up with myself.

1109
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,340
I didn't call once.

1110
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:33,340
I don't know where he is.

1111
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,340
Chuan Yang.

1112
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,340
You think so.

1113
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,340
At least you have a father.

1114
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,340
I want to see my father.

1115
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,340
I can't see him.

1116
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,340
Father sent me these photos every year.

1117
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,340
I just want to give them to his father.

1118
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,340
Wait for me.

1119
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,340
Wait for me.

1120
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:04,340
The phone.

1121
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,340
Thank you.

1122
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,340
You still remember this?

1123
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,340
I'll take you to a place.

1124
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,340
I'll take you to a place.

1125
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,340
It's windy.

1126
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:57,340
It's really comfortable.

1127
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,340
Chuan Yang.

1128
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,340
I'm here to save you.

1129
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,340
Where's your father?

1130
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,340
What do you mean?

1131
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,340
What do you mean?

1132
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:26,340
I learned it from a girl in the welfare center.

1133
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,340
It's a joke.

1134
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,340
You're here.

1135
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,340
Don't give me any news.

1136
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:42,340
Just tell me.

1137
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:44,340
Just let me shout out.

1138
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:45,340
You're here.

1139
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:46,340
You're here.

1140
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:52,340
You're here.

1141
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,340
Yes.

1142
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,340
It's this scene.

1143
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:00,340
You're here.

1144
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,340
You're here.

1145
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,340
You're here.

1146
01:00:03,340 --> 01:00:04,340
You're here.

1147
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,340
You're here.

1148
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,340
You're here.

1149
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,340
You're here.

1150
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,340
How is it?

1151
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,340
You feel better?

1152
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,340
Yes.

1153
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,340
Are you sure?

1154
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,340
Yes.

1155
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:20,340
Are you sure?

1156
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,340
Yes.

1157
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,340
Let's take a picture.

1158
01:00:45,340 --> 01:01:11,480
It's a都有

1159
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,340
You're awake.

1160
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,340
Where's Pu Pu?

1161
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:25,340
I just woke up.

1162
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:26,340
Hurry and wake up.

1163
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:29,340
We need to take a photo for Pu Pu.

1164
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,340
Oh, no. I forgot my hat.

1165
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,340
Mom, you go upstairs first. I'll go get it.

1166
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:40,340
Behind you!

1167
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,340
Got it, mom?

1168
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:46,340
Go.

1169
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:56,340
Drink it.

1170
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,340
You have to climb the mountain after you finish.

1171
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:05,340
My legs are sore.

1172
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,340
Mom, have some water.

1173
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:15,340
It's really good after you've fixed it.

1174
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,340
You're really better than before.

1175
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:26,340
Dad, I was thinking when you have time.

1176
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,340
I have a photo.

1177
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:30,340
The photo is the light.

1178
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,340
As long as the light is good,

1179
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:34,340
everything will look good.

1180
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,340
Dad, do you think I still have a chance?

1181
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:48,340
I think you two are not happy together.

1182
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,340
You should solve it as soon as possible.

1183
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:53,340
It's good for both of you.

1184
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:56,340
Dad,

1185
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,340
do I still have a chance to learn photography?

1186
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,340
You mean photography?

1187
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,340
Of course.

1188
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,340
I won't be late for anything.

1189
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,340
Dad,

1190
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,340
can you help me persuade Xu Jing?

1191
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,340
I know she's listening to you.

1192
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:20,340
Dongsheng,

1193
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:25,340
we know you two have feelings for so many years.

1194
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:30,340
But marriage can't be forced.

1195
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,340
You can take the challenge.

1196
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,340
You've been in Ningzhou for so many years.

1197
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:38,340
We've never been able to treat you well.

1198
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,340
We're just a daughter of the West.

1199
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,340
We can be happier.

1200
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:44,340
She has the right to live a new life.

1201
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,340
You should understand that.

1202
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,340
We hope you can do that.

1203
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:51,340
We've said what we should say.

1204
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,340
Think about it.

1205
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,340
Dongsheng.

1206
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,340
I understand.

1207
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:21,340
Dad,

1208
01:05:22,340 --> 01:05:23,340
it's really sunny now.

1209
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,340
Let's go for a walk.

1210
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,340
Sure.

1211
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:27,340
Let's go.

1212
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,340
The weather is so nice.

1213
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:35,340
Dad, let me do it.

1214
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,340
Yang, wait for me.

1215
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,340
Don't run so fast.

1216
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:43,340
You're too weak.

1217
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,340
I can run for a few more kilometers.

1218
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,340
Don't be so stupid.

1219
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:50,340
You're going to compete with me.

1220
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:51,340
Come on, who's afraid of who?

1221
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,340
Xu Jing's running to the top.

1222
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:55,340
Let's go.

1223
01:05:56,340 --> 01:05:57,340
Wait for me.

1224
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:11,340
This wind is good.

1225
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,340
Let's take a photo for Uncle.

1226
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:15,340
Sure.

1227
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:16,340
Come on, Uncle.

1228
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:17,340
Uncle, stand here.

1229
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,340
Stay here.

1230
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,340
How is it?

1231
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,340
Is it good?

1232
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:44,340
Uncle,

1233
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,340
don't you know how to sing?

1234
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,340
I'll record one for you.

1235
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,340
Then which one should I sing?

1236
01:06:58,340 --> 01:06:59,340
The one with the white boat.

1237
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:03,340
Then let's sing together, Yang.

1238
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,340
I don't know how to sing.

1239
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,340
It's okay.

1240
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:07,340
I'll teach you.

1241
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:09,340
Okay.

1242
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,340
How to sing the first sentence?

1243
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:42,340
There are roses in the spring.

1244
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:43,340
Where are you going?

1245
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:46,340
I haven't finished my homework.

1246
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:47,340
I have to find a place to live.

1247
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:48,340
Don't worry.

1248
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,340
If you have trouble,

1249
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,340
call me.

1250
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,340
Chao Yao.

1251
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,340
Thank you for the guitar.

1252
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:01,340
You're welcome.

1253
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:03,340
If it's not for my mom,

1254
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:06,340
I won't let you go.

1255
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,340
I'll see you again.

1256
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,340
Go upstairs.

1257
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,340
Have a safe trip.

1258
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,340
Goodbye, Chao Yao.

1259
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,340
Let's trick him into taking the mask off.

1260
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:28,340
Hello.

1261
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:30,340
Chao Yao.

1262
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,340
You're rabbit 14 years old.

1263
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:33,340
Who are you?

1264
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,340
Chen Jing flexible?

1265
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:36,460
Hello?

1266
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:40,940
Chaoyang, why are you back so late? Where did you go?

1267
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:45,740
I went to the bookstore to read the book.

1268
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:49,740
There's milk in the fridge. Remember to drink it while it's hot.

1269
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:52,140
We went to the police station to do something today.

1270
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:54,540
I can't go back these days.

1271
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:56,740
You should be careful.

1272
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:59,740
I know, mom. I'll hang up first.

1273
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:38,140
Mom!

1274
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,740
Look.

1275
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:50,940
You took the photos tear your doll into your dominance.

1276
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:09,340
I'll let you have a good rest.

1277
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:13,340
Look, I said we won't meet again.

1278
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:19,340
The night is getting late.

1279
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:22,340
What's going on?

1280
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:24,340
I think we're pushed down.

1281
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,340
What?

1282
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,340
Come and see.

1283
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,340
I'm going to the airport.

1284
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:36,340
How to sing the first line?

1285
01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:41,340
The sky is blue.

1286
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:46,340
The sky is blue.

1287
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:51,340
The sun is shining.

1288
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:55,340
The boat is on the boat.

1289
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:02,340
The boat is on the boat.

1290
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:06,340
The boat is on the boat.

1291
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:12,340
The boat is on a organizations.

1292
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:17,340
The love of the world has come to an end.

1293
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:23,340
I can't see the river.

1294
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:29,340
The spring is not over yet

1295
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:41,340
Fly, fly, fly to the end

1296
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:48,340
The cold sky, the clouds and the forest

1297
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:54,340
The young white boat

1298
01:13:54,340 --> 01:14:00,340
There is a rose tree on the boat

1299
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:06,340
The white soil is warm

1300
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:13,340
The river, the river, the river is not visible

1301
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:19,340
The spring is not over yet

1302
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:31,340
Fly, fly, fly to the end

1303
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:39,340
Fly, fly, fly to the end

1304
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:46,340
Fly to the end

1305
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:19,340
Fly to the end

1306
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:38,340
The blue sky, the clouds and the forest

1307
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:44,340
The young white boat

1308
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:50,340
There is a rose tree on the boat

1309
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:56,340
The white soil is warm

1310
01:15:56,340 --> 01:16:03,340
Fly, fly, fly to the end

1311
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:09,340
The spring is not over yet

1312
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:21,340
Fly, fly, fly to the end

1313
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:28,340
The cold sky, the clouds and the forest

1314
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:34,340
The young white boat

1315
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:40,340
There is a rose tree on the boat

1316
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:46,340
The white soil is warm
