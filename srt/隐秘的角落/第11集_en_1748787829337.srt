1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,520
okay

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,900
Why the hell the tough Watson которые

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,600
After selling this house just you

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,540
We'll take the car first

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,120
Second uncle

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,940
Uncle Chang

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,500
I'll give you money

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,040
To let you live in my house

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,320
I'm still not capable

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What are you doing here?

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
My mom is at home.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What's wrong with the card?

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What's wrong with the card?

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What's wrong?

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Pu Pu's car was caught.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He said his card was empty.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There's nothing in the card.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Say something.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What's going on?

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll give you the empty card.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I didn't have a service card.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why?

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Why are you so bad?

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What about Pu Pu?

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Just tell him that there's only one card.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I've already given him the new card.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Zhuo Yang!

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Mom.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What's that sound?

59
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Nothing.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Close the door.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll go get the tea.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yala.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't worry.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can think of a way.

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I won't believe you anymore.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yang Yang.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't worry.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Mr. Zhang.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Tell me.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Can you let Pu Pu go?

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yala did want me to give him a card.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But I didn't give it.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There's only one card.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,520
There's only one card.

75
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,440
It's the one from the Starry Sky Academy.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,680
Hello?

77
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,080
Mr. Zhang.

78
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
Do you think I'll still believe you?

79
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,320
I've already decided to call the police.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The Starry Sky Academy

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Episode 1

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,920
I heard you went to call the police.

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,520
Didn't you think of my consequences?

84
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,040
I've already released the support.

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,440
If you want me to call the police.

86
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
I've also told you.

87
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,640
If you tell the police,

88
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,720
I'll never see you again.

89
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,040
Don't come any closer.

90
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,960
I'll give you the last chance.

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
Tomorrow at 3 o'clock in the afternoon,

92
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,720
I'll return the report to you.

93
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
BYE!

94
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,640
You Liang.

95
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,880
Hoooo!

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,520
What are you doing there, Mr. Zhang?

97
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,880
Right or not.

98
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,360
Don't be angry.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
I just don't want you to catch it.

100
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,240
You're not.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:33,580
You

102
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,540
do n't have anything but

103
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,220
original

104
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,480
complimentary

105
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,440
of me

106
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
I need to talk to Pufu.

107
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Will he still believe me?

108
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,440
He has no other choice.

109
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
I'm telling you.

110
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,440
Pufu needs to do something.

111
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,440
I can't forgive you.

112
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,440
The Triad

113
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Captain Ye.

114
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
We've asked about the two of us.

115
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
The three people in the water company,

116
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,440
there are two people locked up.

117
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
The other person went to the shop.

118
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
The person who went to the shop is Wang Li.

119
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Her sister is Zhu Jingjing's mom.

120
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,840
Wang Yao.

121
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,240
Are you sure?

122
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,640
Yes.

123
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,840
He has a lot of influence on Wang Li.

124
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,040
His parents opened a hotel.

125
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,040
After that, he gave a loan to Ningzhou Water Company.

126
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,240
Shu Yongping used to be a water company.

127
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,640
I'll go to the hospital later.

128
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,240
Let Lao Chen confirm it.

129
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,440
Okay.

130
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,040
Officer Ye.

131
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,240
Hello, Mr. Chao.

132
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,440
How are you?

133
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Is there anything?

134
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,440
Is it convenient now?

135
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,840
Yes. Come in.

136
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,440
Thank you.

137
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,240
Do you need a change?

138
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,840
No.

139
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,440
Wang Yao, Officer Ye is here.

140
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,840
Is... is there any news from Jin Jin?

141
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Jin Jin's case is still on the scene.

142
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm here today to talk to you about something new.

143
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
Let's sit down and talk.

144
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Okay.

145
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Come.

146
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Come. Sit down.

147
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Wang Yao, is there a place called Wang Li?

148
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
What's wrong with Wang Li?

149
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,440
Do you know where he is now?

150
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
I don't know.

151
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
When was the last time he contacted you?

152
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
A few years ago.

153
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
He didn't want to come back to see me when he was in a big family.

154
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
He's a local.

155
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
He seldom visits his family.

156
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,440
He hasn't called for a year.

157
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Yes.

158
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
He's in the eye-contact.

159
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Eye-contact.

160
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,440
I heard that we know that Wang Li has returned to Ning Zhou.

161
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Are you sure he hasn't contacted you?

162
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,440
We haven't contacted each other for a long time.

163
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,440
A few days ago, a murder case happened in the Sea Ice Square.

164
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
We were seriously injured.

165
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,440
We were in a serious doubt about Wang Li.

166
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
If he contacts you,

167
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
he must tell me.

168
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Officer Ye,

169
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
if Wang Li asks us,

170
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,440
I'll call you first.

171
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
If he really does something,

172
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
I'll do it.

173
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,440
I'll do it if I should.

174
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Officer Ye, are you okay?

175
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
I'll go back to my room first.

176
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Officer Ye, and...

177
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Sorry.

178
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
My wife has been in a bad mood

179
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,440
because of her daughter.

180
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,440
Li,

181
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
you're in a long relationship.

182
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,400
What if Place Music showsallas,

183
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,440
no matter who's in it?

184
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
I'm really curious.

185
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,200
Doctor,

186
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,860
are you sure your wife doesn't know

187
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
that there is someone in the scene?

188
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
I'm humming a song.

189
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
OK, OK.

190
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,440
Okay.

191
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,240
Monk,

192
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,940
find the right place.

193
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,960
Now go to it yourself.

194
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,960
I think there's something wrong with Old Chu.

195
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
He kept calling me.

196
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Why did he leave the car?

197
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,960
And why did Chaoyang lie to the police?

198
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,960
There must be something wrong with you.

199
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm not crazy about you.

200
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
I'm not crazy about Old Chu.

201
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Do you believe me? Do you believe me?

202
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Are you scared?

203
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,960
It's because I was caught by Zhang Mosheng.

204
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
I must save him.

205
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
Just look at it.

206
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,960
If there's anything wrong, I'll go to the warehouse and see.

207
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
L-O-U-U.

208
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
I'll get you a key.

209
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Did you find it?

210
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,960
I'm sorry.

211
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
I've been too sensitive lately.

212
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
It's okay.

213
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,960
I'm not that good at writing.

214
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,960
I'm just going to eat in the past.

215
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
I'm sorry.

216
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Yuuting!

220
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960

Come here.

224
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,920
Don't cry.

225
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,080
Don't cry.

226
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,440
Don't cry.

227
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,000
Don't cry.

228
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Don't cry.

229
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,200
Don't cry.

230
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,360
Don't cry.

231
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,920
Don't cry.

232
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,200
Don't cry.

233
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,360
Don't cry.

234
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:26,120
Why is the karena a excited narrative

235
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,080
kadar led me to Sohey

236
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,320
father

237
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Father

238
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
why you alone

239
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,760
Where is Yanliang

240
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,000
He is not here

241
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,940
PLAYING

242
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,940
Where is Pu Pu?

243
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,940
She's inside.

244
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,940
You go in and find her.

245
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,940
You call her out.

246
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,940
I'll take her away.

247
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,940
If Pu Pu doesn't go out half an hour later,

248
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,940
she'll call the police.

249
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,940
So you let her go.

250
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
You ruined my life.

251
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,940
I'll call the police again.

252
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,940
Don't you want to see your dad?

253
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,940
Don't you want to see your dad?

254
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,940
What?

255
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,940
I'm a friend of Chao Yang.

256
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,940
I'll be right back.

257
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,940
Dad.

258
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,940
Dad.

259
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,940
Tell your dad

260
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,940
what good things I did.

261
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,940
Tell me.

262
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,940
You usually don't say anything.

263
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,940
Tell your dad

264
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:35,940
how much money you've lost.

265
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,940
How did you lie to me?

266
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,940
Tell me.

267
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,940
Do you want me to tell you?

268
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,940
Mr. Zhang, I'm begging you.

269
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
I'm begging you.

270
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,940
Let my dad go.

271
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,940
I'll give you the card now.

272
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,940
Why?

273
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,940
Do you want to do this?

274
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,940
I gave them all the money.

275
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,940
They have a card with a service.

276
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,940
I don't have a service.

277
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,940
You don't have a service?

278
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,940
What kind of deal do you have today?

279
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
You lied to me again.

280
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
Do you still have a truth?

281
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,940
You...

282
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,940
You really have a card?

283
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,940
It's not important how many cards you have.

284
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,940
Shameless.

285
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
Shameless!

286
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:35,940
You're the good son you taught him.

287
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,940
Do you think you know him well?

288
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Don't die.

289
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,940
I'm going to be discharged tomorrow.

290
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
What are you doing?

291
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,940
You didn't even go to the toilet.

292
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:50,940
Why are you so capable?

293
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:53,940
I'm capable.

294
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,940
I'm capable.

295
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,940
This little girl is like a piece of cake to me.

296
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,940
Run away!

297
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,940
Run away!

298
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,940
Run away!

299
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,940
Run away!

300
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,940
Run away!

301
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,940
Just run away!

302
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
Don't move!

303
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,940
Yan Ling!

304
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,940
I know it's you!

305
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
Didn't you want to see Pu Pu?

306
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:12,940
She's dead.

307
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,940
Come out and avenge her.

308
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,940
Come out!

309
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
Dad.

310
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
Dad.

311
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
Dad.

312
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,940
Dad.

313
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,940
Dad.

314
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,940
Dad.

315
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,940
Dad.

316
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
Dad.

317
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,940
Dad.

318
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,940
Uncle Zhang.

319
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,940
Dad.

320
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,940
Dad.

321
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,940
Dad.

322
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:44,940
Dad.

323
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,940
Dad.

324
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,940
Dad.

325
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,940
Uncle Zhang.

326
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,940
Dad.

327
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,940
Dad.

328
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,940
Dad.

329
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,940
Dad, please get out.

330
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,940
Dad, please.

331
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,940
Dad, I'm sorry.

332
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,940
I'm sorry, Dad.

333
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,940
You're so embarrassed.

334
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,940
Dad, please.

335
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,940
Dad.

336
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,940
My daughter.

337
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,940
My daughter.

338
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,940
Get up. I'll send you to the hospital.

339
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,940
Dad, get up.

340
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,940
I'll send you to the hospital.

341
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,940
Dad, get up.

342
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,940
I'll send you to the hospital.

343
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,940
Dad.

344
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,940
Dad, don't sleep.

345
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,940
Dad, listen to me.

346
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,940
I...

347
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
I...

348
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
I want to swim.

349
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,940
I want to breathe.

350
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,940
I want to swim for 20 seconds.

351
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,940
I want to take you to the hospital.

352
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,940
I want to live here.

353
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,940
I...

354
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,940
I...

355
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,940
I want to live here.

356
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,940
Dad.

357
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,940
Dad.

358
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,940
Dad.

359
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,940
Mom.

360
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,940
Mom, it's so dirty.

361
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,940
Dad.

362
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,940
Great, Dad.

363
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,940
Dad eats dozens of fish every day.

364
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,940
It's days past.

365
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,940
More questions.

366
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,940
Dad.

367
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:18,300
I, I was trying to, tried to lie to you

368
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,380
I'll leave that day and live in my wombs

369
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,260
I'm sorry

370
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:38,780
To be the last ABC

371
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,940
Dad!

372
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,940
Dad, I'm sorry.

373
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,940
Dad!

374
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,940
Dad, I'm sorry.

375
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,940
Dad!

376
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,940
Dad!

377
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,940

379
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,940
