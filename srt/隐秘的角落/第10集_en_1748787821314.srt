Did a snack

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,520
I need a key

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,960
A candle

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,760
두� funk still in the drawer

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
Pure dumb

Kelly coures

00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,140
One day fast twitch will hold a birthday party

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,060
Can they be in a great family

modular

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,820
We just treat us as friends.

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,820
If we don't go, we won't give the fox a face.

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,820
We won't be able to hate the fox.

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
What are you afraid of?

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
We three go together.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
Can't we beat a fox?

20
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,820
Finally, San Ji went to the fox's house.

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
They closed the door when they were done with the fox.

22
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,820
The Fox

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,820

24
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
Captain Ye, right here.

25
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,820
Hello, Captain Ye.

26
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,820
It's raining heavily. How did you come here?

27
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,820
The police told me that Chaoyang was in a bad condition.

28
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
It's okay now.

29
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
Chaoyang is in a bad condition.

30
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,820
Okay.

31
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,820
Captain Ye.

32
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
We meet again.

33
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,820
How are you feeling?

34
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Better?

35
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,820
I had a cold last night. I'm much better now.

36
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,820
Hello, Uncle Ye.

37
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,820
Hello.

38
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,820
Thank you.

39
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
Chaoyang,

40
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,820
I want to talk to you about something.

41
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,820
Tell him everything that happened last night.

42
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,820
Are you okay?

43
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,820
Step back.

44
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
Chaoyang, don't be nervous.

45
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
We're very familiar with each other.

46
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,820
Uncle will ask you some questions.

47
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
I hope you can answer them as you wish.

48
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
What happened last night?

49
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,620
He broke the dirt.

50
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,620
Last night,

51
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,420
my dad took me to theева school.

52
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,120
I accidentally blocked myself in a parents' warm-ups.

53
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
Just the two of you and your father.

54
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
Is Auntie Wang Yao going to marry her?

55
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
No.

56
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,820
Only me and my dad.

57
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,820
Chao Yang.

58
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,820
Don't be afraid.

59
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,820
The police are here.

60
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,820
You're right.

61
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,820
How long have you been in the cold?

62
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,820
What was your dad doing at that time?

63
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,820
Actually, not long ago.

64
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,820
My dad went to other people's bitter store.

65
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,820
He came to me later.

66
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
This is my fault.

67
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,820
I shouldn't have gone to the store.

68
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,820
Chao Yang, what are you talking about?

69
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,820
Did you teach him?

70
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,820
What did I teach him?

71
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,820
I didn't tell you.

72
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
What did you teach him? How did you lie to him?

73
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,820
Everyone is watching me here.

74
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,820
When did you tell him?

75
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,820
Even though Zhu Yongping is his dad,

76
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,820
he shouldn't be here at that time.

77
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,820
He should come back to the store.

78
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,820
Chao Yang's mom.

79
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,820
She has a child.

80
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,820
It's okay.

81
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,820
I'm used to it.

82
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,820
That's how it is.

83
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,820
It's okay.

84
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,820
Okay.

85
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,820
How about Chao Yang's mom?

86
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,820
Thank you.

87
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,820
I'll go back to the room.

88
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,820
Thank you.

89
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,820
Chao Yang,

90
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
eat the apple later.

91
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
Chao Yang,

92
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,820
where is your mom?

93
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,820
She's here.

94
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
Tell uncle Ye that you're here.

95
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,820
President San Yang,

96
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,820
you shouldn't be scared or troubled.

97
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
No matter who hurts you,

98
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
uncle will bematress you.

99
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,820
Uncle Ye should ask you again

100
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
as a policeman.

101
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
What happened last night.

102
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,820
Don't find a public Scene.

103
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,820
Rec consume it carefully.

104
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,020
Think about it.

105
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,340
You're a good kid.

106
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,220
You should know that

107
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,540
you're lying to the police

108
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,460
to take the legal responsibility.

109
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,540
Uncle Ye,

110
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,500
I'm a little uncomfortable.

111
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,820
Since that,

112
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,020
I'm not stupid anymore.

113
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,220
Have a good rest.

114
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,620
When you think of something,

115
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,020
talk to me again.

116
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,820
I'm almost done.

117
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
Let's talk again.

118
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,820
Sure.

119
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,020
Mr. Ye.

120
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,820
Thank you for your good rest.

121
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,420
Thank you for your good rest.

122
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,220
I want to talk to my dad

123
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,620
and learn more about the situation.

124
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,620
If there's anything new,

125
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,220
call me anytime.

126
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,820
Well,

127
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,420
last night...

128
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,220
That night, I was abroad.

129
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,220
He didn't come to see me.

130
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,220
I asked him to come to my side.

131
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,220
Let's go.

132
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,620
Let's go.

133
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,020
Why did you lie to the police?

134
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,020
Mom.

135
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,420
I didn't lie.

136
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,820
What are you doing?

137
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,220
Why didn't you tell mom?

138
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,820
What's wrong with you?

139
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,820
What's wrong with you?

140
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,420
Why didn't you tell mom?

141
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,620
Why didn't you tell mom?

142
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,820
Mom.

143
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,620
Mom.

144
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,620
Mom.

145
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,220
Mom.

146
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,420
Mom.

147
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,420
To be honest,

148
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,820
you're an outsider, right?

149
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
Mom.

150
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,020
I'm a little tired.

151
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,820
I want to sleep.

152
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,420
You're not a handsome man.

153
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,620
They bullied you so much,

154
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,220
you even helped them.

155
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,220
I... I tried to take you away.

156
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,020
Your dad took you away for several times.

157
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,020
You didn't even bother to go abroad.

158
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,420
When Qingmei died,

159
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,020
did he care about you?

160
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,020
You thought he really loved you,

161
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,020
he really cared about you,

162
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,020
he really cared about you,

163
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,820
but he wouldn't divorce me.

164
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,420
He wouldn't abandon us, Mu Zi.

165
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,620
Mom.

166
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,020
On the day of the divorce,

167
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,620
you forced my dad to sign the contract.

168
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,620
You insisted on getting divorced with him.

169
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,820
You thought I don't remember?

170
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,820
I remember.

171
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,620
I remember everything.

172
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,020
You're so ridiculous.

173
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,420
Your dad is out there now,

174
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,020
with another woman.

175
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,820
You're so ridiculous.

176
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,620
It's because

177
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,820
you only care about yourself.

178
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,020
I'm home.

179
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,420
The police went to the hospital.

180
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,620
What did Chao An say?

181
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,620
Sometimes I think that

182
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,220
we're funny as parents.

183
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,420
We always ask for children,

184
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,220
to be honest people.

185
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,620
Now I'm telling the truth.

186
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,820
Yang An is a good kid.

187
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,820
He didn't tell the police anything.

188
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,420
Thank you.

189
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,020
Where's your brother?

190
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,420
He's in the hospital.

191
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,820
He's in the hospital.

192
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,020
Tell him

193
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,820
to come back soon.

194
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,420
Tell him clearly.

195
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,620
Or I'll be done with him.

196
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,820
Have some noodles.

197
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,220
I'm going to sleep.

198
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,220
I'm going to sleep.

199
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,500
Ill,

200
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,420
if you'll excuse me.

201
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,620
Why aren't you sleeping?

202
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,220
I can't sleep.

203
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Are you feeling better?

204
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,940
I'm feeling much better.

205
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,580
It's almost stopped.

206
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,460
You should be able to get to Tonghang soon.

207
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,820
Zhu Chaoyang is fine.

208
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,900
Don't worry.

209
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,540
I'll see him in the morning.

210
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,340
Thank you.

211
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,740
Sleep early.

212
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,820
I'll push over.

213
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,220
Can you serve me some soup?

214
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,820
I'm exhausted.

215
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,220
Don't say anything else.

216
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,300
that's not right.

217
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,020
Sky.

218
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,620
That's right.

219
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,500
Don't have to doow burning out the Land Si別 milk tea at night.

220
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,500
Don't think too much about others.

221
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,420
Just look in there to find yourself.

222
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,920
M Cinema

223
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:34,660
Qu Toparing

224
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,660
You're already very old.

225
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,660
Dad, you really think I'm good at making the second place?

226
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,660
I think the first few are not important.

227
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,660
I've never been in the past when I was studying.

228
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660
You always take me as your wife.

229
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,660
Okay, okay. I'm the smartest one.

230
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
Hello?

231
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,660
Captain Ye, Chen's situation has been stable.

232
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,660
Okay, I'll wait in the hospital.

233
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,660
How's your side?

234
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
It's all gone. We're on the Han line now.

235
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,660
We'll check it again.

236
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,660
You'll be informed right away.

237
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,660
Okay.

238
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,660
Well, Mingming...

239
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,660
Go ahead. Don't take me as your wife.

240
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,660
My brother is about 30 years old.

241
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,660
I left a scar on the left side of the head.

242
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,660
There's a clear tattoo on the left hand.

243
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,660
What kind of tattoo?

244
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,660
It's on the left side of the head.

245
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
Five little black dots.

246
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
What's the relationship between Yanliang and him?

247
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,660
Did he mention this to you?

248
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,660
I saw it and I was already in the past.

249
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,660
I feel like they don't know each other.

250
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,660
Except Yanliang...

251
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,660
Here, take the medicine.

252
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,660
Didn't he say something?

253
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,660
Sister-in-law, I'm really sorry.

254
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,660
I've been talking for so long.

255
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
What's wrong?

256
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,660
Chen, we'll talk later.

257
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,660
Yanliang contacted you. Please call him.

258
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,660
Okay.

259
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,660
He's not a bad boy.

260
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,660
Let's check the hospital and Yanliang's condition.

261
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,660
Okay.

262
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,660
Where have you seen Uncle Chen's tattoo?

263
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,660
Where?

264
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,660
I've been in the dark for a long time.

265
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,660
The person in the medical department was shot by us.

266
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,660
The leader was Hong. I called him to see him.

267
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,660
At that time, he was with three or four people.

268
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,660
He was 27 or 28 years old.

269
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,660
He had this tattoo on his hand.

270
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,660
Where are the people later?

271
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,660
After Hong was arrested,

272
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,660
there was a body that was shot by the police.

273
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,660
The others were all dead.

274
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,660
Where is Hong now?

275
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
He should be in Erjian.

276
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,660
I'll go there later.

277
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,660
Okay.

278
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,660
I know I'm in a hurry.

279
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,660
I'll talk to him in a few days.

280
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,660
You can leave the money here.

281
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,660
Give me the scarf.

282
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,660
I don't have money now.

283
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,660
I'll pay you back when I sell this house.

284
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,660
Okay.

285
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,660
We'll take the car.

286
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
Don't talk to me.

287
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,660
Uncle Chen.

288
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,660
Let him go.

289
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,660
Zhang.

290
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,660
I know what you're doing.

291
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,660
You're a young man.

292
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,660
You have to sign a contract with us.

293
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,660
If you don't sign it,

294
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,660
we'll go to your workplace to make trouble.

295
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
Okay.

296
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,660
You go first.

297
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,660
We'll go first.

298
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,660
Next time,

299
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,660
we'll pay you back.

300
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,660
Are you satisfied?

301
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,660
Uncle Chen.

302
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,660
You're bleeding.

303
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,660
Thank you.

304
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,660
You borrowed the S3.

305
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,660
What else?

306
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,660
Where can I get so much money?

307
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,660
You can't live here anymore.

308
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,660
You can't let more people know our identity.

309
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,160
You won't live here anymore?

310
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,660
I either wanted to tell the public or tell the police.

311
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
I can't live here anymore.

312
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Xiaoyang!

313
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,660
Dad?

314
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,900
Mom, where are you going?

315
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,800
Just as I had to tell her to.

316
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,980
Still got nothing to do if I worry too much about her.

317
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,620
Look at your daughter, you have no idea how hard she'd need her.

318
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,480
Didn't I tell my daughter not to play with you?

319
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
No, she won't just take care of my daughter.

320
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,520
She should be well aware of her concerns.

321
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,220
No, they should go to Target 1 to deal with them.

322
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,280
Ohemann kind of had quite anINOUS dog.

323
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,280
I've already brushed it.

324
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Put it in my room.

325
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,080
Gui!

326
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,680
I bought this bed for you.

327
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
I'm sorry.

328
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
You didn't say anything, did you?

329
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
No.

330
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,280
When did you get the first-class award?

331
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
Last year.

332
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Good.

333
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
Chaoyang,

334
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,280
it's not easy for you to be alone.

335
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,280
When you grow up, what's the best way to smile?

336
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
Don't make her angry.

337
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,280
Is he still there?

338
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,280
It's still there.

339
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,280
You taught me all this before I was eight.

340
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,280
This is the year you were one.

341
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
The day you went to the kindergarten.

342
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,280
This is the third-class award.

343
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
Give me a pen.

344
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Give me a pen.

345
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Stop.

346
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
Okay.

347
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,280
I'll be back.

348
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,280
Okay.

349
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
I'll be back.

350
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,280
The result is higher than mine.

351
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
What are you doing?

352
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
Maybe you fell into a pit.

353
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
There's a pit again.

354
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Come.

355
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,280
You fell into a pit.

356
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,280
Let me do it.

357
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
Don't fall into the pit.

358
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,280
What's that?

359
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,280
What are you wearing?

360
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,280
This.

361
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
You fell into a pit.

362
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,280
Th Funded Goçil

363
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Close the door.

364
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Let's go.

365
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
What is this place?

366
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,080
My husband and I are from the same family.

367
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,080
This house is usually not rented.

368
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,080
My son is a cat.

369
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,280
He is so cute.

370
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,680
He is too thin.

371
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,080
Can I feed him?

372
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Sure.

373
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
The food is there.

374
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,480
You are just in the living room.

375
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,480
Don't go to other rooms.

376
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
Here is food.

377
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,880
I will give you some food.

378
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
It's not burning.

379
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,880
There is medicine in this cabinet.

380
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,880
If it is burning,

381
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,480
you can have one.

382
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,680
I will give you the key.

383
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,480
Take care of Yan Liang.

384
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,680
Come here.

385
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,480
I will teach you how to close this door.

386
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,680
This will cause a lot of trouble.

387
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,480
There is someone outside who can't come in.

388
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,680
Understand?

389
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
If I want to come here,

390
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,280
I will call you in advance.

391
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,280
I will read the pass for you later.

392
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,880
I will tell you when I am in the bank.

393
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,280
I am leaving.

394
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
Uncle Zhang.

395
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,080
Thank you.

396
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,680
I will take care of the cat.

397
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,480
Let's go.

398
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,680
Put the door in one step.

399
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,680
Looks like you have危 shutdown.

400
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,680
It should still have a girlfriend.

401
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,100
Don't bother.

402
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,680
I don't think he's that bad.

403
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Then you can't just let him go.

404
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
He's going to kill someone.

405
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,680
But he saved Chang'an and my brother.

406
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Is this case the most criminal case?

407
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,680
But I didn't send Uncle Zhang to another room.

408
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,680
No, you're allergic to this. You can't be with him.

409
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,680
I'm sorry, Xiao Man.

410
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,680
You have to be free in a few days.

411
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Do you want milk powder?

412
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,680
No.

413
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Do you still have a choice?

414
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,680
They told me that

415
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,680
there was a boy who left this in the nurse's room.

416
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,680
Take the chopsticks. I'm hungry.

417
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,680
I'm hungry.

418
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,680
You're leaving, aren't you?

419
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,680
Because of the typhoon, we left.

420
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Then you...

421
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,680
We're staying at Uncle Zhang's place.

422
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,680
Uncle Zhang?

423
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
Why are you here?

424
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,680
If they want to see you, I'll take them here.

425
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,680
Let's go.

426
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
I'll take you to eat something.

427
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,680
Go on.

428
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Which one do you want?

429
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Can I choose one?

430
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,680
You can only choose one.

431
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,680
You can choose one.

432
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,680
If you like it, I'll bring you some next time.

433
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,680
Or you can pick one for your daughter.

434
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Then...

435
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,680
This pink one.

436
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,680
Okay.

437
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
Thank you.

438
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,680
I can't go back to the hospital if I can't get a doctor's license.

439
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,680
I really have no choice.

440
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,680
So...

441
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,680
If you leave tomorrow,

442
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,680
will you leave?

443
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
You can't take off your new surgery.

444
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,680
It's getting better.

445
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,680
Here.

446
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Thank you.

447
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Thank you.

448
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,680
I'll wait for you in the car.

449
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
Thank you.

450
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,680
Mr. Zhang.

451
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Let's eat together.

452
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Let's eat together.

453
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
You two talk.

454
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
I don't exist.

455
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
Yan An.

456
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
Do you have any disease?

457
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,680
Can you tell me about it?

458
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,680
What kind of disease?

459
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
I hope you can get better soon.

460
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,680
I hope you can get better soon.

461
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
Yan An.

462
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
You can't tell me.

463
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
I don't want to.

464
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,680
I hope that the new patient can recover soon.

465
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,680
In this case, we can come back early and find Brother Chang'an.

466
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
Who?

467
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,680
I don't have any medicine.

468
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Which one?

469
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,680
I hope I can be the first one to be a second-hand patient.

470
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Uncle Zhen.

471
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
You?

472
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,680
I hope that everything can be recovered soon.

473
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,680
I hope that everything can be recovered soon.

474
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,680
Did you bring the copy of the card?

475
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
Why did you ask this?

476
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,680
Do you still want to tell her?

477
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,680
She did help us.

478
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
But...

479
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:49,680
Yan Ling.

480
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
You threw the copy of the card away, right?

481
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,680
I threw it away.

482
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,680
I'll think about it.

483
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Yan Ling.

484
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,680
Why did you take so long?

485
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,680
I threw it away.

486
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,680
I threw it away.

487
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,680
I threw it away.

488
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,680
I threw the copy of the card away.

489
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
I threw it away.

490
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
Brother,

491
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
buy some more for me.

492
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,680
I need more.

493
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
Eat.

494
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,680
Otherwise, you'll get cold.

495
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,680
Yan Lang.

496
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Can you call me tomorrow?

497
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
I think so.

498
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
I'll buy you tickets tomorrow.

499
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
I'll save the money for you in the card.

500
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,680
You can't bring so much money to the boat.

501
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,680
It's not safe.

502
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,680
If you believe me,

503
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
I can help you.

504
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
Yan Lang can stay with me.

505
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,680
You can rest assured.

506
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,680
Yan Ling.

507
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
Yan Ling.

508
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,680
This girl ran away with Yan Lang.

509
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,680
They have a good relationship in the welfare center.

510
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,680
The welfare center that left on 18th last month.

511
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,680
I don't know the reason.

512
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,680
Hurry up and find this girl.

513
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
Let Xiao Li send the photo to the car station and the boat.

514
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
I'll go to the police station and report it to them.

515
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,680
Okay.

516
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Yan Ling.

517
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,680
Uncle, do you want to take me to the bank?

518
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Why are you here?

519
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
I'm here.

520
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,680
Open the door.

521
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
Why are you lying to me?

522
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
What did you say?

523
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,680
Why are you lying to me?

524
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,680
Because of you.

525
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,680
I ruined my life.

526
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,680
I ruined everything.

527
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
I paid you.

528
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
I let you live in my house.

529
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,680
I'm not a human being.

530
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
Why are you lying to me?

531
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
You disappointed me.

532
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,680
You disappointed me.

533
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
I'm so disappointed.

534
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,680
Take it out.

535
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,680
I don't know what you want me to take out.

536
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
And the decoration.

537
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,680
I know you have a card in your welfare center.

538
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
We don't.

539
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
I heard it yesterday.

540
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,680
You lied to me.

541
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
What?

542
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
You want to go out?

543
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,680
Okay.

544
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,680
I'll go out first.

545
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,680
Go.

546
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
Go to the police.

547
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
Go.

548
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,680
We can't be together.

549
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,680
Go.

550
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
I don't want to hurt you.

551
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,680
I just want to get rid of these lazy people.

552
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,680
When you go to your hares,

553
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,680
I'll live my life.

554
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
Or you go to the police station now.

555
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
I'll tell the police everything.

556
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
If you lose money,

557
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
your brother will be dead.

558
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
You choose.

559
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
Boss.

560
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680
I'll go home for breakfast later.

561
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Eat more.

562
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,680
I'll go home.

563
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,680
Mimi.

564
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,680
Drink up.

565
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,680
I give it to you.

566
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,680
You go away.

567
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,680
I want to give it to you.

568
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
I don't want to see you again.

569
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,680
Then let me help you.

570
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,680
Get off the car.

571
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,680
Go.

572
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,680
Fu Fu.

573
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,680
Fu Fu.

574
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,680
Fu Fu.

575
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,680
You little bastard.

576
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,680
You little bastard.

577
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,680
Uncle Zhang.

578
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,680
What's wrong?

579
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,680
What's wrong?

580
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,680
Where's the card?

581
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,680
What card?

582
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,680
The card you're serving.

583
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,680
Didn't I give you the card?

584
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,680
Uncle Zhang.

585
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,680
I'm a little sad.

586
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,680
I want to take the medicine.

587
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,680
Zhuang.

588
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,680
Liar.

589
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,680
I won't believe you again.

590
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,680
Isn't it good for you?

591
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,680
I gave you 300,000.

592
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,680
I'm going to kill that person.

593
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,680
You're just treating me like this.

594
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,680
Where's the card?

595
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,680
Lu Pu.

596
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,680
What's wrong?

597
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,680
Speak.

598
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,680
Lu Pu.

599
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,680
Medicine.

600
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,680
Medicine.

601
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,680
Medicine.

602
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,680
What medicine?

603
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:31,680
Medicine.

604
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,680
Where's the card?

605
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,680
What medicine, Pu Pu?

606
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,680
What medicine?

607
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,680
Here, Lu Pu.

608
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,680
Medicine.

609
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,680
Medicine.

610
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,680
Medicine.

611
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,680
Medicine, Pu Pu.

612
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,680
Medicine.

613
00:45:58,680 --> 00:45:59,680
Medicine is good.

614
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,680
Medicine.

615
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,680
Medicine.

616
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,680
Medicine.

617
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,680
Medicine.

618
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,680
Pu Pu.

619
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,680
Pu Pu.

620
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,680
Don't sleep.

621
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,680
I'm a little sad.

622
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,680
I can help you.

623
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,680
I'm pregnant.

624
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,680
I can't breathe.

625
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,680
Is there any reason for it to be so weak?

626
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,680
No.

627
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,680
It should be a filial piety meal.

628
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,680
We can't take the medicine ourselves.

629
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,680
What should we do?

630
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,680
Don't worry.

631
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,680
Tell us the address.

632
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,680
We'll call the ambulance.

633
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,680
Hello?

634
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,680
Sir.

635
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,680
Tell us your address.

636
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,680
Hello?

637
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,680
Are you still here?

638
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,680
Hello?

639
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,680
Hello?

640
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,680
Hello?

641
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,680
Hello?

642
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,680
Hello?

643
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,680
Hello?

644
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,680
Hello?

645
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,680
Hello?

646
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,680
Hello?
