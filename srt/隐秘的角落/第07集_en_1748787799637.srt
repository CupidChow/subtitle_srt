1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
Da Shuai

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,120
Da Shuai

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,200
You're not as good as I am

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,480
I gave you all of my所

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,960
march

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,940
Mei Shou

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,620
Your word

8
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,580
is a good fear for you.

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,340
Do you know

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,260
that my father

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,500
the guy on the boat

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,340
is also

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,860
it,

14
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,580
that stage

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,820
when this,

16
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,380
the guest

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,860
likes this,

18
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,780
then

19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,580
right now,

20
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,700
Let me go.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,300
Where are you taking me?

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,100
I won't go.

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,500
Let me go.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,740
Let me go.

25
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,500
Dad, don't go.

26
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,300
Let me go.

27
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,700
Let me go.

28
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,580
Let me go.

29
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,580
Look, how to swim.

30
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,580
You must put your head down like this.

31
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,580
Help me.

32
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,580
Let me go.

33
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,580
Mrs. Zhou.

34
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,580
Mrs. Zhou.

35
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,100
I have to go.

36
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,780
Go.

37
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,940
Sis.

38
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,700
Sis.

39
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,380
What's up, Chicha?

40
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,500
I gave Aunt to Yanyi.

41
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,580
She said

42
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,900
I can't say anything.

43
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:51,860
Did Zhang Dongzheng

44
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,460
save our new team?

45
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,860
If he doesn't do the surgery,

46
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,740
there might be no chance.

47
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,580
Why are you here?

48
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,980
I'll cook for you when I'm done.

49
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,580
My dad is still here.

50
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,980
You can go to the park and we'll talk.

51
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,580
Then say it now.

52
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,580
We can't delay the money.

53
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,980
We have to find Zhang Dongzheng.

54
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,580
If...

55
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:34,980
Chang'an,

56
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,580
we'll wait for you at your house.

57
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,580
Okay.

58
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,580
Come on.

59
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,580
How do we continue after drinking?

60
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
Dad,

61
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,580
I'm a little tired.

62
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,580
Okay,

63
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,580
we'll leave after drinking.

64
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,580
Is he going to refuse me?

65
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,580
What should we do?

66
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,580
This money is for Jiu Xinxin.

67
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,580
If I can't save her,

68
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,580
why should I take her?

69
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,580
What's wrong?

70
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,580
This money is for Jiu Xinxin.

71
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,580
If I can't save her,

72
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,580
why should I take her?

73
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,580
What's wrong?

74
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,580
She's turned off the camera.

75
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,580
Let's go home.

76
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,580
Brother Yuan.

77
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,580
Yuan Liang,

78
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,580
don't be so impulsive.

79
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,580
I'll go to Shang Nian Gong to find her tomorrow.

80
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,580
It's safer this way.

81
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,580
Brother Yuan.

82
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,580
Mom,

83
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,580
what are you doing?

84
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,580
Why are you taking so long?

85
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,580
It's done.

86
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,580
What are you doing?

87
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,580
Why are you taking a swimming pool?

88
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,580
I'm practicing my temper.

89
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,580
Firm temper?

90
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,580
I think the chief of the department

91
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,580
has learned swimming.

92
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,580
Mom, will you swim?

93
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,580
I'll teach you after I learn it.

94
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,580
Mom,

95
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
I'll teach you when I learn it.

96
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,580
Mom,

97
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
I can't swim anymore.

98
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,580
I can't swim anymore.

99
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,580
Let's go home.

100
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
Let's go.

101
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,580
Let's go.

102
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
Mom,

103
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,580
don't be so impulsive.

104
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,580
I'll learn it.

105
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,580
Mom,

106
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,580
I'll teach you how to swim.

107
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,580
You can swim.

108
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,580
Mom,

109
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,580
I'll teach you how to swim.

110
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,580
Mom,

111
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
I'll teach you how to swim.

112
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,580
Mom,

113
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,580
I'll teach you how to swim.

114
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,100
Look, we need to stand near your apartment tomorrow.

115
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,340
I've brought quite a bit of milk.

116
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,180
Why did you come out so soon?

117
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,900
Zhang Luo Chen didn't come to take class today.

118
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,500
He won't come out, will he?

119
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,660
Let's go to his place.

120
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,260
Wait for me at his place.

121
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,660
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,540
Why are you here?

123
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,140
I have something to tell you.

124
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,860
Come in.

125
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,780
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,860
Why are you looking for me?

127
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,420
Can you give me the money?

128
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,420
I told you.

129
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,540
I can't afford to pay you.

130
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,780
If you don't give me the money,

131
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,740
we'll...

132
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,380
Call the police, right?

133
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,740
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

134
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,740
You are?

135
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,300
I'm Ye Jun.

136
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,100
This is my daughter, Ye Chi Min.

137
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,140
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

138
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,060
Mr. Zhang, I'm here to visit you.

139
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:10,780
How about this?

140
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,020
My daughter

141
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,820
wants to go to the office of the Shao Nian Palace.

142
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,740
But the big brother didn't report it.

143
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,300
So...

144
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,300
Zhu Chaoyang.

145
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,300
Come in.

146
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,020
Come in.

147
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,780
Is Mr. Zhang using a change of shoes?

148
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,340
No need.

149
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,740
Chaoyang, why are you here?

150
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,300
Hello, Mr. Ye.

151
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,620
I'm... I'm Mr. Zhang.

152
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,500
I'll pay him for it every week.

153
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,580
Do you know that

154
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,740
Chaoyang and Min Min are classmates?

155
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,660
The first name is different.

156
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,460
How did you find here?

157
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:51,780
Mr. Zhang,

158
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,380
my daughter

159
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,780
always calls me.

160
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,260
We went to the Shao Nian Palace to find you.

161
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,060
You're not here.

162
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,980
I heard that you don't have class recently.

163
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,780
I asked Mr. Tang for your address.

164
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,700
Mr. Zhang,

165
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,900
I have several classmates.

166
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,420
They all say that you speak very well.

167
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,940
I also want to improve the academic performance.

168
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,340
Yes.

169
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,500
At this stage,

170
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,020
I'm starting to get the academic performance.

171
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,020
It's a little helpful to improve the results.

172
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,340
Right, Zhu Chaoyang?

173
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,820
Mr. Zhang, we've actually met before.

174
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,700
Really?

175
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,740
I didn't wear a uniform today.

176
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,820
You may not recognize me.

177
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,420
In the past,

178
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,100
there was a girl in the Shao Nian Palace.

179
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,980
I went to know her.

180
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,500
It's a little impressive.

181
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,500
Have a seat.

182
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,500
I'll pour you some water.

183
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,420
Mr. Zhang, don't bother.

184
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,060
I'll leave right away.

185
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,660
No trouble.

186
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,420
Zhu Chaoyang,

187
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,660
how long have you been here?

188
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,820
Not long.

189
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,860
Young boy,

190
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,460
is there anything different

191
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,620
between you and Younger Brother?

192
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,820
Nothing different.

193
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,540
It's just...

194
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,580
I want to practice more.

195
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,380
What are you doing today?

196
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,620
Making a ring.

197
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,580
What ring are you making?

198
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,620
Show me.

199
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,460
Zhu Chaoyang,

200
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,580
come and get some water for me.

201
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,660
You shouldn't come here.

202
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,620
Younger Brother,

203
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,820
Younger Brother,

204
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,060
are you going to move your box?

205
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:47,980
No.

206
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,060
I just passed out.

207
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
Since you're really

208
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,660
very risky,

209
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,820
I'll bother you.

210
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,860
How about this?

211
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,860
I'll get you a set of exercises.

212
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,540
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

213
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,300
You've done your first round.

214
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,620
I'll do it as much as I can.

215
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,660
I'll take a look at your video.

216
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,620
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

217
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,820
See you later.

218
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,180
Take care.

219
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,180
Tell me.

220
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,340
What do you want?

221
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,620
How did he die?

222
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,660
Is it an accident again?

223
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,780
I've prepared the money for you.

224
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,180
Wait for my call.

225
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,180
Is he going to kill me?

226
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,660
I don't know.

227
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,420
Let's finish this thing.

228
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,340
Mr. Zhang will take the money

229
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,700
in the next few days.

230
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,460
We have to make a deal.

231
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,380
We can't go to his house anymore.

232
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,020
Where to?

233
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,260
We'll ask him to come over.

234
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,260
No.

235
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,140
We have to choose a place with more people.

236
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,460
The more people we meet, the safer we'll be.

237
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
How about

238
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,700
we ask him to the Star Palace?

239
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,340
There are more people there.

240
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,900
Let's take the money out first.

241
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,940
We'll leave right away

242
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,820
after we get the money.

243
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,220
Okay.

244
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:06,940
Mr. Zhang,

245
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,100
who are the two people

246
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,380
who went to Zhang Dou Sheng's house today?

247
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,580
My classmates Ye Chi Ming and his dad.

248
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,180
His dad is a police officer.

249
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,540
Why did the police go to his house?

250
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,180
They went to the department store.

251
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,820
Come in.

252
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:30,980
Your mom

253
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,740
is still angry with dad?

254
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,780
No.

255
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,940
There are many things

256
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,180
that I can't do.

257
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,020
Show me.

258
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,620
What's the use?

259
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,820
It's not dangerous.

260
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,420
How about this?

261
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,860
I promise you

262
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,420
I'll find you a better teacher

263
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,420
than Mr. Zhang.

264
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,540
And

265
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,740
whenever you go to class,

266
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,660
I'll be with you.

267
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:05,700
Really?

268
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,300
Really.

269
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,460
You can write it.

270
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,380
I'll be with you.

271
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,260
This house is good for you.

272
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,660
Yes.

273
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,220
I heard that

274
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,620
you were in a bad situation.

275
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,060
So you want to sell this house, right?

276
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,020
Why do you dare to sell it to me?

277
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,380
I'm not selling it.

278
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,460
Why should I sell it to you?

279
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,340
Look at the other rooms.

280
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:38,980
Is it okay?

281
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,620
Yes, it's okay.

282
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,500
This is the kitchen.

283
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,140
This is the study room.

284
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,300
This is the kitchen.

285
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,020
Can I have a better price?

286
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,340
We've been

287
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,780
much lower than the price.

288
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,980
These rooms are lower than the price.

289
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:57,940
Of course.

290
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,380
Whoever comes to your room

291
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,820
will be very considerate.

292
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,020
You don't have to think about it.

293
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
This house is not sold.

294
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,940
What's the attitude?

295
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,940
I'll try to pick it up.

296
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,740
Mr. Zhang,

297
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,340
you know that

298
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,940
this house is hard to sell.

299
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,100
You have to know your attitude.

300
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,940
Why does he buy so many houses

301
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,940
for me?

302
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,340
Can he manage it?

303
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,740
We can't hide it from the client.

304
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,140
It's not a big deal.

305
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,740
Otherwise, it'll be a big deal.

306
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,940
I won't sell it, okay?

307
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,540
You don't have to bother me anymore.

308
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,540
Let me see.

309
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,140
One condition is to pay 300,000 yuan

310
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,340
to pay the other condition.

311
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,340
You have to get the sword

312
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,740
and exchange it with them.

313
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,740
I've told you before.

314
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,540
I don't want to hurt you.

315
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,540
I want to hurt you.

316
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,740
I want to hurt you.

317
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,740
Hello.

318
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,140
My bank card

319
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,340
is 3,000 yuan

320
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,540
on the ATM today.

321
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,140
Can you check

322
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,740
the location of the machine?

323
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,740
Have you checked the people

324
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,940
in the Young Master's Palace?

325
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,540
Yes.

326
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,540
Zhang Dongsheng also checked it.

327
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,340
He was in the office at the time.

328
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,140
Many students can verify it.

329
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,540
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,540
Chaoyang.

331
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,340
Do me a favor.

332
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,340
Say it.

333
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,340
Can you help me

334
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:48,740
put the information in the machine

335
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,940
on this card?

336
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,340
After we get Zhang Dongsheng's money,

337
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,340
I'll hand this card to the police.

338
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,940
Then I'll confess everything.

339
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,140
Confess?

340
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,940
I'll tell the police

341
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:05,540
that I'm the only one

342
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,540
who can't trust you and your uncle.

343
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,740
You don't believe me?

344
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,540
I believe you.

345
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,540
And...

346
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
Don't tell me about this.

347
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble.

348
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,740
I'll tell the police

349
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,740
that I'm the only one who can't trust you and your uncle.

350
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,340
Let me go.

351
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,740
I don't know where to go.

352
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,540
I'll tell you if you call me.

353
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,740
I'll tell you if you call me.

354
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,740
Let me go.

355
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,740
Let me go.

356
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,740
Let me go.

357
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,540
Let me go.

358
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,540
Let me go.

359
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,540
Let me go.

360
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Let me go.

361
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,540
Let me go.

362
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,540
Let me go.

363
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,540
I'm so tired.

364
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
You're tired?

365
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,540
How happy is Zhu Jiang

366
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,540
when you put me on the high school?

367
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540
I didn't bring a boat to school.

368
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,540
But all the girls in the school

369
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
came to see me.

370
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,540
I was so sad then.

371
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,540
When will you take me to the high school?

372
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540
Let's practice more.

373
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,540
I'll take the oil

374
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,540
when I was 18.

375
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,540
Okay.

376
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,540
Let's take the oil first.

377
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
Come on.

378
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,540
Come on.

379
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,540
Two, three, four.

380
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,540
Go.

381
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
Fang.

382
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,540
When you went there,

383
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,540
don't forget to bring the box.

384
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,540
Okay.

385
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
Fang.

386
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,540
Are you coming here?

387
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,540
Today is my last day of work.

388
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,540
I'm also the last one to take the task.

389
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,540
See you tonight.

390
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,540
I'm going to the high school.

391
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,540
I'm going to the high school.

392
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,540
I'm going to the high school.

393
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,540
I'm going to the high school.

394
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,540
I'm going to the high school.

395
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,540
I'm going to the high school.

396
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,540
I'm going to the high school.

397
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,540
I'm going to the high school.

398
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,540
I'm going to the high school.

399
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,540
I'm going to the high school.

400
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,540
I'm going to the high school.

401
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,540
I'm going to the high school.

402
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,540
I'm going to the high school.

403
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,540
I'm going to the high school.

404
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,540
I'm going to the high school.

405
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,540
Hurry up.

406
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,540
Let's close the door.

407
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
Right away.

408
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,500
ِ

409
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,620
hehe

410
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,740
Most beautiful

411
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,340
Yes.

412
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,140
We should give the back office a chance.

413
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,140
Xiao Bo.

414
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,340
Let's go.

415
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,540
I've been a police officer for my whole life.

416
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,140
I'm a police officer.

417
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,340
I've done this.

418
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,340
But sometimes,

419
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,140
I feel a little regretful.

420
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,740
I retired today.

421
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,740
When I think about these regrets,

422
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,140
I can't believe I can't say that.

423
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,140
Chen.

424
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,340
You've done a good job.

425
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,340
Come.

426
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,140
Let's have a toast to the old comrade.

427
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,140
Let's have a toast to the old comrade.

428
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,140
Come.

429
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,140
Let's drink.

430
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,140
Let's drink.

431
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140
Let's drink.

432
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,140
Cheers.

433
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,140
You're up.

434
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,140
You're up.

435
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
You're up.

436
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,140
You're up.

437
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,140
You're up.

438
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,140
You're up.

439
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,140
You're up.

440
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,140
You're up.

441
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,140
Yan Liang.

442
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,140
It's me.

443
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,740
Tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock,

444
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,740
wait for me on the way to Li Ming Road.

445
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,740
I'll take you to see your dad.

446
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,340
What's wrong, Yan Liang?

447
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,140
I'll call the police tomorrow.

448
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,140
Really?

449
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,140
Take it.

450
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,140
Hey, hey, hey.

451
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,140
Don't say that.

452
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,140
Sorry, I'm not very clear.

453
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,140
Do you know who's in charge of this boat?

454
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,140
It's nothing.

455
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,140
The boss asked me to take care of it.

456
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,140
Is that so?

457
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,140
Isn't the repair period almost over?

458
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,140
I think we should go back to the old comrade.

459
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,140
He bought a few boats.

460
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,140
Did you think about selling them?

461
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,140
Selling boats?

462
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,140
I'll give you the boss's phone number.

463
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,140
These boats are long-range.

464
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,140
It's not good for me.

465
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,140
It looks good.

466
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,140
It's still okay to clean inside.

467
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,140
Come on, take the test.

468
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,140
Not bad.

469
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,140
The ground is not moving.

470
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,140
It's all wooden boats.

471
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,140
It's all burnt.

472
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,140
I'll go back to the old comrade.

473
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,940
On eight- tighter, please.

474
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,740
Today, I had a new goal.

475
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,100
It was when I was 18

476
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,940
when I was chase after a man,

477
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,260
we helped him find a big card.

478
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,340
He said after it was over,

479
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,740
he wanted to report a Devil還是要去告发长廊上.

480
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,980
After the operation is over,

481
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,380
he still needs to sleep to get a doctor's license.

482
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:18,900
Chen.

483
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,620
Why don't you have a uniform?

484
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,260
I retired.

485
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,220
I'm just like you now.

486
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,740
Just a normal person.

487
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,300
That's enough.

488
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,740
I admire you.

489
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,420
Lu An.

490
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,020
What's written on it?

491
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:49,700
You.

492
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,860
You can have a look after you finish it.

493
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,900
Can I?

494
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,740
The first one is the one that I bought.

495
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,740
I bought it from the market.

496
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,740
It's a little bit different.

497
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,740
It's a little bit different.

498
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,740
It's a little bit different.

499
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,740
It's a little bit different.

500
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,740
It's a little bit different.

501
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,740
It's a little bit different.

502
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,740
It's a little bit different.

503
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,740
It's a little bit different.

504
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,740
It's a little bit different.

505
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,740
It's a little bit different.

506
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,740
It's a little bit different.

507
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,740
It's a little bit different.

508
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,740
It's a little bit different.

509
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,740
It's a little bit different.

510
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,740
Your dad can't take the video.

511
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,740
Your dad can't take the video.

512
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,740
There's a problem here.

513
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,740
Sometimes it's clear.

514
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,740
Sometimes it's messy.

515
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,740
It's getting worse and worse.

516
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,740
When I called him to wake up,

517
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,740
I asked him

518
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,740
if he wanted to tell you about this.

519
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,740
He didn't agree.

520
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,740
So I kept saying it.

521
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,740
Now you're busy.

522
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,740
You'll have to prepare for it later.

523
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,740
I have a plan.

524
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,740
You can come down.

525
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,740
Come down.

526
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,740
Come down.

527
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,740
Be careful.

528
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,740
Be careful.

529
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,740
Come down.

530
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,740
Come down.

531
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,740
Come down.

532
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,740
Be careful.

533
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,740
Shili.

534
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,740
Hurry up.

535
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,740
I just came.

536
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,740
Hurry up.

537
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,740
What are you doing?

538
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,740
Go to my son.

539
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,740
I'll go to Shili.

540
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,740
Shili.

541
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,740
Shili.

542
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,740
Shili.

543
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,740
Go down.

544
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,740
Go.

545
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,740
Go.

546
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,740
Go.

547
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,740
Go.

548
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,740
Go.

549
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,740
Go.

550
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,740
Go.

551
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,740
No.

552
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,740
Go.

553
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,440
Give me a glance.

554
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,840
What's wrong?

555
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,560
I'm here to see you two.

556
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,740
Cook!

557
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,040
Cook!

558
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,440
Cook!

559
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,900
Cook!

560
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:22,640
I remember what you said in the letter.

561
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,940
Even I can't replace theしrHEs anymore.

562
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,720
So what now?

563
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,580
I was so worried.

564
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,560
But I forgot that morning.

565
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,720
가마시 Part.

566
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,600
But I also want to go back.

567
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,140
Look at this.

568
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,140
I can't say it.

569
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,140
You can't say it?

570
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:52,140
You can't just lie to me.

571
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,140
Let's go.

572
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,140
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

573
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,140
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

574
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,140
Can you sign here?

575
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,140
You bastard.

576
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,140
Stop.

577
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,140
Get off.

578
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,140
Come on.

579
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,140
You son.

580
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,140
You're so harsh to your aunt.

581
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,140
I'm so afraid that she'll get into your life.

582
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,140
I'm so ashamed.

583
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,140
I should stay at home

584
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,140
and spend my life with my wife and grandson.

585
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,140
I'm so lucky.

586
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,140
I'm so ashamed of you.

587
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,140
I'm so human.

588
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,140
What's wrong?

589
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,140
Did I owe you?

590
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,140
You're so mean.

591
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,140
Did I owe you?

592
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:39,140
Did I persuade you?

593
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,140
Did I say something wrong to you?

594
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,140
Did I send you to the hospital?

595
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,140
Did I say something wrong?

596
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,140
I should bring you a car.

597
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,140
Hello, Tian Liang.

598
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
I'm here with your dad.

599
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,140
I want your dad to listen to you.

600
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,140
How can you be so heartless?

601
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,140
Chen, can you stop caring about me?

602
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,140
I care about you

603
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,140
because you don't want your dad to suffer.

604
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,140
It's for your own good.

605
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,140
I don't need it.

606
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,140
You were good for my dad.

607
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,140
But now...

608
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,140
You don't have to be here

609
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,140
because your dad

610
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,140
has learned the reason you didn't learn it.

611
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,140
You don't have to say it.

612
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,140
I don't understand.

613
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
I don't understand.

614
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,140
The middle of the cold sea.

615
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,140
The cold sea.

616
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,140
I'm going to find your son.

617
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,140
I'm going to find your son.

618
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,140
Here's the toothbrush.

619
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,140
Here.

620
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,140
Here.

621
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,140
Here.

622
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,140
Here, take a breath.

623
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,140
Here.

624
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,140
Here.

625
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,140
Here.

626
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
Here.

627
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,140
Here.

628
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,140
Here.

629
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,140
Here.

630
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,140
Here.
