He ran off and left its lorry between us

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,320
Why would Cha coyong give help to look for逮 opens

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,560
There's something wrong straight in the screen

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,360
Cool

00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,660
Tell your dad

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,860
I've done something good

Yezi, in addition to the three bodies,

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
we also found a lot of traces of the beating.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Where's the main statue?

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's outside.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The child hasn't said a word yet.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's continue to investigate.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay.

Zhao Yang!

Zhao Yang!

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000

Mom is here!

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Are you okay?

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Say something!

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Are you okay?

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Can I take her home first?

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Can I say anything else?

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Zhao Yang!

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Mom, what happened to your hand?

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What happened to your hand?

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Zhao Yang!

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Zhao Yang!

33
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Tomorrow, if you lose, you won't come again.

34
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll send this semester's results to Mr. Tang.

35
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The students who have been called by their names, please come up here.

Zhou Chaoyang.

42
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Zhao Yang.

43
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I know what you just experienced.

44
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I also believe that you will make the right choice.

45
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Dad.

46
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Dad.

47
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's me.

48
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yan Liang.

49
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know if you can hear me.

50
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I came to your graduation this time.

51
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Maybe I won't see you again.

52
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You want me to be a good person, right?

53
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't know how to be a good person.

54
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Chen said I was the same as you.

55
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What do you think?

56
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What do you think?

57
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Dad.

58
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm leaving.

59
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Dad.

60
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,240
I'll leave the results of the class to me.

64
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
Okay.

65
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,720
Here you are.

66
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Thank you.

67
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,320
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

68
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,520
We came here today to talk about the situation in Zhu Chang'an.

69
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
Hello.

70
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
Please have a seat.

71
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Mr. Zhang.

72
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Zhu Chang'an is still in your house.

73
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
He's not here anymore.

74
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,520
His previous class has been over.

75
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Did you notice any meaning?

76
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,520
I don't think so.

77
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
His homework is in the middle of the night.

78
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
He's very serious.

79
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
What's wrong with him?

80
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
He's not in the class anymore.

81
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,520
He's not in the class anymore.

82
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
What's wrong with him?

83
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
Nothing.

84
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,520
I just want to know the situation.

85
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
By the way, Mr. Zhang.

86
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Do you have a ticket to Zhu Chang'an?

87
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
Yes, I'll give it to you.

88
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Okay.

89
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Thank you.

90
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,520
Mr. Zhang, your hand...

91
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,520
When you were repairing the car, you took the oil off.

92
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,520
It's really hard to wash the oil.

93
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,520
Yes.

94
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
You were repairing the car when you were fine.

95
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
Yes.

96
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,520
I got a small problem myself.

97
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Mr. Zhang, if you can,

98
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
can I take this away?

99
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
Sure.

100
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,520
Okay.

101
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Thank you.

102
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Okay.

103
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Thank you for your cooperation today.

104
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
If you need anything,

105
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
just contact us.

106
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,520
Okay.

107
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
If your daughter has anything to do with the study,

108
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
you can come to me at any time.

109
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,520
Sure.

110
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Bye.

111
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
Mr. Zhang,

112
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
you don't have eyes.

113
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
You look quite unfamiliar.

114
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
Mr. Zhang,

115
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
you're here.

116
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
I'm here to see you.

00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520

I'm here to see you.

121
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
I'm here to see you.

122
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,520
I'm here to see you.

123
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
I'm here to see you.

124
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
I'm here to see you.

125
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,520
I'm here to see you.

126
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm here to see you.

127
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
I'm here to see you.

128
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
I'm here to see you.

129
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
I'm here to see you.

130
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
I'm here to see you.

131
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
I'm here to see you.

132
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
I'm here to see you.

133
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
I'm here to see you.

134
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
I'm here to see you.

135
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
I'm here to see you.

136
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
I'm here to see you.

137
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
I'm here to see you.

138
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
I'm here to see you.

139
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
I'm here to see you.

140
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,520
I'm here to see you.

141
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
The police told me

142
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
Sel Japanese suspects me.

143
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
He would lure me to the rot.

144
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
I can't Spearham.

145
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
Why did you lie to me?

146
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Tell the police.

147
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,520
I want to start over.

148
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,520
Like my dad wanted.

149
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Do you want to call the police?

150
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
I want to see my dad.

151
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
I don't want to.

152
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
They can't die in vain.

153
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
What's the case?

154
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Zhang Dongsheng's father-in-law.

155
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Do you think he's in trouble?

156
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Take back the case of Xu Jing.

157
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
Check if he has any negative medicine in his liver.

158
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
Negative medicine?

159
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
A kind of sugar-free medicine.

160
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
It's not necessary to take it as a blood sugar.

161
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
And...

162
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
Where are you going to get the police?

163
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Take back the surveillance footage of the police.

164
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
Okay.

165
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Mr. Zhang.

166
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,520
I only live in Changyang.

167
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
How did you come out?

168
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,520
Tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock.

169
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
I'll wait for you at the right lane.

170
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Why should I listen to you?

171
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
Have you forgotten?

172
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,520
The postcard is still with me.

173
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
I understand.

174
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
See you tomorrow.

175
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
See you tomorrow.

176
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
I'll see you tomorrow.

177
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
See you.

178
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Is it good?

179
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,520
Slow down.

180
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
One time.

181
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Slow down.

182
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
Mom.

183
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
I've got the result.

184
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
I'm the first one again.

185
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Aren't you happy?

186
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
I'm happy.

187
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Mom.

188
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
I'll be your proud.

189
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
Mom.

190
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Captain Ye.

191
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,520
We've found him.

192
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Find Zhu Changyang.

193
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520
We'll find him right away.

194
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
I'm here.

195
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Where are you?

196
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
You've been walking with your eyes closed.

197
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
You can see me.

198
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Okay.

199
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Is Yan Yang here?

200
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Is he ready?

201
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,520
What's he ready for?

202
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
He's ready to catch me.

203
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,520
You're your dad's good son.

204
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Don't you want to avenge him?

205
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
No, you're my dad.

206
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
It's all because of you.

207
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Because of me?

208
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
If you're not happy,

209
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
they won't die.

210
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
I won't go to the capital either.

211
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,520
Zhu Changyang.

212
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
I don't know what you're here for.

213
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Then why are you here?

214
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
I want to help you.

215
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
I bought the food.

216
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
I just got in.

217
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
The bag just dropped in.

218
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
I thought I dropped something on the floor.

219
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Otherwise, I would have come out and looked at it.

220
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
I didn't see anyone.

221
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,520
I thought I was going to fall.

222
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
I was going to fall.

223
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
I was going to fall.

224
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
I was going to fall.

225
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
I was going to fall.

226
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
I was going to fall.

227
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,520
I was going to fall.

228
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
I tried getting along with people...

229
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
and I got into trouble.

230
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
It's so much!

231
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,520
I'm vitamin.

232
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
You're all a hope.

233
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
I knew this whole time.

234
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
Don't tell anyone!

235
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
Let me help you!

236
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,400
Be Libya,

237
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Kill them.

238
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,920
But the evidence is gone.

239
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,560
I can't let them die.

240
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,760
I can't let you be my guardian.

241
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,400
Thank you for your trust.

242
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,400
Yan Liang.

243
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Yan Liang is dead.

244
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Come on.

245
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Let's do it.

246
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
Come on.

247
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,200
I'll avenge your father.

248
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
Yan Liang.

249
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
It's good.

250
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,000
It's a little bit sweet.

251
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Come on.

252
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Come on.

253
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Chao Yang.

254
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
You're a coward.

255
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,800
You can't escape if you kill him.

256
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Yan Liang.

257
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,800
I did the last thing.

258
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,000
I just opened the door for you.

259
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,800
Come on.

260
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Go find Yang.

261
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,800
I killed your father.

262
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,600
You shouldn't have killed my father.

263
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yan Liang.

264
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Chao Yang.

265
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Don't come in.

266
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,000
Kill me.

267
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,800
I've been killed.

268
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,000
You can't escape.

269
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,800
I won't kill you.

270
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,800
I'll let you live.

271
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,800
I'll live like me.

272
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
Hello?

273
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,000
Uncle Yizhi.

274
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,800
Yizhi.

275
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Sie lynching my sister.

276
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,200
I've sent her to the hospital.

277
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Don't surf it up anymore.

278
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,560
Good.

279
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,160
Instructor.

280
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,400
The police are almost there.

281
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,280
Fang Yang, come here!

282
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,320
Fang Yang, come here!

283
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,200
Don't move.

284
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,960
Be careful.

285
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,000
Put down the knife.

286
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,360
We'll shoot if you take him away.

287
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,600
You can trust Tong Hua.

288
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,240
Before you left,

289
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,400
you might have done it somewhere else.

290
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,720
Stop, stop!

291
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,360
Here,

292
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,360
hide under the fence.

293
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,400
Find the city.

294
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,720
Here.

295
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,600
Take the bloodba immerser out.

296
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:20,800
Play with me,

297
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
The first day of the Chinese elementary school

298
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
I believe everyone has gone through a difficult time

299
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Because the children want to play a song

300
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
From the children's group performance

301
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Little white

302
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Little white

303
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Little white

304
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
Little white

305
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Little white

306
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,800
Little white

307
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Little white

308
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Little white

309
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Little white

310
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Little white

311
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Little white

312
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Little white

313
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,800
Look, that fake ID card is here

314
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
Don't put it there

315
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
I don't have any more

316
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
Dear teachers

317
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Dear classmates

318
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
My school's student rate

319
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,800
Has been rising

320
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
The world is good

321
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
This

322
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Can't leave

323
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,800
The only teacher

324
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
The only student

325
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Work hard and hard

326
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
The first day of the Chinese elementary school

327
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Will begin

328
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
From now on

329
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
After the major adjustment

330
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,800
I will be able to use

331
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
More full

332
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,800
The spirit state

333
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
The new challenge

334
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
One year in Yichun

335
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
One day in Yichun

336
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
A good group

337
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
Is the result

338
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
Half of it

339
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Half of it

340
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Students

341
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,800
No matter how much you go

342
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,800
Remember the high achievement

343
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
No matter how much you are satisfied

344
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
Are you satisfied

345
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
Or not

346
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
I hope you can

347
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
Hold on to the new beginning

348
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,800
New start

349
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,800
The new level of slow down

350
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
The children's pulse

351
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Run away

352
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
As long as we have the support

353
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Can tell

354
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Six thousand flowers

355
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
Yichun

356
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Our sweat

357
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Is not lost

358
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
I am in the future

359
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800

360
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,800
The future

361
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
The future

362
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,800

365
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
Next week's surgery

366
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
Do you want me to take you to the harem

367
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Thank you, old Chen

368
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,800

Want to have a dream

380
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,800
Only you are really strong

381

Can help others

382
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800

Do you think it's okay

Write this letter

00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Want to say thanks to you

00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,800
Thanks when you were the person

414
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
You and brother Yuan great help

415
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,960
I thought so too.

416
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,680
So I hope we will always be best friends.

417
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,720
After my parents left,

418
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,000
I haven't laughed for a long time.

419
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,640
I can laugh happily

420
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,360
when I meet you.

421
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,640
I know

422
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,760
that our future

423
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,680
has caused you a lot of trouble.

424
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,520
You and Brother Yan Lang did

425
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,160
a lot of things you don't want to do for me.

426
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,800
I know how much you love your parents.

427
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,520
I'm afraid that because of these things,

428
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,640
they will lose them.

429
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,920
So

430
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,920
I want to tell you

431
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,520
this letter.

432
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,200
I never mentioned

433
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
the thing about the boy.

434
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,240
I won't tell anyone.

435
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,320
I will always keep this secret for you.

436
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,920
But I still hope

437
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,200
that one day you can say it out bravely.

438
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,240
Because only that

439
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,720
will start over again.

440
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,040
Am I right?

441
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,080
Granny.

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,800
He fell asleep.

443
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,880
Where was Zhu Jing Jing standing?

444
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,800
she couldn't surprise her parents near the hill,

445
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160

446
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,560

452
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:25,940

453
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,820
