1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Okay, forget it

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,200
Thanks

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,740
I love you

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:17,880
It's okay

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,340
Be good

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,420
It's okay

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,600
Keep me company

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,340
People are in love

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,840
You will look neat

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,600
customized.

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,100
That was great.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,120
Stay possibility.

13
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

14
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

15
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

16
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

17
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

18
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

19
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

20
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

21
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

22
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

23
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

24
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

25
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

26
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

27
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

28
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

29
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

30
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

31
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

32
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,840
I'm not afraid of the wind

33
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:50,840
my sweet

34
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,840
There is no end

35
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,720
Let's go back first. Don't make trouble. Okay?

36
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,640
I understand why he appeared in the young man's palace.

37
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,720
Can you really say that? How many hundred people still can be the young man's palace?

38
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
They are all the murderer!

39
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,240
We can follow your clues and continue to investigate.

40
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,640
Let's go back first.

41
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,920
Yes.

42
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,480
You guys asked me to come here to see the surveillance.

43
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,440
I saw it too. I found the murderer for you.

44
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,840
Why didn't you go catch him?

45
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,160
We have evidence to prove it.

46
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,920
We didn't say we can catch him.

47
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Isn't the evidence very obvious? Look.

48
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,400
Jin Jin just died. He just ran out.

49
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,760
Isn't this already clear?

50
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,560
Can't you explain it?

51
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,480
Don't make trouble for the police.

52
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,920
Don't give evidence. Okay?

53
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,080
Let the police investigate.

54
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,720
Yu Le.

55
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,040
Director Zhu.

56
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,840
Director Liu.

57
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,520
It's okay.

59
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,920
Can't you understand that Jin Jin?

60
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,000
But your wife is not only not able to solve the problem,

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
but also delaying our case.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Before Zhu Shaoyang appeared in the young man's palace,

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,600
we already found him before we saw him.

64
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,560
And we already asked him.

65
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Officer Ye, how did the police find out?

66
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,920
Don't worry. They are still investigating.

67
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,800
I'm not going to let my son live. He's not going to be the murderer.

68
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm begging you.

69
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,640
He's only six years old.

70
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,520
He can't just die like this.

71
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,120
Because he wants to catch the murderer.

72
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,880
You have to believe Officer Ye.

73
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,400
They must have wanted to find the murderer.

74
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,520
Director Zhu, we definitely won't find the murderer.

75
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,920
You go back and rest.

76
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,720
We'll talk when we have news. Okay?

77
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
Let's go back first.

78
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,440
I'm sorry.

79
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,840
The criminal is not that hard to deal with.

80
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,720
When you become a parent, you'll understand.

81
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,720
A'Zhi, take a close-up.

82
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,520
Okay.

83
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,240
Chaoyang.

84
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,000
Mom.

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,960
What's wrong?

86
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,880
Go buy some soy sauce for mom.

87
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,800
Okay.

88
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,520
Bring the trash here.

89
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,960
Okay.

90
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,680
Are you all right?

91
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,560
Is the garbage box empty?

92
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,360
Take the garbage upstairs.

93
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,200
We'll ask mom later.

94
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,520
Chaoyang.

95
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
in Shang Nian Palace?

96
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,720
I...

97
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,200
I went to Shang Nian Palace last night

98
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,640
to help you attend the class.

99
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,160
I only knew

100
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,240
what happened to Jingjing.

101
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,360
Don't be afraid.

102
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,960
I just wanted to ask you

103
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,200
if you know anything.

104
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,120
Do you have any hidden secrets?

105
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,880
You can tell me the truth.

106
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
It's not me.

107
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
It's not you.

108
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,280
What is it?

109
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,280
I... I went to buy something.

110
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,480
I want to see you in Shang Nian Palace.

111
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,280
Zhu Chaoyang!

112
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,480
Did you kill Jingjing?

113
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
No, I didn't.

114
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,880
I didn't.

115
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,280
No, I didn't kill her.

116
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,880
Stop!

117
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
Stop!

118
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
No!

119
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,480
Come here!

120
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,480
It's none of my business.

121
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Why are you running?

122
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,880
Let go of me!

123
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:46,880
Get up!

124
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,880
Get up!

125
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,080
Get up!

126
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,680
Go!

127
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,880
Come with me!

128
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,880
Get up!

129
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Chief!

130
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Don't play with me!

131
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
Hurry and get me a fight!

132
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
I'm not playing with you!

133
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Chief!

134
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
What are you talking about?

135
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,880
Get out of the way!

136
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Do you hear me?

137
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Get out of the way!

138
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
What are you doing?

139
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Let go of me!

140
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
Let go of me!

141
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Chaoyang!

142
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Are you okay?

143
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Get up!

144
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
What are you doing?

145
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
Zong Zhihong!

146
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Your son is a murderer!

147
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
Don't be a bloody bastard!

148
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
How can you say he's a murderer?

149
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
He was in Shang Nian Palace that day.

150
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
He said he didn't see Jingjing.

151
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,880
He lied to me.

152
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,880
There are so many children in Shang Nian Palace.

153
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
Are all brothers a murderer?

154
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,880
I told him to go.

155
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
I told him to take him to the hospital.

156
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
He's your son, right?

157
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,880
No wonder you took your son to the hospital with you.

158
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
You're a murderer, right?

159
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,880
You're your son who killed my daughter, right?

160
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
You're crazy!

161
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Let's go!

162
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
You're not allowed to go.

163
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,880
Zong Zhihong,

164
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
where were you that day?

165
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
If I had a problem,

166
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
the police would come to ask me.

167
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
It's not your fault!

168
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
I can't get into the sea!

169
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm working!

170
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Move aside!

171
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Get up!

172
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
You're a thief!

173
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,880
Get up!

174
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Get up!

175
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Get up!

176
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Get up!

177
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Get up!

178
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Get up!

179
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
Get up!

180
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Get up!

181
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Get up!

182
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Get up!

183
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
Get up!

184
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Get up!

185
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
Get up!

186
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
Stop!

187
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Stop!

188
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
Where's the police?

189
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,880
He's a murderer!

190
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,880
They killed my daughter!

191
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,880
Stop!

192
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
Where's the police?

193
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
Get out of here!

194
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Get out!

195
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
You're a murderer!

196
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
I've told you two to go.

197
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
You're a thief!

198
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
Get out!

199
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
Thank you.

200
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Does it still hurt?

201
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,880
Yes.

202
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Mom.

203
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
You fell from there.

204
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,880
I'm fine.

205
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Mom.

206
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,880
It was...

208
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,880
It's not your fault.

209
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,880
It's not your fault.

210
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,080
I didn't protect you well.

211
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,880
Mom, what if he comes back and I do something?

212
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,880
We're not afraid of him, right?

213
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,880
I'm sorry.

214
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,880
I don't want to be a police officer next year.

215
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,280
I want to find a job near my home.

216
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
I can take care of you.

217
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,480
Mom,

218
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,480
I can take care of myself.

219
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,440
Mom,

220
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
I can't go there in this condition.

221
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,200
I didn't think you were okay at first.

222
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,680
My little brother is here.

223
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,480
Listen,

224
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,520
I'm in the worst�들��정 Father.

225
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:44,920
Don't help me.

226
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,760
I need you.

227
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,400
I'm ready to die.

228
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,160
Give all of the money my sister allowed us toburden and crime.

229
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,880
Give it back.

230
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,560
Thief Simpsons

231
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,420
Changyang

232
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,020
Mom

233
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,060
I want to be alone

234
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm not afraid to run away Roping about promises

235
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,100
I'm afraid there will be later

236
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,020
I'm afraid

237
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,120
Today you're eating the soup

238
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,440
Today your麵 are glowy

239
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,340
Your에as is alike

240
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,720
Don't fight, dear.

241
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,640
Good luck.

242
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,120
Don't be 곳less anymore.

243
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,640
Yongping,

244
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,060
Chaoyang surely has a problem.

245
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,200
Wang Yao,

246
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,660
let's do something else.

247
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,340
Zhu Chaoyang's eyes.

248
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:28,340
He always hides my eyes.

249
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,340
Do you know that?

250
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,340
Why doesn't he dare to look at me?

251
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,340
It means he has a ghost in his heart.

252
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,340
He must have hidden something.

253
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,340
Then tell me.

254
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,340
What's the reason for him to kill his sister?

255
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,340
Because of jealousy.

256
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,340
I'm sorry.

257
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,340
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,340
Pu Pu.

259
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
I'm sorry.

260
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,340
I'm sorry.

261
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,340
Pu Pu.

262
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,340
Where is the dream?

263
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,340
I'm in the six mountains.

264
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,340
I think I live in Jingye.

265
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,340
Don't you dare to look at me.

266
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,340
You're always asking for it.

267
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,340
He will come back to you later.

268
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,340
Don't think about it.

269
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,340
Brother Yangyang.

270
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,340
I feel that we have let them down too much.

271
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,340
I used to

272
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,340
take my mom to burn the paper every year.

273
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,340
When she burned the paper,

274
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,340
my dad would let me talk to my mom.

275
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,300
Tell my mom.

276
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,060
She said she could hear me at that time.

277
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,300
Let's go to Liu Fengshan in a few days.

278
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,940
Tell them about the paper.

279
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,140
Tell them about it.

280
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,500
Go to sleep.

281
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,820
I have a problem.

282
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,660
Is that anวaw?

283
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,740
I see.

284
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,100
Yes, you are repeated素杂既然 resting at home,

285
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,540
we'll hire you again in 10 days.

286
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,020
Inside the Jiangfa building below the V io apartment on the proposed three years ago,

287
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,700
we'd pay you a ticket to quality of rent.

288
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,380
Hurry up!

289
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,340
I'm not afraid of being honest with you.

290
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,340
I'm the only one who thinks so.

291
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,340
I'm not going to be ugly if I'm against you.

292
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,340
Thank you.

293
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,340
I've been thinking about you for so many times.

294
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
I understand.

295
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,340
I'll call you later.

296
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,340
You're joking.

297
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,340
You don't see your family as workers.

298
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,340
I don't have any business.

299
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,340
What do I do?

300
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,340
I'm a farmer.

301
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,340
I'm a farmer.

302
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,340
I'm a farmer.

303
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,340
Here's the money, Paifang.

304
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,340
Miss Hong, you're here.

305
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,340
What are you doing?

306
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,340
I'm on the phone.

307
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,340
Thank you.

308
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,340
I'm afraid your son will be in trouble.

309
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,340
Are you okay?

310
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,340
How could I be okay?

311
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,340
I'm fine.

312
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,340
I'm fine.

313
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,340
I'm fine.

314
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,340
I'm fine.

315
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,340
I'm fine.

316
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,340
I'm fine.

317
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,340
I'm fine.

318
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,340
I'm fine.

319
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,340
I'm fine.

320
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,340
I'm fine.

321
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,340
I'm fine.

322
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,340
I'm fine.

323
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,340
He's got a headache.

324
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,340
Zhou Yongping,

325
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,340
after we divorced,

326
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
I didn't bother you.

327
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,340
You two lost your child.

328
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,340
I feel very bad.

329
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,340
I hope you remember.

330
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,340
You still have a son.

331
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,340
It's on you.

332
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,340
Chaoyang's my son.

333
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,340
I'm fine with it.

334
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,340
I'll go and have a look at him two days later.

335
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,340
How many days is it the next day?

336
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,640
Wang Yaorawso מ away from me so often all day.

337
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,340
I have to watch him.

338
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,840
I'll call you when he's better.

339
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,840
Anyway, it's more important than your son.

340
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,340
If Chao didn't betray you, that's enough.

341
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,840
You tell Wang Yao.

342
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,540
If he harasses my son again,

343
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,840
I'll fight with him.

344
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
Go.

345
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,340
Go.

346
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,340
Let's go.

347
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,340
Go.

348
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,340
Go.

349
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,340
We'll go to Shao Nian Palace this afternoon.

350
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,340
Let's check the woman who appeared on the TV.

351
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,340
Every class, every floor.

352
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,340
Let's take a look.

353
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,340
Officer Ye, sorry to disturb you.

354
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,340
Did the DNA test result come out today?

355
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,340
Miss Wang, it's like this.

356
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,340
Once there's a new progress, I'll inform you immediately.

357
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,340
You don't need to run here for three days and two days.

358
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,340
Thank you.

359
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,340
Is this pig's head?

360
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,340
Is it him?

361
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,340
The DNA test result is my female.

362
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,340
Except for the pig's head, it might be him.

363
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,340
That's Zhou Xun Hong.

364
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,340
It must be him.

365
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,340
You're not going to the bathroom?

366
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,340
Our kid, please go.

367
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,340
Did you mess with me?

368
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,340
Okay, okay.

369
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,340
You see Where are your parents?

370
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,340
You were hurt while safer than me being in the baby開始.

371
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,340
This IS theazioni reinstatement.

372
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,340
Do you understand?

373
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,340
Let look after him.

374
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,340
I believe you.

375
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,060
Well...

376
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,060
We're having breakfast. We're having breakfast.

377
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,260
Dad, why don't you have any sense of crisis?

378
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,060
If I don't study, I can't even keep the second place in college.

379
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,060
Yes, yes, yes.

380
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,900
Then, is the best way to study is to live in Shanghai?

381
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,180
Don't ask me directly. You've already opened a family meeting.

382
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,900
Then, Dad, I have a question for you.

383
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,620
If you don't understand the question, will you ask Zhu Shaoyang?

384
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,940
No. We don't even have anyone to talk to.

385
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,300
Why?

386
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,020
We know that he's lying on the table every day. He's not playing with anyone.

387
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,780
He's never even seen the Pearl Princess.

388
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,300
He doesn't even know the Pearl Princess?

389
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,540
Then, is Zhu Shaoyang his best friend?

390
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:12,140
I don't know. He doesn't seem to have any friends.

391
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,140
Okay.

392
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,140
Forget it. Let's go.

393
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,140
Okay.

394
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,540
Why are you here so late? I thought you weren't home.

395
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,340
I didn't hear you.

396
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,340
Don't be angry.

397
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,940
How did you get to see me?

398
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,340
Just forgive him. He didn't mean to lose his camera.

399
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,940
I'm not angry because of you.

400
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,980
Go and get again

401
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,140
Go get again

402
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,540
Got again

403
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,900
How's it going? Is yet cold?

404
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,460
No, it's already completely wiped out.

405
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,220
Don't behear it. Let's go have a look.

406
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,540
The first one is this one, the third one is this one.

407
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
I can't take it out.

408
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
Let's try again.

409
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
Look.

410
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
You take it as a gift.

411
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,540
I'm busy.

412
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,540
I'm busy.

413
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,540
I'm busy.

414
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,540
I'm busy.

415
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,540
I'm busy.

416
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,540
I'm busy.

417
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,540
I'm busy.

418
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,540
I'm busy.

419
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,540
I'm busy.

420
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,540
Good.

421
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
Brother Chang.

422
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,540
What if Wang Yao comes to you again?

423
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,540
Why are you afraid of her?

424
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,540
If she comes again,

425
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,540
she'll be so mad.

426
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,540
Here's the last piece.

427
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,540
Who do you want?

428
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,540
Can I forgive you?

429
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,540
I was wrong when I was in my last year.

430
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,540
I feel sorry for her.

431
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,540
I did it for Chaoyang last time.

432
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,540
I did it last time too.

433
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,540
Here's a pack of it.

434
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,540
Yueniang.

435
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,540
Let's go get the camera back together.

436
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,540
Let's go.

437
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,540
Let me take a photo.

438
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,540
Let's go.

439
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
Who are you?

440
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,540
I'm not in a hurry.

441
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,540
Can you help me?

442
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,540
Are you leaving?

443
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
Where's your parents?

444
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,540
I was with them just now.

445
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
They're gone.

446
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,540
Don't cry.

447
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,540
Don't cry.

448
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,540
Grandpa will go to you.

449
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,540
Don't cry.

450
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,540
Here.

451
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,540
Come on.

452
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,540
Okay.

453
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,540
Grandma, open the door.

454
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
Chen, open the door.

455
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,540
What are you doing?

456
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,540
Chen.

457
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,540
Grandpa is not here.

458
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,540
I'll find a camera for you.

459
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,540
What are you doing?

460
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
I'm not here.

461
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,540
I'm not here.

462
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,540
Let's go.

463
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,540
Grandpa.

464
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,540
You're crying.

465
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,540
Grandpa.

466
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
Grandpa.

467
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,540
Grandpa.

468
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,540
Grandpa.

469
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,540
Grandpa.

470
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Grandpa.

471
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,540
Grandpa.

472
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,540
Let's go out.

473
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,540
Grandpa.

474
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,540
I think I know where we are.

475
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,540
Where?

476
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,540
Just...

477
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,540
There.

478
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,540
We just came from there.

479
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,540
I just got up.

480
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,540
Yue Po.

481
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
Brother.

482
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,540
You're big brother.

483
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,540
I've been looking for him for a long time.

484
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540
I just walked in the wrong direction.

485
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,540
This is the man who took me to this place.

486
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,540
Thank you, Grandpa.

487
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
Thank you, Grandpa.

488
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,540
Is that okay?

489
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,540
Then take him home.

490
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,540
Grandpa, goodbye.

491
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,540
Goodbye.

492
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,540
Take care next time.

493
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,540
Don't lose him.

494
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,540
Okay.

495
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Here.

496
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:37,080
The

497
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
Here.

498
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,540
Have a taste.

499
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
No.

500
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,540
What is all this?

501
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,540
Don't eat.

502
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,540
Eat some green onion.

503
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,540
What's wrong with fat?

504
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,540
You saw that there was no oil in the oil yesterday.

505
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
The two who made the rinses.

506
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,540
That woman is fat too.

507
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,540
That man is cold and light.

508
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,540
He's like a baby.

509
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,540
Don't you know?

510
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,540
He's a thief.

511
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,540
Why are you still so jealous?

512
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,540
The next week's food delivery is coming out.

513
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,540
You're out.

514
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,540
The next week's food delivery is coming out.

515
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,540
Why are you so jealous?

516
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,540
I'll tell the director later.

517
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,540
It's okay.

518
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
She's a good girl.

519
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,540
You can help her.

520
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,540
Don't call her.

521
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,540
I'm a mother.

522
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,540
But my son is not an orphan.

523
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,540
Hello, how do you get in the car?

524
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,540
The left of the door is the car. The right is the car.

525
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
Thank you.

526
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,540
What are you doing again?

527
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,540
Zhou Chenghong, I'm here to tell you.

528
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,540
Okay, go.

529
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,540
The police have found the evidence.

530
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,540
They found your DNA on Jin Jin.

531
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,540
You can't escape.

532
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,540
What are you doing?

533
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,540
Don't bother me with my work.

534
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,540
What are you hiding from me?

535
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,540
You're so heartless.

536
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,540
Your daughter died because I'm so in love with you.

537
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,540
If you suspect me, you can go to the police.

538
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,540
I'm not a murderer.

539
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,540
Hello, I'm the director of the police station.

540
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,540
Do you have anything to say to my office?

541
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,540
Zhou Chenghong, when Jin Jin was in trouble,

542
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,540
where were you?

543
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,540
He was in the unit of duty.

544
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,540
I can prove it.

545
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,540
Right?

546
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,540
I'll go out now.

547
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,540
If you still love us, we'll call the police.

548
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,540
Zhou Chenghong, you can't escape.

549
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,540
I'm not a murderer.

550
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,540
I'm a murderer.

551
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,540
You can't escape.

552
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,540
I'll find out.

553
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,540
You're the only one?

554
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,540
Let's start.

555
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,540
Bring it to Chaoyang.

556
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,540
Thank you.

557
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
Do you want some water?

558
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,540
No.

559
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,540
That woman is really amazing.

560
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,540
She'll come again next time.

561
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,540
See how I'll scold her.

562
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,540
Let's go to the play together next Saturday.

563
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,540
Foreigners do it.

564
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,540
It's good.

565
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,540
Many friends' children are interested in it.

566
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,540
Did you tell Chaoyang?

567
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,540
The play?

568
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,540
No.

569
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,540
Don't buy fruits.

570
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,540
She doesn't like it.

571
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
What's wrong?

572
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,540
Did I do something wrong?

573
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,540
Don't see me again.

574
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,540
What's wrong?

575
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,540
We're good friends.

576
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,540
Chaoyang and you really need someone to take care of you.

577
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,540
Don't keep Chaoyang.

578
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,540
I'm not a murderer.

579
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,540
I'm not a murderer.

580
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,540
Don't keep Chaoyang.

581
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,540
I'm sorry.

582
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,540
I can take care of her.

583
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,540
I don't need someone else.

584
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,540
Actually, we're open now.

585
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,540
It's nothing.

586
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,540
Before she becomes a person,

587
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,540
I don't want to think about it.

588
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,540
Where did you get the phone?

589
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,540
I borrowed it.

590
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,540
I want to see if Li Wen can find my dad's clue.

591
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,540
I'll give it back when I find my dad.

592
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,540
I'm looking forward to it.

593
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,540
The video is still here.

594
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,540
I think I've never seen it.

595
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,540
Or the police will have caught it.

596
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,540
Don't look at the picture.

597
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,540
If you don't look, you'll be dead.

598
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,540
Chaoyang,

599
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,540
let's go to the mountain tomorrow.

600
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,540
Why?

601
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,540
Did my parents go crazy?

602
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,540
I want to get some paper.

603
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,540
Don't look for your parents again.

604
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,540
Okay.

605
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,540
Hello.

606
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,540
Who are you looking for?

607
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,540
I lost a wallet when I was climbing the mountain.

608
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,540
It was picked up by your staff.

609
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,540
I came to thank him today.

610
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,540
Do you remember his name?

611
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,540
I'm sorry. I forgot.

612
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,540
I didn't ask his name.

613
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,540
Do you remember which day you lost the wallet?

614
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,540
Friday.

615
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,540
Friday?

616
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,540
I was the one who lost it.

617
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,540
I didn't hear anyone lose the wallet.

618
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,540
It was him.

619
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,540
Did he come first?

620
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,540
No.

621
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,540
He didn't lose the wallet.

622
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:47,540
Are you sure it was the wallet you lost on Friday?

623
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
I'm sure.

624
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,540
You might have remembered it wrongly.

625
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,540
He didn't lose his wallet this month.

626
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,540
I'm sorry.

627
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,540
Thank you.

628
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,540
It's okay.

629
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,540
Who is it?

630
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,540
He's doing a good thing.

631
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:27,540
Grandma.

632
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,540
Don't worry.

633
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,540
We won't let that murderer go.

634
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,540
Don't look for your parents again.

635
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,540
He's also sick for his brother.

636
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,540
When his brother is well,

637
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,540
I'll definitely avenge you.

638
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,540
Hello.

639
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,540
Excuse me.

640
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,540
How did the advertising firm leave?

641
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:02,540
We've been walking here.

642
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,540
Thank you.

643
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,540
Sister.

644
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,540
Everyone, please pay attention.

645
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,540
In this area,

646
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,540
there's a murderer.

647
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,540
His name is Zhou Chunhong.

648
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,540
Last Saturday,

649
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,540
Zhou Chunhong killed my daughter

650
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,540
in the Palace of the City.

651
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,540
She was shot.

652
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,540
She was lying.

653
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,540
She was a human.

654
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,540
She was accused of committing crimes with her son.

655
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,540
They don't admit their crimes.

656
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,540
Zhou Chunhong.

657
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,540
The marriage family is not happy.

658
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,540
You're going to kill me.

659
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,540
Every year, he was abandoned by his husband.

660
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,540
He was tortured.

661
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,540
So he was forced to kill my daughter.

662
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,540
Wang Yao, what are you doing?

663
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,540
He pushed her down from the 5th floor.

664
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,540
He was in the office.

665
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,540
He was killed in the scene.

666
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,540
Don't talk to him.

667
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,540
Call the police.

668
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,540
Call the police.

669
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,540
Report.

670
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,540
Call the police.

671
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,540
I saw the police coming.

672
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:17,540
They caught you and me.

673
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,540
And you.

674
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,540
Why did you protect him?

675
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,540
Do you know this is a crime?

676
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,540
Don't talk to him.

677
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,540
Come out.

678
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,540
The head of the district police station

679
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,540
was killed by Zhou Chunhong.

680
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,540
He was in the scene.

681
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,540
Why did you kill him?

682
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,540
Zhou Chunhong was killed

683
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,540
by him.

684
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,540
Wang Yao.

685
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,540
Wang Yao.

686
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,540
What do you want?

687
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,540
What do you want?

688
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,540
I want you to die for my daughter.

689
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,540
Can you?

690
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,540
You didn't kill her.

691
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,540
It's the police.

692
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,540
I don't want you to be

693
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,540
a public figure in my unit.

694
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,540
I don't want you to be a public figure.

695
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,540
My daughter.

696
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,540
My daughter.

697
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,540
Now, you are a public figure.

698
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,540
You can tell me what you want.

699
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,540
I'll kill everyone.

700
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,540
Look at you and your son.

701
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,540
Who are you?

702
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,540
Do you think he is the best

703
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,540
in the first place?

704
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,540
Is he your friend?

705
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,540
He is like you.

706
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,540
He is a heartless,

707
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,540
ugly and murderous criminal.

708
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,540
You.

709
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,540
Wang Yao.

710
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,540
My son is my son.

711
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,540
He is my son.

712
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,540
He is my son.

713
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,540
You can't say that.

714
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,540
Come out.

715
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,540
You want to kill Chang Yu, right?

716
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,540
Come out.

717
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,540
Come out and kill me.

718
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,540
Come out.

719
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,540
You dare to do that?

720
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,540
You dare to do that?

721
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,540
You are different from me.

722
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,540
I'm not as evil as you.

723
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,540
If I kill you,

724
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,540
can my daughter live?

725
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,540
I'll make you die.

726
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,540
Zhou Chunhong.

727
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,540
Don't do that.

728
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,540
I've done enough.

729
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,540
I'll kill her.

730
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,540
I'm a human.

731
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,540
I won't kill her.

732
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,540
She is a liar.

733
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,540
She is a liar.

734
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,540
She is a liar.

735
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,500
Kang Lu.

736
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,900
This is my work.

737
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,140
You work again.

738
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,420
So for my place,

739
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,660
you can always use my rules.

740
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,660
So tomorrow is the process.

741
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,840
Martial performance.

742
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,400
Now you will be part of the battle.

743
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,400
I didn't come to the police station to work.

744
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,000
Because I'm in the Sixth Wind Ice House,

745
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
I'm with Director Ma.

746
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,600
I've already told the police about this.

747
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,800
If you still don't believe me,

748
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,000
you can go and check the opening records yourself.

749
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,200
There's also a monitoring.

750
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,400
Find me.

751
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,800
Find me.

752
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,400
How is it?

753
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,200
Do you still want to hear other details?

754
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,800

00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,400
The Sixth Wind Ice House

756
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,400
The Sixth Wind Ice House

757
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
The Sixth Wind Ice House

Another world's things

766
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,400
The world's things
