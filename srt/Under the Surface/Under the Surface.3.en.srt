1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,680
Xiaoxiao.

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,240
Tell me.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,530
What should I do?

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,400
Rely on yourself.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,540
See the truth clearly.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,480
Use your own hands

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,560
to get justice for Hong Ming.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,320
As long as I can get justice for Hong Ming,

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,210
I'm willing to do anything.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,370
If Xiangyang can climb up as a son-in-law,

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,560
we can use weapons he can't resist.

12
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,770
His ideal woman.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,730
The beauty trap.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,280
Fight fire

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,080
with fire.

16
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,640
Zhiqiu, you're back, right?

17
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,640
Answer my call quickly.

18
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,900
Please answer my call!

19
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,280
Zhiqiu, answer my call.

20
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,760
Mr. Xiang.

21
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,200
Yes?

22
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
Mr. Xiang, I heard

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,380
that Zhiqiu has returned to China. Is that true?

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
She just got back.

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Then where is she?

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,320
Tell me.

27
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
She's not answering any of my calls.

28
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,140
Why don't you text her?

29
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,200
I...

30
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,280
Found nothing.

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,840
Sorry for the trouble yesterday.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
Rachel has been Ye Zhiqiu's agent for many years.

33
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,160
She knows Ye Zhiqiu too well.

34
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,480
Xiangyang is easy to fool.

35
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,810
Rachel won't be so easy.

36
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,320
You need to look more into Ye Zhiqiu's stuff.

37
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,780
Learn more about her life.

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,500
Don't give yourself away in front of Rachel.

39
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,340
We must find a way to get rid of Rachel.

40
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,400
This is

41
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,570
Xiaoxiao, look.

42
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,050
This is their contract.

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,440
What is it?

44
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Their contract

45
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,640
was signed for 10 years.

46
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,200
So?

47
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,240
It's about to expire.

48
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,610
I know what to do now.

49
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,890
What are you going to do?

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
Since Rachel is the biggest variable

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,240
in our plan,

52
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,690
we need to clear the obstacles.

53
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,060
Partners for ten years

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,500
should part on good terms.

55
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
So narcissistic.

56
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,610
Look at this.

57
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,209
This is a love letter from Xiangyang to Ye Zhiqiu.

58
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,600
It's so cheesy.

59
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,580
He's truly a romantic held back by business.

60
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,480
No wonder Ye Zhiqiu fell for him.

61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,970
With his deeply romantic persona,

62
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,040
what woman could resist?

63
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,540
What about you?

64
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,610
Would you also be unable to resist?

65
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,240
I'm different from other women.

66
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,930
I'm going in with a purpose.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,600
I must resist.

68
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,940
Remember what you said today.

69
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,250
Xiangyang is good at confusing people's hearts.

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,980
Since Xiangyang likes to play romantic,

71
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,440
I'll use this poem to make him lose his mind.

72
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,040
Let him know

73
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,850
that favoritism

74
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,600
comes with a price.

75
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,560
I want to hold a retirement press conference soon.

76
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,020
Alright, I'll arrange it.

77
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,320
Rachel, I'm back.

78
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,680
Zhiqiu,

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,880
where are you?

80
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,210
Let's meet tomorrow

81
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,330
to discuss work.

82
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
Is work really

83
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,720
all we have to talk about?

84
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,280
Mr. Xu,

85
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,200
I have to take your call no matter how busy I am,

86
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,040
right?

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,880
I have to take it regardless of money.

88
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,600
Yes, yes.

89
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,160
As you know,

90
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,280
I mortgaged my house

91
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,680
to save the company.

92
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,159
Please help me out, Mr. Xu.

93
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,050
Okay, thank you, thank you.

94
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,450
[QUYUE Production]

95
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,120
Zhiqiu,

96
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
you're finally back.

97
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,520
Could it be that Sister Zhiqiu is back?

98
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,120
Really?

99
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,280
Seeing the boss in such a good mood,

100
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,140
it must be true.

101
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,760
Zhiqiu really wants to play the female lead in your show.

102
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,120
The shooting schedule is fine.

103
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,250
She's already back.

104
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
I'll arrange a meeting for you two right away.

105
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Okay, thank you.

106
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,520
Miss Qiu, someone is here to see you.

107
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,080
Come in.

108
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,280
Ms. Zhou, hello.

109
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm Ms. Ye Zhiqiu's appointed lawyer.

110
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,930
My name is Zhou Zhiheng.

111
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,800
Lawyer?

112
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,210
Where's Zhiqiu?

113
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,760
Ms. Ye Zhiqiu can't come today,

114
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,760
so I'm representing her.

115
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,000
Can't come?

116
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,890
What's going on?

117
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,120
What could possibly be inconvenient between us?

118
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,480
According to Ms. Ye's request and authorization,

119
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,000
there are some matters

120
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,000
I need to inform you about.

121
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,080
Your cooperation agreement with Ms. Ye

122
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,140
expires this week.

123
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,520
After the agreement expires,

124
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,680
Ms. Ye will no longer renew her contract

125
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,320
with your agency team.

126
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,680
Therefore, your professional relationship

127
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,740
with Ms. Ye is over.

128
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,840
Shut up!

129
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,560
This is the authorization letter signed by Ms. Ye

130
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,620
and her statement.

131
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,800
Are you saying

132
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,560
Zhiqiu won't renew her contract with me?

133
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,120
Yes.

134
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,520
When should we deal with

135
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,680
our contract renewal?

136
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,410
Don't worry,

137
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,240
we've been working together for almost ten years.

138
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,560
Don't we still have six months left?

139
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,290
Get out of my way, I'm in a hurry.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,330
Have you lost your mind?

141
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,560
Ye Zhiqiu and I

142
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,090
have worked together for 10 years.

143
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,920
During these 10 years,

144
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,360
we've spent every day together

145
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,690
through thick and thin.

146
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,080
Before she went abroad, she told me

147
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
she was going to renew our contract.

148
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,440
It's impossible.

149
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,799
She would never abandon me.

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,799
She wouldn't.

151
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,960
According to the previous cooperation agreement,

152
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,840
Ms. Ye Zhiqiu

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,560
has exercised her right not to renew the contract,

154
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,560
effective immediately.

155
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,280
Additionally,

156
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,200
to compensate for her recent absence

157
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,080
and the inconvenience and losses caused to the team,

158
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,120
Ms. Ye Zhiqiu will provide you and the team members

159
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,580
with a compensation plan.

160
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,200
Are you crazy?

161
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,000
What are you talking about?

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
My Ye Zhiqiu,

163
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,380
we've been together for 10 years.

164
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,140
During these 10 years,

165
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,080
she would be nothing without me.

166
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,400
Every movie,

167
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,880
every role,

168
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,560
I fought

169
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,680
desperately to secure them for her.

170
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,520
And it all ends with one simple 'not renewing the contract'?

171
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,120
This is the compensation plan.

172
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,780
It contains the compensation proposal for you.

173
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,960
Bastard!

174
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,240
Is compensation what I want?

175
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,680
Do I need money?

176
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,560
Rachel is terrifying when she gets angry.

177
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,960
You'd better be careful.

178
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,050
Zhiqiu is holding a press conference.

179
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,980
Zhiqiu is having a press conference?

180
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,120
I'm at Ye Zhiqiu's press conference.

181
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,640
Breaking news will be announced shortly.

182
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,360
Outside, it's already packed to capacity.

183
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,690
What are you looking at?

184
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,200
Guess what?

185
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,800
How long will it take for Ye Zhiqiu,

186
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,640
whom we haven't seen for ages, to arrive?

187
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,570
What kind of news will she bring us?

188
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,600
Zhiqiu didn't notify you?

189
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,520
Rachel.

190
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,640
Whatever decision you make,

191
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
I'll support you.

192
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,160
Rachel,

193
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,000
why are you here?

194
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,280
What's wrong with your throat?

195
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,400
I have vocal cord polyps.

196
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,460
I'm still getting treatment.

197
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,960
Why are you here?

198
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,960
It's your press conference.

199
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,500
Your agent should certainly be present.

200
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,360
Let's have

201
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,800
a private talk.

202
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,040
Just say what you want to say.

203
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,400
It's fine.

204
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,490
Whatever you have to say

205
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,620
can be said in front of Xiangyang.

206
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,160
Alright.

207
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,760
Zhiqiu.

208
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,690
We've been together for ten years.

209
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,120
During these ten years,

210
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,400
I've secured resources for you,

211
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,600
scheduled your appointments,

212
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,200
and when you were in trouble,

213
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,000
I was there to protect you.

214
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
I don't know why you want to terminate our contract.

215
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,200
Is it because I scheduled too much work,

216
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,040
or because I interfered with your private life,

217
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,840
or perhaps

218
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,440
someone promised you more freedom?

219
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,040
None of those.

220
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,640
I'm retiring from the industry.

221
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,500
I don't need an agent anymore.

222
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,600
Retiring?

223
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,480
Why?

224
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,520
You're just one step away

225
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,920
from becoming a top star.

226
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,930
As you've heard,

227
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,080
I'm having voice problems,

228
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,720
and my health now...

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,600
While I can still exit gracefully,

230
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,620
I hope you understand.

231
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,280
Okay,

232
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,720
I understand.

233
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,650
Then can we at least reduce your workload?

234
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,880
Rachel.

235
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,850
I'm already in my thirties.

236
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,050
I want to live differently.

237
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,920
Rachel,

238
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
please respect Zhiqiu's decision.

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,520
If you have any difficulties in the future

240
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,580
feel free to ask me.

241
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,120
Zhiqiu.

242
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,090
Over there. Get out.

243
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,960
Everything is ready over there.

244
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,760
You can go now.

245
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,480
Okay.

246
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,130
Let's go.

247
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,240
I'll go ahead.

248
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:49,800
Wait.

249
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,880
Rachel.

250
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,440
Zhiqiu,

251
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,400
do you think retiring from acting is child's play?

252
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,000
Fine.

253
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,320
I'll agree to your terms.

254
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
I can compromise.

255
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,680
I only ask that

256
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,960
you don't throw away our ten years of friendship.

257
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,360
Please, I'm begging you.

258
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,360
Rachel,

259
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,180
thank you for your care and support all these years.

260
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,200
But I also hope

261
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,520
you can respect my decision.

262
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,640
Ye Zhiqiu,

263
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,320
you must give me an explanation.

264
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,840
One that I can believe.

265
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,440
You just successfully fooled Rachel.

266
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,300
You can deceive everyone's eyes.

267
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,680
You are Ye Zhiqiu.

268
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,560
Keep it up,

269
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,240
Ye Zhiqiu.

270
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,650
Something's wrong.

271
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,440
She's acting too strange today.

272
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,410
Why is she being so polite to me?

273
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,480
What's wrong?

274
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,600
The brand owners are inside right now.

275
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,640
A bunch of reporters are sitting there waiting for you.

276
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,800
What are you trying to do?

277
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,720
This is not the time for you to be willful.

278
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,200
I have an appointment today.

279
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,880
You go deal with them.

280
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,520
Wait.

281
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Tell me the truth.

282
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,370
Are you going to see Xiangyang now?

283
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,040
Can you be more sensible?

284
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Your career is on the rise right now.

285
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,200
Do you know how much dirt

286
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,400
Xiangyang has on him?

287
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,120
What if reporters catch you together?

288
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,760
How will they gossip about you?

289
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,320
Can you stop acting like a nagging mother

290
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,960
and going on and on about everything?

291
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,360
Dealing with those reporters,

292
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,400
whether they wait one day or two,

293
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,000
that's your job, okay?

294
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,920
If she wanted to retire

295
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,610
because of health reasons,

296
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,220
she could have told me!

297
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,280
And bringing a lawyer?

298
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,730
No, something's not right.

299
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,920
There must be something wrong here.

300
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,920
Definitely something wrong.
