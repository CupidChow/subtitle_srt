1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,180
What you asked for,

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,960
the resident list of Binjiang Gardens,

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,090
has been sent to you.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,640
The owner of unit 302

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,360
is Xie Yuxuan.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,450
So the person she went to see

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,160
I have an appointment today.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,890
You go deal with the reporters.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,120
after she finished filming

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,560
was

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,460
I'm in unit 402.

12
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,240
Zhou Ruiqiu's medical records

13
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,640
I've already sent them to you.

14
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,770
I've seen the files.

15
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,370
I'll transfer the money to you right away.

16
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,760
Principles of central nervous system depressant interactions

17
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,600
(such as anti-depressants

18
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,329
and failure Q

19
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,920
What?

20
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,320
You actually took the initiative to meet me for once.

21
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,250
Do you finally believe what I said?

22
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,520
It's Zhiqiu who cares about you.

23
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,840
She's finding the best hospital for you

24
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,040
and the best doctors.

25
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,400
Zhiqiu cares about me?

26
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,090
Impossible.

27
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,010
She wouldn't care about me.

28
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,079
She just wants to send me to the hospital for treatment

29
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,440
and lock me up

30
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,960
so no one will know she's an impostor.

31
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,400
Such a clever fake.

32
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,400
Ruiqiu,

33
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,680
you don't deserve

34
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,880
Zhiqiu's concern for you.

35
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,560
She's not concerned about me at all.

36
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,020
She's protecting herself

37
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,900
because she's afraid her identity will be exposed.

38
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,320
Ruiqiu,

39
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,040
let's resolve this matter like this.

40
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,370
I'll give you some money

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,960
and you leave Zhiqiu alone, okay?

42
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,690
Do you think I care about money?

43
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,760
When I was helping Ye Zhiqiu,

44
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,120
what did she have?

45
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,720
During the time she disappeared,

46
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,160
I sold everything I had to keep the studio running.

47
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,760
The relationship between us

48
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
can't be measured by money.

49
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,040
Of course,

50
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,480
you probably don't believe what I'm saying

51
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,280
because you all think I'm crazy.

52
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,880
Ruiqiu.

53
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,960
People change.

54
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,320
I know.

55
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,400
I've looked into your company.

56
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,659
Money is very important to you right now.

57
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,760
And you need to respect Zhiqiu's choices.

58
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,420
She told me before going abroad that she would renew the contract.

59
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,200
Xiangyang,

60
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,120
between you and Ye Zhiqiu

61
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,080
it's just mutual benefit, taking what each needs.

62
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,080
I'm not stopping anything.

63
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,280
But now you're

64
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,040
being fooled by a con artist

65
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,640
and you're still trying to be the good guy for them.

66
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,960
Fine. Even if I believe you,

67
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,640
where's your evidence?

68
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,700
Where's the proof?

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
See for yourself.

70
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,360
Ye Zhiqiu has been abroad for six months.

71
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,520
During these six months,

72
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,280
her spending records are completely clean.

73
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,740
Is she that kind of person?

74
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,560
She should be shopping even more when abroad!

75
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,120
Ruiqiu,

76
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,850
how did you get Zhiqiu's computer?

77
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,520
Did you go to her home?

78
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,100
Do you know what you're doing is illegal?

79
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,159
Bin CF55690.

80
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:33,799
Come quickly and take a photo.

81
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,559
Everyone hurry up!

82
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:34,960
Hurry!

83
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,400
When I become famous later,

84
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,720
you'll have to be my body double.

85
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,360
Sure.

86
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,880
How much will you pay me per day?

87
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,440
I'll pay you whatever you want.

88
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,900
I want half of your salary.

89
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,400
Deal.

90
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,120
I promise.

91
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,700
Hey, Xuanxuan.

92
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,820
Hey, Xiaoxiao.

93
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,890
The hospital sent an email.

94
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,440
It's a regular follow-up

95
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
and post-operative instructions.

96
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,720
They want us to confirm.

97
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,520
Which email account received it?

98
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,160
I hope it's not the one linked to our real identities.

99
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,880
Carefully check the sender and content

100
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,480
for any exposed critical information.

101
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
It's the one

102
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
we temporarily registered before.

103
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,000
The sender is the hospital's official address.

104
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,800
The content is

105
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,170
just ordinary routine reminders.

106
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,360
What about the instructions?

107
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,090
Delete this email immediately

108
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,600
and deactivate the account.

109
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Everything connected to this address

110
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,400
and all digital traces of our past identities

111
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
must be completely erased.

112
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,680
Okay, got it.

113
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,480
Xiaoxiao.

114
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,720
I've deleted the emails and closed the account.

115
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
Everything else has been taken care of too.

116
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,760
Check that apartment again.

117
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,760
Make sure nothing is left that could link to the hospital

118
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,160
or reveal your identity.

119
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,720
Especially paper documents,

120
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,440
old phones,

121
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,400
receipts with addresses on them.

122
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,960
Once you're sure, get out of there immediately.

123
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,400
Okay.

124
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,200
Xiaoxiao,

125
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,520
can I take some more of my things with me?

126
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,480
Xuanxuan,

127
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,920
how many times have I told you?

128
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,160
You're Ye Zhiqiu now.

129
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,650
Finish up and get out of there quickly.

130
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,480
Xie Yuxuan,

131
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,920
your white dress looks so beautiful today.

132
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,080
Hey, Xuanxuan.

133
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,010
Xiaoxiao, did you see the message?

134
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,940
Rachel knows everything now.

135
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,770
You shouldn't go back tonight.

136
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,400
Forget it, I'll handle this.

137
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,360
Hello, could you help me check

138
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,600
the surveillance footage from September 20, 2024, evening,

139
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,800
in the elevator area of Building 1, Unit 3?

140
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,200
We only keep recordings for one month.

141
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,000
It's been eight months already.

142
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,210
That's impossible.

143
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,900
Are you asking about those two beautiful women?

144
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,520
Yes.

145
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,560
That day, didn't we

146
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,880
check the surveillance footage together?

147
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,480
Look,

148
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,200
is this the beautiful woman

149
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,960
who was wearing a hat in the elevator?

150
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
She does look like the beautiful woman

151
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,620
who was wearing a baseball cap and mask that day.

152
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,600
It's been so long,

153
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,940
how do you remember it so clearly?

154
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,200
September 20th

155
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,210
was my birthday.

156
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,480
When she came,

157
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,040
nice car, beautiful woman,

158
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,770
I just took a few extra glances.

159
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,480
Did they leave together?

160
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,240
No,

161
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
they each drove their own car.

162
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,860
But the other woman

163
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,000
seemed to be driving

164
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,400
a car belonging to a resident with the surname Xie.

165
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,960
Why didn't you tell me this when we checked the surveillance footage last time?

166
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,320
That day you only asked if I recognized this woman.

167
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,120
You didn't mention this matter.

168
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,040
In that box...
