1
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,460
What are you doing?

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,260
Let go of me!

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,480
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,180
I'm sorry, Zhiqiu.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,400
I was wrong.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,080
I wrongly blamed you.

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,200
Let go of me!

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

9
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:33,920
My sister called me.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,960
She said you were together that entire afternoon.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,770
Why didn't you tell me that day?

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,920
We've already broken up.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,080
Please leave.

14
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:48,840
Zhiqiu.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,920
I'm truly sorry.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,520
Please forgive me this time.

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,360
Why?

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,570
Why did you suspect I was the murderer?

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,220
That person was Rachel who accompanied me for 10 years.

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,519
In your eyes,

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
am I that monster?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,400
No.

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,760
Zhiqiu, listen to me.

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,000
That day at the Cloud Restaurant,

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,480
I...

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,400
I...

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,880
I watched the security footage.

28
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,360
That woman really looked like you.

29
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,120
I thought she was the one forcing Rachel to drink.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,760
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,760
My judgment that I was so proud of...

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,520
I was completely wrong at that moment.

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,250
Please give me another chance,

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,480
Zhiqiu.

35
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,980
Xiangyang.

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,180
Rachel had a heart condition.

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,759
She'd been to the emergency room several times.

38
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:36,000
Her family knew about this,

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,920
that's why they chose not to call the police.

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,979
But I never thought

41
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,289
you wouldn't even have the most basic trust in me.

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,330
Zhiqiu, I was wrong.

43
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,720
I overthought everything.

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,240
Enough.

45
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,729
That's about it.

46
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,080
Stop the act.

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,080
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,740
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

49
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,920
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,620
I'm sorry, Zhiqiu.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,130
I was too impulsive.

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,360
It's just that person looks exactly like you.

53
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,000
If you saw her with your own eyes,

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,200
you'd be shocked too.

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,280
I want to see.

56
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,320
I want to know

57
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,680
just how similar we look.

58
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,260
Okay, I'll find it for you.

59
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,090
Is she really that similar?

60
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,840
Xiangyang

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,130
It's too late today.

62
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,040
Go home and get some rest.

63
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,880
Okay?

64
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,450
Don't you need me to stay with you anymore?

65
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,120
I want to be alone for a while.

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,160
Alright, I'll head back now.

67
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,540
Take care of yourself.

68
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,400
I'll go first.

69
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,159
Xiaoxiao

70
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Xuanxuan.

71
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
Ye Zhiqiu isn't dead.

72
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,860
She's still alive.

73
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,800
Xiaoxiao.

74
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,840
Really?

75
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,160
What nonsense are you talking about?

76
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,890
I'm driving.

77
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Let's talk later.

78
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,160
Xiaoxiao.

79
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,050
That's impossible.

80
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,340
It can't be.

81
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
How could that be?

82
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,280
How is this possible?

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,680
Ye Zhiqiu

84
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,040
is alive.

85
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,920
Ye Zhiqiu.

86
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,260
Hey, Xiaoxiao.

87
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,920
Ye Zhiqiu's body is missing.

88
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,840
Ye Zhiqiu isn't dead.

89
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,960
That person at the Cloud Restaurant

90
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
is Ye Zhiqiu.

91
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,560
Ye Zhiqiu is still alive.

92
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,280
What should we do?

93
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,520
Come to my place.

94
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,080
Xiaoxiao.

95
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,200
Xiaoxiao.

96
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,360
Xiaoxiao.

97
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,600
Xiaoxiao.

98
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,440
Xiaoxiao.

99
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,920
Xuanxuan.

100
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,800
I'm going to Korea for a few days

101
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,600
to handle the hospital records.

102
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,159
Be extra careful these days.

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,200
If anything happens,

104
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,120
call me.

105
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,799
Xiaoxiao.

106
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,200
Are you sick?

107
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,210
Why is your voice so hoarse?

108
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,039
It's nothing.

109
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,900
Just a cold.

110
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
How could this be?

111
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,880
How is that possible?

112
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,360
How could I?

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,920
Having a face

114
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,090
that looks exactly like yours, right?

115
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,460
Who are you really?

116
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,920
Xuanxuan.

117
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,170
Who do you think I am?

118
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,400
This is my home.

119
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
You're Xiaoxiao.

120
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,280
Xiaoxiao.

121
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,400
Ye Zhiqiu's body is missing.

122
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,840
Rachel already knows about that place.

123
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,400
I must eliminate any potential risks.

124
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,480
Ye Zhiqiu's body

125
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,050
was also switched by me.

126
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,320
You killed Rachel.

127
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,840
So...

128
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,410
So you had plastic surgery.

129
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,720
Just to kill someone.

130
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,320
You think I wanted to?

131
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,760
Rachel forced me to do it.

132
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,360
She wouldn't let go of you.

133
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,680
I had no choice but to sneak into Korea.

134
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,940
To become another you.

135
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,880
I couldn't take that chance.

136
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,660
I won't let you bear

137
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,120
even the slightest risk.

138
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,000
You know what?

139
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,640
No.

140
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,860
It shouldn't be like this.

141
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,980
How did it come to this?

142
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,920
Xuanxuan.

143
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,520
From now on,

144
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,720
I won't let anyone

145
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,680
interfere with our plans.

146
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,860
Xiangyang is completely devoted to you now.

147
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,840
Soon,

148
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,800
he will propose to you.

149
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,040
What?

150
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,520
Propose?

151
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,080
You can only legally inherit his property

152
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
if you marry him

153
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,600
and after his death.

154
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,080
Shelly.

155
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,640
Since Xie Yuxuan is missing

156
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,410
and Xiangyang has issues with Leng Xiaoxiao,

157
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,680
you're my only

158
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,880
breakthrough now.

159
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,960
Zhiqiu.

160
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,200
Surprise.

161
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,000
Shelly,

162
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,160
what brings you here?

163
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,600
I came to see you.

164
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,520
A celebrity's life

165
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,170
is indeed different from ordinary people's.

166
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,360
Such a big house.

167
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,400
I could never afford it in my lifetime.

168
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,530
Please, have a seat.

169
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,800
Shelly.

170
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,840
It's been a while.

171
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,620
It's been a long time since we talked.

172
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,760
How have you been?

173
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,800
It hasn't been that long.

174
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,450
Didn't you contact me a few months ago?

175
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,890
I didn't even ask what it was about.

176
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,760
Right.

177
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,400
I completely forgot.

178
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,890
The privileged sure have short memories.

179
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,600
What?

180
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,720
Found yourself a rich husband

181
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,520
and rushed to quit the industry.

182
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,040
Moving up the social ladder quickly, aren't you?

183
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,440
Can't be envious of that.

184
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
There's no such thing as crossing class barriers.

185
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,860
It's nothing special anyway.

186
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,680
This lack of confidence...

187
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,080
Is this really our big star Ye Zhiqiu?

188
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,000
Why do I feel like

189
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,000
you're much more approachable

190
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,720
than you appear on the big screen?

191
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,120
In movies,

192
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,010
I'm always wearing makeup.

193
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,210
Aren't you curious?

194
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,240
How I managed to find your home?

195
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,060
What's there to be curious about?

196
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,600
We have

197
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,680
so many mutual friends.

198
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,340
You couldn't have asked Xiangyang about it, right?

199
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,040
Although his office building

200
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,080
is quite eye-catching.

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,480
I know my boundaries.

202
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,930
Xiangyang is your husband.

203
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,620
How could I go to him behind your back?

204
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,160
Besides,

205
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,480
We were roommates in college.

206
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,680
Shouldn't I come to you first when I need something?

207
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,940
I can't just bypass you

208
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,280
and go straight to your sugar daddy.

209
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,040
Shelly.

210
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,560
Do you need something from me?

211
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,280
Nothing.

212
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,280
I just missed my old classmate

213
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,720
and wanted to drop by.

214
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,240
We should hang out more often.

215
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,800
Sure.

216
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,400
Please, have a seat anywhere.

217
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,320
Two flatbreads.

218
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,980
No, thanks.

219
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,540
You're Ye Zhiqiu's agent.

220
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,480
Former agent.

221
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,770
What do you want from me?

222
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,600
Do you still keep in touch with your college roommates:

223
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,930
Ye Zhiqiu, Leng Xiaoxiao, and Xie Yuxuan?

224
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,740
Any contact with them?

225
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,210
Two flatbreads.

226
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,890
You came all this way

227
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,360
just to dig up ancient history?

228
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,720
This is important.

229
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,560
Recently,

230
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,650
we held a press conference.

231
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,090
Ye Zhiqiu is retiring from acting.

232
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,000
At the press conference,

233
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,160
we caused quite a stir.

234
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,360
Although Xiangyang later paid off the media

235
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,420
to keep them quiet,

236
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,240
some information still leaked out.

237
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,000
Alright.

238
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,130
You came to me asking about these old stories,

239
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,000
so I need to know what's in it for me.

240
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,560
I don't do business at a loss.

241
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,160
Fine.

242
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,920
I heard you recently got a new job.

243
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,000
Would you like me to lend you some money

244
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,240
so you can get a bigger place?

245
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,440
Yes.

246
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,100
I haven't started yet.

247
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,800
As for housing,

248
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,500
I do want to get a new place.

249
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,320
Ye Zhiqiu.

250
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
She did contact me recently.

251
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,680
Shelly.

252
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,360
I see you've lost so much weight.

253
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,480
Are you not feeling well?

254
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,860
This is called being lean.

255
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,090
All that money spent at the gym has to show for something.

256
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,490
Watch out for this girl.

257
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,520
She's no pushover.

258
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,760
Back then,

259
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,120
she was always causing trouble.

260
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,450
Going to the gym is good.

261
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,920
Health is the most important thing now.

262
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,840
Back in the day, you and I were fine.

263
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,220
But Leng Xiaoxiao,

264
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,220
she was always picking on you.

265
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,130
But you never held a grudge.

266
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,810
Are you still in touch with her?

267
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,980
Finally getting to the point.

268
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,540
Leng Xiaoxiao?

269
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,640
We haven't been in touch for many years.

270
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,280
Really?

271
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,160
I'd really like to get in touch with her.

272
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Why don't we get together sometime?

273
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,040
I don't even have her contact information anymore.

274
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,400
How can we meet up?

275
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,980
What about Xie Yuxuan?

276
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,300
Wasn't she close with Leng Xiaoxiao?

277
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,850
Have you seen her recently?

278
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,920
I heard her husband died.

279
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,520
That hopeless romantic,

280
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,520
who knows if she'll remarry.

281
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,160
Really?

282
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,400
Xie Yuxuan.

283
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,960
We haven't been in touch for a long time.

284
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,820
I'm not sure about her situation.

285
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,119
Look at your memory.

286
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,040
How could you pretend not to know

287
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,319
your roommate of four years in college?

288
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,440
Don't tell me

289
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,300
the person standing in front of me

290
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
is a fake Ye Zhiqiu?
