1
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,290
I never expected

2
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,320
this is the place you found.

3
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,180
Not bad, right?

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,240
If you're not satisfied,

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,810
we can find somewhere else.

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,520
If the arrangements aren't impressive enough,

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,850
I'll have to punish you.

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,400
Incense ash falls like shooting stars,

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,640
wisdom dissolves into mountain winds.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,560
Actually, this place

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,020
is quite nice as a final destination.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,220
Why so melancholic suddenly?

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
I'm not being melancholic,

14
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,940
I'm just enlightened.

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,080
Have you been struggling in the mundane world for too long

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,480
that you've become numb?

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,650
Let's go.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,370
Let's go.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,960
The honored guests have arrived.

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,560
How was it?

21
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,840
Was it difficult to find?

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,500
It was fine.

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,960
Why don't you arrange dinner for us first?

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,400
Sure.

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,640
Our Cliff Edge Guesthouse

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,720
is famous for its cliff-side dinners.

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,120
Let me check you in first.

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,800
Don't let anyone disturb us.

29
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,480
Don't worry,

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,600
you've booked the entire place.

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,080
We'll ensure your privacy.

32
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,080
This way, please.

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,130
What kind of cigarette is this?

34
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
That night,

35
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
was her initiative related to this?

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,720
Do you all

37
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,560
really want me to disappear,

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,480
especially Ye Zhiqiu?

39
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,400
She asked me to identify someone.

40
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,329
Who's behind Ye Zhiqiu's mask now?

41
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,720
Is it Xie Yuxuan

42
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,680
or Leng Xiaoxiao?

43
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,720
He only believes

44
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,320
that fake Ye Zhiqiu.

45
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,120
You gave Shelly those cigarettes.

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,850
You tempted her to smoke again.

47
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,600
I don't care who you are right now.

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,720
Where is Shelly?

49
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,880
One problem after another.

50
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,519
Don't meddle in others' affairs.

51
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,880
Watch yourself.

52
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,280
Investigating your own boss.

53
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,640
What big plan are you thinking about?

54
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,860
I just need to know where he is now.

56
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,720
You can check his car's location.

57
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,480
His car?

58
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,650
He didn't take the company car.

59
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,640
Wait. I have an idea.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
We can check his and Ye Zhiqiu's spending records.

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,460
Spending records?

62
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,400
How?

63
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
Give me their ID numbers.

64
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,760
I can access their bank transaction records.

65
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,480
They contain merchant information.

66
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,120
Merchant category codes and names.

67
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,080
With their account numbers, I can...

68
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,040
Stop.

69
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,840
What codes? What merchants?

70
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,920
I don't understand.

71
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,360
Look.

72
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,360
I'll send you the ID numbers.

73
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,210
Don't worry.

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,730
I'll definitely make it worth your while.

75
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,280
Xuanxuan.

76
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,660
Xiaoxiao, tell me.

77
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Today is your

78
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,320
last day as Ye Zhiqiu.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,840
Enjoy your dinner well.

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,760
After all,

81
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,360
you won't be a bride

82
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,000
for more than a few hours.

83
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,040
Leave the rest

84
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:44,920
to me.

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,960
I've prepared a surprise for you.

86
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,840
A surprise.

87
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,659
What surprise?

88
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,220
Did you let it slip?

89
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,080
You heard me.

90
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,560
It seems

91
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,840
I'm not a good actor yet.

92
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Then just focus on being Mrs. Xiang.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,330
Please enjoy your meal.

94
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,930
What are you looking at?

95
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,760
I think you're right.

96
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,530
I really should make some changes.

97
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,159
You're just fine the way you are.

98
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,159
Everyone says I'm selfish and cold,

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,460
only caring about profit.

100
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,080
In the eyes of a thousand people,

101
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,740
there are a thousand Hamlets.

102
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:00,760
Just be your authentic self.

103
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,040
Accept yourself,

104
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,220
even the parts others don't like.

105
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,440
Zhiqiu.

106
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,050
I think you're different from others.

107
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,540
Before, Lengxiaoxiao

108
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,930
was always trying to change me.

109
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,220
But what happened?

110
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,170
So don't overthink it anymore.

111
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,080
Someone will always like your good side

112
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,000
and accept your flaws too.

113
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,580
Xiangyang.

114
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,920
I like every side of you.

115
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,360
I love every side of you

116
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,120
too.

117
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,880
To our authentic selves.

118
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,440
Xiangyang.

119
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,980
I want to go over there and take a look.

120
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,880
Such a quiet wedding.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,480
Do you feel any regrets?

122
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,240
Of course I have regrets.

123
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,659
What I regret is

124
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,890
why we didn't meet earlier.

125
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,559
If life were like a movie,

126
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
I could fast-forward to this moment

127
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,840
and skip all the time in between.

128
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,520
That's disgusting.

129
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,160
Just hang in there a little longer.

130
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,080
The surprise

131
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,880
will be here soon.

132
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
We can set off the fireworks now.

133
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,580
How beautiful.

134
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,920
Do you like

135
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,460
this surprise?

136
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,560
No one has ever

137
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,440
been so thoughtful to me before.

138
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,730
I think this is no longer

139
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,680
just a destination wedding.

140
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,490
What would you call it then?

141
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,090
This is our journey to our final destination.

142
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,210
This place is also our final destination.

143
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,450
Final destination.

144
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,440
Yes.

145
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,720
I've waited so many years

146
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,480
just for today.

147
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,760
What he said is actually right.

148
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,330
This is indeed his final destination.

149
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,440
It's also his

150
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,040
burial ground.

151
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,840
I'm sorry.

152
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,490
What's going on?

153
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,000
Sorry to disturb you two.

154
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,140
What's happening?

155
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,400
What exactly is going on?

156
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,460
What's the matter?

157
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,800
There's a phone call for you.

158
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,880
They say it's important.

159
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,280
They insisted I find you.

160
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,020
Nobody knows I'm here.

161
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,180
Who's calling?

162
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,040
It's a man.

163
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,970
He says it's extremely urgent.

164
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,570
He insisted I must find you.

165
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,660
What are you doing?

166
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,760
Why are you just standing there?

167
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,480
Xuanxuan

168
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,720
Xiaodi

169
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,810
Mr. Xiang

170
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,340
It's like this.

171
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,840
The company has an urgent matter

172
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,300
and needs you to come back.

173
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,080
What is it?

174
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,280
Mr. Zhao

175
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,640
wants to move the meeting up.

176
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,490
So he keeps asking me

177
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,820
when we can confirm it.

178
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,650
I think this cooperation is too important

179
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,440
and would be better if you personally chair it.

180
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,420
How did you know I was here?

181
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,880
I guessed.

182
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
You said you were going somewhere windy.

183
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,240
I guessed you might be here.

184
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,300
So I made a call.

185
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,080
What a coincidence.

186
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Please come back.

187
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,160
You've handled much bigger issues

188
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,080
before.

189
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,290
Why do you have to find me this time?

190
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,760
Also,

191
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,200
I asked you to find Xie Yuxuan,

192
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,800
but you couldn't locate him.

193
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,290
Stop worrying about my personal affairs.

194
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,050
That will be done soon, senior.

195
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,570
She must be in desperate need of money now.

196
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,920
Hong Ming borrowed money from all her relatives and friends

197
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
just to partner with us in business.

198
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,200
This is my unfulfilled wish right now.

199
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,720
Xiaodi.

200
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,540
You must find Xie Yuxuan as soon as possible.

201
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,600
Give Hong Ming the money that was owed to her back then,

202
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,560
and double it.

203
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Hong Ming borrowed money from all her relatives and friends

204
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,280
to partner with us in business,

205
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,810
and ended up in a lot of debt.

206
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,800
She must be in desperate need of money now.

207
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,530
If it's really not possible...

208
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,420
Send someone to Hong Ming's place

209
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,820
to see if there's any trace of Xie Yuxuan.

210
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,600
Remember,

211
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,780
don't tell anyone about this,

212
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,260
including Zhiqiu.

213
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,240
Senior,

214
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,320
do it quickly.

215
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,000
Hello?

216
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,160
Senior?

217
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,690
If anyone calls looking for me,

218
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,980
say I can't be reached.

219
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,120
Certainly,

220
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,720
Mr. Xiang.

221
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,520
We also have an infinity pool here.

222
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,380
You and your wife might want to check it out tonight.

223
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,560
I'll pass on swimming.

224
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,480
We can't swim.

225
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,280
Thank you.

226
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,570
Let's go.

227
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,680
Boss,

228
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,260
those two people are really strange.

229
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,320
Life is colorful,

230
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,080
but also complicated.

231
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,160
Xiaoxiao.

232
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,130
It really is Shi Xiaodi.

233
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,080
How could he find such a hidden place?

234
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,480
Is it just a coincidence?

235
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,480
Go back.

236
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,770
I want to go back.

237
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,280
Yes,

238
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,100
I'm leaving tomorrow.

239
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,160
No,

240
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,240
I want to leave today.

241
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,320
Calm down.

242
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,770
You can't leave.

243
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,640
Things have already gone this far.

244
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,920
How much longer do we need to wait?

245
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,120
If you leave now,

246
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,040
Xiangyang will get suspicious.

247
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,720
Only when Xiangyang is dead,

248
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,000
can all of this

249
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,960
finally end.

250
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,520
But I really can't do it.

251
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,840
He's not as bad as you say.

252
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,640
Try again.

253
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,700
Maybe one more attempt will succeed.

254
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,760
Trust me.

255
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,820
We still have a chance.

256
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,490
There's still hope.

257
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,720
You've forgotten again.

258
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
You are Ye Zhiqiu,

259
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,080
Xiangyang's wife.

260
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,920
This honeymoon trip

261
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,840
is just a charade.

262
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,480
I think you've gotten too deep into your role

263
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,540
and forgotten our original purpose.

264
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,240
You don't need to do anything special,

265
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
just act normal.

266
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,400
I'll make it up to you.

267
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,440
You are Ye Zhiqiu.

268
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
Xiangyang's heart is in your hands.

269
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,280
If you squeeze even a little,

270
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,480
he will feel the pain.

271
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,560
His emotions

272
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,490
are all under your control.

273
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,920
You shouldn't panic.

274
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,440
You shouldn't be afraid.

275
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,040
The one who should be afraid

276
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,480
is him.

277
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,440
This Shi Xiaodi has really lost his mind.

278
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,370
He can't stand seeing us together.

279
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,680
Am I really

280
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,980
that important to you?

281
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,640
Don't let me

282
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,010
cause you two to grow apart.

283
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,360
Honey,

284
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,120
in my heart,

285
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,520
you're the most important to me.

286
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,380
You're my husband,

287
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
the one who will grow old with me.

288
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,780
You're important too.

289
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,930
But Xiaodi always suspects your intentions,

290
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,680
you must be upset about that.

291
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,320
His concerns are reasonable.

292
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,140
Prenuptial agreement

293
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,860
is definitely necessary.

294
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,960
After all, you're a major shareholder in the company.

295
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,960
We should consider how others feel.

296
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,920
Being with you

297
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,130
already makes me happy.

298
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,000
Everything except you

299
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,380
I don't care about.

300
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,520
Many people are spreading negative news about me.

301
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,450
I always thought

302
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,460
you wouldn't marry me.

303
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,080
I haven't heard anything yet,

304
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,600
but maybe I will in the future.

305
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,280
So...

306
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,720
You should come clean

307
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,300
and give me a heads-up.

308
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,080
Xuanxuan.

309
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,280
Xuanxuan.

310
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,240
Xuanxuan.

311
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,579
Cold Xiaoxiao and I...

312
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,440
Right.

313
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,500
You were college classmates.

314
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,530
She must have told you about it.

315
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,920
Your marriage alliance with the Cold family

316
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,680
is known by everyone in Binjiang.

317
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
It's hard not to know about it.

318
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,820
The Cold family...

319
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,080
I married into their family.

320
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,920
Later my father-in-law passed away.

321
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,320
The rumor outside is that

322
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,210
I plotted carefully

323
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,090
and drove him to his demise.

324
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,010
You've heard this version, right?

325
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,400
I rarely keep in touch with Cold Xiaoxiao,

326
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,520
so about your situation,

327
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,800
I don't know much.

328
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,920
Are you saying these stories

329
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,240
have too many fabrications?

330
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,420
Only the part about marrying into their family is true.

331
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,460
The mud the Cold family threw at me

332
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,220
and the matters between Cold Xiaoxiao and me...

333
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,880
All these things are in the past.

334
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,840
I don't want to worry about them anymore,

335
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,640
nor are they worth my attention.

336
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,620
The only thing I can't get over

337
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,290
is Hong Ming.

338
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:36,920
[Plan]

339
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,400
[Sketch]
