1
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,280
Are you well?

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,120
Xiao Xiao

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,160
Let's go and surrender ourselves

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,840
I know her death was an accident

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,040
But she died in your house

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,720
The police will consider you the killer

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,080
Rest assured

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,160
I'm with you

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,400
I will settle the matter completely

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,920
As if nothing had happened

11
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:21,880
to stop

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,320
Congratulations to Professor Yi Qiu on the successful completion of the filming

13
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,720
Congratulations on finishing filming

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,520
Thanks

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,120
Congratulations, congratulations

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,960
May God bless you

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,880
Congratulations, congratulations!

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,640
God bless you, director

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,479
May God bless you all

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,200
Congrats!

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,560
This is from President Chiang Yang during his business trip,

22
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,440
Limited edition hand-picked just for you.

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,200
Early morning today,

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,720
Specially arrange for it to be sent.

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,000
You have good taste.

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
I received the gift, thanks.

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,200
Chi Chiu,

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,760
Tell me when you leave.

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,480
Okay, I get it.

30
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,400
It has arrived.

31
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,240
Chi Chiu,

32
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,320
Come on, come in.

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,680
Xuan Xuan,

34
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,560
Come, let me take a look at you.

35
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,040
Long time no see,

36
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,320
You've slimmed down a lot.

37
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
But you are the most beautiful.

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,240
My big star.

39
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,480
You're always good at compliments.

40
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,040
Come on, please sit inside.

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,079
Help me hang my clothes.

42
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,000
Its fabric is expensive.

43
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,680
It wrinkles easily.

44
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Isn't this Ling Xiaoxiao, the eldest daughter of the richest man?

45
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,560
Is your case with Xiangyang over?

46
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,280
right,

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,440
I have to change the way I call you now.

48
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,400
I must call you

49
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,760
Miss "most in debt",

50
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,200
Relative to debt.

51
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,040
Yi Qi Qiu.

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,320
Okay, okay.

53
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,400
The two of you fight as soon as you meet.

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,760
Can you today for me,

55
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,520
Should you stop quarreling?

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,920
Come on, let's go eat.

57
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,520
Xuan Xuan, I finished filming today.

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,560
from now on,

59
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,840
I will have more free time.

60
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,000
When you need me,

61
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,280
I can come and accompany you at any time.

62
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,240
Good.

63
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,200
You are very busy.

64
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,720
Since Hong Ming's death until now,

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,400
I was the one accompanying Xuanxuan.

66
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,000
Unlike you,

67
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,560
You are getting closer to Chiang Yang,

68
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,600
Completely ignoring Xuanxuan's feelings.

69
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,519
Do you know how I endured all this?

70
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,320
What does Hong Ming's death have to do with Xiangyang?

71
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,480
Xuan Xuan,

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,560
Tell her.

73
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,760
Let her know Xiangyang's true face.

74
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,280
Hong Ming was Xiang Yang's partner.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,760
their company,

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,159
It was founded by Xiang Yang relying on the Ling family's connections.

77
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,440
Hong Ming desperately wanted...

78
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,440
When the company grew and achieved huge profits,

79
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,840
Xiang Yang turned on them

80
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,159
He refused to pay according to the contract.

81
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,440
Hong Ming went to confront him and they had a violent quarrel.

82
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,960
Immediately after that, his car's brakes failed.

83
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,720
He died and left behind huge debts.

84
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,040
Tell me, how can there be such a coincidence?

85
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,800
Who is the biggest beneficiary of this?

86
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,800
Xuan Xuan.

87
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,920
How much money do you need?

88
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
Tell me,

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,720
I can give you.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,800
Chi Chiu.

91
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,480
I don't want your money,

92
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,160
Rather, I fear that you will be deceived.

93
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,080
Did you forget?

94
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,520
Xiang Yang was very cruel to Xiao Xiao at that time.

95
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,800
He even tricked Hong Ming

96
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,920
I'm afraid to deceive you

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,280
Don't you know what kind of person Ling Xiaoxiao is?

98
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,160
If her father fell, she would be nothing

99
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,560
Her nature is as foul as a stone in a toilet

100
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,760
What man can bear it?

101
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,480
It was very natural for Xiang Yang to abandon her

102
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,880
Yi Qi Qiu

103
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,440
Repeat what you said again

104
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
What would Xiangyang do without the Ling family?

105
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,000
He had absorbed the Ling Family's blood

106
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,960
And it killed my father

107
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,000
And now he has come to deceive you, you fool

108
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,880
I'm telling you

109
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,320
The next one to die is you

110
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,360
Ling Xiao Xiao

111
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,159
What are you saying?

112
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,280
If you have the courage, repeat what you said

113
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,560
Chi Chiu

114
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,920
Really Xiangyang

115
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,560
He climbed on the corpses of others

116
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,680
Hong Ming is a prime example of this

117
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,040
Xuan Xuan, how much money do you need? Xuan Xuan!

118
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,280
If you need money, you can tell me

119
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,280
I can give you

120
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,400
In the future, stay away from this crazy woman, okay?

121
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,840
Who are you calling a crazy woman?

122
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,800
I'm talking about you

123
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,920
You are an abandoned woman

124
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,920
Even if you throw yourself at men, no one will want you

125
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,320
And yet you still have the audacity to act rudely in front of me?

126
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,360
Yi Qi Qiu

127
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,800
I've seen despicable people

128
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,800
But I've never seen anyone as despicable as you

129
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,800
How dare you hit me?

130
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,240
I'm hitting you specifically

131
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
You crazy woman

132
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,680
Stop quarreling! Stop quarreling!

133
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,880
You two, stop fighting

134
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,680
Don't interfere in my business

135
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,400
Xiao Xiao

136
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,040
What are you trying to do?

137
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,840
Stop quarreling!

138
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,080
Chi Chiu

139
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,360
Chi Chiu

140
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,800
Chi Chiu, what's wrong?

141
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,680
Chi Chiu

142
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,000
She died

143
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:32,840
Chi Chiu

144
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,240
Chi Chiu, wake up

145
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,240
Chi Chiu

146
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,040
Wake up, Xuan Xuan

147
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,480
Don't touch her, she's already dead

148
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,000
Don't touch her now, Xuanxuan

149
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
I was the one who paid it

150
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,880
I killed someone

151
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,560
I killed someone

152
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,800
Xiao Xiao, Xuan Xuan

153
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,840
I killed someone, calm down

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,159
Xuan Xuan, you killed someone

155
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,960
Xuan Xuan

156
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,200
Xuan Xuan, look at me

157
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,240
Calm down a little

158
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,240
I was the one who proposed this gathering

159
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,280
We will find a solution together

160
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,120
I will help you

161
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,040
We will bear this together

162
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,560
How will we bear this?

163
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,120
Should we go call the police?

164
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,240
Give ourselves up?

165
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,040
If it was unintentional murder

166
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,560
So I...

167
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,480
Xiao Xiao

168
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,400
So my whole life...

169
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,520
My whole life will be ruined

170
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,240
Xuan Xuan

171
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,520
Do you have a large suitcase at home?

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,640
Do you have?

173
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,799
Go get it quickly

174
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,120
Aren't you back yet?

175
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,680
The reporters are all waiting inside.

176
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,560
If we are unable to send the press release today,

177
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,000
All subsequent work will be affected.

178
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,160
Did Sister Ye say where she went?

179
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,840
How about we go look for her?

180
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,240
You left suddenly,

181
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,440
How do I know where you went?

182
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,160
Enter it.

183
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,000
quickly!

184
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,280
Help!

185
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,480
Don't stand still, hurry!

186
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,320
Sister Ye drives an Avatar car,

187
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,240
We can check the car's location on the phone.

188
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,640
I saw your car.

189
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,720
Where are you?

190
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,680
Rachel.

191
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,480
Take off your clothes.

192
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,600
Good.

193
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,840
Come on, wear this.

194
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,520
Good.

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
When she goes upstairs,

196
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,160
We go down.

197
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:28,680
Let's go.

198
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:30,880
strongly.

199
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,560
Yi Qiqiu's car.

200
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,960
You drive her car and I drive yours.

201
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,640
Where are we going?

202
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,400
Follow me.

203
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,440
Let's go quickly.

204
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:43,680
Good.

205
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,880
Where is the car?

206
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:03,960
Hey Xiao Xiao,

207
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,720
Where do we go now?

208
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,920
Her car definitely has a tracking device.

209
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,720
The last place Ye Qiqiu appeared was,

210
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,600
It can't be your home.

211
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,040
Let's go.

212
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,120
To her house.

213
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,600
Good.

214
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,160
Sister Ye's car,

215
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,840
She seemed to be heading towards her home.

216
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,760
What?

217
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,880
Hurry up!

218
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Are you Rachel?

219
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,240
What's up with you today?

220
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,240
Let's meet.

221
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
A message from Rachel

222
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,080
Let's talk about anything tomorrow.

223
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,280
I'm very tired today.

224
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,240
What a pity.

225
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,240
They've assigned the two of us to a joint patrol again.

226
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,320
You have to be content.

227
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,200
I'm trapped.

228
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
Find a place to stop.

229
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,400
I can't bear it anymore.

230
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,360
In this desolate wilderness.

231
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,200
I will never accept this work again, even over my dead body.

232
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,360
What is that thing?

233
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,680
It looks like a human foot.
