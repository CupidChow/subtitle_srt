1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,860
If it doesn't work out,

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,360
have someone go to Hong Ming's place

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,560
to see if there are any clues about Xie Yuxuan.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,160
Remember,

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,720
don't tell anyone,

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,620
including Zhiqiu.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,180
Why is he looking for me

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,660
and trying to break into my house?

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,840
Okay.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,330
As soon as possible.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,200
Hello?

12
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
- Hello?
- Xiaoxiao?

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,170
I'm here.

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,160
Xiangyang

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,930
seems to suspect us now.

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,000
He asked Shi Xiaodi to send someone to break into my house.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What should we do?

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,520
Now you know what kind of person he is, right?

19
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:42,960
I...

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,400
So you have no way out.

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,180
Don't be fooled by his false tenderness.

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,000
But...

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,160
His tenderness is only for Ye Zhiqiu.

24
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,020
And who are you?

25
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,520
You are Xie Yuxuan.

26
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,280
The one who killed the person he loved most.

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,360
No.

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,000
Xiaodi.

29
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,960
I like you.

30
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,280
Xueli.

31
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,960
I know you like Ye Zhiqiu.

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,400
Xueli.

33
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,140
Can't we just be good friends?

34
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,280
Of course.

35
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,970
Even though we'll be graduating soon,

36
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,720
we'll still be in the same city.

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,000
Whenever you think of me,

38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,980
just look back,

39
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,560
I'll always be there.

40
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
Why did Shelly start using drugs?

41
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,240
You should really ask yourself that.

42
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,640
She stayed in Binjiang

43
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,120
and suffered so much,

44
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,010
changed jobs countless times,

45
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,360
and was even raped when she worked in sales.

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,079
She stayed in Binjiang

47
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,480
just to be closer to you.

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,200
Ask yourself:

49
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,730
did you deserve her?

50
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,440
This is insane.

51
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
You're making my life difficult

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,840
and cost me a million yuan.

53
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,520
I'll make you pay back a hundred times more.

54
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,159
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,680
I'm sorry.

56
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,120
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,040
Last night...

58
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,770
Don't say anything.

59
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,520
Last night was fine.

60
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,000
You don't need to feel burdened.

61
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,420
[Xiaoxiao answers the phone]

62
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,440
Hello, Xuanxuan.

63
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,240
What's wrong?

64
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:38,880
Xiaoxiao,

65
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,400
Shelly...

66
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,300
she knows everything.

67
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,020
I told you long ago she couldn't stay.

68
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,720
You insisted on being soft-hearted.

69
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,840
We've delayed for so long,

70
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,640
wasting all this time for nothing.

71
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
I thought since we were classmates,

72
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,600
she might consider our old friendship

73
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,280
and I wanted to give her a chance.

74
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,610
A chance to send us to our graves, you mean?

75
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,930
This matter,

76
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,880
don't get involved anymore.

77
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,080
I'll handle it.

78
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,680
Xiaoxiao.

79
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,840
What?

80
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,250
You like it here now?

81
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,900
Raising money takes time.

82
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,280
It's always the same line.

83
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,280
I'll say it again.

84
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,480
My patience is limited.

85
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,080
I really can't come up with that much money.

86
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200
That's your problem.

87
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't push me.

88
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,580
Isn't it just about money?

89
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,280
I have some dollars

90
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,800
I'll give them to you tomorrow.

91
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,530
For the rest,

92
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,900
I'll find a way to raise it.

93
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,060
You said tomorrow.

94
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,840
Dollars.

95
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,050
How much?

96
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,760
100,000.

97
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,200
How will you deliver it?

98
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,130
Wait for my call.

99
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,680
I'll tell you

100
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,960
where to meet.

101
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,760
I'll say this one last time.

102
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,560
My patience is truly limited.

103
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,240
Do you want to fight to the death with me?

104
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,560
You're not up to it.

105
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,560
Eat up.

106
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,280
Tomorrow,

107
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,840
I'll buy you some dishes and chopsticks,

108
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,600
and get some pots and pans.

109
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,320
You should learn how to cook properly.

110
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,760
A home should feel like a home.

111
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,090
You understand?

112
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,440
Home...

113
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,770
I've almost forgotten what it feels like.

114
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,400
Xueli.

115
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,520
I'm sorry.

116
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,640
Back then, I...

117
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't bring up the past.

118
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,600
It was my own choice.

119
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,960
It has nothing to do with you.

120
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,240
I think

121
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,660
this place you're living in is too small.

122
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,160
I can find you a better place,

123
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,520
a big villa.

124
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,900
How about that?

125
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,000
No need.

126
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,920
A villa?

127
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
I'm leaving soon.

128
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,450
Where are you going?

129
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,900
Leaving Binjiang.

130
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,040
Why?

131
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,040
Is it Ye Zhiqiu's idea

132
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,480
or my senior's?

133
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,880
Do you think

134
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,360
the current Ye Zhiqiu is the same as before?

135
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,520
Zhiqiu?

136
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,480
She looks exactly the same as before.

137
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,520
But...

138
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,620
there might be something different,

139
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,240
not the same feeling as before.

140
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,600
Though I haven't seen her for so many years,

141
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,240
maybe my memory is playing tricks on me.

142
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,490
Haven't you considered

143
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,440
that she's an impostor?

144
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,240
Someone who had plastic surgery

145
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,740
to look like Ye Zhiqiu?

146
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,760
I think

147
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,530
Ye Zhiqiu's agent mentioned this before.

148
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,320
But

149
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,720
how could that be possible?

150
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,880
Zhou Ruiqiu, who kept saying she was fake, is dead.

151
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,840
Do you think that's just a coincidence?

152
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,160
So when you recently went to see my senior,

153
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
it was about this?

154
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,960
Did he believe what you said?

155
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,200
He only believes that fake Ye Zhiqiu.

156
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,840
Fake Ye Zhiqiu?

157
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,680
Fake Ye Zhiqiu...

158
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,610
What do you mean?

159
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,760
Do you have any evidence?

160
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,860
I want to see it.

161
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,400
Some things

162
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,200
are better left unknown.

163
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,250
Zhou Ruiqiu is dead,

164
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,100
and I'm about to leave too.

165
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,490
Some secrets should just stay buried.

166
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,900
Where's the money?

167
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,860
Why are you in such a hurry?

168
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,340
It'll be here soon.

169
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,690
Are you planning a surprise for me?

170
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,560
What surprise?

171
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,860
How much longer do we have to wait?

172
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,080
Soon.

173
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,170
Have a drink.

174
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,260
No, thanks.

175
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,300
What are you afraid of?

176
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Afraid of ending up like Zhou Ruiqiu

177
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,780
who died after having a drink?

178
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,730
You're being way too cautious.

179
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,760
Miss Ye.

180
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,330
Just put it here.

181
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,400
Actually,

182
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,480
we're quite similar.

183
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,200
I'm nothing like you.

184
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,560
You were born with a silver spoon in your mouth.

185
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,970
I've had to do everything on my own.

186
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,250
Now you know who I am.

187
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,200
I know.

188
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,080
We were roommates for four years after all.

189
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,000
You've finally gotten what you wanted,

190
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,060
marrying the man you wanted to marry.

191
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,200
But I heard

192
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,730
you got divorced recently.

193
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,380
It's really eye-opening.

194
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,120
That Hong Ming who used to be at my family's beck and call

195
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,000
for a living

196
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,400
has now become your right-hand man, Xiangyang,

197
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,200
wagging his tail for your favor.

198
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,000
And then there's Xie Yuxuan.

199
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,360
One of my few friends

200
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,360
now won't answer my calls or reply to my messages

201
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,760
and avoids me whenever we meet.

202
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,480
Xiangyang,

203
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,320
tell me,

204
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,800
is there anyone in this world you can't buy off?

205
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,600
You're blaming all of this on me.

206
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
Buy off Hong Ming?

207
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,120
What means do I have to buy him off?

208
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,800
In this house,

209
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,440
I'm walking on eggshells just to keep my place.

210
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,120
Honestly,

211
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,060
Xiangyang,

212
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
take a good look at where you are now.

213
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,840
Think back to

214
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,280
what you were like when you first stepped into our family.

215
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,410
Everything you have

216
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,640
came from my family.

217
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,840
But how did you repay us?

218
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,640
Conspiring with outsiders,

219
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,100
leaking company secrets,

220
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,580
secretly diverting project resources.

221
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:25,860
Xiangyang,

222
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,240
I was truly blind.

223
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,690
My father was right.

224
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,520
You are talented,

225
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,200
a calculating genius

226
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,160
who betrays those who helped you.

227
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,960
I'm a genius?

228
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,000
Why is it that whenever something goes wrong with the company,

229
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,840
all fingers point directly at me?

230
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,360
How many hidden problems did your family have before?

231
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,480
Why is it that as soon as we got married,

232
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,240
all these so-called mistakes

233
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,200
seemed perfectly arranged,

234
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,640
just waiting for me to sign and take the blame?

235
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,970
Enough. I don't want to hear your excuses.

236
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,250
My father was right.

237
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,940
You've achieved what you wanted,

238
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,000
stepping on my family

239
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,960
to reach the top.

240
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,540
Xiangyang,

241
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,930
we're finished.

242
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,240
The two of us

243
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,680
are exactly the same.

244
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,040
We both want happiness,

245
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,320
but we've lost ourselves

246
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,440
and become what we hate most.

247
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,680
What did you put in it?

248
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,480
It's similar to ecstasy.

249
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,720
Ye Zhiqiu used to smoke it too.

250
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,040
Forget it.

251
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,120
I'll keep it.

252
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,490
It's not for you.

253
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,940
For these cigarettes,

254
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
I need to add more.

255
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,080
How much?

256
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,320
Put all of these in.

257
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,640
This dosage could kill someone.

258
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,320
I only smoke one per day.

259
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,520
Easy to carry around.

260
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,410
Let me take you home.

261
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,240
I feel terrible.

262
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:30,920
I think

263
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,040
I overdosed.
