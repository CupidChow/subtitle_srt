1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,200
September 20th,

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,240
I saw a ghost.

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,730
September 20th.

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,210
September 20th.

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,660
Hey, Xuanxuan.

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,560
What's wrong?

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,920
Xiaoxiao, something happened.

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,520
Zhiqiu's laptop is missing.

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
It must be Rachel.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,680
A fan just sent an anonymous message.

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,000
September 20th,

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,800
saw a ghost.

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,440
I blocked that person.

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,660
But what about the laptop?

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,440
The computer is gone.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,960
Xuanxuan.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,570
We're walking on thin ice with every step.

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,280
One small mistake and all our efforts will be wasted.

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,960
Was I not clear enough before?

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,560
Ye Zhiqiu's things must be completely dealt with.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,600
I've been handling it, Xiaoxiao.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,780
But, Xiaoxiao.

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,289
I'm not like you.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,440
I can't be as meticulous as you are.

25
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,400
Alright.

26
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,570
Now is not the time for self-blame.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,180
Our risk of exposure is multiplying.

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,920
Do you know the consequences?

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,720
I understand.

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,130
Of course I understand.

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,320
But Rachel.

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,060
She knows everything.

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,520
She knows too much.

34
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,330
She's setting a trap for us.

35
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,640
Making us walk right into it.

36
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,880
She understands Ye Zhiqiu better than anyone.

37
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,039
What should we do?

38
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,600
She won't let us go.

39
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,120
You're right.

40
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,360
She knows too much.

41
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,640
And she won't give up.

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,520
Since she won't let us go.

43
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,009
Then we can only.

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,800
Eliminate this problem.

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,960
Qili

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:09,960
Qi Lin

47
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,400
Qi Linyi

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,840
Li Yuan

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,320
Yue Peng

50
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,400
Yue Peng

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,440
Lin Jing Xin

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,880
Er Bei Qingxi

53
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Did you get what I asked you to find?

54
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,640
This is Xie Yuxuan's Leapmotor car

55
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,920
driving records for the entire September.

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,560
However,

57
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,520
I couldn't find the plastic surgery contract

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,120
that you asked me to look for.

59
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,880
By the way,

60
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,240
When I picked up the computer last time,

61
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,100
I found an identical photo frame.

62
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,360
Thought it might be useful to you,

63
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
so consider it a gift.

64
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
If that's all, I'll be going now.

65
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,880
Row 3, Column 17, 255 characters.

66
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Wangjiang Town.

67
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,330
Row 20, Column 1, 14 characters, #255.

68
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,200
What were they doing there so late at night?

69
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,930
Row 20, Column 1, 62 characters, #255.

70
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,700
Xiangyang.

71
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,530
I heard Rachel made a scene at the company.

72
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,920
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
It's all my fault.

74
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,220
For getting you involved in all this.

75
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,280
Don't worry about it.

76
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,010
I've taken care of everything.

77
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:21,940
Xiangyang.

78
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,160
Why do you always do this?

79
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,370
You never say anything,

80
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,200
you just quietly help me.

81
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,200
Being able to protect you

82
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,260
makes me happy.

83
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,640
Maybe I should thank Rachel

84
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,380
for giving me more chances to be with you.

85
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,680
Xiangyang.

86
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,200
What is it that you love about me?

87
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,040
Why are you so good to me

88
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,880
that it feels like a dream?

89
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,760
Zhiqiu.

90
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,620
This isn't a dream.

91
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,680
This is real.

92
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,260
I'm serious about you.

93
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:17,920
Zhiqiu,

94
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,400
are you there?

95
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:20,880
Zhiqiu?

96
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,300
Zhiqiu,

97
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:26,940
Zhiqiu,

98
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,010
are you okay?

99
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,260
Zhiqiu?

100
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,280
Xiangyang,

101
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,920
I'm dealing with something right now.

102
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,320
I'll call you back later.

103
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:51,840
Xiaoxiao,

104
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,610
did you see the message Rachel sent me?

105
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,610
What should I do?

106
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:56,930
Don't panic.

107
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,280
Just do as I say.

108
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,160
Where are you? Let's meet up.

109
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,800
Finally willing to see me.

110
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,160
You finally agreed to see me.

111
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,400
Rachel.

112
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,820
I've treated you well.

113
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,840
Let's part on good terms.

114
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,440
Don't make things difficult for everyone,

115
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:37,920
okay?

116
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,840
You're threatening me,

117
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,450
warning me about my situation.

118
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,240
I'm just

119
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,280
giving you advice as a friend.

120
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,280
I hope you think carefully.

121
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,600
About what

122
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,850
is most beneficial for you.

123
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,840
How much money does it take

124
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,200
to buy back a human life?

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,060
Where is Ye Zhiqiu?

126
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,300
Is she still alive?

127
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,760
I am Ye Zhiqiu.

128
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,080
I'm living quite well now.

129
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,920
You're not the real Ye Zhiqiu at all.

130
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,960
I will find Ye Zhiqiu,

131
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,440
until I do.

132
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,620
Xiangyang.

133
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,520
What's wrong?

134
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,040
Where have you been?

135
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,120
I called you 23 times.

136
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,000
You didn't answer any of them.

137
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,530
I almost called the police.

138
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,300
My phone was on silent.

139
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,290
I didn't hear it.

140
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,730
Are you okay?

141
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,160
I'm fine.

142
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,420
Xiangyang,

143
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,050
you bought a new car.

144
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,560
This car

145
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,040
looks pretty nice.

146
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,480
It matches yours. A couple set.

147
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,360
Bin CF55690.

148
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,160
Bin C·F55690,

149
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,890
it really is.

150
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,770
Your previous car was classic,

151
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,960
but it was only suitable for work.

152
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,900
This one suits your style better.

153
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,170
I respect classics,

154
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,660
but I'd rather create the future.

155
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,260
Hey, Xuanxuan.

156
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,620
How's it going on your end?

157
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,920
I'm sure he'll only come back after everything is taken care of.

158
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,650
Don't worry.

159
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,080
By the way,

160
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,040
what about Rachel's matter?

161
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
How is that going?

162
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
Rachel doesn't want money.

163
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,160
Money can't solve this problem.

164
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,700
Let me handle this matter.

165
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,440
Xiaoxiao,

166
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,880
are you feeling sick?

167
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,890
Why is your voice so hoarse?

168
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,640
It's nothing.

169
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,780
I caught a cold.

170
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,380
Why did you choose this place?

171
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,160
It's quiet.

172
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,100
You never liked places like this before.

173
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,300
People change.

174
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,240
We can't stay the same forever.

175
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,680
Some habits need to change.

176
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,880
That's how life becomes more comfortable.

177
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,810
Don't you think?

178
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,000
Here.

179
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,360
This is wine that Xiangyang brought back from France.

180
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,000
I know you like this region.

181
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,660
I brought it specially for you to try.

182
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,720
Cheers.

183
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,960
How is it?

184
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,500
Not bad, right?

185
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,720
If you like it, have some more.

186
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,580
Are you trying to get me drunk?

187
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,460
If we don't drink to our heart's content,

188
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,960
how can I tell you

189
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,840
what you want to know?

190
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,560
Most importantly,

191
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,480
tomorrow you

192
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,280
will forget everything that happened today.

193
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,320
Fine then.

194
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,520
Tell me who you really are.

195
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,880
Didn't Ye Zhiqiu

196
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,800
tell you

197
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,360
who she looks like?

198
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,680
You're really Xie Yuxuan?
