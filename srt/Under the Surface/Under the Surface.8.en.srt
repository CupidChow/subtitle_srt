1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,000
Tell me who you really are.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,400
Didn't Ye Zhiqiu

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,320
tell you

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,880
who she looks like?

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,820
You really are Xie Yuxuan.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,680
Your intuition

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,180
has always been right.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,120
But claims need evidence.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,880
You admitted it.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,860
Xie Yuxuan.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:36,920
Tell me

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,250
where Zhiqiu is.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,040
Xie Yuxuan

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,200
Where is Xie Yuxuan?

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,610
This Xie Yuxuan you're talking about,

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,160
I haven't seen him for a long time.

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,360
Rachel

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,180
What nonsense are you talking about?

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,040
Did you forget

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,370
to take your medicine again today?

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,250
Your old problem with auditory hallucinations is acting up again.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,440
Xie Yuxuan.

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,410
I'm warning you.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,240
Tell me where Ye Zhiqiu is.

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,680
Why should I tell you?

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,320
What can you do

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,000
if I don't tell you?

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,780
You're most afraid of people finding out you're a fake.

29
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,479
I'll pay for

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,570
this meal today.

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,080
Xie Yuxuan.

32
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,560
Rachel.

33
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,300
What nonsense are you talking about?

34
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,610
Did you forget to take your medicine again today?

35
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,770
Your old problem with auditory

36
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
hallucinations is acting up again.

37
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,680
Zhiqiu.

38
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
My Zhiqiu.

39
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,160
Wait until I find you.

40
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,760
Special extended-release tablets.

41
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,360
It looks exactly the same as what you'd get from the pharmacy.

42
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,280
But one pill contains three times the normal dosage.

43
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,880
Remember,

44
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,159
no more than one pill per day.

45
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,640
This is so much more convenient.

46
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,180
It saves her from having to swallow pills

47
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,480
by the handful like candy every day.

48
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,400
It hurts me just watching her.

49
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,240
If the single intake of sodium valproate

50
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,120
exceeds 200 milligrams per kilogram of body weight,

51
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,780
it will cause coma and respiratory depression.

52
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,480
If lithium carbonate is taken daily on top of that,

53
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,720
the situation becomes even more dangerous.

54
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,920
Alcohol intensifies the toxicity of sodium valproate.

55
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,040
Combined with lithium carbonate,

56
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,640
it could be fatal in minutes.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll come see you.

58
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,920
I have something important to tell you.

59
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,040
Just tell me over the phone.

60
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,760
It's about

61
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,760
Zhiqiu.

62
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,920
I need to tell you in person.

63
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,360
Come over for dinner tonight.

64
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,760
I have a surprise for you.

65
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,400
I need to run some errands in the suburbs today.

66
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,930
I can't join you for dinner.

67
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,920
Okay.

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,460
I'll be at home. Come over.

69
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,370
Alright.

70
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,740
I'll be there soon.

71
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,560
Zhiqiu,

72
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,100
are you done with work?

73
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,440
The housekeeper made delicious seafood porridge today.

74
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,040
I'm waiting for you to have it together.

75
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,480
I'm not finished with the matters in the suburbs.

76
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,810
I won't come over today.

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,640
That's fine.

78
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,660
Take care of yourself.

79
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,320
Come in.

80
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,440
This is homemade wine my friend brought today.

81
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,970
Try some.

82
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,880
I could use a drink.

83
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,810
I was at Cloud Restaurant today

84
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,200
with Ye Zhiqiu

85
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,640
and already had some drinks.

86
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,560
Zhiqiu? When?

87
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,370
We had dinner together.

88
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,330
That's impossible.

89
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,440
We were just on the phone.

90
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,600
Xiangyang,

91
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,200
wake up.

92
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,200
This person now

93
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,080
is not Ye Zhiqiu.

94
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,720
She's Xie Yuxuan,

95
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,600
an impostor.

96
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,540
You've been telling me

97
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,360
that Zhiqiu isn't Zhiqiu,

98
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,800
and now you're saying

99
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,000
Zhiqiu is Xie Yuxuan.

100
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,560
What are you talking about?

101
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,760
Do you have any proof?

102
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,400
Proof?

103
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,760
The day she finished filming and left the crew,

104
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,220
she went to see Xie Yuxuan.

105
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,960
She disappeared after going to Xie Yuxuan's home.

106
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
It's Xie Yuxuan.

107
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,360
It was Xie Yuxuan.

108
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,040
Xie Yuxuan killed my Zhiqiu.

109
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,300
Rachel, you're crazy.

110
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,720
They were college roommates.

111
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,000
Xie Yuxuan lost her spouse.

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,320
Zhiqiu went to visit her.

113
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,440
What's wrong with that?

114
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,640
She went to Xie Yuxuan's home

115
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,780
and then left the country.

116
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,330
She was gone for six months.

117
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,120
Six months.

118
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,240
Not a word from her,

119
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,159
not even answering her phone.

120
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,799
After coming back,

121
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,419
she wanted to retire from acting.

122
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,039
Even her vocal cords,

123
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,039
her voice is completely different.

124
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,920
All her memories of the past

125
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,080
have become blurred.

126
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,500
That's too much of a coincidence.

127
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
Let me tell you.

128
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,800
They deceived you together.

129
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,410
They're the ones

130
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,600
who killed my Ye Zhiqiu.

131
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,820
You've really gone crazy.

132
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:19,960
Rachel.

133
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,160
Rachel, what do you mean?

134
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,320
Rachel.

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,880
Rachel, are you okay?

136
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,400
Rachel.

137
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,960
Rachel, are you doing this on purpose?

138
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,620
Are you doing this on purpose?

139
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,320
Hello, emergency services?

140
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,680
Someone has fainted here.

141
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm at Nanjiang No.1.

142
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,560
Please hurry.

143
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,600
Rachel.

144
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,240
Rachel, hang in there.

145
00:09:59,240 --> 00:09:59,720
Rachel.

146
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,040
Rachel.

147
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:14,840
Doctor,

148
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,420
how is Zhou Ruiqiu?

149
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,040
I'm sorry,

150
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Ms. Zhou Ruiqiu

151
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,440
passed away at 11:45 PM

152
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,680
despite our resuscitation efforts.

153
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,340
She's gone.

154
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,770
Please accept my condolences.

155
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,020
Xiangyang,

156
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,760
what happened to Ruiqiu?

157
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,600
Who is Zhou Ruiqiu's family member?

158
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,130
We need a signature on the death certificate.

159
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,920
There are other procedures to follow.

160
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,520
What?

161
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,120
Ruiqiu is dead?

162
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,400
Doctor,

163
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,260
we're all friends of Zhou Ruiqiu.

164
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,640
I just contacted her sister.

165
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,080
She won't arrive until tomorrow.

166
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,210
Then we'll wait for her family to arrive before signing.

167
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,680
Xiangyang

168
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,560
You just told me Rachel had an accident at home,

169
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,760
so I rushed over here.

170
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,720
What happened to Rachel?

171
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,800
Zhiqiu.

172
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,370
Where did you come from?

173
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,560
I came from...

174
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm asking you

175
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,760
why Rachel had an accident in our house.

176
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,560
She came to see me.

177
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,240
She's not Ye Zhiqiu.

178
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,240
She's Xie Yuxuan.

179
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,340
Never mind.

180
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
We'll talk later.

181
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,320
Xuanxuan.

182
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,500
You know where you are.

183
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,640
I also know where you are.

184
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,250
Don't be afraid.

185
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,650
The innocent have nothing to fear.

186
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,210
Zhou Rachel's death

187
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,300
has nothing to do with you.

188
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,620
Shi Xiaodi.

189
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,570
Shi Xiaoyou.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,600
Doctor.

191
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,640
She was always fine.

192
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,620
How could she die so suddenly?

193
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,920
Our preliminary assessment

194
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,240
indicates it was the combined effect of alcohol and medication

195
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,900
that caused her sudden death.

196
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,960
Drinking?

197
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,040
Alcohol was just one of the triggers.

198
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,040
The real cause

199
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,480
was acute cerebral edema.

200
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,380
and respiratory failure.

201
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,360
Does she regularly take any special medication?

202
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,620
I've always known she takes medication.

203
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,530
It's just...

204
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,360
She...

205
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,840
She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

206
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,520
She's been taking medication to stabilize her condition.

207
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,840
What medication does she take?

208
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,100
How much does she take?

209
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,880
Do you know?

210
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,880
This...

211
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,280
I just remembered.

212
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,800
Doctor,

213
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,410
I saw these medications in her bag before.

214
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:44,960
But

215
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,240
I don't recognize them.

216
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,640
Look, these are the ones.

217
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,520
So many medications.

218
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,650
She's taking pills like they're food.

219
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,280
She was just under too much work pressure.

220
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,800
Maybe

221
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,860
she wasn't taking her medication properly as prescribed.

222
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
We never expected

223
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,730
that she would suddenly...

224
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,290
Please try to calm down.

225
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,600
It's okay. I'm fine.

226
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,940
It's my fault for not taking good care of her.

227
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,720
If you need anything in the future,

228
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,120
don't hesitate to ask us.

229
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,480
It's alright. Don't worry about me.

230
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,160
Nothing we say matters now.

231
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,600
Zhiqiu.

232
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,490
I'll have Xiaodi take you home.

233
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,440
No need.

234
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,300
I want to go back by myself.

235
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,600
Preliminary assessment

236
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,760
indicates it was the combined effect of alcohol and drugs

237
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,420
that caused the sudden death.

238
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,960
Rachel, did you do this on purpose?

239
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,420
Did you do this on purpose?

240
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,160
This person now,

241
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,920
she's not Ye Zhiqiu.

242
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,640
She's Xie Yuxuan.

243
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,560
Xiaodi,

244
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,560
help me find

245
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,760
Zhiqiu's former roommate, Xie Yuxuan.

246
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:13,920
Also,

247
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,400
find me

248
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,780
a psychiatrist from a private hospital.

249
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,880
Remember,

250
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,210
this needs to be done secretly.

251
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,840
Just between you and me.
