1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,680
Zhiqiu.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,360
Mr. Xiang,

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,500
let me take you somewhere.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,840
Where?

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,920
You'll see when we get there.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,160
Child.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,680
Your father

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,640
is taking me to turn myself in.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,880
Xiangyang,

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,360
I've disappointed you again in the end.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,520
I'll turn myself in.

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,640
But why

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,160
can't you give me six more months

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,080
to have this baby?

15
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,520
Back to this place again.

16
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,000
That email,

17
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,320
did you see it?

18
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,880
What email?

19
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,120
Actually,

20
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,040
I'm not Ye Zhiqiu.

21
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,860
I've known for a long time.

22
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,560
I thought

23
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,840
I could fool you.

24
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,560
I just preferred to let myself be deceived.

25
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,360
Long ago,

26
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,170
I already sensed it.

27
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,160
You're not the one

28
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,290
who was hot and cold with me, Ye Zhiqiu.

29
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,370
I don't know who you are.

30
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,120
I don't know why

31
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,640
you're pretending to be Ye Zhiqiu to get close to me

32
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,240
or what your real purpose is.

33
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,700
But since you appeared in my life,

34
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,620
I've felt a sense of security I've never had before.

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,930
I'm becoming more and more addicted to this feeling.

36
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,839
I don't want to know who you are anymore.

37
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,959
Let's just say you're Ye Zhiqiu.

38
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,540
Then do you know

39
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,580
where the real Ye Zhiqiu is right now?

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,600
I don't want to know anymore.

41
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,760
No.

42
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,320
You must know.

43
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,200
Do you know

44
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,760
how Rachel died?

45
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,320
How Shelly died?

46
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,760
And Shi Xiaodi?

47
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,400
It doesn't matter if you didn't see that email.

48
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,720
I can tell you myself.

49
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,800
I don't want to hear anymore.

50
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,460
They're all

51
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,720
with Ye Zhiqiu now,

52
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,920
lying in a dark, sunless underground place.

53
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,720
Please stop talking about this.

54
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,720
Their deaths have nothing to do with you.

55
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,850
How can they have nothing to do with me?

56
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,160
Ye Zhiqiu's death was an accident,

57
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,120
but everything that happened afterward spiraled out of control.

58
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,160
I am the unforgivable criminal.

59
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,880
Is that so?

60
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,720
I know

61
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,880
all these people were killed by Leng Xiaoxiao.

62
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,240
From the first time I saw the surveillance footage,

63
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,760
I already knew there was someone

64
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,690
who looked exactly like Ye Zhiqiu.

65
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,450
I just never thought

66
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
that person would be Leng Xiaoxiao.

67
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,440
I should have talked Xiaoxiao out of it.

68
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,570
I shouldn't have

69
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,370
let Xiaoxiao make one mistake after another.

70
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,880
If I had been a little braver,

71
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
if I had turned myself in earlier,

72
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,520
if I had ended all this sooner,

73
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,159
perhaps

74
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,180
Xiaoxiao and the others wouldn't have died.

75
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,730
But, Xiangyang,

76
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,760
I'm pregnant.

77
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,320
The doctor says

78
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,680
he's developing well.

79
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,560
He's already formed.

80
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,730
Could you

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,040
give me another six months?

82
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,650
Let me give birth to him.

83
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,280
Then I'll turn myself in.

84
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,600
Okay?

85
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,560
I know.

86
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,690
I thought I was someone who knew right from wrong.

87
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,600
But until I met you,

88
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,360
until I fell in love with you,

89
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,760
I abandoned all my previous moral principles.

90
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,040
Even though you were once my friend's wife,

91
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,090
I still selfishly want to have you for myself.

92
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,380
I blame myself for Hong Ming's death,

93
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,560
yet I'm hopelessly lost in your tenderness.

94
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,600
I can ignore all the gossip in the world.

95
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,000
I just want to be with you.

96
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,600
Xie Yuxuan,

97
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,960
can we give each other a chance?

98
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,960
But I can't do it.

99
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,960
I can't

100
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,840
put all the blame

101
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,600
on Xiaoxiao.

102
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,100
Xiangyang,

103
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,520
I want to end all this.

104
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,180
I want to atone for my sins.

105
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,930
I want to turn myself in.

106
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,240
But our child...

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,730
Then let's have the baby first.

108
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,340
No matter what happens in the future,

109
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,330
I will always stay by your side.

110
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,280
Now we'll start counting down.

111
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,690
You will slowly wake up.

112
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,200
You know that everything that just happened

113
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,159
was just a dream.

114
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,130
You want to wake up from this dream.

115
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,480
Your body is slowly regaining consciousness.

116
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
Your hand moved.

117
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,120
Everything in the hypnotic trance

118
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,720
hasn't happened yet.

119
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
You can choose your life path again.

120
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,240
Now,

121
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,500
you're about to wake up

122
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,900
and return to the present.

123
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,250
What did you see?

124
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,280
I saw...

125
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,260
I spread rumors about how Xiangyang hurt me.

126
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,920
My father, to protect me,

127
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,480
endlessly insulted Xiangyang.

128
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,260
The relationship between the Leng family and Xiangyang got worse and worse.

129
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,480
Dad finally had a heart attack from anger and passed away.

130
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,520
I fell into a pit of hatred.

131
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,760
I dragged my best friend into endless revenge.

132
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,840
In the end, I lost everything

133
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,560
and became what I hated most.

134
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,480
Do you really have to do this?

135
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,960
Is there a better choice?

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,720
Xiaoxiao.

137
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,440
Sis,

138
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,090
why didn't you go back home?

139
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,280
My mom was in a car accident two weeks ago.

140
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,940
She had surgery that same day.

141
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,800
She's still recovering now.

142
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,240
It happened that afternoon after leaving your place.

143
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,040
By the way,

144
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,610
what are you doing here?

145
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,340
I haven't been sleeping well lately.

146
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,680
I came to get some medication

147
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,010
and have hypnotherapy.

148
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,440
Hypnotherapy?

149
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,080
It's like

150
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,090
I've been in a dream.

151
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,160
And now I've woken up.

152
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,500
Only then did I realize

153
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,880
how to live a better life.

154
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,600
Sis.

155
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,320
Buy some good food for Mom

156
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,780
and get the best medicine.

157
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,600
Don't tell Xiangyang I was here.

158
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,520
Why not?

159
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,240
We're going through a divorce.

160
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,640
Divorce?

161
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,600
Is it because of me and Mom?

162
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,440
No, Xiaoxiao, let me tell you.

163
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,040
Xiangyang is a filial child.

164
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,040
He knows Mom had an accident

165
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,360
at the entrance of your neighborhood,

166
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,960
and he feels extremely guilty about it.

167
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,720
That's why he's being temperamental.

168
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,520
Don't divorce him because of this.

169
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,120
Sis.

170
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,450
I'm at fault too.

171
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,280
I've never

172
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,040
considered things from Xiangyang's perspective.

173
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,500
I've never cared about his feelings either.

174
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,690
I'm leaving.

175
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,480
Take good care of Mom.

176
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:20,800
Xiaoxiao.

177
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,160
Honey.

178
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,100
What are you doing?

179
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,840
Weren't you on a business trip?

180
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,170
Why are you back so soon?

181
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,280
Because I missed you.

182
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,360
It's broad daylight, aren't you in a hurry?

183
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:47,890
Hurry up.

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,600
I made plans with Xiaoxiao to see Zhiqiu's concert.

185
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,160
How can I rush something like this?

186
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
If I rush, how could you enjoy it?

187
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,080
Honey.

188
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,360
Hurry up.

189
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,560
We're going to be late.

190
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,440
Coming.

191
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,050
How do I look in this outfit?

192
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,480
Beautiful.

193
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,240
My wife

194
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,160
looks gorgeous in anything.

195
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,210
You're such a sweet talker.

196
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,090
Let's go.

197
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,520
Rachel.

198
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,240
I wouldn't be who I am today without you.

199
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,200
I'm looking forward

200
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,530
to stepping into the next decade with you.

201
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,320
I hope

202
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,560
you'll always be my comrade through thick and thin,

203
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,720
my closest friend.

204
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,160
Thank you.

205
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,240
Thank you for being here.

206
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,970
At the same time,

207
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,330
I'd also like to thank my dear classmates.

208
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,920
Thank you all for coming today

209
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,560
to witness my next decade.

210
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,120
Thank you all.

211
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,560
I love you all.

212
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,620
Why didn't Xiangyang come today?

213
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,680
He's busy.

214
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,180
Hongming didn't come either.

215
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,530
That's true.

216
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,640
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,120
Am I late?

218
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,400
Is it all over?

219
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,760
You two talk. I'll go find Hongming.

220
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,320
Bye.

221
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,560
I thought you

222
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,280
didn't want to see your first love,

223
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,160
Ye Zhiqiu.

224
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,770
What are you talking about?

225
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,690
You're the only one in my heart.

226
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,200
This is a gift I brought you from Europe.

227
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,720
You'll definitely like it.

228
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,580
You shouldn't have spent so much.

229
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,900
Come over here.

230
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Limited edition.

231
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,480
Good taste.

232
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,280
Xiaoxiao.

233
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,360
I'm sorry.

234
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,640
During my trip to Europe,

235
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,570
I met with David.

236
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,090
He's very interested in our products.

237
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,600
If we can convince Dad

238
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,120
to make some minor adjustments

239
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,580
to our existing products,

240
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,820
David will definitely agree.

241
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,840
I understand.

242
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,040
Dad never listened to your suggestions before.

243
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,700
From now on,

244
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,860
I'll be the mediator between you two.

245
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,040
Xiaoxiao.

246
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,970
Thank you for your help.

247
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,890
You've worked hard too.

248
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,010
Let's go eat.

249
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,090
Let's go.

250
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
Mom, are you okay?

251
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,040
I'm fine.

252
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,760
Take some time to rest when you get home.

253
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,040
Make sure to remind Mom to take her medicine on time.

254
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,240
Don't worry. I can take good care of Mom.

255
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,960
Xiaoxiao came to the hospital a while ago.

256
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,690
Did you know?

257
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,060
She didn't tell me.

258
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,420
She didn't mention it.

259
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,040
Mom.

260
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,200
Xiaoxiao.

261
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,080
I'm here to take you home from the hospital.

262
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,560
Good.

263
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,200
What's wrong?

264
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,180
I cut my finger.

265
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,360
It's nothing.

266
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,140
You're still smiling?

267
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,609
Does it hurt?

268
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,040
I'm fine.

269
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
Press on it first.

270
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,839
How can you be so happy when you're hurt?

271
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,080
Seeing you so serious

272
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,380
is really amusing.

273
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,970
You're making lamb with scallions for me?

274
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,640
Why didn't you ask my sister to help you?

275
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,080
I wanted to surprise you.

276
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,120
I don't want to bother your sister for everything.

277
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't want your mother to think

278
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,360
that I can't do anything.

279
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,220
She might feel sorry for you then.

280
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,130
But you've never

281
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,290
set foot in a kitchen your entire life.

282
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,400
All this time,

283
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,840
you've been the one making sacrifices for me.

284
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,840
But love should be a two-way street.

285
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,120
Xiaoxiao.

286
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,760
I love you.

287
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,040
I love you too.

288
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,480
- Row.
- Row.
