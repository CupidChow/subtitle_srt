1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,000
Zhiqiu,

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,490
let's have a meal together.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
With Shen Yixiao.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,850
Your childhood friend.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,080
Oh, her?

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,760
But I've been so busy with work lately.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,560
I have so many unfinished tasks.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,780
Maybe another day?

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,980
So what do you think

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,360
I should reply to her?

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,200
Just say I'm not feeling well

12
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,009
and I'm recovering these days.

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,840
Then we'll talk when you have time.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,600
Shen Yixiao?

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,560
No.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,240
Shen Yixiao? Sun Yixiao?

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,880
Sun Yixiao.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,280
She's not Ye Zhiqiu.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,880
Where did Zhiqiu go?

20
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,079
Xiaoxiao.

21
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,290
Xiaoxiao, I think I've been found out.

22
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,480
That Rachel deliberately gave me the wrong name

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,280
to trick me.

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,320
She really suspects something.

25
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,720
It seems

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,040
we need to figure something out.

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,079
What should I do?

28
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,680
Is there any solution at all?

29
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,100
What's wrong? You look terrible.

30
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,440
I...

31
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,720
Do I?

32
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,840
Maybe I haven't been sleeping well lately.

33
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,480
Your eyebrows are all furrowed.

34
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,440
Rachel keeps bothering me lately.

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,820
I really don't want to see her.

36
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,490
Don't worry.

37
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,320
About Rachel,

38
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,500
I'll help you deal with it.

39
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,160
Pretending to be nice,

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,130
that's his usual trick.

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,000
You seem quite troubled lately.

42
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,560
Is it because of Hong Ming?

43
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,700
Don't rush.

44
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,770
He won't tell you the truth yet.

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,820
Hong Ming was once my best friend.

46
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,500
Alright, let's not talk about this anymore.

47
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,490
Why don't you get some rest?

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,320
Xuanxuan.

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,250
I'm going to Korea for a few days

50
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,200
to handle the hospital records.

51
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,760
Be extra careful these days.

52
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,800
If anything happens,

53
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,920
call me.

54
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,980
Go to sleep.

55
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,760
Oh my God.

56
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,760
I'm actually responding to him.

57
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,000
What have I become?

58
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,160
Do you want to know the truth?

59
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,380
Knowing the truth comes with a price,

60
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,960
a heavy price.

61
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,570
Okay, see you tomorrow.

62
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:38,640
Zhiqiu.

63
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,500
Xiangyang.

64
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,820
Why aren't you asleep?

65
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,010
Can't you sleep?

66
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,140
I just returned a call.

67
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,450
I was afraid of disturbing you.

68
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,530
Get some rest early.

69
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
You go ahead first.

70
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
There's someone I know over there.

71
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,010
I need to talk to her.

72
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,000
Coffee.

73
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,300
Xiangyang.

74
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,289
Are you really confused or just pretending to be?

75
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,679
Even though we don't work together,

76
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,120
we're still good friends.

77
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,450
You can speak your mind.

78
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,640
The current Ye Zhiqiu

79
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,120
is an impostor.

80
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,160
First she's on vacation,

81
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,220
then she's abroad,

82
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,050
disappears for so long,

83
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,850
comes back and wants to retire,

84
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,480
and her stories don't add up.

85
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,360
All of this

86
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,610
is definitely not just a coincidence.

87
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,420
You came to see me just to say this?

88
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,720
Nothing else?

89
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,000
Can't you really see it?

90
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,240
Rachel,

91
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,000
I think you're the one with issues.

92
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,200
The current Ye Zhiqiu

93
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,680
even gets her childhood friend's name wrong.

94
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,200
Has someone brainwashed you?

95
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,440
And you say I'm crazy?

96
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,280
You're even helping her kick me out.

97
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,120
Shouldn't you be concerned about

98
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,960
where the real Ye Zhiqiu has gone?

99
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,680
Enough.

100
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,760
Rachel.

101
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,440
Ever since you installed surveillance in Zhiqiu's home,

102
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,800
you've been acting abnormally.

103
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,360
Don't you realize that?

104
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,920
I didn't install any surveillance.

105
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,720
Why so loud?

106
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,760
What's wrong?

107
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,120
Zhiqiu isn't your cash cow

108
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,170
or your personal property.

109
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,240
After ten years together, let's part on good terms.

110
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,570
Stop harassing Zhiqiu.

111
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,740
Xiangyang.

112
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,690
The real Zhiqiu is in danger right now.

113
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,160
You won't even investigate

114
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,760
and just tell me to walk away?

115
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
Are you too stupid to see it,

116
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,420
or do you know what's really going on?

117
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,580
Xiangyang.

118
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,240
You don't care about Zhiqiu at all.

119
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,240
Rachel,

120
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,170
you should see a doctor.

121
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,080
Don't put on an act with me.

122
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,980
Zhiqiu is in danger right now.

123
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,360
You won't go?

124
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:10,920
Fine.

125
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,040
I'll go.

126
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,420
I never expected this.

127
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,240
I just went to Korea for surgery.

128
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,640
She's acting like she's gone crazy.

129
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,680
Zhiqiu's return this time

130
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,080
seems really different.

131
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,370
I never expected

132
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,000
you would sing so well today.

133
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:42,920
What?

134
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,080
Coming to blame me on behalf of your master?

135
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,640
No.

136
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,640
I just want to have a quick chat with you.

137
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,010
What could we possibly have to talk about?

138
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,720
Don't make us seem like enemies.

139
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,090
I know something

140
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,660
about your condition.

141
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,800
We should go for your follow-up appointment.

142
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,960
Follow-up?

143
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,560
Right.

144
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,360
Once I'm diagnosed as crazy and locked up,

145
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,200
you'll all be happy,

146
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,200
won't you?

147
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,880
Don't you all

148
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,080
just want me to disappear?

149
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,160
Especially Ye Zhiqiu.

150
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,120
That Ye Zhiqiu.

151
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,800
Can people be fake?

152
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,210
Don't you feel anything at all?

153
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,920
First disappearing, then breaking up.

154
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,440
This isn't something Zhiqiu

155
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,600
would ever do to me.

156
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,020
I don't care if you all think I'm crazy or insane.

157
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,200
I must find

158
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
the real Ye Zhiqiu.

159
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,160
I still think

160
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,560
you should take care of yourself first.

161
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,520
By the way,

162
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,780
I heard the compensation is quite substantial.

163
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,080
You should accept it if you can.

164
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,800
Wait.

165
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,730
You came to see me today.

166
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,680
Do you know something?

167
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,850
Or are you planning something?

168
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,490
You said you have evidence. What is it?

169
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,930
I will get the evidence.

170
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,240
In this world,

171
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,400
everything is fake.

172
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,280
I don't believe in anything,

173
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,960
including people.

174
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,080
Then find some evidence.

175
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,020
The thing I asked you to do,

176
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,170
have you done it?

177
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,240
Good.

178
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,810
Did you bring it?

179
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,900
You brought the stuff.

180
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Where's my money?

181
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,360
The stuff is correct.

182
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,120
There's another job.

183
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,960
Are you in?

184
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,400
Tell me.

185
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,400
A list of all residents at Binjiang Gardens.

186
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,050
Get the money ready.

187
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,130
Starting from September 20th.

188
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,280
Clothes, jewelry,

189
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,340
Clothes, jewelry,

190
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,000
handbags,

191
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,820
she hasn't bought any of them.
