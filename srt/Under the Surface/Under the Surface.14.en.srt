1
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,980
Hey, Xuanxuan.

2
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,610
We've all been deceived by Shelly.

3
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,800
That ticket to Korea she showed us was altered.

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,320
What?

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:32,960
It seems

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,400
we need to take the initiative now.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,000
Before she finds Xiangyang,

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,600
we should explain the million-dollar situation clearly

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,200
to ease Xiangyang's doubts.

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,740
I told you not to pick me up,

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,020
yet you still came.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,000
First, to pick you up.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,800
And second?

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,080
There's something

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,220
I want to talk to you about.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,560
What is it?

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,050
What do you need me to do?

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,600
It's nothing serious.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,480
It's just that

20
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,580
Shelly asked to borrow money from me before.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,500
When she went to your place last time,

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,650
I already suspected

23
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,840
she was probably after your money.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,039
Just didn't expect it to happen so soon.

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,160
She ran into some trouble recently,

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,320
and since we were classmates,

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,720
I decided to help her out.

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,039
Helping her

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,480
is a favor, I suppose.

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,720
But after I lent her the money,

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,000
she insisted that 1 million wasn't enough

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,200
and wanted even more.

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,960
So I refused.

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,180
As a result,

35
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,600
she altered a ticket to Korea

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,250
and claimed I was a fake.

37
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,100
People these days,

38
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
how did they become so frightening?

39
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
People change.

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,240
Greed knows no bounds.

41
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,360
It seems

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,640
I shouldn't have lent her the money.

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,880
Don't worry. I'm here.

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,760
It's here.

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,840
So this is your big boss's office?

46
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,010
Keep it down.

47
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,329
Brother.

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,410
You two talk.

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,360
Are you finished, Mr. Xiang?

50
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,680
I have a meeting soon.

51
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,079
Get to the point quickly.

52
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,040
Mr. Xiang,

53
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,380
I want to tell you a secret.

54
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,640
Zhou Ruiqiu's death

55
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,680
is connected to Ye Zhiqiu.

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,000
She came to see me before,

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,520
saying there was something wrong with the current Ye Zhiqiu,

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,079
and then she ended up dead.

59
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,370
What exactly are you trying to say?

60
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,000
You don't believe me?

61
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,480
Ruiqiu met Zhiqiu before she died.

62
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,320
I checked the surveillance footage at Cloud Restaurant.

63
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,720
The person Ruiqiu met wasn't Zhiqiu at all.

64
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,570
She just looked similar to her.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,680
Besides,

66
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,320
Zhiqiu was at my hometown that day,

67
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,440
with my sister.

68
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,279
How could that person possibly be Zhiqiu?

69
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,399
The doctor's conclusion was

70
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,080
that she died suddenly from an alcohol-medication reaction.

71
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,640
It's written in black and white.

72
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,900
How could it possibly be Zhiqiu's fault?

73
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,920
I've already wrongly blamed her once.

74
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
I won't make the same mistake again.

75
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,480
And I won't easily believe

76
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,540
the rumors spread by people like you.

77
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,720
Fine.

78
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,890
Look at what this is.

79
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,200
I know what this is.

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,330
Money that Zhiqiu transferred to you.

81
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,650
What do you think this money is for?

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,159
This is hush money.

83
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,920
If she hadn't done something wrong,

84
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,840
why would she give me so much money?

85
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,560
Hush money.

86
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,330
I'm not making this up, Xiangyang.

87
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,600
I have solid evidence.

88
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,480
The current Ye Zhiqiu is fake.

89
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,520
You know nothing about her.

90
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,620
She had plastic surgery in Korea.

91
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,330
Do you want to know which hospital?

92
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,850
I can tell you right now.

93
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,560
Shelly.

94
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,060
The money Zhiqiu lent you,

95
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,580
she never expected you to pay it back.

96
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,960
You really don't believe me.

97
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,200
You trust that fake face of hers.

98
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,340
Ye Zhiqiu didn't lend me money at all.

99
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,560
I sent her my ticket to Korea,

100
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,760
which scared her,

101
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,960
so she gave me some money.

102
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,020
This ticket has been altered.

103
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,880
It looks fake.

104
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,920
I really underestimated that woman.

105
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,020
Xiangyang.

106
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,720
Mr. Xiang.

107
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,320
I always thought you were smart,

108
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,200
but you're just as clueless as the rest.

109
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,200
Shelly.

110
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,770
Are you done making a scene?

111
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,420
Senior, the meeting is starting.

112
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,800
I'm not lying to you at all.

113
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,320
Shelly,

114
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,180
what brings you here to see my senior?

115
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,640
Let's talk another time.

116
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,120
If you're having any difficulties in life,

117
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
I can help you.

118
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,090
What are you talking about?

119
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,600
We've been classmates for so many years after all.

120
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,000
If you have any problems,

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,730
feel free to come to me anytime.

122
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,760
Zhiqiu.

123
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,440
There's something I've been hesitating about.

124
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,120
Can you help me with some advice?

125
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,720
What is it?

126
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,840
My lawsuit with the Cold family

127
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,900
suddenly stopped.

128
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,720
Isn't it good that the lawsuit stopped?

129
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,890
I'm not sure yet.

130
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,360
We were supposed to have another court session recently,

131
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,290
but Cold Xiaoxiao never showed up.

132
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
Their lawyer didn't appear either.

133
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,720
Manager Zhang can't reach them at all.

134
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,600
We've been in this legal battle for so long.

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,800
Xiaoxiao has always refused to settle,

136
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,040
but now this matter

137
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,680
seems like suddenly no one cares about it anymore.

138
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,040
About your lawsuit,

139
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
I don't know much about it.

140
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,680
Xiaoxiao never mentioned it to me.

141
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,240
Are you still

142
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,260
in contact with Xiaoxiao?

143
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,120
We haven't been in touch for a long time.

144
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,840
Since I got together with you,

145
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,680
as you know.

146
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,120
Even back in college,

147
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,080
we didn't get along well,

148
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,120
let alone now.

149
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,000
In the future,

150
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,780
we won't have any connection either.

151
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
I'm sorry you had to go through this.

152
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,680
Isn't it good

153
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,320
that the lawsuit is over?

154
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,050
At least you don't have to worry about it anymore.

155
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,280
It's not that simple.

156
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,420
The lawsuit still needs to continue.

157
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,480
But I also hope

158
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
to reach a settlement with Xiaoxiao.

159
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,240
I don't care about the money.

160
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,559
By the way,

161
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,010
Xiaoxiao and Xie Yuxuan are good friends.

162
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,320
Could you ask her

163
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,120
what's going on with Xiaoxiao now?

164
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,320
If that doesn't work,

165
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,220
you could also ask her other classmates.

166
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,620
I'll try my best to ask around.

167
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,200
Okay.

168
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,800
Take your time with your meal.

169
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,840
I'm heading to work now.

170
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,570
I'm leaving.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,480
Hey!

172
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,820
Hey, Xiaoxiao!

173
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,650
I'm here.

174
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,760
Do you know

175
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,980
what Xiangyang asked me to do?

176
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Calm down first.

177
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,480
He asked me to contact Xiaoxiao and Xuanxuan.

178
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,280
And now,

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,280
his lawsuit against the Leng family

180
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,640
has no one to fight it anymore.

181
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,280
Xuanxuan.

182
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,900
Don't be bought by his fake kindness.

183
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,440
Focus on dealing with Shelly.

184
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,780
Listen, Xuanxuan.

185
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
We've already wasted too much time.

186
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,300
Any interference must be eliminated immediately.

187
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,160
Eliminated.

188
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,920
Shelly

189
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,000
must disappear.

190
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,640
We both saw it.

191
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,040
She's ten times more dangerous than Rachel.

192
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,840
She could

193
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,930
blow us all up at any moment.

194
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,200
We can't let her cause any more trouble.

195
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,040
She's not worth a penny.

196
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,800
We were college classmates.

197
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,130
Can't you just leave her alone?

198
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,650
That depends on her.

199
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,560
Whether she wants to give herself a way out.

200
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,900
Hey, Ye Zhiqiu.

201
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,490
I've made up my mind.

202
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,960
Give me a little more money and I'll leave.

203
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,440
The amount we discussed before will do.

204
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,240
I'll keep your secret to myself.

205
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
I keep my word.

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,120
I have no illusions about bribing Shelly

207
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,760
whatsoever.

208
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,080
But if we give her more money,

209
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,960
she could leave this place.

210
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,600
Xuanxuan.

211
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Someone like her

212
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,440
will never be satisfied. It's endless.

213
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,100
We need to take the initiative

214
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,480
to eliminate this threat once and for all.

215
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,280
But she's not our enemy.

216
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,000
We don't need to take this risk because of her.

217
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,600
Xuanxuan.

218
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,290
You don't still think she's innocent, do you?

219
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,020
All she sees now are benefits and calculations.

220
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,410
If you back off from her,

221
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,920
you're pushing yourself into the fire.

222
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,920
This is like a loaded gun.

223
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,920
If this gets out,

224
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,080
it will cost her life.

225
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,680
So

226
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,720
you can't be the one to pull the trigger.

227
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,520
But who will go?

228
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,280
Xiangyang,

229
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,360
you're back.

230
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,960
What are you thinking about?

231
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,040
Didn't you ask me to inquire about Cold Xiaoxiao's situation?

232
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,680
I found out

233
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,000
she's gone abroad.

234
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,560
Abroad?

235
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,520
Why did she go abroad?

236
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,320
Maybe she's been through too much lately.

237
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,840
She wanted to find a quiet place

238
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,960
to heal herself.

239
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,720
Oh, right.

240
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,800
This is about Shelly.

241
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,420
Take a look.

242
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,200
Some people

243
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,770
are better off never seen again in this lifetime.

244
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,280
Senior.

245
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,760
Hello, Mr. Xiang.

246
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,860
It's like this.

247
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,920
I'm planning to leave Binjiang.

248
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,650
I won't bother you anymore.

249
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,960
What does that have to do with me?

250
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,160
Zhiqiu and I are old classmates.

251
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,720
And we're not strangers either.

252
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,840
I'm in a bit of trouble now.

253
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,000
Living alone in a strange city isn't easy.

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,880
So...

255
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,520
So what?

256
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,780
Playing dumb, huh?

257
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,160
Let's do this.

258
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,220
Lend me some money.

259
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,530
Consider it helping me out.

260
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,100
I suggest you leave here as soon as possible.

261
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,130
You've worked so hard to get clean.

262
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,420
Don't let having money

263
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,220
lead you back to drugs.

264
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,770
Where did you come from?

265
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,320
Shelly.

266
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,400
I sympathize with what you've been through,

267
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,160
but you can't keep making the same mistakes.

268
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,020
And I can't support you jumping into the fire again.

269
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,920
Who do you think you are, some kind of saint?

270
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,340
How did you make your fortune?

271
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,020
You think I don't know?

272
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,500
How are you any different from me?

273
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,740
You'll end up destroying yourself sooner or later.

274
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:33,960
Shelly.

275
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,440
What's really going on with you?

276
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,480
Tell me.

277
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,240
I can help you.

278
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,640
You can't help me.

279
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,440
Senior.

280
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,000
Shelly,

281
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,680
what's wrong?

282
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,320
What? Feeling sorry for her?

283
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,640
No.

284
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,760
I'm just concerned about

285
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,130
her condition just now.

286
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,280
I asked you to investigate Shelly.

287
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,480
What did you find out?

288
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,520
I...

289
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
You already know,

290
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,720
but you don't want to tell me.

291
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,600
No, Senior.

292
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,640
She's already quit drugs.

293
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,160
Can we drop this subject?

294
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,360
She was just asking me for money.

295
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,160
Xiaodi,

296
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,660
stay away from her.

297
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,720
Ye Zhiqiu

298
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,080
Xie Yuxuan

299
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,119
Leng Xiaoxiao

300
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,050
Just wait. All of you just wait.

301
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,599
It's me.

302
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,760
That hospital I asked you to investigate last time,

303
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,319
keep investigating it for me,

304
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,920
look into one of the clients,

305
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,040
or possibly two.

306
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:22,920
I have money.

307
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,700
I'll give you one million.

308
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,420
I'll transfer it to you today.

309
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,900
She owes a lot of money.

310
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,680
She must be desperate for cash right now.

311
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,200
Xiaodi.

312
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,560
This matter,

313
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,720
you must resolve it for me as soon as possible.

314
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,450
If it's really not possible...

315
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,380
Send someone to Hong Ming's place

316
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,800
to see if there are any leads on Xie Yuxuan.

317
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,400
Remember.

318
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,420
Don't tell anyone about this,

319
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,440
including Zhiqiu.
