1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,960
In the middle of nowhere,

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:10,450
I'd never want to do this kind of job again.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,000
What's that thing?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,460
It looks like a human foot.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,320
Where?

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,900
You must be seeing things.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,259
There was definitely a foot just now.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,280
What foot?

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,220
You really think you're a cop.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,580
Let's go, let's go.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,010
Let's go.

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,640
Not a cop, a security guard.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,640
Let's go.

14
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,289
It's Xiangyang.

15
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
Tonight he's been

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,330
looking for Ye Zhiqiu all evening.

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
What should we do?

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,039
Just received an urgent notice.

19
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,360
Need to go abroad immediately.

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,690
Will contact when back.

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,880
Zhiqiu.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,280
Today is my birthday.

23
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,759
I have a birthday wish.

24
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:38,920
Zhiqiu.

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,039
Will you be my girlfriend?

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,160
Xiaoxiao,

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:47,960
marry me.

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:49,970
Don't worry.

29
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,840
How much did Xiangyang take?

30
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,970
I'll make him pay back every penny with interest.

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,850
Three, two, one.

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,040
Take another one.

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,500
Zhiqiu.

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,880
Xiaoxiao.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,600
Xiaoxiao.

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,880
Wrong person again.

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,160
Your backs look so similar.

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,220
Just like sisters.

39
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,280
Wait till I come back.

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,340
I'll give you a big birthday present.

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,560
Xiangyang.

42
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,980
Your beloved Ye Zhiqiu will be back soon.

43
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,180
Enjoy it while you can.

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,000
Zhiqiu.

45
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,360
Did you sleep well last night?

46
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,850
When are you planning to come to the office today?

47
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,120
I'm planning to go abroad for a while.

48
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,250
I'll leave the company matters to you.

49
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,120
Mr. Zhao.

50
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,760
Hello, this is Rachel.

51
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:22,840
Hello.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Did Mr. Zhao call you?

53
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,130
Mr. Zhao has arranged everything.

54
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,280
I'd like to see

55
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,640
the surveillance footage from Building 1, Unit 3 elevator from last night.

56
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,370
Here you are.

57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,560
Could you zoom in for me?

58
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,000
Sure.

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,400
Why did you go abroad?

60
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,660
Zhiqiu.

61
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,540
Who did you go abroad with?

62
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,450
With an old friend. Why?

63
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,840
Is it your friend from Binjiang Art Garden?

64
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,280
You have so many scheduled appearances

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,640
and you just left without warning.

66
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,160
I couldn't sleep all night.

67
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,200
I was worried something might happen to you.

68
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,000
Afraid you had no one to take care of you.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,060
Who did you go with?

70
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,010
Don't worry.

71
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,820
I'll take good care of myself.

72
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,960
Xuanxuan.

73
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,880
From today on,

74
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,240
you are the real Ye Zhiqiu.

75
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,840
As long as we can find out the cause of Hong Ming's death,

76
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,240
I'll do whatever you ask.

77
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,640
Anything.

78
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,700
Then let's bring Ye Zhiqiu

79
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,800
back to life.

80
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,770
You'll become Ye Zhiqiu

81
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,480
and get close to Xiangyang.

82
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,440
This is insane.

83
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,720
Besides, how could Xiangyang

84
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,120
not recognize Ye Zhiqiu?

85
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,440
You said it yourself,

86
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,000
they haven't seen each other for ten years.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
Does he know who Ye Zhiqiu is now?

88
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,610
What he's obsessed with

89
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,560
is just a fantasy in his mind.

90
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,480
Xuanxuan,

91
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,840
think about Hong Ming.

92
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,880
How did he die?

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,760
Why should Xiangyang get away with it?

94
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,200
This is your only chance

95
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,600
to get close to him

96
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,480
and dig out the truth.

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
To get justice.

98
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,440
Zhiqiu.

99
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,220
What are you doing?

100
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,280
I suddenly feel empty inside today.

101
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,320
Is your empty heart

102
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,060
because I'm not there?

103
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,000
Today will be cloudy.

104
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,920
with temperatures between 15 and 22 degrees Celsius.

105
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,560
There might be light rain in the afternoon.

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Please take a raincoat if you go out.

107
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,920
Got it.

108
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,120
Drive safely.

109
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,240
I've been doing well lately.

110
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,570
You don't need to worry.

111
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,320
Zhiqiu.

112
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,320
It's been two months already.

113
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,850
Have you been resting well?

114
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,360
Let's talk about your upcoming work schedule.

115
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,840
I know you've been thinking about it.

116
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,440
I'd like to rest a bit longer.

117
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,330
A day apart feels like three years.

118
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,450
How much longer until I can see you?

119
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,159
Soon.

120
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,810
I'm about to rush to you.

121
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,680
Are you ready, Xuanxuan?

122
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,120
It's Ye Zhiqiu.

123
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,140
What's being revealed now

124
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,040
is your new life.

125
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,880
Xuanxuan.

126
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,480
Trust me.

127
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,250
You're very close to becoming her now.

128
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,530
Just be a little braver.

129
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,480
And you'll truly be Ye Zhiqiu.

130
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,560
Xiaoxiao.

131
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,600
Xiaoxiao.

132
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,520
Xiaoxiao.

133
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,820
Why does my voice sound like this?

134
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,320
I...

135
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,720
I'm still very different

136
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,760
from Ye Zhiqiu.

137
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,760
To become Ye Zhiqiu,

138
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,010
your voice is also crucial.

139
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,400
Don't you remember

140
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,530
you just had vocal cord polyp surgery?

141
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,960
It needs time to heal.

142
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,520
Relax.

143
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,260
Practice more,

144
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,240
and it will get more perfect.

145
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,040
Trust me,

146
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,410
you're already very close to being Ye Zhiqiu.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,520
But...

148
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,840
but I'm not Ye Zhiqiu after all.

149
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,320
Even if I can fool

150
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,680
Xiangyang who hasn't seen her for years,

151
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,010
I can't deceive Rachel who lives with her.

152
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,080
And all those fans.

153
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,760
How can I face them?

154
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,720
That's why the first thing to do when you return

155
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,180
is to announce your retirement from acting.

156
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,720
Can I really do this?

157
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,080
I used to despise this face,

158
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,600
but now I love it just as much.

159
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,980
After all, only she

160
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,960
can help us reclaim everything we've lost.

161
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,120
Can I really?

162
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,480
Meijia came to demand the penalty fee.

163
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,400
I'm broke.

164
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,880
I mortgaged my house to the bank.

165
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,500
Zhiqiu,

166
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
where are you?

167
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,360
I've rested enough.

168
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
I'll be back soon.

169
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,860
When you come back,

170
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,840
I'd like to invite you to Yuelong Resort.

171
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,240
Consider it a belated birthday gift for me.

172
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,640
This is a pearl earpiece.

173
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,570
It adheres to your eardrum.

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,080
This is the main unit.

175
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,540
Just touch it to turn it on.

176
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,540
It looks like normal jewelry.

177
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,800
No one will notice it.

178
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
We'll use this

179
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,640
for our covert communications.

180
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,620
Xiangyang.

181
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,360
Zhiqiu, I'm here.

182
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,490
I'll wait for you in the garage.

183
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,840
Xiaoxiao.

184
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,840
Can I really do this?

185
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,720
Remember,

186
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,920
you are Ye Zhiqiu.

187
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,360
Face him bravely.

188
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Don't be nervous.

189
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,600
Be confident.

190
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,520
Zhiqiu, long time no see.

191
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,650
Long time no see.

192
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,080
Welcome back.

193
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,760
What's wrong with your voice? Do you have a cold?

194
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,820
Vocal cord polyps.

195
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,720
I'm trying conservative treatment.

196
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,080
I have polyps on my vocal cords.

197
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,240
I'm still undergoing treatment.

198
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,900
Recovery will take some time.

199
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,650
Let's go.

200
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:03,640
Zhiqiu.

201
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,840
I want to ask you for a birthday gift.

202
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,490
What kind of birthday gift do you want?

203
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,400
Not being able to hold onto you back then

204
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,200
is my biggest regret.

205
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,360
Now

206
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,880
I don't want to wait anymore.

207
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,240
I want you.

208
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,560
Say yes to him.

209
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:41,960
I

210
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,610
Xuanxuan

211
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,090
don't forget our original intention.

212
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,240
Only by getting close to him.

213
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,500
Only then can we know the truth about Hong Ming's death.

214
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,960
You've been gone for six months.

215
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Do you know how hard it's been for me?

216
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,640
Agree to it.

217
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,520
Xiangyang

218
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,360
You finally got what you wanted,

219
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,960
slept with your beloved Ye Zhiqiu.

220
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,080
I will also get what I want,

221
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,640
take back everything that belongs to the Cold family.
