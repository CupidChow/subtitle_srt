1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,170
She's here. She's here.

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,280
Why is she here again?

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,360
See?

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,930
You can't avoid her.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,220
If she asks you out, go see her.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,200
to verify

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,800
Am I right?

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,000
Hey, Shirley.

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:32,800
Zhiqiu.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,290
I haven't finished what I said yesterday.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,320
Let's talk tomorrow.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
See you tomorrow.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,960
Xiao Xiao.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,860
She asked me to meet tomorrow.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,160
Forget it. I'll go see her.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,760
Nothing can happen now.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,640
Any move

18
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,090
will take risks.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,520
I'll nail her to death this time.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,180
What are you doing?

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,370
You can't hurt anyone anymore.

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,440
You promised me

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,760
Rachel was the last one.

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,080
What do you think I'm talking about?

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,440
What I know now

26
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,920
is enough for Shirley to retreat.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,080
I won't hurt her.

28
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,480
Just leave our sight.

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,440
You promised me

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,730
you won't hurt Shirley.

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,530
Don't worry.

32
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,680
I promise you I'll see her tomorrow.

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,080
She won't die.

34
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,680
Okay.

35
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,090
What do you want me to do?

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,320
Xuan Xuan.

37
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,570
You need Xiangyang to love you.

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,800
I love you more and more.

39
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,759
I love him so much that I can take the initiative

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,600
to give everything to you.

41
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,200
You just need to do this well.

42
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,800
As for the rest,

43
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,120
to me.

44
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,479
Okay.

45
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,080
Okay.

46
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,400
Shirley.

47
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,800
You wanted to be a hunter.

48
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,199
But

49
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,040
I became a prey.

50
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,360
Where is the thing I want?

51
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,200
Why did you ask me out?

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,480
I can't afford other places.

53
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,880
It's so nostalgic here

54
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,560
I came to the society

55
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
I found that

56
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,880
You're the best, old friend.

57
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,240
Shirley.

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,200
Let's get straight to the point.

59
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,440
Sure.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,440
I know who you are.

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,160
I also know your target is Xiangyang.

62
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,650
What are you talking about?

63
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,159
What goal?

64
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,200
You should ask me

65
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,360
what I want.

66
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,320
What do you want?

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,480
Say it.

68
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,560
That's right.

69
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,600
Ten million.

70
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,480
Ten million.

71
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,240
You're a big star.

72
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
Is this much for you?

73
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
Why are you so surprised?

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,800
The 10 million

75
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,130
That's too much.

76
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,360
I can't take them out.

77
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,520
I knew you would play tricks.

78
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:29,920
Here.

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,900
Let me show you something.

80
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,400
This is me.

81
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,600
Right?

82
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
What do you think?

83
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Who is this?

84
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,640
This is me.

85
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,520
Are you blind?

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,360
This is not you.

87
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,560
This is you.

88
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,800
Do you know

89
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,840
how much 10 million is?

90
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I'm not in a hurry.

91
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,180
I'll pay in three days.

92
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:19,920
Shirley.

93
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,210
Are you threatening me?

94
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,440
Do you think I can take it out?

95
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,360
Can you take it out?

96
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,040
I don't know until I try.

97
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,200
I believe you can do it.

98
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,080
Bye.

99
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,159
Wait, Shirley.

100
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,900
We're old friends.

101
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,860
Give me a few more days.

102
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,890
How about a week?

103
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:51,600
Sure.

104
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,000
Deal.

105
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,580
It's easy to smoke.

106
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,260
It's for you. It's for you. It's for you. It's for you. It's for you.

107
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,280
What's this?

108
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,100
The cigarette you gave me.

109
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,800
you gave me.

110
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,280
Just follow the latest recipe.

111
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,320
Xuan Xuan.

112
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,600
I did promise you not to kill her.

113
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,320
But...

114
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,520
She had a flaw in her life,

115
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,000
yet she's blackmailing me.

116
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Hello, Xuan Xuan.

117
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
Hello, Xiaoxiao.

118
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,800
How did it go

119
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,960
with Shirley?

120
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,800
She wants 10 million won.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,640
What?

122
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,940
We don't have that much money.

123
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,600
Is she crazy?

124
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,360
You should believe it now.

125
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,220
You are soft-hearted.

126
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,039
she won't go easy on you.

127
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,960
What do you want?

128
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,100
I don't have any fantasies

129
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
to bribe Shirley.

130
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,600
A druggie

131
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,760
has no credibility.

132
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,130
What? I'm not a druggie.

133
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,240
A druggie.

134
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,280
Shirley is taking drugs?

135
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,690
Don't be sad.

136
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,810
Just be Xiangyang's little bunny.

137
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,320
and nail her to death.

138
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,720
I'll do it.

139
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,520
Hey, it's me.

140
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,380
What's the cigarette you gave me?

141
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,960
It's too strong.

142
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,250
But I'm almost done.

143
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,480
Do you like it?

144
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,210
I'll give you one next time we meet.

145
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,560
But...

146
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,640
Don't smoke too much. It's expensive.

147
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,570
It's expensive.

148
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,120
We're old friends.

149
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,800
Don't talk about money.

150
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,640
You don't need money anymore.

151
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,560
Have you prepared

152
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,240
are you ready?

153
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,000
It takes a process to raise money.

154
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,640
See you at the same place tomorrow.

155
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,720
Let me get you some.

156
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,780
Give me your phone.

157
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,940
A recorder.

158
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,040
No.

159
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,840
No.

160
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,760
Ten million is too much.

161
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,560
It takes time.

162
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,760
But since I promised you,

163
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,410
I will definitely do it.

164
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,720
Don't worry.

165
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,880
Are you kidding, rich lady?

166
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,130
You can't raise 10 million.

167
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,840
to fool the kids.

168
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,200
I have no job in the company.

169
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,240
or do anything.

170
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Where can I get so much money for you?

171
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,480
It doesn't matter if you don't have cash.

172
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,360
You're the White Moonlight of Sunny.

173
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,680
You're the sweetheart.

174
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,400
He must help you.

175
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,680
Xiang Yang and I are not married.

176
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,360
How could I get so much money?

177
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,640
I can give you one million first.

178
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,680
The rest

179
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
in installments.

180
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay.

181
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,000
Hurry up.

182
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,850
I don't have much patience.

183
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,440
But I have one condition.

184
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,200
I knew you would play tricks.

185
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,420
Get the money and leave Binjiang.

186
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,280
Don't ever come back.

187
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,730
Don't ever see me again.

188
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,160
So cruel.

189
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,240
We're old classmates after all.

190
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,080
Is it necessary?

191
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,840
Of course not.

192
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,200
But things have come to this.

193
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,680
We don't want

194
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,840
any more trouble, right?

195
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,360
Okay.

196
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,880
Deal.

197
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,280
By the way,

198
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,660
Where's the cigarettes you promised me?

199
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,140
I almost forgot

200
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,520
I almost forgot.

201
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,720
This

202
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,440
in China.

203
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,920
Only in our circle

204
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,960
in our circle.

205
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,800
But let me remind you.

206
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,320
Don't get addicted.

207
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,520
What did you add in it?

208
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,760
What?

209
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,920
It tastes familiar.

210
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,370
You bastard!

211
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,680
You bastard!

212
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,080
I learned it from you.

213
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,240
Are you in Korea now?

214
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,520
Do you have a deal? Yes.

215
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,600
Money.

216
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,320
Okay.

217
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,650
Go to a plastic surgery hospital in Korea.

218
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,010
Find someone for me.

219
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,140
I'll send you the information later.

220
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,840
I'm going out.

221
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,760
Do you need anything?

222
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,680
Shirley.

223
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,800
Hello?

224
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Hello, Xiaoxiao.

225
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,800
Did you see the message Shirley sent me?

226
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,120
That crazy woman.

227
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,860
Give her the money.

228
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,170
Calm her down first.

229
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:18,880
I...

230
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,600
I knew you were scared.

231
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,640
I've sent you the money.

232
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,170
You can leave Binjiang now.

233
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
Autumn.

234
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,090
I have something to do in Binjiang.

235
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,080
Just wait.

236
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,370
What do you mean?

237
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,000
I do have something to do.

238
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,940
I haven't visited Xiang Yang yet.

239
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,640
Our old classmate

240
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,200
We should get together.

241
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,760
Shirley.

242
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,160
That's not what you said before.

243
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,780
You really believe it?

244
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
To be honest,

245
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,860
I was worried that you would lie to me.

246
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,520
Sure.

247
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I got the money.

248
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,040
But...

249
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,840
Who are you sending away?

250
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,000
Tell me.

251
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,880
if I take your transfer record

252
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,040
with your transfer record,

253
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,680
Shirley.

254
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,640
Will he pity me?

255
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,200
Give me a zero.

256
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,400
Shirley, you...
