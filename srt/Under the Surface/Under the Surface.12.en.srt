1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,120
Hello.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,800
I'd like you to help me find someone.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,360
Why is someone asking about this again?

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,280
A young man came earlier to check the surveillance footage.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,010
And now you're here asking too.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,600
Who our customers dine with is private.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,880
As a business owner, I shouldn't gossip.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,560
Was that young man him?

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,440
Yes.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,400
I've even seen him in a financial magazine.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,440
Did he find anything?

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,360
I don't know.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,720
It's not like they died in my restaurant.

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,920
Why do people keep asking me about this?

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,960
She's my best friend.

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,460
Please help me.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,480
That's the surveillance room over there.

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,840
I'll put in a good word for you.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,770
Go ahead and ask.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,039
Thanks.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,280
Hello.

22
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,680
Here to check the surveillance footage again?

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,520
Everyone says this woman

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,920
looks a lot like Ye Zhiqiu,

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,380
you know, that movie star.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,120
This is the surveillance footage.

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,050
Look, does she resemble Ye Zhiqiu?

28
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,370
They look alike.

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,920
Exactly the same.

30
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,680
Do you know Ye Zhiqiu?

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,060
How could I possibly know him?

32
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,640
Hey, Han.

33
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,850
I heard you're good at finding people.

34
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,170
Who do you want to investigate?

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,010
I've sent you the information.

36
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,340
Take a look.

37
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,000
Whereabouts, work history,

38
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,490
and marital status.

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,320
I want it all.

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,280
Got it.

41
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,380
Three days.

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,220
Work overtime.

43
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm too old to stay up late.

44
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,880
Double the price.

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,480
I need it tomorrow.

46
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,440
Deal.

47
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,600
You're awake.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,800
You're back.

49
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,180
Move in with me.

50
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Waiting like this

51
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,800
is too hard on you.

52
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,090
I'll get you some chicken soup.

53
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,010
Move in with him.

54
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,200
Our plan was always to use marriage

55
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,730
to get Xiangyang's assets.

56
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,180
Now's the perfect time to strike.

57
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,880
Move in.

58
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,480
But lately, Shelly

59
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,850
has been constantly bothering me.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,120
After you move there,

61
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,120
Xiangyang can help you deal with her.

62
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,080
You're too weak.

63
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,820
Shelly can see right through you.

64
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,760
But what if

65
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,920
she comes looking for me at Xiangyang's place?

66
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,720
After what happened with the breakup last time,

67
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,810
do you think Xiangyang would still doubt you?

68
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,520
Okay, I got it.

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,160
The main attendees will probably be

70
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,880
the supervisory departments of our company.

71
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,000
They'll all be coming.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,520
And about tomorrow's 1 PM meeting...

73
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,420
When would be a good time for me to move in?

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
Then at 3 PM tomorrow,

75
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,140
you might need to meet with

76
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,530
Director Xiang.

77
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,610
Director Xiang.

78
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,480
Go on.

79
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,200
What are you doing here?

80
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Old classmate,

81
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,480
we meet again.

82
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,600
So you've moved.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Why didn't you tell me you were moving?

84
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,970
Xiangyang, this villa is really impressive.

85
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,540
Must cost 50 or 60 million, right?

86
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,850
By the way, where's Xiangyang?

87
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,040
Xiangyang is on a business trip.

88
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,440
What would you like to drink?

89
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,000
Anything is fine with me.

90
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,850
Oh right.

91
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,880
I felt bad coming empty-handed last time,

92
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,680
so I brought you a gift this time.

93
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,240
A gift?

94
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,290
You really shouldn't have.

95
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,480
No, it's nothing.

96
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,170
Look at this.

97
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
Look at how we were

98
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,900
so young back then.

99
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes.

100
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,090
The four of us were so close,

101
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,040
just like real sisters.

102
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,520
But now Leng Xiaoxiao and Xie Yuxuan

103
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,850
have both disappeared.

104
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,360
Where do you think they went?

105
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
I've been looking

106
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,880
for them all this time.

107
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,170
I don't really know either.

108
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,820
Here, have some water.

109
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,080
By the way.

110
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,160
I heard that plastic surgeons for celebrities

111
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,290
are really skilled.

112
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,040
The prices must be frightening too, right?

113
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,240
Well...

114
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,480
It really depends on the procedure.

115
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,200
It varies.

116
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,240
So tell me,

117
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,180
if I wanted to change my face completely,

118
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,659
how much would it cost?

119
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
It would probably

120
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,720
cost a lot of money.

121
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,600
Introduce me to your doctor!

122
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,720
Don't be so nervous.

123
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,760
What I mean is...

124
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,240
A big star like you

125
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,900
must have some good connections, right?

126
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,140
Introduce me to a good doctor.

127
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,820
Maybe they could even give me a discount.

128
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,520
Actually, I

129
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,760
don't know much about these things.

130
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,170
Under that photo we took together,

131
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,240
there's a number.

132
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,080
It's supposedly an amazing plastic surgery hospital

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,260
the kind that can even replace your head.

134
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,640
Since you've retired from acting anyway,

135
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,370
why don't you

136
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,340
come with your old classmate?

137
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,960
We could both

138
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,799
get completely transformed.

139
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,320
Wouldn't that be fun?

140
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,520
I've already retired from acting,

141
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,380
why would I need plastic surgery?

142
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,460
Have you really

143
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,240
never been to a plastic surgery clinic?

144
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,400
Show anger.

145
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,890
Ask her what she's really here for.

146
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,360
Shelly,

147
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,600
did you come here today just to mock me for being ugly

148
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,260
and needing plastic surgery?

149
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,480
Since you could find a doctor

150
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
to remove the birthmark on your arm,

151
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,520
why are you making such a fuss

152
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,580
when I just ask you for a hospital?

153
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,840
Just like a cat

154
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,640
that got its tail stepped on.

155
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,800
Shelly is greedy for money.

156
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,680
Sound her out

157
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,660
and lure her in.

158
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,680
Shelly.

159
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,400
We were roommates

160
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
and close friends for four years in college.

161
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,680
Although we haven't been in touch for years,

162
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,440
but...

163
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,720
I've been thinking about you all this time.

164
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,240
Look,

165
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,320
aren't we chatting again now?

166
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,520
What a great coincidence,

167
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,050
isn't it?

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,600
Well said.

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,440
As long as she slows down,

170
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
it proves our judgment was right.

171
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,400
Yes,

172
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,760
meeting college classmates again is definitely fate.

173
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,000
Back in the dorm,

174
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,760
we were like real sisters.

175
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,720
So,

176
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,720
now that I've left the industry,

177
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,600
if there are any good opportunities in the future,

178
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,880
we can work together.

179
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,960
You're so clever.

180
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
She took the bait.

181
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,440
Whatever she wants,

182
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,080
promise her everything first.

183
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,410
Whatever you want to do,

184
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,500
you can tell me.

185
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,480
I can help.

186
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,480
I'm quite clumsy,

187
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,050
can't handle big tasks,

188
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,540
but I'm happy to do small things with you.

189
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,720
We can work it out.

190
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,280
In the future,

191
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,000
just ask.

192
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
I'll be going now,

193
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,080
old friend.

194
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,160
I'll take this with me,

195
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,800
for when I miss you.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,040
Let me see it.

197
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,120
Did you find anything on Shelly?

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,330
Did you dig up anything?

199
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,840
I checked her background.

200
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,400
She worked less than six months after graduation,

201
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,600
then just up and left.

202
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,040
No job, no social security.

203
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,000
Couldn't even find a proper permanent address.

204
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,320
Just drifting around aimlessly.

205
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,480
Then completely vanished for several years.

206
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,240
Only rented a place in the last 3-4 months.

207
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,480
Vanished.

208
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,850
My first thought was

209
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,450
she might have gone abroad.

210
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,640
Abroad?

211
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,720
Her? Please.

212
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,280
Look at how broke she looks now.

213
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,200
She reeks of bad luck from head to toe.

214
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,160
Wait, Han.

215
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,280
Did you miss something?

216
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,720
Think about it again.

217
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,360
Quick thinking.

218
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,320
We're already on that.

219
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,580
But we can't rush this.

220
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,960
We need official proof with a red stamp.

221
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,410
You know what I mean.

222
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,460
Old classmate!

223
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,480
Long time no see, Shelly.

224
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,640
Long time no see.

225
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,250
You've changed so much.

226
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,120
You're getting more handsome.

227
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,620
Not really.

228
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,440
Perfect timing. The soup just arrived.

229
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:15,720
Please enjoy.

230
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,600
Great, thanks.

231
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,640
I ordered your favorite clay pot rice.

232
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,980
I don't like clay pot rice.

233
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,970
Clay pot rice is what Zhiqiu likes.

234
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,520
I love hotpot.

235
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,720
Let's go for hotpot next time.

236
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,380
I'll take you there next time.

237
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,920
Sure.

238
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,280
Do you still like Ye Zhiqiu now?

239
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,520
It's been so many years.

240
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,560
Now that she's with Xiangyang,

241
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,400
seeing them being lovey-dovey every day,

242
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,130
does it hurt?

243
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,370
Why would I be upset?

244
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,880
Besides, Zhiqiu rarely comes to the office.

245
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,800
I don't see her often.

246
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,480
So you still like her.

247
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,140
Stop talking about me.

248
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,520
Tell me about yourself.

249
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,380
How have you been all these years?

250
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,650
Are you married?

251
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,400
Who would I marry?

252
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,320
My whole heart

253
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,520
belongs to you.

254
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,840
Wait,

255
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,450
what do you mean by that?

256
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,410
You're putting so much pressure on me.

257
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,740
What about you?

258
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,570
Are you married?

259
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,680
Do you have a girlfriend?

260
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,000
Don't even ask.

261
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,840
I work with my senior,

262
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,320
more than 10 hours a day.

263
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,010
That's just routine for me.

264
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,280
Girlfriend? Please.

265
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,360
For me right now,

266
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,040
even sleeping is a luxury.

267
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,720
I feel like my life

268
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,320
has been sacrificed to my senior.

269
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,000
That must be tough for you.

270
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,920
Do you know Zhou Ruiqiu?

271
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,320
Zhiqiu's former agent?

272
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,260
She came to see me before she died.

273
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:19,920
She said

274
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,800
the current Ye Zhiqiu

275
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,500
is an impostor.

276
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,400
She asked me to identify her.

277
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,320
Impostor?

278
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,840
Identify?

279
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,850
What does that mean?

280
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,080
Back then, there were only four of us in our dorm.

281
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,740
Xie Yuxuan and Leng Xiaoxiao both disappeared.

282
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,810
Now I'm the only one who truly knows Ye Zhiqiu.

283
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,880
She asked me to figure out

284
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,890
who's behind Ye Zhiqiu's mask now -

285
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,560
is it Xie Yuxuan

286
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,640
or Leng Xiaoxiao?

287
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,640
No,

288
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,770
stop joking around.

289
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,160
Are you saying

290
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,600
Ye Zhiqiu is either Xie Yuxuan or Leng Xiaoxiao?

291
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,890
That's impossible.

292
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,380
I really don't need to walk you up.

293
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,680
No need.

294
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,440
My place is

295
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,240
a bit messy right now.

296
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,480
Thanks.

297
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,380
Okay, I'll watch you go up.

298
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,240
Mr. Xiang,

299
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,730
we met at Zhiqiu's place a few days ago.

300
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,680
As it happens, I've run into some trouble at home.

301
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,280
I was wondering if you could lend me some money.

302
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,600
Here, senior.

303
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,560
These are newly arrived coffee beans.

304
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,840
I've tried them. They're good.

305
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,570
Try them and see what you think.

306
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,960
How is it?

307
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,660
These beans are great.

308
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,800
Xiaodi,

309
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,240
are you still in contact with Xueli?

310
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,440
Why do you ask?

311
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,000
A few days ago, I ran into her

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,960
at Zhiqiu's place.

313
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,160
She said she wants to be Zhiqiu's agent.

314
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,760
I just had dinner with her.

315
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,420
That sounds great.

316
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,740
Hey, Xiaoxiao.

317
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,680
There's something about Shelly

318
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,319
that feels off to me.

319
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,020
She's different from Rachel.

320
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,040
But I

321
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,050
can't quite put my finger on what's wrong.

322
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,680
It's like something happened before

323
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,120
that shouldn't have.

324
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,600
Xiaoxiao.

325
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,080
I just feel like

326
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,770
she wants more than just a simple collaboration.

327
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,780
She's after money.

328
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,300
She's testing you.

329
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,130
She wants to blackmail you.

330
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,960
What should I do?

331
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,080
Xuanxuan,

332
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,840
don't have any illusions about human nature.

333
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,000
In this world, only the sun and the human heart

334
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,080
cannot be looked at directly.
