1
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,640
Look at your memory.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,650
How could you pretend not to recognize

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,000
your roommate of four years in college?

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,000
Don't tell me

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,580
the person standing in front of me

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,880
is a fake Ye Zhiqiu?

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,520
How could that be?

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,440
After all, we haven't been in touch for so long.

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,300
It's normal to have some changes.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,280
Besides,

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,080
it's been so many years since graduation.

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,920
We've all been busy with our own lives

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,980
and haven't had time to keep in touch.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,720
Yes, there are changes.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,040
You've changed

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,800
quite a lot.

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,640
It's been so many years.

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,170
As long as everyone is safe.

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,400
Sometimes,

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,920
no news

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,480
is the best news,

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,480
isn't it?

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,220
That's not necessarily true.

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,730
Things might not be so good.

25
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:23,680
By the way,

26
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,800
earlier...

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,800
You and Xie Yuxuan

28
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,480
invited me to some

29
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:31,960
class reunion.

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,079
I happened to be busy that day and couldn't make it.

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,840
You all must have had a good time.

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Just got an invitation from Xuanxuan

33
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,120
for a classmates' get-together.

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,980
Want to join us?

35
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,770
It's been so many years.

36
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,560
But I guess that young lady

37
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,280
will probably be there too.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,079
Zhiqiu, happy wrap-up!

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,440
It was nice.

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,440
I was just too busy that day.

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,400
I went and stayed for a while,

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,160
then I left.

43
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:01,960
I see.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,280
I thought you didn't have each other's contact information.

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,540
How did you end up at the gathering again?

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,720
It was Xiaodi.

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,160
He's Xiangyang's younger brother.

48
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,760
You two must be quite familiar with each other.

49
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,280
Yes.

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,200
No.

51
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Xiangyang wasn't there that day.

52
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,560
He contacted my agent.

53
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,560
That's interesting.

54
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,680
I heard your agent

55
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,920
overdosed on medication.

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,040
This girl must know a lot.

57
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,800
Ask her

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,940
if she's ever met Zhou Ruiqiu.

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,770
Do you know Zhou Ruiqiu?

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,130
Her name is Zhou Ruiqiu.

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,620
If what you're saying is true,

62
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,680
how big must their scheme be?

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,520
Give me some inside information.

64
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,120
How much is Xiangyang worth?

65
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,360
You don't need to know that.

66
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,920
Of course I need to know.

67
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,080
If I don't know their bottom line,

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,280
I won't know how big a bet they'll place.

69
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,200
Never play a risky hand.

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,050
Understand?

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,300
I don't know the exact figure,

72
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,520
but it starts at nine digits at least.

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,160
I get it now.

74
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,720
They're fattening us up before the slaughter.

75
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,519
So what we need to do

76
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,840
is to keep bluffing,

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,200
disrupt their rhythm

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
and prevent them from going all-in.

79
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,600
When they think their chance has come,

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,060
we'll fold with a perfect hand and walk away.

81
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,080
I don't know

82
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
who my opponent is this time.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,200
But I'm certain

84
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,040
she's not Ye Zhiqiu.

85
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,680
You came to me

86
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,840
because you know

87
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm familiar with all three of them.

88
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,400
I can recognize them at a glance.

89
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,080
You

90
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,080
are just too clever.

91
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,360
So what's in it for me?

92
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,800
Are you going to rip me off?

93
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,400
You're so practical.

94
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,850
Whatever you think is right

95
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,960
is fine with me.

96
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,880
Since your agent died,

97
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,610
would you like to find a new one?

98
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,480
I've already left the industry.

99
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,140
What would I need an agent for?

100
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,560
Right now,

101
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,040
I just want to live a simple life.

102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,120
That's such a shame.

103
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,440
You chose to leave just when you should've blown up.

104
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,880
That takes real courage.

105
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,440
Actually,

106
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,440
I was hoping to get a job with you.

107
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,840
Since we're old classmates

108
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,720
and know each other well.

109
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,080
I'll think about it.

110
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,400
After all, I've retired from the industry.

111
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,530
I don't have much say in these matters.

112
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,080
If I ever work on something again in the future,

113
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,540
I'll definitely call you.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,680
Great.

115
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,240
I'll hold you to that.

116
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,540
I hope this 'future' of yours isn't too far away.

117
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,210
Don't worry.

118
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
I'll be in touch.

119
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,920
Or I could contact you.

120
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,560
We know where to find each other now.

121
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,000
Alright.

122
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,010
I won't bother you then.

123
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,010
Goodbye.

124
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:23,920
Goodbye.

125
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,640
Xiangyang.

126
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,420
What a coincidence meeting you here.

127
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,400
You're Shelly.

128
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,560
Yes. Don't you recognize me?

129
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,000
Not at all.

130
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,300
Here to see Zhiqiu?

131
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,480
Yes.

132
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,720
I came to catch up with her.

133
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,640
But I'm about to leave.

134
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,640
Xiangyang, you're something else.

135
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,920
You managed to win over

136
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,280
our school beauty back then.

137
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,810
You're quite the lucky man.

138
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,260
Xiangyang.

139
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,690
What are you doing here?

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,920
Since you're here,

141
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,000
I won't disturb your lovey-dovey time.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll be going now.

143
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,820
You old classmates should get together more often.

144
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,480
That's fine.

145
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,640
We can also invite

146
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,640
Xie Yuxuan.

147
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,280
As for Leng Xiaoxiao,

148
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,440
forget it.

149
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,720
I'm leaving now.

150
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,160
Okay.

151
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,920
Call me.

152
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,610
You don't need to say anything.

153
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,480
I know.

154
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,360
Rachel Zhou left,

155
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,159
and now Shelly shows up.

156
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,320
Each one of them

157
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
has their own agenda.

158
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,140
Let's wait and see.

159
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
She definitely

160
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,080
wants something

161
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,300
and will contact you sooner or later.

162
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,560
What's wrong?

163
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,440
Did Shelly say something to you?

164
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,960
It's nothing.

165
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,560
I just saw in the news

166
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,440
that my agent died

167
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,420
and wanted to become my agent.

168
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,240
But as a retired actor,

169
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,860
what do I need an agent for?

170
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,400
Haven't you

171
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,520
moved on from Rachel's death yet?

172
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,100
It's not that easy.

173
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,180
I had to say goodbye

174
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,000
to my partner of 10 years.

175
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,600
And then you

176
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,120
suspected me of murder.

177
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,320
Zhiqiu.

178
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,360
I was wrong

179
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,049
about this whole thing.

180
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,370
I'll make it up to you properly.

181
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,480
Zhiqiu,

182
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
will you marry me?

183
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,120
Xiangyang,

184
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,810
you change your attitude faster than turning pages.

185
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,520
But marriage is a big deal.

186
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,960
I need to evaluate you thoroughly.

187
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,450
Can you accept that?

188
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,320
Fine.

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,680
I'll wait.

190
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,280
Until you say yes.

191
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,600
Well done.

192
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,760
Keep him hanging.

193
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,490
Make him believe you're the real Ye Zhiqiu first.

194
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,840
Binjiang Daily:

195
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,300
Xiang Group's International Cooperation.

196
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,320
I'm sorry,

197
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,930
the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable.

198
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,520
Please try again later.

199
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,080
Xiangyang,

200
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,640
this is Shelly.

201
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,600
Xiangyang, this is Shelly.

202
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
This is my number.

203
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,760
Old classmates, when shall we catch up?

204
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,860
Hello, Xiangyang.

205
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,820
Hello, Zhiqiu.

206
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,650
Are you busy?

207
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,160
I'm reading.

208
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,890
Not busy.

209
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,000
That old classmate of yours

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,040
called me again.

211
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
I've changed my phone number again.

212
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
It's Shelly.

213
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:37,800
Yeah.

214
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,420
She's really persistent.

215
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,720
Why don't we

216
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,040
invite her out for a meal sometime?

217
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,320
She's your roommate after all.

218
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
Avoiding her like this isn't a solution.

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,440
Let's not do that.

220
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,080
I feel like Shelly

221
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,640
is different from before.

222
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,300
You're afraid she'll cling to me.

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,920
You're so prominent now.

224
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,560
Too many people want to get close to you.

225
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,280
As for Shelly,

226
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,960
let's just not respond to her.

227
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,560
Okay?

228
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,440
Okay, I got it.

229
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,840
I never thought,

230
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,200
Ye Zhiqiu.

231
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,440
We're old classmates after all.

232
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,960
You should help

233
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,600
your old friend in need.

234
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,560
Here.

235
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,050
Have some water.

236
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
Good, have a seat.

237
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,840
Sister,

238
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
my name is Shelly.

239
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,800
Shelly.

240
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
When Rachel came home,

241
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,440
she was always on her phone.

242
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,980
Was she talking to you?

243
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,720
Yes.

244
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,320
It's me.

245
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,400
Tell me,

246
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,960
how could someone perfectly fine

247
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,960
suddenly just...

248
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,760
She never should have,

249
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,040
she shouldn't have drunk so much

250
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,530
and then died at that big boss's house.

251
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,480
Which boss?

252
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,020
Don't you know?

253
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,320
That young star she was managing, Ye Zhiqiu.

254
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,840
I think she died at her boyfriend's place.

255
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,680
He even gave me some money for the funeral.

256
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,080
When Rachel died,

257
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,010
was Ye Zhiqiu there too?

258
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,520
She was completely shocked,

259
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,000
kept holding my hand saying,

260
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,420
'I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

261
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,770
I didn't take good care of Rachel.'

262
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,720
They're both good people.

263
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,760
You're a good person too.

264
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,760
Look, it's mealtime now.

265
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,080
Why don't you sit down

266
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,060
while I make you something to eat?

267
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,960
Thank you, sis.

268
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,560
Sis,

269
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,680
I need to use the bathroom first.

270
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,210
Alright.

271
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,660
Make yourself at home.

272
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,800
How does she have this photo?

273
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,240
Sis,

274
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,080
I have something else to do.

275
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
I need to go now.

276
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,720
Won't you stay for a meal before leaving?

277
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,380
No, thanks.

278
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,040
Hello. This is April Plastic Surgery Hospital.

279
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,599
What?

280
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,300
You're really talking nonsense.

281
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,040
What?

282
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,210
You think it's a fairy tale too, right?

283
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,800
But some things

284
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,160
are just that unbelievable.

285
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,400
Go meet Ye Zhiqiu.

286
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,040
I want to know

287
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,960
if you feel the same way I do.

288
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
Could Ye Zhiqiu

289
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,800
actually be replaced by someone else?
