1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,180
The only thing I can't get over

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,850
is Hong Ming.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,600
Hong Ming.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,720
What exactly happened to Hong Ming?

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,520
You and him...

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,240
I had nothing to do with Hong Ming's death.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,900
How could I possibly harm him?

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,000
We had a disagreement over profit distribution

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,130
and argued about it.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,840
Later he went on a business trip.

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,480
He had an accident on the way.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,960
He must have been angry with me until his death.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,420
Now we don't even have a chance to reconcile.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,800
Leng Xiaoxiao and Xie Yuxuan told me with certainty

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,860
that Hong Ming's death

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,120
was your doing.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,000
Hong Ming was someone

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,370
who worked very diligently and reliably.

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,000
When I was being looked down upon by the Leng family,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,840
he was the one who encouraged me

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,700
to start over with a new business.

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,490
Me and Shi Xiaodi

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,400
were in charge of business operations.

24
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,640
Hong Ming handled everything else.

25
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,360
We had a disagreement over profit distribution

26
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,490
and argued about it.

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,530
If he hadn't had that accident,

28
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,240
he would have seen my newly drafted

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,770
profit distribution plan.

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,539
I would rather give my share to Xiaodi

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,770
than let Hong Ming feel shortchanged.

32
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,120
But now Hong Ming is gone.

33
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,610
I've become the biggest beneficiary.

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,130
I have no way to prove my innocence.

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,820
You don't need to prove anything.

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,000
I believe you.

37
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,320
Thank you, honey.

38
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,320
Qi

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,760
Qili

40
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,000
Qilin

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,200
Qilinyi

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,640
Li Yuan

43
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,240
Lin Jing Xin

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,680
Er Bei Qingxi

45
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,880
Xiaoxiao

46
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,040
I heard that.

47
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,160
Why did we get disconnected last night?

48
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,960
Bad signal.

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,800
Alright, let's not talk about this anymore.

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,460
I found a very secluded place.

51
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,600
This time

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,760
we can't fail again.

53
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,440
Xuanxuan

54
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,240
Are you having second thoughts?

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,140
You've already been won over?

56
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,160
Everything he says is nonsense.

57
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,400
It's all an act, don't you understand?

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,560
He even fooled my dad

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,020
who's such an old hand.

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,690
You're no match for him.

61
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,360
Xiaoxiao

62
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,650
Your plan depends on him making a mistake.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,200
Xiangyang

64
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,570
He has a lot of outdoor experience.

65
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,140
He won't allow himself to make mistakes.

66
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,840
So this plan

67
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,640
won't work.

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,130
Have you lost your mind?

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,960
Can you please come to your senses?

70
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,560
Do you want to live with Ye Zhiqiu's face

71
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,959
for the rest of your life?

72
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,079
I'm very clear.

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,899
I know everything you want to say.

74
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,720
My mission

75
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,040
I won't forget it.

76
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,780
I remember when we were in college

77
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,090
we never went hiking together.

78
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,900
We're not hiking here.

79
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,480
We're paying respect to Buddha.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,280
So this honeymoon trip

81
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,840
is also a pilgrimage.

82
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,440
You could say that.

83
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,080
I know

84
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,080
the most wonderful thing about a temple

85
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,680
is when the gate is about to close but hasn't yet.

86
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,540
That threshold

87
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,120
marks the boundary between the mundane world

88
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,400
and pure paradise.

89
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,720
So when we arrive there,

90
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,520
do you want this door

91
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,250
to be open or closed?

92
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,120
Closed.

93
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,280
Our worldly affairs aren't finished yet.

94
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,010
Let's just live our lives well.

95
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,920
I'd rather it be open.

96
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,800
That way,

97
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,240
I'd have one more choice.

98
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,480
Xuanxuan.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,000
You have no other choice.

100
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,480
We have no way back.

101
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,840
Let's go.

102
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,640
Zhiqiu.

103
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,720
The view here is nice.

104
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,650
Come take a look.

105
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,220
We're here, aren't we?

106
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,440
Now we're just one step away.

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,660
All you need to do is push him down,

108
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,120
and we'll be free.

109
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,050
If you can't take this step,

110
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,320
you'll forever remain a fake Ye Zhiqiu,

111
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,130
living in a nightmare forever,

112
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,570
even when dreaming,

113
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,760
you'll have to be cautious.

114
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,540
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

115
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,480
Don't leave any evidence.

116
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,400
Now.

117
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,040
Push him down.

118
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:36,980
Move in with me.

119
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,330
It's too hard

120
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,280
for you to wait like this.

121
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,920
Marry me.

122
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:51,760
Xuanxuan.

123
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,560
Push him down.

124
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,640
This viewing platform is dangerous

125
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,040
and in a remote location.

126
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,480
She must really need money right now.

127
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,400
Back then, Hong Ming borrowed from all his

128
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,200
friends and relatives just to partner with us.

129
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,330
This is my unfulfilled wish right now.

130
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,960
You don't need to prove anything.

131
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,760
I believe you.

132
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,360
Senior.

133
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,380
Sister Zhiqiu.

134
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,960
I finally caught up with you.

135
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,210
Why are you here?

136
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,850
I saw you both

137
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,240
from a distance.

138
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,760
But I just couldn't catch up.

139
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:34,960
Really?

140
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,840
How come I didn't notice you?

141
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,679
Zhiqiu,

142
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,049
mountain paths,

143
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,480
they look close but take forever to walk,

144
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,940
and they're so dangerous,

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,440
right?

146
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,200
Senior,

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,280
I came this time because there's something very important

148
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,760
that I must tell you in person.

149
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,820
How important is it

150
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,880
that you had to come all this way?

151
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,090
It's not about work.

152
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,500
It's about that matter you asked me to handle. I've made progress.

153
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,880
Can we talk in private?

154
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,240
We're both married now.

155
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,600
There's nothing she can't hear.

156
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,160
Go ahead.

157
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,440
Xie Yuxuan, the person you asked me to find,

158
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,120
I have news.

159
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,120
Zhiqiu also wants to know Xie Yuxuan's whereabouts.

160
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,050
Where is she now?

161
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,600
Xie Yuxuan went to Korea last September

162
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,840
and never came back.

163
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,840
Then let's keep looking.

164
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,640
Find someone to return her money.

165
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,240
If she doesn't want to come back to China,

166
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,300
we can help her buy property in Korea.

167
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,080
People need to make changes.

168
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,580
This is also the last thing

169
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,840
I can do for Hong Ming.

170
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,400
We're almost at the temple.

171
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,600
Let's keep climbing.

172
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,040
Xiangyang,

173
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,610
I want to go back now.

174
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,080
Go back now?

175
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,240
Yes.

176
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,770
We've already made it this far,

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,130
so it's good enough.

178
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,970
That's true.

179
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,690
People should always leave some regrets.

180
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,410
Let's go.

181
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,890
You can continue climbing.

182
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,640
Shi Xiaodi

183
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,260
I still feel very sorry

184
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,280
for not giving you a wonderful experience.

185
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,400
It's fine.

186
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,600
I'm already content.

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,860
You're so busy,

188
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,820
yet you're still willing to go through this with me.

189
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,440
Even though so many people are against us,

190
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,100
you still want to marry me despite the pressure.

191
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,200
I'm truly happy.

192
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,680
There aren't that many people.

193
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,880
It's just Shi Xiaodi.

194
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,260
I understand why he's against me.

195
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,880
After all, he's been with you for so many years.

196
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,050
He already sees you as his own brother.

197
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,880
It's inevitable that boundaries get crossed.

198
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,920
But we're still boss and employee.

199
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,080
Even if we're close friends,

200
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,640
it's not an excuse for him to overstep.

201
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,440
This isn't good for the company.

202
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,650
You're the boss.

203
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,850
His arrogance is because you've spoiled him.

204
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,290
Looks like I need to make some changes.

205
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,800
That being said,

206
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,640
getting rid of Shi Xiaodi

207
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,040
isn't going to be easy.

208
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,920
I know that.

209
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,400
Shi Xiaodi is basically Xiangyang's right-hand man.

210
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,960
Although he's not that capable,

211
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,280
he's loyal

212
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,140
and dedicated to his work.

213
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,120
Xiangyang won't easily let him go.

214
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,720
I'll find a way to transfer him.

215
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,520
Xiangyang has so many subsidiaries,

216
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,200
there must be somewhere for him to go.

217
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,520
Do you think transferring him away

218
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,080
will make him behave?

219
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,320
What do you want then?

220
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,200
At least it will reduce his contact with Xiangyang

221
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,130
and I won't have to see him as often.

222
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,120
Shi Xiaodi isn't just a ticking time bomb.

223
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,480
He's also a devoted lover.

224
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,880
He's different from Rachel and Shelly.

225
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,420
He doesn't need money.

226
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,220
This kind of person

227
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,120
is the most troublesome.

228
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,140
What exactly do you want to do?

229
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,560
He's different from Rachel and Shelly.

230
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,000
He's not here for the money.

231
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,960
He only wants to protect Xiangyang.

232
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,890
Finding Shelly -

233
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,210
what did he do wrong?

234
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,970
I'll find a way to get him out of the way.

235
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,760
Please don't hurt him anymore,

236
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,280
okay?

237
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,920
Xuanxuan,

238
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,960
this is the first time you've used this tone

239
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,090
when speaking to me.

240
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,360
This time I'll listen to you.

241
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,560
But if you want Shi Xiaodi to be safe,

242
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,040
then with Xiangyang,

243
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,760
you need to move forward quickly.

244
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Get what we want as soon as possible,

245
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,880
and all of this

246
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,840
can finally end.

247
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,680
Just now,

248
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,730
when I was looking down into the cliff,

249
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,690
I was really scared.

250
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,560
You weren't there.

251
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,080
You can't feel that fear,

252
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,720
that one wrong step could send you falling.

253
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,640
Xuanxuan,

254
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,120
although I wasn't there,

255
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,040
I've always been with you.

256
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,540
We are the same person.

257
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,840
We have the same goal.

258
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,720
Now we just need to get Shi Xiaodi out of the way,

259
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,580
and everything else will be easy.

260
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,660
His relationship with Xiangyang...

261
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,320
How forceful should I be?

262
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,400
His relationship with Xiangyang...

263
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,800
He's just a dog raised by Xiangyang,

264
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,240
a cat.

265
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,120
Loyal to his master

266
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,560
and dependent.

267
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,460
Xiangyang doesn't keep pets.

268
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,280
He wouldn't even raise a cat.

269
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,170
But that Shi Xiaodi,

270
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,570
he's like a pet that only clings to its master.

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,280
[Doesn't keep pets]

272
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,000
Isn't that a bit exaggerated?

273
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,560
Someone at the company is allergic to cat hair.

274
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,480
So we need to be careful.

275
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,120
Who's allergic to cat hair?

276
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,160
Xiaodi.

277
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:30,880
Xuanxuan.

278
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,820
What do you think of this plan?

279
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,810
Go ahead.

280
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,080
You're right.

281
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,960
I should have listened to you.

282
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,090
Let's find a way to send Shi Xiaodi away

283
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,520
on the pretext of work.

284
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,920
Then you can make your move on Xiangyang.

285
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,640
This way,

286
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,240
everything will be much easier.

287
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,080
Okay.

288
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,680
I agree.

289
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,480
Hello, Mr. Shu.

290
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,080
Are you busy these days?

291
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,600
Not busy.

292
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,860
I've already retired from the hospital.

293
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,610
Retired from the hospital.

294
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,480
There's something I'd like to ask you.

295
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,280
I have a friend

296
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,080
who's been feeling really unwell lately,

297
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,200
like they've taken the wrong medication.

298
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,400
He was allergic to cat hair before,

299
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,160
and it seems to have gotten worse recently.

300
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,400
Cat hair allergy.

301
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,680
Don't take it lightly.

302
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,080
That thing can be deadly.

303
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,840
The allergen is a special protein.

304
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,500
If exposed,

305
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,440
the throat and airways can swell up,

306
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,170
suffocating a person to death.

307
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,580
Is it that serious?

308
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,740
It seems...

309
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,920
I really need to remind my friend

310
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
not to touch it at all.

311
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,860
Xiangyang.

312
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,640
How do I look in this outfit?

313
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,840
Youthful and casual,

314
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,720
isn't it nice?

315
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,240
It is nice.

I don't think it's a big deal,

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,400
right?

321
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,920
