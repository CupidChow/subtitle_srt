1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,850
Brother.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,360
This is Dr. Zhao.

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,239
He just returned from advanced studies in Japan.

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,400
He's a psychiatry specialist

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,600
who now practices at Shenlai Hospital.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,240
Dr. Zhao, please have a seat.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,080
By the way,

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,720
Xiaodi,

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,020
have you found Xie Yuxuan?

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,440
I've used all my connections,

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,120
but I still can't find Xie Yuxuan.

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,720
Since Hong Ming passed away,

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,100
she seems to have vanished into thin air.

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,160
It seems like she's cut off contact with everyone.

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,100
Okay, you go ahead with your work.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,240
Dr. Zhao,

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,960
I have a professional question

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,200
I'd like to ask you about.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,680
Yes, Director Xiang. Please go ahead.

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,610
If a patient with bipolar disorder

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,120
is taking lithium carbonate,

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,920
sertraline, sodium valproate,

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,160
and alprazolam

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,250
along with other medications,

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,080
can they still drink alcohol?

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,440
Theoretically, it's not allowed.

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,120
It could be life-threatening.

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,720
Why do you say 'theoretically'?

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,160
Many patients with mental disorders

30
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,920
have alcohol dependency issues.

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,200
We repeatedly emphasize

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,520
that they must abstain from alcohol while on medication.

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,320
But honestly,

34
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,080
the number of patients who actually comply

35
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,210
is extremely small.

36
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,200
So you're saying

37
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,330
many people still drink while taking their medication?

38
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,840
Alcohol addiction isn't something you can just quit easily.

39
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,560
If someone is taking psychiatric medications

40
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,960
and drinking red wine at the same time...

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,080
Would wine glasses like these

42
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,410
with two glasses of wine

43
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,840
be enough to cause death?

44
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,800
No.

45
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,520
A regular dose of psychiatric medication

46
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,440
combined with a small amount of alcohol

47
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,479
usually won't directly cause death.

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,240
Unless

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,440
either the alcohol consumption is excessive,

50
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,880
or the medication dosage

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,800
far exceeds therapeutic levels.

52
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,479
The amount of alcohol you mentioned

53
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,280
is theoretically unlikely to cause a life-threatening situation.

54
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, I understand.

55
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,720
Thank you.

56
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,560
I need to go to the suburbs today to take care of something.

57
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,120
I won't be able to join you for dinner.

58
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,680
Zhiqiu,

59
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,960
where did you come from?

60
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,889
I was at the Cloud Restaurant today

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,360
and already had drinks with Ye Zhiqiu.

62
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,640
Senior,

63
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,800
Senior,

64
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,770
where are you going?

65
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,940
Cloud Restaurant.

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,490
Let's go together then.

67
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,520
I'll go by myself.

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,000
There's an important meeting at 5 p.m.

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,260
You'll chair it for me.

70
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,840
Okay.

71
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,360
Stop.

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,720
The district matters aren't settled yet.

73
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,980
I won't go there today.

74
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,850
So she really did have something going on.

75
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,610
Are you looking for her?

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,860
Did she steal something from you?

77
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,480
Thank you for your hard work.

78
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,880
Between you and Ye Zhiqiu,

79
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,810
it's just mutual benefit, each taking what you need.

80
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,680
But now you're being

81
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,840
played like a fool by a con artist.

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,440
You're still trying to be the good guy for them.

83
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,980
Are you asleep?

84
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,040
Senior.

85
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,440
Yesterday's meeting was mainly about...

86
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,200
What's wrong?

87
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,010
The mood is so tense.

88
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,440
Did you have a fight with Zhiqiu?

89
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,760
Come.

90
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,900
Then see for yourself.

91
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,120
I'll go out.

92
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,080
Xiaoxiao.

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,440
I made some desserts.

94
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
What do you think?

95
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,200
Should I bring some to Xiangyang?

96
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,760
Of course.

97
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,530
Why don't you wrap yourself up too?

98
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,020
Tie a bow and deliver yourself along with it.

99
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,160
Xiaoxiao.

100
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,570
You've been teaching me

101
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,780
to find ways to capture his heart.

102
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,700
I'm just doing what you told me to.

103
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,360
Did I do something wrong?

104
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,880
Is that why you're upset

105
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,480
and angry with me?

106
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,680
Silly girl.

107
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,940
How could I ever be angry with you?

108
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,080
It's just that someone like Xiangyang

109
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,880
is far more skilled than you are.

110
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,320
I'm afraid you'll soften up

111
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,600
and forget your mission after a few sweet words from him.

112
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,400
That's why I keep reminding you.

113
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,280
Don't forget

114
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,640
how Hong Ming died.

115
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,840
I understand.

116
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,200
Xiangyang

117
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,690
Why are you here?

118
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,730
This is a cake I made myself.

119
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,560
Would you like to try it?

120
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,620
I need to finish my work first.

121
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,650
If you're hungry, go ahead and eat.

122
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,650
I've been waiting for over 2 hours.

123
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,370
Xiangyang is deliberately ignoring you.

124
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,800
Let's go.

125
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,890
Take your things and leave.

126
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,320
In Ye Zhiqiu's dictionary,

127
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,049
there's no such word as 'wait'.

128
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,320
You look like a wife waiting for her husband's return.

129
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,919
Do you want him to discover you're an impostor?

130
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,090
Where are you going?

131
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,600
You're so busy with work

132
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,060
and don't have time for me.

133
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,600
I think I should leave now

134
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,130
and not bother you anymore.

135
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,440
Wait.

136
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,690
I'll take you out for a meal.

137
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,890
How's the taste?

138
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,850
Better than what I make.

139
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,640
I've recently learned a few new dishes.

140
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
One of these days,

141
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,060
I'll cook them for you.

142
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,360
Rachel's last meal

143
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,360
was here.

144
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,500
Rachel came to see me that day.

145
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,600
She said that afternoon,

146
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,160
you had lunch with her here.

147
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,290
And drank the wine I brought back from Europe.

148
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,480
Xiangyang.

149
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,020
You brought me here today on purpose.

150
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,450
Is there something you want to tell me?

151
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Turn yourself in.

152
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,940
I'll find you the best lawyer.

153
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,160
Rachel.

154
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,800
She stayed with me through my darkest nights online.

155
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
More numerous than all the stars you've ever seen.

156
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,860
You actually suspect I'm the killer.

157
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,340
You're looking at me like I'm a murderer.

158
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,240
Ye Zhiqiu.

159
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
The security footage is very clear.

160
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,960
You and Rachel

161
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,970
spent an hour together.

162
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,600
So what?

163
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,760
Even if I had drinks with her,

164
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,610
in your eyes,

165
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,800
having a drink with an old friend

166
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,280
is evidence that I harmed her?

167
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
Turn yourself in.

168
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't make me call the police.

169
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,840
Xiangyang.

170
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,680
Xiangyang

171
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,440
Let's end it here.

172
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,000
From now on,

173
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,440
whether I live or die,

174
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,060
whether I'm free or in prison,

175
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,920
it has nothing to do with you.

176
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,400
Hey, sis.

177
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,240
Yangzi, what are you doing?

178
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,080
I'm fine.

179
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,800
Just about to head home.

180
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,860
What's up? Something happening at home?

181
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,920
Are you driving?

182
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,770
I'll make it quick then.

183
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,480
Your girlfriend,

184
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,520
that celebrity Ye Zhiqiu,

185
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
does she have a butterfly-shaped ring?

186
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,020
She left it at my place.

187
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,440
Should I bring it to you

188
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,980
or will you come pick it up?

189
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
How did her ring end up at your place?

190
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,040
That day, Saturday afternoon,

191
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,920
she bought lots of groceries, said she wanted to cook for you.

192
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,400
She specifically asked me how to make

193
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,660
your favorite dishes.

194
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,280
That stir-fried lamb,

195
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,560
she had to try three times before getting it right.

196
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,000
She insisted on washing and cutting the vegetables herself.

197
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,530
She took off her ring because it was in the way.

198
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,160
Sis?

199
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,080
Are you sure it was Saturday afternoon?

200
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,640
Yes.

201
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,880
Around 3 o'clock.

202
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Then around 7,

203
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,780
she got a call from Shi Xiaodi.

204
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,760
When she heard you were done with work, she rushed out.

205
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,420
She left in such a hurry that she forgot her ring.

206
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,860
Sis, I've got to go now.

207
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,400
Yangzi!
