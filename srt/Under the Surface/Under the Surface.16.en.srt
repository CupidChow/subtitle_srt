1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,000
Xiaoxiao.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,720
Didn't you promise me

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,130
you wouldn't do this again?

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,480
How could you?

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,040
Xuanxuan.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,200
If we keep delaying,

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,760
it won't be Shelly who gets hurt,

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,080
but the one Xiangyang has been looking for,

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,560
Xie Yuxuan.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,370
If he could be so cruel to Hong Ming,

11
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,400
do you think

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,960
he would show any mercy to Xie Yuxuan?

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,160
Stop talking.

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,280
Please stop.

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,640
I'm begging you.

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,400
Xuanxuan.

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,840
Have you forgotten how Ye Zhiqiu died?

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,100
Have you forgotten

19
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,920
where she died?

20
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,050
You're threatening me.

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,640
I'm just reminding you

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,800
that we have no way out now.

23
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,040
Do you think

24
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,300
I'm manipulating you?

25
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,560
Does it even matter anymore?

26
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,400
One after another,

27
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,120
how will you stop?

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,600
Don't play dumb with me.

29
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,800
Only if Xiangyang dies

30
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,760
will all of this end.

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,220
Shelly went to see Xiangyang before.

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,280
She told him,

33
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,120
'I am Xie Yuxuan,'

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,079
but he didn't believe her.

35
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,290
If he completely disbelieved Shelly,

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,640
why would he send Shi Xiaodi to find you?

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,920
Don't listen to what he says,

38
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,880
watch what he does.

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,480
Enough,

40
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,100
crying won't help.

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,480
Next,

42
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
I'll handle this.

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,400
None of this concerns you.

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,700
You just need to

45
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,400
play your role as Ye Zhiqiu well.

46
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,560
Also,

47
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,850
accept Xiangyang's proposal,

48
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,160
get married quickly,

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,460
and take back everything that belongs to us.

50
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,240
Only then will this nightmare

51
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,280
finally end.

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,840
This is the only path left to take.

53
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,900
Shelly.

54
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,600
Shelly,

55
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,770
are you home?

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,440
Hey,

57
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,080
Feng.

58
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,360
Hey bro,

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,040
I found it.

60
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,170
You found it?

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,240
That phone number you gave me

62
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,040
hasn't been used for three days.

63
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,480
Not used for three days...

64
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,970
Where was she last located?

65
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,620
North of Binjiang.

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,040
North of Binjiang...

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,079
There's no airport there

68
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,280
and no high-speed rail station either.

69
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,370
So she must still be in the city.

70
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,960
Some things are better left unknown.

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,610
Zhou Ruiqiu is dead.

72
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,980
I'm about to leave too.

73
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,570
Some secrets should just die with you.

74
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:38,920
Shelly.

75
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,159
Okay. Thank you, driver.

76
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,159
Shelly?

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,159
Shelly?

78
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,600
Are you home?

79
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,640
Shelly?

80
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,280
Hello. This is April Plastic Surgery Hospital.

81
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,890
Haven't you considered

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,330
that she's an impostor,

83
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,480
someone who had plastic surgery

84
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,860
to look like Ye Zhiqiu?

85
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Zhou Ruiqiu, who kept saying she was fake, is now dead.

86
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,780
Do you think this is all coincidence?

87
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,720
Feng.

88
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,160
That plastic surgery clinic I just sent you,

89
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,440
I need you to check

90
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,890
all their client information.

91
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,020
That's completely unrealistic.

92
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,880
These institutions have very thorough

93
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,240
confidentiality systems.

94
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,640
Overcome all obstacles

95
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,170
and get me all the information.

96
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,800
This place

97
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,920
is wonderful.

98
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,440
If you like it,

99
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,740
I'll buy it for you.

100
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,760
Xiangyang.

101
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,320
Do you think

102
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,770
I'm with you because of your money?

103
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,360
Of course not.

104
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,560
I just want to find a quiet place

105
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,820
where you can come to relax often.

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,560
Zhiqiu.

107
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,720
I like you for who you are,

108
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,130
not for your celebrity status.

109
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,170
I know you feel the same way.

110
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,260
I've prepared a surprise for you.

111
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,220
Wait for me.

112
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,200
Brother.

113
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,040
Take a look at their group photo

114
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,440
and the phone number on the back.

115
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
Check this number

116
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,560
and you'll understand what I'm talking about.

117
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,760
Xiaoxiao,

118
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,320
Shi Xiaodi sent a message to Xiangyang.

119
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,020
Xiaodi knows about our plastic surgery clinic.

120
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:41,880
Zhiqiu,

121
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,000
marry me.

122
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,400
I do.

123
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,810
What did you say?

124
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
I said

125
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,600
I do.

126
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,900
Beautiful.

127
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,120
Why should I be sad?

128
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,380
Isn't this exactly what I wanted?

129
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,140
Xiangyang.

130
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,330
Can't control your feelings, can you?

131
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,680
Then pay back what you owe

132
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,720
to the Leng family.

133
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,040
Xiaoxiao.

134
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,320
Last night.

135
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,210
I heard everything.

136
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,520
Did you enjoy

137
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,240
last night?

138
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,600
Xiaoxiao.

139
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,520
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,360
There's nothing to be sorry about.

141
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,320
Xiangyang and I were over long ago.

142
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,400
As for you,

143
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,320
don't let physical pleasure

144
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,660
make you forget your mission.

145
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,600
Remember

146
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,400
why you're here.

147
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,080
I know.

148
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,520
Senior.

149
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,890
I'm here.

150
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,320
Senior, why are you so happy?

151
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,760
I'm getting married.

152
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,720
You're the first to know.

153
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,480
Married?

154
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,000
Senior.

155
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,740
The phone number in this photo

156
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,680
belongs to a Korean plastic surgery hospital.

157
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,330
You understand what I mean, right?

158
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,420
You came to see me just to say this?

159
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,960
Yes.

160
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:15,960
I...

161
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,930
I can't just stand by and watch you do this.

162
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,160
Watch me do what?

163
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,850
Watch you marry a woman with an unclear identity.

164
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,360
That woman might be an impostor.

165
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,040
She might not be Ye Zhiqiu.

166
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:28,980
Enough.

167
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,280
Xiaodi.

168
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,850
Help me prepare for the reception.

169
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,360
And plan the wedding while you're at it.

170
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,260
What you just said,

171
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,580
I'll pretend I never heard it.

172
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,040
Senior.

173
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,000
Just because you didn't hear it,

174
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,730
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

175
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,820
Please listen to me this time.

176
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,920
Let's postpone the wedding for now.

177
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,450
Once we've cleared this up,

178
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,640
you can get married whenever you want.

179
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,280
I know.

180
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,640
You liked Zhiqiu in college,

181
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,300
didn't you?

182
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,120
You confessed to her and she rejected you.

183
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,080
As good brothers,

184
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,540
I understand how you feel.

185
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,840
Senior.

186
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,860
That's completely different from what I'm saying.

187
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,340
We're both men.

188
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,170
Now that Zhiqiu is marrying me,

189
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,020
don't you feel even a bit jealous?

190
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Jealous?

191
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,560
Why would I be jealous of you?

192
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,400
The plastic surgery hospital you mentioned

193
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,530
was Zhiqiu's regular partner before.

194
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,600
I know everything about her.

195
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,330
So please stop worrying, okay?

196
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,920
Help me prepare for the wedding.

197
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
Draft a guest list

198
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,130
and get it to me as soon as possible.

199
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,920
Okay.

200
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,060
I understand, Senior.

201
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,060
Congratulations.

202
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,760
I'll go get busy then.

203
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,400
You play well.

204
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,160
Have you thought about

205
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,020
where we should hold our wedding?

206
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,640
I want to find a quiet place

207
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,400
to have

208
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,610
a wedding just for the two of us.

209
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,240
So it's like a honeymoon.

210
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,450
Is that okay?

211
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,520
Fine,

212
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,020
whatever you want.

213
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,480
Xiaodi.

214
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,080
Senior.

215
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,120
Zhiqiu.

216
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,320
Congratulations to both of you.

217
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I heard you got your marriage certificate.

218
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,000
By the way,

219
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,440
after the shareholders heard your good news,

220
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,640
they're all waiting to attend your wedding

221
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,300
and have a toast to celebrate.

222
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,880
We've decided to have our own private celebration,

223
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,520
so we won't trouble everyone.

224
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,580
This troublemaker

225
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,440
is up to something again.

226
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,360
How you hold your wedding

227
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,560
is your own business.

228
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,240
Senior.

229
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,000
Before...

230
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,560
I was meddling

231
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,560
and spoke out of turn.

232
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,820
It's fine. That's all in the past.

233
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,130
Let's go.

234
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:14,880
Senior.

235
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,560
It seems I can't stop

236
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,120
you from getting married.

237
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,930
Today, even if it means offending you,

238
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,400
I must speak my mind.

239
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,040
What exactly do you want to say?

240
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,720
Mr. Xiang,

241
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,730
as the company's largest shareholder...

242
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,600
Chairman.

243
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,800
Your marriage isn't just a personal matter,

244
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,680
it's also closely related to the company.

245
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,200
So?

246
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,570
Get to the point.

247
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,520
I strongly suggest

248
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,400
for the benefit of the shareholders,

249
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,200
you add a prenuptial agreement.

250
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,490
So that's your suggestion?

251
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,680
Xiaodi, oh Xiaodi.

252
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,240
You're really such a good brother to me.

253
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,600
Coming here early in the morning,

254
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,720
congratulating me with your words.

255
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,160
I knew this guy wouldn't give up easily.

256
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:00,880
Let's go with Plan B.

257
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,560
You're actually cursing my marriage to fail,

258
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,160
so we'll have to divide our assets.

259
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,089
Calm down first.

260
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,400
Changes in company shares are not a small matter.

261
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,560
Xiaodi's proposal

262
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,970
is something we should discuss properly.

263
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,079
Zhiqiu.

264
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,200
To eliminate unnecessary concerns,

265
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,930
I've decided

266
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,079
to make a prenuptial agreement,

267
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,720
so that in the future

268
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,520
there won't be unnecessary gossip in the company.

269
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,240
Zhiqiu.

270
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,400
I...

271
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,420
I'm not targeting you.

272
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm not targeting anyone.

273
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,520
I just...

274
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,520
Xiaodi.

275
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,680
I understand your position.

276
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,050
When I marry Xiangyang,

277
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,440
I've never been after what's in his name,

278
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,100
those numbers and documents.

279
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,800
I just don't understand

280
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,160
why my union with him

281
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,810
causes you so much concern.

282
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,900
But it doesn't matter.

283
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,540
After the prenuptial agreement is done,

284
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,520
I'll personally deliver a copy to you

285
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,450
for your review.

286
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,280
By then,

287
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,210
you should feel reassured.

288
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,380
Shi Xiaodi.

289
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,840
My affairs

290
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,900
are none of your business.

291
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
Senior, let's go.

292
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,930
Senior Brother.

293
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,360
It seems

294
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,800
you won't let this go.
