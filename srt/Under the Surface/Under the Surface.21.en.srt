1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,560
I had a dream last night.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,460
I dreamed about Hong Ming.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,360
Hong Ming.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,100
Hong Ming died in an accident.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,520
In my dream,

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,240
everything was so vivid.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,800
So,

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,010
what exactly

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,200
happened that day?

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,840
What's going on here?

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,770
Director Xiang,

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,560
the finance department says

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,840
you had the procurement department spend 60 million

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,280
to import several pieces of equipment,

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,840
assigned Shi Xiaodi a car worth over 1 million,

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,900
and gave him a bonus of over 3 million.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,610
What does this mean?

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,320
What about the year-end bonus

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,450
we agreed on before?

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,400
Since Xiaodi joined,

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,160
our orders have been increasing.

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,360
Providing him with a car and bonus

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,440
is completely justified.

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,170
We should now

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,960
take this opportunity to expand the company.

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,319
The profit distribution will be postponed.

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,250
Don't forget that I'm also a partner in this company.

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,960
All those days and nights of hard work,

29
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,360
let's not even talk about my contributions.

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,160
Now the company is making money, but I get nothing,

31
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,760
and I don't even have the right to question how money is spent.

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,480
Xiangyang, tell me,

33
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,610
what am I, Hong Ming,

34
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,440
to this company? What exactly am I?

35
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,039
Hong Ming,

36
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,640
the company was built on the business I brought in from the Leng family,

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,680
growing bit by bit.

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,440
Of course I have the right to make these decisions.

39
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,000
Brother,

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
that money isn't for anything else.

41
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,880
When we started this business,

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,200
we borrowed money from friends and family

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,640
and promised to pay them back by the end of the year.

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,170
Besides,

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,920
I'm a registered shareholder in this company.

46
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,250
I invested my own money.

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,280
From now on, I don't care,

48
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,280
I demand joint control of finances,

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,759
or we split up.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,600
Hong Ming,

51
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,100
how about this:

52
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,200
when you return from Chendu,

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,080
we'll discuss it again.

54
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,560
Okay?

55
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,200
Fine.

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,080
I'll take the high-speed train.

57
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,840
I'll leave this afternoon

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,360
and be back tomorrow morning.

59
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,720
How about tomorrow afternoon?

60
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,450
Is that okay?

61
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,440
Wait.

62
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,620
Take the company's business car.

63
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,560
I bought some liquor for Director Huang.

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,760
Please take it to him for me.

65
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,620
I'll have Xiaodi give you the car.

66
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,090
Alright, got it.

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,760
Hey, honey.

68
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,840
Hongming, when will you be home?

69
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,210
I made your favorite braised pork.

70
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,320
I have some bad news.

71
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,490
I don't think I can make it back.

72
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,520
I'm waiting for Shi Xiaodi to hand over the car.

73
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,640
I need to drive to Chendu this afternoon to meet Mr. Huang.

74
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,770
Xiangyang insists I deliver the wine.

75
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,760
Sounds like

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,130
things didn't go well with Xiangyang.

77
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,540
He's acting like he runs everything now.

78
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,260
It won't be easy to negotiate.

79
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,160
It's okay.

80
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,290
We'll have an answer tomorrow.

81
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,720
Let's end it if that's what needs to be done.

82
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,200
Alright, I've got to go.

83
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,130
I'm leaving now.

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,540
Take care of yourself.

85
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,920
Hong Ming had a car accident.

86
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,090
It was ruled as an accident.

87
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,740
But because of our previous disagreements,

88
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,120
even Xie Yuxuan thought

89
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,000
I didn't want to share money with Hong Ming

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,400
and deliberately arranged that accident.

91
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,240
Why can't you explain it then?

92
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,120
Maybe

93
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,640
Xie Yuxuan would believe you.

94
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,440
Everyone says

95
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,890
I caused Hong Ming's death.

96
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,400
I don't want to argue.

97
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,880
I just want to atone.

98
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Hong Ming is gone.

99
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
I want to pay off Yuxuan's debts,

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,130
but she won't even give me that chance.

101
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,900
Xiangyang,

102
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,920
these burdens shouldn't be yours.

103
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,340
How long will you keep carrying them?

104
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,480
You and I,

105
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,020
aren't we the same?

106
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,760
Xiaoxiao.

107
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,600
I was going to tell you in person.

108
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,610
But I don't think it's necessary anymore.

109
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,880
Xiaoxiao.

110
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,320
I want out.

111
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,720
Xuanxuan.

112
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,610
Are you sure about this?

113
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,780
After everything we've done.

114
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,120
Xiangyang is like a fish on the chopping block now.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,060
If you back out now,

116
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,920
not only will all our efforts be wasted,

117
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,480
but also

118
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
you'll drag us all to hell.

119
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,320
But I'm really exhausted.

120
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,080
Xiaoxiao.

121
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,360
I really can't hold on anymore.

122
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,090
Besides, Xiangyang

123
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
isn't nearly as bad as you said.

124
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,500
You've fallen in love with him, haven't you?

125
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,890
But does he love you?

126
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,180
Does he lack women in his life?

127
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,400
He's looking for Ye Zhiqiu

128
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,860
just to make up for what he missed in college.

129
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,480
Stop talking.

130
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,200
You don't know Xiangyang at all.

131
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
I saw with my own eyes

132
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,760
how he rejected Xiaolu when she threw herself at him.

133
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,820
He loves Ye Zhiqiu.

134
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,850
He's faithful to Ye Zhiqiu.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,440
But you're not Ye Zhiqiu!

136
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,660
You're the one who caused Ye Zhiqiu's death!

137
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,760
You just need to play Ye Zhiqiu well.

138
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,200
For our sake.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,680
I'll completely destroy Xiangyang.

140
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,360
I won't let you succeed.

141
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,169
The nurse is coming.

142
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,560
How are you today?

143
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,520
Everything looks normal to me.

144
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:46,880
Good.

145
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,000
If there's any change on the patient's monitor,

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,860
tell the duty nurse immediately.

147
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,320
The monitor?

148
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,160
Yes.

149
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,320
Last night the heart rate sensor came loose.

150
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,720
We thought something was wrong.

151
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,050
The alarm went off at the nurse's station.

152
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,440
Okay.

153
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,400
I understand.

154
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,760
You're awake, Xiangyang.

155
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,890
Why are you all here?

156
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,920
It's nothing.

157
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,280
The doctor will be here soon for rounds.

158
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,940
Are you feeling uncomfortable anywhere today?

159
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,880
No.

160
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Okay, I'll go now.

161
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,050
Okay, thank you.

162
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,780
Here, have some water.

163
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,280
Are you feeling alright?

164
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,220
When did you change your clothes?

165
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,560
This morning when I was washing my face,

166
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,640
I got my clothes wet,

167
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,480
so I changed into another set.

168
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,880
Would you like some breakfast?

169
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,210
I'll get you something.

170
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,080
Okay.

171
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,130
Time for your IV.

172
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
The nurse is here.

173
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,780
Xiangyang?

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,800
Xiangyang is now like a fish on the chopping board.

175
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:06,880
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,160
Yes, I apologize.

177
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,920
The medication I just prepared is completely ruined.

178
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,520
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,400
Stop cleaning. You might prick yourself.

180
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,520
What happened? What's going on?

181
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,180
Head nurse,

182
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,080
I was just about to start the IV when...

183
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,810
I'm so sorry.

184
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,210
I spilled the medicine.

185
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,520
This medication is contaminated.

186
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,680
It can't be used anymore.

187
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,720
Clean this up.

188
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,360
Please prepare the medication again.

189
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,760
Okay.

190
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,900
Sorry, doctor.

191
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,920
She's been working too hard these past few days.

192
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,720
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

193
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,180
Xiangyang,

194
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,940
I need to use the restroom.

195
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,680
Xuanxuan.

196
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,680
How is Xiangyang?

197
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,010
He's doing fine.

198
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,530
Did he get the IV?

199
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,680
Yes, he did.

200
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,210
However,

201
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,420
the medicine was changed.

202
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,120
Xuanxuan.

203
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,420
Just focus on playing Ye Zhiqiu well.

204
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,960
You don't need to handle anything else.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,080
Isn't that better?

206
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,080
Let me tell you.

207
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,640
This matter ends here.

208
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,560
No one should interfere.

209
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,240
Are you forgetting your principles for profit

210
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,360
or for attraction?

211
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,160
Xiangyang married Ye Zhiqiu.

212
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,080
Do you really think you are Ye Zhiqiu?

213
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,800
Anyway,

214
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,480
when I say it's over, it's over.

215
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,540
Give yourself a break too.

216
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,120
Don't be so childish.

217
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,000
Let's talk in person.

218
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,160
We'd better never see each other again.

219
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,440
Xuanxuan.

220
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Xuanxuan.

221
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,880
Mr. Xiang,

222
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
um, there's something else

223
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,580
I need to report to you.

224
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,560
I had a brief chat

225
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
with the police assisting with the case.

226
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,160
He said the recently missing Shelly

227
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,760
appears to be roommates with the boss lady.

228
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,460
More importantly,

229
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,250
the boss lady's former agent Zhou Ruiqiu,

230
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,480
allegedly,

231
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,520
on the afternoon before her death,

232
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,120
had lunch with someone

233
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,410
who looked just like the boss lady.

234
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,540
I already know about this.

235
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,360
Call Zhiqiu.

236
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,200
Okay.

237
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,440
If the police summon her again,

238
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,490
tell her to call you.

239
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
She should only speak when you're present.

240
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,280
Okay.

241
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,760
If there's nothing else,

242
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,840
I'll go contact the boss lady now.

243
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:28,930
Alright.

244
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:33,740
Xiangyang,

245
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,400
why didn't you tell me about such a serious matter?

246
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,600
I only found out from your subordinate.

247
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,320
I was afraid you'd worry,

248
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,680
that's why Zhiqiu and I didn't dare tell you.

249
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,940
Is the injury serious?

250
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,560
Will there be lasting effects on the lungs?

251
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:48,880
Sis,

252
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,210
it's just simple pulmonary edema.

253
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,440
If it were serious,

254
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,180
I would've been in intensive care by now.

255
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,600
It's nothing.

256
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,210
That's true.

257
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,370
If it were serious, would you still be joking around?

258
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,610
Where's Zhiqiu?

259
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,840
She went home

260
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,400
to get me some clean clothes.

261
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,530
She'll be back soon.

262
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,720
Oh, I made you something delicious.

263
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,920
Eat it while it's hot.

264
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,860
Xiangyang.

265
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,600
Sister, you're here too. Zhiqiu has arrived.

266
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,660
I made Xiangyang's favorite dishes.

267
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,560
Come, try some together.

268
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,000
Sure.

269
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,960
Here's his favorite Yu-Shiang pork.

270
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,440
And on the next layer, there's his favorite tomato and egg stir-fry.

271
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,080
Here.

272
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:33,800
Sister,

273
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,690
there's something that's been on my mind.

274
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,280
I really want to know the answer.

275
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,480
What is it? Tell me.

276
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,250
Leng Xiaoxiao has a scar

277
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
on her ankle.

278
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,400
She told me,

279
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,320
she...

280
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,080
told me it was Xiangyang.

281
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,200
She said it was evidence of Xiangyang's

282
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,690
domestic violence and sexual assault. Is that true?

283
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,980
I really don't believe it.

284
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,920
Xiangyang is such a gentle

285
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,300
and sensitive person.

286
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,890
Although sometimes

287
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,560
he can be

288
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,400
selfish and ruthless.

289
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,620
But that's just

290
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,840
his protective coloration in the business world.

291
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,100
I really can't believe

292
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,800
he would do such

293
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,800
appalling things to Leng Xiaoxiao.

294
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,640
Because

295
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,080
that day, Xiaoxiao nearly killed Mom.

296
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,360
What?

297
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,600
Xiaoxiao.

298
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,920
This is the

299
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,200
pickled radish Mom made back home.

300
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,800
Xiangyang loves it so much.

301
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,330
We brought some for you too.

302
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,000
Look at you.

303
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,040
What can you do?

304
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,400
You can't even hold a bag properly.

305
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,160
Are you okay?

306
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
It's fine.

307
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,200
No need.

308
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,960
Let me wipe that for you.

309
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,440
No need.

310
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,040
Look at these clothes.

311
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,960
Go buy yourself a new outfit.

312
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,840
No need.

313
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,400
Xiaoxiao, I'm really sorry.

314
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,880
I actually came to return your money today.

315
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,360
Look at this.

316
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,160
Return money?

317
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,520
Yes.

318
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,320
What money?

319
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,820
It's like this.

320
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,320
Didn't you lend me money

321
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,360
to buy a house?

322
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,040
I borrowed a bit extra.

323
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,720
And now,

324
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,840
I don't need the extra money,

325
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,340
so I'm returning it to you.

326
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,720
Xiangyang gave you money to buy a house?

327
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,240
Wasn't it from you?

328
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,770
Mom, what are you doing?

329
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,600
What's going on?

330
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,360
The floor is dirty.

331
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,160
What do you mean what's going on?

332
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,090
You've been keeping secret money?

333
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,600
This is money I earned myself.

334
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
I can decide how to spend it, can't I?

335
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,060
You work at Cold Corporation.

336
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,160
Isn't your salary on that bank card?

337
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,040
The card is in the drawer.

338
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,220
You took it out.

339
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,220
Xiangyang.

340
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,880
What's really going on here?

341
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,600
Mom,

342
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,040
this is all money I earned myself.

343
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,099
It's only right that I spend it on you.

344
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,960
Don't forget,

345
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,200
everything you have comes from the Cold family.

346
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,599
Xiaoxiao, what do you mean?

347
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:09,640
My mother is here for the first time today.

348
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,960
What do I mean?

349
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,000
You keep secret money and still act righteous?

350
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,060
What secret money?

351
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,839
It's money I earned myself.

352
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,369
I can decide how to spend it.

353
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,200
Why are you being so harsh with me?

354
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't forget,

355
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,880
without the Cold family,

356
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
you'd be nothing.

357
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,680
If it weren't for me,

358
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,599
would Cold Corporation be where it is today?

359
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,680
That's ridiculous.

360
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,160
You forgot how you looked when you first came to our family,

361
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
so pathetically poor. Stop arguing.

362
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,200
Xiaoxiao, don't go too far, okay?

363
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,600
Stop arguing.

364
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,400
Who are you pretending to be?

365
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,840
Stop arguing, Xiangyang.

366
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,800
It's all my fault.

367
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,720
I'm to blame.

368
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,020
I shouldn't have come.

369
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,280
I'll leave right now.

370
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,960
Xiangyang, no. I'll go by myself.

371
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,920
Mom.

372
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,240
Mom.

373
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,940
Xiangyang.

374
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:40,920
Come back.

375
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,600
If you dare walk out that door today,

376
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,840
