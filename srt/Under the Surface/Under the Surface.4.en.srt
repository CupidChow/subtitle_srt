1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,640
Here it comes.

2
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,360
Yes.

3
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,600
That's really good.

4
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,330
Indeed it is.

5
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,220
Where's Zhiqiu's birthmark?

6
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,280
It's gone.

7
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,820
[Traveler: Ye Zhiqiu]

8
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,120
Sorry,

9
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,360
the number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

10
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,900
Who are you?

11
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,780
Why are you helping me?

12
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,320
Sorry,

13
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,600
the number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

14
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,079
Hey, Xiaolu.

15
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,640
I'll send you a phone number.

16
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,900
Can you help me find out who it belongs to?

17
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,360
September 20th,

18
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,380
she has no record of leaving the country.

19
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,520
Why?

20
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,959
Before supposedly going abroad, she told me

21
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,000
she wanted to renew our contract.

22
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,720
There's an issue with my voice.

23
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,250
I should leave with dignity while I still can.

24
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,980
She's been lying to me.

25
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,960
What exactly is she hiding from me?

26
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,520
Good.

27
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,880
It sounds beautiful.

28
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,440
Good.

29
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,760
Thank you very much

30
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,920
for coming today, my friends from the press.

31
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,320
Because of your support,

32
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,840
I am who I am today,

33
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,880
and there's a Ye Zhiqiu that everyone loves.

34
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,080
Thank you all.

35
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,200
Also,

36
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,940
I want to thank the lyricist of this song.

37
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,450
It's a sunflower

38
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,090
that has accompanied me through all seasons.

39
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,160
Because of his presence,

40
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,780
my life has been enriched.

41
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,220
It makes me believe

42
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,520
that some love

43
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,080
can be eternal.

44
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,440
Okay.

45
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,280
Fine.

46
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
Who is he?

47
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,760
Xiangyang,

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,680
one of the new top 10 local tycoons.

49
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,080
The performance was very successful.

50
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,440
Thank you.

51
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,040
Ye Zhiqiu's Xiangyang Flower.

52
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,280
That's so shocking!

53
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,880
But he just got divorced.

54
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,760
He was clearly a live-in son-in-law.

55
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,960
What's going on?

56
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,280
Everyone.

57
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
I know you've all noticed

58
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,680
that my voice is different now.

59
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,330
It's because

60
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,220
I have polyps on my vocal cords

61
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,680
and need ongoing treatment.

62
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,240
Therefore,

63
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,450
I've decided

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,530
to retire from the industry

65
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,480
and

66
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,040
not renew my contract with my management team.

67
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,900
I'm very sorry.

68
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
She's no longer with Rachel's team.

69
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,600
Rachel,

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,440
we can't trace the phone number owner.

71
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,160
It's an anonymous black card.

72
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,880
I see.

73
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,010
What's going on?

74
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,960
Where's Rachel?

75
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,290
Yes, what's happening?

76
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,800
May I ask why you're retiring from the screen?

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,160
Are there any other reasons?

78
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,680
Do you have any marriage plans?

79
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,610
Are you going abroad to have a baby?

80
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,360
May I ask if you and President Xiang

81
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,020
are dating?

82
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,240
Is he your sunflower?

83
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,040
Ye Zhiqiu!

84
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,220
What are you doing?

85
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,080
Security!

86
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,040
Get up!

87
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,360
Explain what you just said.

88
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,440
Everyone.

89
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,800
You've all got your exclusive information.

90
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
Please leave in an orderly manner.

91
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,060
Xiaodi.

92
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,280
Wait.

93
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,240
She's Ye Zhiqiu's agent.

94
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,000
What?

95
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,200
Rachel.

96
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,600
Tell us what's bothering you.

97
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,130
Go ahead.

98
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,640
It's not right to just take someone away like this.

99
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,360
Let me go!

100
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,400
Let me go!

101
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,370
Calm down. Don't say anything.

102
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,810
Let her make a scene.

103
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,220
The more she talks,

104
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,520
the crazier everyone will think she is.

105
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,120
That's exactly what we want.

106
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,560
Ye Zhiqiu,

107
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,600
where have you been recently?

108
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,820
Six months ago you told me you were going abroad.

109
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,240
Why is there no record of your flight?

110
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,060
Why is there only a return trip but no departure?

111
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,880
I went by ship.

112
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,760
Rachel,

113
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,320
I traveled by ship.

114
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,720
How do you even know whether I bought a ticket or not?

115
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,160
Why do you know so much

116
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,440
about my ticket purchases?

117
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,600
Are you spying on me?

118
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,480
She's spying on her.

119
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,120
What? She's spying on her?

120
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,360
How could she do that?

121
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,020
An agent spying on her client.

122
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,480
I know you have anxiety.

123
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,440
I know you have bipolar disorder,

124
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,100
and a strong need for control.

125
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,159
But you're invading my privacy!

126
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,760
I...

127
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,090
You not only monitor all my schedules,

128
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,080
but also installed

129
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,540
so many cameras in my home.

130
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,520
Cameras!

131
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,560
Rachel,

132
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,780
what you're doing is illegal.

133
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,890
Really? She actually dared to do that?

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,680
I didn't.

135
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,920
It's okay.

136
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,520
I'll arrange someone to check your place for bugs.

137
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,780
I wasn't spying on you.

138
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,240
Someone sent me anonymous messages.

139
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,540
What's wrong with Rachel?

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,720
Why is Rachel acting like a lunatic?

141
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,560
She's talking to herself.

142
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,160
Rachel,

143
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,920
you forgot to take your medicine again,

144
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,580
didn't you?

145
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,480
Rachel,

146
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,600
did you forget to take your medicine?

147
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,060
Medicine? What medicine?

148
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,020
What medicine?

149
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,440
Why would I take medicine?

150
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,440
I'm not sick. I don't need any medicine.

151
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,640
You always have hallucinations and delusions.

152
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,080
You think everyone is out to get you,

153
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,960
and me too,

154
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,880
so you monitor my every move.

155
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,559
But like this,

156
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,280
I'm really suffocating.

157
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
Please get proper treatment.

158
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,900
Otherwise,

159
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,000
you're really driving me crazy.

160
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,440
I make you feel suffocated?

161
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,140
I've been with you day and night for 10 years.

162
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,770
I make you feel suffocated?

163
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,440
Rachel,

164
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,720
I'll have my lawyer contact you.

165
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,120
That's enough for today.

166
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,050
Let's go.

167
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
Xiangyang, she's a patient.

168
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,360
Her behavior is uncontrollable during her episodes.

169
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,320
The law states

170
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,360
she can be exempt from legal responsibility.

171
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,000
So

172
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
let's not give her a hard time, okay?

173
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,040
What? Rachel has a mental illness?

174
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,360
No wonder Ye Zhiqiu wanted to replace her management team.

175
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,120
Rachel could kill someone and not be held accountable.

176
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,380
That's too dangerous.

177
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,520
I'm not sick.

178
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,040
What illness do I have?

179
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,160
Who said I'm sick?

180
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm not sick. Calm down.

181
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,720
Don't get upset.

182
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,200
She must be crazy.

183
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,040
She's gone mad, hasn't she?

184
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,840
She's insane.

185
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,680
She normally relies on medication

186
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,080
to maintain emotional and mental clarity.

187
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,240
But she hasn't been to her follow-up appointments for months.

188
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,840
Everyone.

189
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,400
Rachel needs to take medication

190
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,600
to keep her condition stable.

191
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,180
But she hasn't been

192
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,960
to her check-ups for several months.

193
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,520
I retired from acting

194
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,780
not just because of my vocal cord polyps.

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,400
It was more because of Rachel's condition.

196
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,760
I'll get her treatment as soon as possible.

197
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,160
I apologize for Rachel's

198
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,640
behavior just now.

199
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,960
Sorry.

200
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,410
What kind of act are you putting on?

201
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,120
You're not Ye Zhiqiu at all.

202
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,160
Everyone.

203
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,840
I will quickly

204
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,160
contact Rachel's family.

205
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,680
I'll find the best hospital for her,

206
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
the best doctors,

207
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,240
and the best medication.

208
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,320
Rachel.

209
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,080
We're not just artist

210
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,360
and agent.

211
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,880
We're also sisters for ten years

212
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
and partners who fight side by side.

213
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,480
I won't abandon you.

214
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,180
Who's your sister?

215
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,120
What right do you have

216
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,850
to send me to a mental hospital?

217
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,360
You're not Ye Zhiqiu at all.

218
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,410
Where is Zhiqiu?

219
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,480
Let's go. Don't waste words on her.

220
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,010
You're not Ye Zhiqiu at all.

221
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,600
Rachel.

222
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,680
Where's the birthmark?

223
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,240
Rachel.

224
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,240
Let me go.

225
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,720
All friends present here.

226
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,840
What is she doing now?

227
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,970
You're all longtime fans of Ye Zhiqiu.

228
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,560
You all know very well

229
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,320
that Ye Zhiqiu has

230
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,400
a red birthmark on her arm.

231
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,960
But this woman...

232
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,290
She doesn't have it.

233
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,000
Everyone.

234
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,290
Because of this birthmark,

235
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,880
when I went out,

236
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,660
many fans would recognize me.

237
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,720
I felt

238
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,650
it seriously affected my life.

239
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,680
Since I decided to retire,

240
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,440
I had it removed.

241
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,680
I hope everyone can understand.

242
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
But I don't know why this

243
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,080
has such a big impact

244
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,160
on Ms. Rachel.

245
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,760
Rachel.

246
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,600
Perhaps it's the illness

247
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,120
that made you lose your empathy.

248
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,050
But don't worry.

249
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
You don't understand me,

250
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,480
but I won't blame you.

251
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,360
As long as you get proper treatment,

252
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,760
everything will be fine.

253
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,920
She's too good.

254
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,380
Indeed.

255
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
So nice to her.

256
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,210
You're not Ye Zhiqiu at all.

257
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,720
Where is Zhiqiu?

258
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,810
Let's go.

259
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:02,970
Security guard.

260
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,880
Get away.

261
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,400
Zhiqiu.

262
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,880
Are you okay?

263
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,680
What's wrong?

264
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,600
It's Rachel.

265
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,360
Rachel.

266
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,740
Where is she going?

267
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,080
I don't know.

268
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,060
Don't know?

269
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,810
What don't you know?

270
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,130
I didn't know Rachel was so seriously ill.

271
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,240
After how she treated you,

272
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,840
you still care about her so much.

273
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,770
She's a patient.

274
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,690
Her behavior is out of control,

275
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,120
and she's dangerous right now.

276
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
She needs immediate hospital treatment.

277
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,580
I'll contact her family as soon as possible.

278
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,240
Xiaodi,

279
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,930
you handle this matter.

280
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,720
Okay.

281
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,560
Hold on tight.

282
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,920
Zhiqiu,

283
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,640
you've done more than enough for her.

284
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,770
Don't overthink it.

285
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,660
Stay away from her.

286
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,300
I never expected this.

287
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,960
I just went to Korea for surgery

288
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,160
and had my birthmark removed.

289
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,320
She just went crazy.

290
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,680
Sister Zhiqiu, since you came back,

291
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,340
you really do seem different.

292
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,000
Do I?

293
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,140
How am I different?

294
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,840
More mature.

295
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,920
I think you're more approachable than on screen.

296
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,760
I never expected

297
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,160
you'd sing so well today.

298
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,720
Everyone's tired today.

299
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,850
Let's go to my place.

300
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,040
We're not just artists

301
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,570
and manager relationship.

302
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,480
We've been best friends for ten years.

303
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,280
How's that thing I asked you to do?

304
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,080
My sister contacted Zhiqiu,

305
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,120
but she absolutely refuses to come out.

306
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,080
They're childhood friends from the same hometown

307
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,880
and partly in the same industry.

308
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,300
She won't even see her.

309
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,400
I haven't been doing well lately,

310
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,040
my emotions might be unstable.

311
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,560
Even if we can't work together anymore,

312
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,280
we can still be friends, besties.

313
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,840
Zhiqiu,

314
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
please come back.

315
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,800
I was wrong.

316
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,000
Rachel.

317
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,440
Let's just go our separate ways.

318
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,360
Hello?

319
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,520
Hello?

320
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,040
If it's about work, don't bother.

321
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,050
It's not about work,

322
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,530
really it's not.

323
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,480
Between us,

324
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,360
isn't there no work left to discuss anyway?

325
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Then what is it?

326
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,280
Zhiqiu,

327
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,170
let's have a meal together.

328
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
With Shen Yixiao.

329
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,920
After all,

330
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,420
you two were always together in the past.

331
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,760
Now that you're back,

332
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,620
she hasn't had a chance to see you yet.

333
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,880
Shen Yixiao?

334
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,040
Yes,

335
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,970
your childhood friend.

336
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,480
Shen Yixiao.

337
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,600
Oh, her.

338
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,280
But I've been so busy with work lately,

339
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,080
I have so many unfinished tasks.

340
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,500
How about another day?

341
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,500
So what do you think

342
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,880
I should tell her?

343
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,720
Just say I'm not feeling well

344
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,460
and I'm recovering right now.

345
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,080
Okay.

346
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,200
We'll talk when you have time then.
