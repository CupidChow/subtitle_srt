Do you have anything else?

17
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,040
Well. Well. Well.

18
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,280
Then I'll see myself out.

19
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,439
This way.

20
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,400
OK. OK.

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,840
I didn't expect that

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,919
Her Highness is so different from

23
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,639
the Second Prince.

24
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,879
Imperial Consort Shu is quietly elegant.

25
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,080
She doesn't talk much.

26
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,639
She only talks to you

27
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:21,000
because you're known as being talented.

28
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,680
I really couldn't keep up with

29
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
her sudden change of topic.

30
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,599
Next, we'll visit Lady Ning,

31
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,960
the birth mother of the First Prince.

32
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,599
By leading troops
in the frontier fortress,

33
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,599
the First Prince owns
the military power.

34
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,919
If he wants to become the Crown Prince,

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,199
won't he gain an upper hand?

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,879
Eunuch, it's fine.

37
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:36,919
No one will know if you don't tell.

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,639
You...

39
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,159
The First Prince won't do that,

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,400
and he can't.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,800
Why?

42
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,800
Lady Ning is from Dongyi.

43
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,919
She was grabbed back by His
Majesty from a northern expedition.

44
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,400
Back then,His Majesty was injured
in the battlefield.

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,840
By taking care of His Majesty
day and night,

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,039
she was no longer a slave.

47
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,400
Later, she entered the imperial palace

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
and gave birth to the First Prince.

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,319
So the First Prince

50
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,080
is of mixed-blood.

51
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:56,840
So,

52
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,400
he can't inherit the throne.

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,560
That's also why the Empress Dowager

54
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,840
doesn't like Lady Ning.

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,759
She was originally an Imperial Consort.

56
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,120
Years ago,

57
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,199
something happened,

58
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,840
and she was deprived of her rank

59
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,719
and demoted to Lady.

60
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,879
The old lady is quite narrow-minded.

61
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,280
Mr. Fan,

62
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,719
I've not lived long enough!

63
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,719
Eunuch, don't worry.

64
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,360
I won't say that in front of

65
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,080
In this case,

66
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,680
Mr. Fan,

67
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,159
don't even think about that.

68
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,080
You should mind your words all the time.

69
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:32,039
There are so many old ladies.

70
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,479
Who knows I'm talking about
the Empress Dowager?

71
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,159
Are you Fan Xian?

72
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,599
Yes, Your Highness.

73
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,400
You have no beard.

74
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:55,879
What?

75
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,039
Your arms are not strong enough.

76
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,360
You actually

77
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,960
killed Cheng Jushu!

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,680
He was
an Eighth Dan martial arts master.

79
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,520
I don't buy it.

80
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,719
Your Highness,

81
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,319
we fought on the streets.

82
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,400
Many people have seen us.

83
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,599
You should be more robust.

84
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,560
Rougher.

85
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,560
Anyway, you shouldn't

86
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,360
be like this.

87
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,160
Fine.

88
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,439
Since Wan'er likes you,

89
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:24,959
then so be it.

90
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,439
That's it?

91
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:27,879
Right!

92
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,399
We just want to see you today.

93
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,399
Satisfied or not,

94
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,519
it's up to Wan'er.

95
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,160
Your Highness, you're really sensible.

96
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Well. Just leave.

97
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,120
Your Highness,

98
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,439
has been hesitant about

99
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,720
wants to see Fan Xian after lunch.

100
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,800
Go ahead. I'm not holding him back.

101
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,600
No!

102
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,759
Look, it's not early now.

103
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,879
So you're here for lunch.

104
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,319
No, I don't. I dare not.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,879
you're not as frank as I am.

106
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
I'm the mother of Wan'er.

107
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,920
Now that he's in the imperial palace,

108
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:09,959
why doesn't he come to visit me?

109
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,319
Your Highness, you forgot.

110
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,360
You said yourself that you don't want to

111
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,120
see him for fear
that you might be bored.

112
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,800
But now I think

113
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,160
it might be interesting to see him.

114
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,600
Is he still in Lady Ning's palace?

115
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,120
At this moment,

116
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,199
the Empress Dowager's palace.

117
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,319
I want to see him?

118
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,040
Wait!

119
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,160
Fan Xian can't be the only one

120
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,120
to have fun.

121
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,959
Ask Xiaoyi over.

122
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,959
Yeah.

123
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,720
Ask him to bring his bow and arrows.

124
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,720
Have you remembered the route?

125
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,399
I've remembered the route
from the entrance gate

126
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,319
to the Empress Dowager's palace.

127
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,000
Draw a map when we go back.

128
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:07,800
Mr. Fan,

129
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:11,160
you may kneel down here.

130
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,079
Let the Empress Dowager see you.

131
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:15,720
Kneel down here?

132
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,720
Yeah.

133
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,560
Without entering the palace?

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,199
It's the Empress Dowager's order.
Just kneel down.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,279
I've never knelt down
before His Majesty.

136
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,480
Just kneel down.

137
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,920
Forget that.

138
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,560
I'm just showing respect to the old.

139
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,600
The Empress Dowager only asks
Mr. Fan to kneel down.

140
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,680
I'll keep my brother company.

141
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,439
Can Her Majesty see me

142
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,000
kneeling down here?

143
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,120
This is...

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,839
Mind your words.

145
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,199
Eunuch Hong,

146
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,759
Who are the Four Great Masters?

147
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,480
Nanqing has two Great Masters.

148
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,439
One is Liuyun Palm Ye Liuyun.

149
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:14,399
The other is mysterious and unknown.

150
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,600
Rumor has it that he is hidden

151
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,920
in the imperial palace
of the capital city.

152
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,399
There's other speculation that

153
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,360
he is an old eunuch

154
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,160
in the imperial palace.

155
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,360
The Empress Dowager said

156
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,279
you shouldn't kneel down
for respecting the old.

157
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,279
You're kneeling down here
because as an official,

158
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,240
you should show respect
to the imperial family.

159
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,839
The Empress Dowager also said

160
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:44,879
next time you see His Majesty,
you'd better kneel down before him.

161
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,639
Can she hear me inside...

162
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,639
You could hear me, right?

163
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,879
You'd better mind your words

164
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,759
and behaviors
inside the imperial palace.

165
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,519
Not everyone has a good hearing

166
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,800
as you do.

167
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,160
The Empress Dowager
asked me to tell you.

168
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,920
Treat Wan'er nicely.

169
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,759
If you ever make her sad,

170
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,879
you'll have to die for that.

171
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,480
Eunuch Hong,
please tell Her Majesty that

172
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,439
her words might

173
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,680
have the exactly opposite effect.

174
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,120
They'll keep others

175
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,199
away from Wan'er instead.

176
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,360
Are you scared?

177
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,759
I'll treat Wan'er nicely

178
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,560
because I love her wholeheartedly.

179
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,039
I'll protect her

180
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:35,320
no matter what Her Majesty said.

181
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,080
I hope you can remember your own words.

182
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,559
Escort him out the imperial palace.

183
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,120
Eunuch Hong,

184
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,840
are you a Great Master?

185
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,720
That kid is unwilling to submit.

186
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,679
But he said

187
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,919
he'll treat Wan'er nicely
because he loves her wholeheartedly.

188
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,960
I think he means it.

189
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,519
How long

190
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:36,440
can love last?

191
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:38,159
Your Majesty, won't you meet him?

192
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,639
Among the younger generation,

193
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
he's a smart one.

194
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,919
I've seen him from a distance,

195
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,399
I don't like it here.

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,600
Why?

197
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,080
It's hard to describe it clearly.

198
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,200
I just feel that

199
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
I had seen him somewhere.

200
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,799
Your Majesty, that's impossible.

201
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,399
Yep.

202
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,279
It might be fate.

203
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,679
Just let him go.

204
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,919
Luckily, everything goes on
smoothly today.

205
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,039
Mr. Fan,

206
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
after today,

207
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,559
there won't be any obstacles

208
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,600
for your marriage with the princess.

209
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,600
I'll congratulate you in advance

210
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,480
for good luck and happiness.

211
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,080
Well, you...

212
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,360
I really mean to congratulate you.

213
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,080
And I really mean to thank you.

214
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,679
Then I'll take it.

215
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,120
The Princess Royal wants to
see Fan Xian.

216
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,759
No one has told me in advance.

217
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,960
Her Highness didn't want to
see him then,

218
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,360
but now she wants to see him.

219
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,120
Well...

220
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,559
I'm here for Wan'er,

221
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,519
so I definitely should visit
Her Highness.

222
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:13,679
Please lead the way.

223
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,720
Her Highness only wants to see you.

224
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,039
They should wait for you

225
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,840
in Consort Yi's palace.

226
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,720
Brother!

227
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:22,440
Please!

228
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,360
Her Highness is waiting for you inside.

229
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:44,320
Mr. Fan, please.

230
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,639
I, Fan Xian,

231
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,360
to Your Highness.

232
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:03,559
I heard you're a student of Fei Jie

233
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,679
and your medial skills are marvelous.

234
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,440
Now, Wan'er is also

235
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,200
getting better.

236
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
I just happen to know
some folk prescriptions.

237
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,559
Do you have any
folk prescription for headache?

238
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,000
Headache has many causes.

239
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,799
My teacher also found it a headache

240
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,120
to explain them to me.

241
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:25,639
Isn't there any good method?

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,120
I actually learned

243
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,039
massage from my teacher.

244
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,840
It might relieve the pain.

245
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,120
Try it on me.

246
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,799
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

247
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,600
Mr. Fan, you're so old-fashioned.

248
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,320
In a few days,

249
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,159
you'll become my son-in-law.

250
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:41,480
What are you afraid of?

251
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,440
I'll certainly obey the order

252
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,840
from the elder.

253
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,360
Have you started?

254
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:13,879
Have you also learned the technique

255
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,000
from Fei Jie?

256
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,320
The acupoint recognition method
is also taught by my teacher.

257
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:22,440
I do feel much relieved.

258
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,200
It's mainly for
promoting blood circulation.

259
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,840
Insufficient blood supply to the brain

260
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:27,840
might also cause headache.

261
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:32,240
I heard you've opened a bookstore.

262
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:33,960
Danbo Bookstore.

263
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Just a small business.

264
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,440
It's safer than being an official
in the imperial court.

265
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,559
After all, you took part in

266
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,399
must have scared you.

267
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,559
I remember it all the time.

268
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,720
I heard your guard was killed.

269
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,720
His name is Teng Zijing.

270
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,799
He's not only my guard,

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,039
but my friend.

272
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,120
Separation in life or death
is inevitable.

273
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,440
Your Highness, you're absolutely right.

274
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,519
Did I say anything funny?

275
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,360
Well. Well.

276
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,919
I just found those words

277
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,080
so funny.

278
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,679
How?

279
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,480
The person planned the assassination

280
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,799
was actually comforting the target.

281
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,159
Isn't that funny?

282
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,399
After all, you took part in

283
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,559
was planned by me.

284
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,080
Do you mean

285
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,879
did your friend die in vain

286
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:59,480
because of me.

287
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:02,600
Isn't that funny?

288
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,799
Why do you stop?

289
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,919
Did you plan it all by yourself?

290
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:13,200
You want to know whether the
Crown Prince was involved or not.

291
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:14,720
Yeah.

292
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,440
Though I support the Crown Prince,

293
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,320
I won't tell him everything.

294
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,960
Lin Gong pledged allegiance
to me secretly.

295
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:23,639
The Crown Prince
knew nothing about that.

296
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,799
I heard you want to

297
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,840
avenge your guard's death.

298
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,559
His name is Teng Zijing.

299
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,639
No need to remember

300
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,000
the name of a dead man.

301
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,759
Will you avenge his death?

302
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,200
Now there's no one here

303
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,039
in the Guangxin Palace.

304
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,000
What do you want to do?

305
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,879
you can do it.

306
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,559
Why are you hesitating?

307
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,120
Aren't you seeking revenge

308
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,159
all the time?

309
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,159
Is it the fairyland

310
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,679
my status?

311
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,519
Or are you

312
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,679
did your friend die in vain

313
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,279
after all?

314
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,879
I missed an acupoint just now.

315
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,200
Do you feel better now?

316
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,519
You're really good at massaging.

317
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,320
Now I'm just

318
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,599
slightly uncomfortable.

319
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,839
Then I'll massage you a little longer.

320
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,160
Your Highness, I want to thank you.

321
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,079
Thank me?

322
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,680
Thank me for trying to kill you?

323
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,519
Thank you for clearing my doubts.

324
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,119
Till today,

325
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
I finally know

326
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,359
who wants to kill me.

327
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,799
You're welcome.

328
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:45,359
By the way,

329
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,839
the assassination in Danzhou...

330
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:47,559
It was also me.

331
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,039
Was it because you were afraid that

332
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,160
I might take over the Neiku?

333
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:52,799
At first, it was.

334
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,480
Later I found you

335
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,079
so

336
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:55,759
interesting.

337
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
It's fun to kill

338
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,359
someone interesting, right?

339
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,119
Your Highness,
you are really perceptive.

340
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,960
I also find myself interesting.

341
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:04,880
Just now,

342
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,640
why didn't you kill me?

343
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,480
I wanted to.

344
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,119
Then why not?

345
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,480
Your Highness, I'll make you a bet.

346
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:16,000
Go ahead.

347
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,440
If I tried to kill you,

348
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,000
now I would be

349
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:23,599
a dead man.

350
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,319
Am I right?

351
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,039
Well, get out.

352
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,759
How smart you are!

353
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,519
I find you more interesting.

354
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,960
If Your Highness
have nothing else for me,

355
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,119
I shall leave now.

356
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,920
If there had been no one
ambushing just now,

357
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,799
would you kill me?

358
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,160
Take it easy.

359
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,559
The day is yet to come.

360
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:10,799
Your Highness will know the answer

361
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,319
to the question sooner or later.

362
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,039
I'm waiting.

363
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,160
See you!

364
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,559
Interesting.

365
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,119
Director Yan, nice to see you again.

366
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We'll meet again.

367
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,839
Master Zhuang is here.

368
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,960
Master Zhuang!

369
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,680
Take me as your student, Master Zhuang!

370
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,480
Master Zhuang!

371
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,440
Master Zhuang, take me as your student!

372
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,400
Master Zhuang! Master Zhuang!

373
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,039
Take me as your student, Master Zhuang!

374
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,599
Take me as your student, Master Zhuang!

375
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,880
Don't push! Step aside!

376
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:18,960
Master Zhuang,

377
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,240
Take me as your student!

378
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,319
Master Zhuang!

379
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,359
Step aside! Step aside!

380
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:27,839
Get out of the way!

381
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,759
Take me as your student, Master Zhuang!

382
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,119
Master Zhuang!

383
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,240
The Beiqi mission has arrived
in the capital city.

384
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,799
Zhuang Mohan is among them.

385
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,200
Many scholars

386
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
from the capital city

387
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,200
rushed to the gate to welcome him.

388
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,960
Scholars around the world

389
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,599
honor Zhuang Mohan as their teacher.

390
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,920
His visit this time

391
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,559
might affect

392
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,759
the negotiation.

393
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,279
The negotiation is up to His Majesty.

394
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:54,640
A scholar won't make a difference.

395
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,200
Anything else?

396
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,440
Head,

397
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:10,039
in recent days, secret forces
have been formed inside the Investigator's Office.

398
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,200
I was tipped off that

399
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:13,319
a lot of people want to

400
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,839
sabotage this negotiation.

401
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,480
They want to restart the war

402
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,200
so as to defeat Beiqi at one stroke.

403
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:23,720
Head, you're really perceptive.

404
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,039
The First Division

405
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,240
should take care of the things
happened in the capital city. Watch out closely.

406
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,000
What if our colleagues

407
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,480
are involved in the conspiracy?

408
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:34,960
When the state is concerned,

409
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:36,519
we should be impartial.

410
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,079
I see.

411
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,480
-You want to see me?
-Your Excellency Fan!

412
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,680
Your Excellency Fan!

413
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,519
I've long heard your reputation
as a talented youth.

414
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,880
On seeing you today,

415
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,039
You're really young and outstanding.

416
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,359
Look at you! Look at you!

417
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:03,680
You do have an imposing appearance.

418
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,519
Who are you?

419
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,759
I am Xin Qiwu,

420
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:09,920
Xin Qiwu.

421
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,240
Court of State Ceremonials?

422
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,319
Right!

423
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,160
Your Excellency,

424
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,319
now we're colleagues

425
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,200
in Court of State Ceremonials.

426
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:16,960
We should look after each other.

427
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,480
Well. Well.

428
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,960
Aren't I the Chief Musician of Court
of Imperial Sacrifices?

429
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,079
Your Excellency, from now on,

430
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,079
you're a member of Court
of State Ceremonials.

431
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,079
You're sent to work in Court of
State Ceremonials for the moment.

432
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,279
It's of great importance.

433
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,279
You should be careful about it.

434
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,440
About what?

435
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,160
Your Excellency may not know.

436
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,400
Missions from Beiqi and Dongyi

437
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,240
have arrived in the capital city.

438
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,279
I know that.

439
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,839
Beiqi is here to make peace.

440
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,799
Dongyi is here to make an apology.

441
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,559
How is that relevant to me?

442
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:55,720
As for the negotiation between
Beiqi mission and our country,

443
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,000
Your Excellency is
the Deputy Receptionist, right?

444
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,880
I...

445
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,279
Right, it's you!

446
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,119
His Majesty
has issued an imperial edict.

447
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,079
How can that be false?

448
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,599
So I rushed here

449
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:06,720
to escort Your Excellency

450
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
to Court of State Ceremonials.

451
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,799
Let's go

452
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,079
and get prepared.

453
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:15,599
It's true.

454
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,079
Your Excellency, please!

455
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,039
Your Excellency, look!

456
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,200
In a few days,

457
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
we'll negotiate with

458
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,359
Beiqi mission here.

459
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,079
By then, we'll count on

460
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:35,079
your elegant demeanor.

461
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:35,519
Wait!

462
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm still confused about

463
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,920
the whole thing.

464
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,400
What are you confused about?

465
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,079
I have no experience in negotiating.

466
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,720
Why am I chosen?

467
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:46,559
Well. Well.

468
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,640
You certainly

469
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:49,839
know the answer.

470
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:50,799
Behave yourself!

471
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,400
Because the Crown Prince

472
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,400
and the Prime Minister recommended you.

473
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,880
The Crown Prince and the Prime Minister?

474
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,119
Right. They tried so hard

475
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,000
to help you build

476
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,880
a good name successively.

477
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:14,279
Well, Your Excellency,

478
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,200
if there's anything wrong,

479
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:16,759
please feel free to tell me.

480
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,359
I will help you out.

481
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,359
Your Excellency Xin.

482
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,799
you're a fourth rank official,
while I'm an eighth rank official,

483
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,400
but you call me "Your Excellency"
all the time.

484
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:25,720
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

485
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,640
Well, there's a saying that

486
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,480
man's will does not depend on
his official rank.

487
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,680
Is there?

488
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,359
Yes, of course.

489
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Young and competent

490
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,400
as you are,

491
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,000
plus the support of the Crown
Prince and the Prime Minister,

492
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,920
your prospect

493
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,359
is beyond measure.

494
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:50,160
In addition,

495
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,039
I want to tell you a secret.

496
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:55,400
I'm also a follower of the Crown Prince.

497
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,559
I don't know myself that

498
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,680
I'm a follower of the Crown Prince.

499
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,440
Your Excellency, stop it!

500
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,680
You're making fun of me

501
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,319
again.

502
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,000
If you're not
a follower of His Highness,

503
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,480
why would he think so highly of you?

504
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:11,920
We'd better talk about

505
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,680
the negotiation.

506
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:13,960
Good!

507
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:18,079
Your Excellency, here's the thing.

508
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,839
There's someone named Zhuang Mohan

509
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,920
in the Beiqi mission.

510
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,319
You can treat anyone

511
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,920
unfriendly

512
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,519
but him.

513
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,319
Zhuang Mohan?

514
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:46,759
What're you staring at?

515
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,119
Look at that cloud!

516
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,079
You're so relaxed and carefree today.

517
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,079
Doesn't it look like a pile of silver?

518
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,880
That's definitely your style.

519
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,160
What if

520
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,000
I took all the silver back?

521
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,039
How happy my wife and daughter

522
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,279
would be!

523
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,720
Are we going back to the Fan mansion?

524
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:10,119
Wang Qinian,

525
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,160
have you ever heard of Zhuang Mohan?

526
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:13,920
I have.

527
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,519
He arrived in the capital city today.

528
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,440
All the scholars in the capital city

529
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,119
went to pay respects to him.

530
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,759
He's so respected!

531
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,880
It's known to all the scholars that

532
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,119
Zhuang Mohan is a literary giant,

533
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,839
a living saint

534
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:27,440
in the world,

535
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,640
and the teacher to all scholars.

536
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:30,680
you don't know

537
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,839
Aren't you a scholar, too?

538
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,640
I'm not.

539
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,440
You're so modest.

540
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:37,440
You've written poems

541
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,920
with universal praise.

542
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,720
You're definitely a scholar!

543
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,519
Let's go.

544
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:48,680
What's up?

545
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,039
Master Shadow.

546
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,160
Does Chen Pingping have anything for me?

547
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:56,799
Someone wants to kill the Head.

548
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:57,759
In the world,

549
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:58,960
a lot of people want to kill him.

550
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,480
They will attack in less than an hour.

551
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,960
Where is he?

552
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,279
In the Investigator's Office,

553
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:07,200
Then he'll be fine.

554
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,400
Without massive forces,

555
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,759
no one can break into
the Investigator's Office to kill him.

556
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,000
Now no one

557
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,759
is protecting the Head.

558
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,599
What do you mean?

559
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,160
Zhuang Mohan has arrived
in the capital city.

560
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,119
How is Zhuang Mohan

561
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,000
relevant to this?

562
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,000
Zhuang Mohan's arrival

563
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,680
leads to the change.

564
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,480
Everyone in the Investigator's Office
knows that

565
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,880
The only way to restart the war

566
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,759
is to assassinate Zhuang Mohan.

567
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,359
But the Head has sent the First Division

568
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:31,640
to protect Zhuang Mohan.

569
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,319
Yeah.

570
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,519
Zhu Ge from the First Division

571
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:36,559
has led all his men out.

572
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,960
Fei Jie from the Third Division
is not in the capital city.

573
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,359
Martial arts masters
from other divisions

574
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,720
have been sent out by me respectively.

575
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,559
Today, all the officials inside

576
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:46,880
the Investigator's Office
are on our side.

577
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Even so, we don't have enough men

578
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,119
to kill Zhuang Mohan.

579
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,119
Zhuang Mohan is just a cover.

580
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:58,839
The person we're really going to kill

581
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,599
is Chen Pingping.

582
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:21,599
There you are.

583
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,079
We have no way out.

584
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:30,759
Let's go to the dungeon.

585
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,119
You all know that

586
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,839
Chen Pingping is the person

587
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:37,839
preventing us from restarting the war

588
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,480
in the Investigator's Office.

589
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,799
If he dies,

590
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:42,400
the Investigator's Office
will be controlled

591
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,759
by loyal people like us.

592
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:46,599
By then, it will be very easy

593
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:47,720
to motivate His Majesty

594
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,200
to destroy Beiqi.

595
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,319
He's also a man.

596
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,440
I've exhausted my abilities

597
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:54,559
to create a favorable situation for us.

598
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,200
If we don't kill him today,
we won't have a second chance.

599
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,640
Kill Chen Pingping! Kill Chen Pingping!

600
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,799
Kill Chen Pingping!

601
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,960
Kill Chen Pingping!

602
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Once Chen Pingping is killed,

603
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,160
The Investigator's Office

604
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,599
will be controlled by us.

605
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,920
What's done is done.

606
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,599
There's no way back.

607
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,240
Let's do it!

608
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,039
Kill Chen Pingping! Kill Chen Pingping!

609
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,440
Kill Chen Pingping!

610
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,960
Kill Chen Pingping!

611
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,359
Mr. Fan,

612
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,440
Miss Lili, let's talk later.

613
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,279
We're being hunted.

614
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,880
Hunted?

615
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,559
Press that.

616
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,720
It leads to

617
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,319
the deepest part of the dungeon,

618
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,200
where the most vicious villains

619
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,039
are locked up inside.

620
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:02,759
Let's get inside first.

621
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,640
Are we safe here?

622
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,319
Not really.

623
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,759
Many people know this path.

624
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,359
They usually deliver water

625
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,400
and food to the prisoners.

626
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:21,000
Sometimes,

627
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,279
they have to pull out the bodies.

628
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,880
Then what's the point of hiding here?

629
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,160
It's narrow inside.
Maybe we can resist them for a while.

630
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,359
Then we'll have to die sooner or later.

631
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,680
It's a dead end.

632
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:35,640
Gosh! It's bad news!

633
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,160
I can't die.

634
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,119
I haven't told my wife yet.

635
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,480
If I die without her permission,

636
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,559
she will definitely be angry.

637
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,519
We're in great danger,

638
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,119
yet you're afraid
your wife might be angry.

639
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,839
Life or death, it doesn't matter.

640
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,200
What really matters is whether I've gained
permission from my wife or not.

641
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,880
You don't understand.

642
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,519
What will happen to Si Lili outside?

643
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:03,839
They want to kill me.

644
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,640
They won't leave anyone alive.

645
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,640
Give me the key to her cell.

646
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,319
You can't even protect yourself.
Why care about others?

647
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,000
The key!

648
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:16,920
Wait a minute.

649
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:27,160
He's a good lad.

650
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:33,799
What's the sound?

651
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:36,319
What's the sound?

652
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,920
Is there an internal strife
in the Investigator's Office?

653
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,359
Why do you save me?

654
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,079
Hurry up!

655
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,440
They could rush in any minute.

656
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,799
Kill Chen Pingping! Kill Chen Pingping!

657
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:05,160
Kill Chen Pingping!

658
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:10,960
Kill him!

659
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,279
What's the point of

660
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:23,920
bringing me here?

661
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,240
I still have to die.

662
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,720
I've promised you to protect you.

663
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:27,799
Even if you have to die,

664
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,920
you must die after me.

665
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,079
Go inside.

666
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,799
Your Excellency.

667
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:40,960
What's this?

668
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:42,200
I've told you about

669
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,599
the prisoners locked up here.

670
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:45,559
The most vicious villains?

671
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,480
Right.

672
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,599
One of them is still alive.

673
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,480
So many chains are used to
lock up only one person?

674
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,160
Yes, only one.

675
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,359
Will your life be saved
after looking at him?

676
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,519
This way.

677
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,799
No.

678
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,200
Hurry up and find Chen Pingping!

679
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:19,319
He's not here.

680
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,119
No, He's not here. He's not here.

681
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,480
He's not here.

682
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:22,960
Where is he?

683
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:23,960
Go inside and find him!

684
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,480
No! No! No!

685
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:28,880
Wait a moment!

686
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm going to die.

687
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,839
Can I at least satisfy

688
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:54,559
my curiosity?

689
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,240
Is he really dangerous?

690
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,519
Indeed!

691
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,119
His name is Xiao En.

692
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,480
I was paralyzed because of him.

693
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,400
Chen Pingping is inside.

694
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,960
He has no way to go.

695
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,440
-Kill him! -Come on!

696
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,760
Kill him!

697
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,719
-Kill him! -Kill Chen Pingping!

698
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,480
They've opened the door

699
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
to the secret path.

700
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,039
-Kill Chen Pingping!
-Kill Chen Pingping!

701
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,159
Catch him!

702
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:38,480
Si Lili.

703
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,519
What do I need to do?

704
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,599
Beiqi is defeated.

705
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,880
Why do you tell me that?

706
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,679
I'm nervous. I have to say something.

707
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:58,239
Actually there's another way

708
00:34:58,239 --> 00:34:58,880
to save our lives.

709
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,880
They only want to kill Chen Pingping.

710
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:05,880
Do you believe they will

711
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,679
let us go?

712
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,480
We can kill him first.

713
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,760
Then we can trade his head
for our lives.

714
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,280
This is the only way to save our lives.

715
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,320
Wang Qinian,

716
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,400
Your Excellency.

717
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,039
Let's take the risk.

718
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:29,559
OK.

719
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,360
What are you doing?

720
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:33,199
Just wait.

721
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:39,159
It's Shadow! He's alone!

722
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:39,880
Kill him!

723
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,599
-He's alone! -Kill him!

724
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:42,719
Kill him!

725
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,800
All the men outside
are martial arts masters.

726
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,039
How long can he hold by himself?

727
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,960
The noise of fighting is
further and further away from us.

728
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,719
He has killed a way out?

729
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Are those opponents

730
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,800
too weak?

731
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,079
They are all martial arts masters
above the Seventh Dan.

732
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,119
It's really not my idea.

733
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,320
What did you just say?

734
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:28,280
Shadow wants to test you.

735
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,039
It's not my idea.

736
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,199
What do you mean?

737
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,039
Test me?

738
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,320
Are those men outside acting?

739
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,519
They do want to kill me.

740
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,000
Then why do you say it's a test?

741
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,920
Shadow alone can resist
one thousand cavalrymen.

742
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,480
I don't know.

743
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,000
I've never seen Master Shadow

744
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,039
in a fight.

745
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,599
Push me out.

746
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,719
Chen Pingping,

747
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:04,199
don't die. Wait for me to get out.

748
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,199
He's afraid I might be killed by others.

749
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,719
He won't get out.

750
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:17,800
Let's go.

751
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,400
So you knew

752
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,320
they wanted to kill you?

753
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,079
Yes.

754
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,679
Yet you just let them.

755
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,639
Independent from the Six
Ministries, the Investigator's Office

756
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,719
is an important organization
with great power.

757
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:46,880
Though I'm the Head,

758
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,960
I can't guard against the world.

759
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,440
There will always be organizations

760
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,199
finding ways to plant agents

761
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,199
who are good at hiding themselves.

762
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,840
By giving them the chance to kill me,

763
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:57,119
they would jump out

764
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,679
and be exposed once and for all.

765
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,360
Wang Qinian,

766
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:24,440
Use yourself as bait.

767
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,440
Smart as they are,

768
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
they wouldn't be tricked

769
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,079
without seeing me.

770
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,719
We've walked a long way,

771
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:33,000
but we've seen no one alive.

772
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,960
This is the consequence of
walking into a trap.

773
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:39,519
I find it safer inside.

774
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
There's no sound outside.

775
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,920
It should be safe.

776
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:06,119
Would you find me ruthless?

777
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:08,079
They want to kill others.

778
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,480
It's natural for them to be killed.

779
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,320
Moving forward with a heavy burden,

780
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:14,760
they just can't help it.

781
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,880
Wang Qinian, open the door.

782
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,960
The jade is good.

783
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:05,559
Head,

784
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,280
I saw Shadow killing our colleagues

785
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:09,880
when I came back to
the Investigator's Office.

786
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:11,480
I asked him to.

787
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,239
You should be monitoring

788
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,679
Zhuang Mohan from Beiqi.

789
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,280
Why are you back?

790
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,159
Something is wrong.

791
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,360
Zhuang Mohan is missing.

792
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,719
Upon arrival in the capital city,

793
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,599
Zhuang Mohan stayed

794
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,599
in the residence arranged by
the Court of State Ceremonials,

795
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:37,960
and never came out.

796
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,639
I found it strange,

797
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,199
so I asked my man to dress up as

798
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:42,000
a servant to clean the room.

799
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:47,280
Master Zhuang.

800
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,000
May I clean your room?

801
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:54,000
Master Zhuang.

802
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,599
It turned out that

803
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,960
Zhuang Mohan was not there.

804
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,199
Who visited him before?

805
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:09,719
Officials from Imperial College,
Ministry of Personnel,

806
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:10,760
Ministry of Rites, and Censorate

807
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,440
all visited him.

808
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,119
It seems
that they really admire Zhuang Mohan,

809
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,199
so they consulted him in person.

810
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,800
Then why did they

811
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,199
sneak him out?

812
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,360
Head,

813
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:26,679
Zhuang Mohan is a literary giant.

814
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,239
His words and behaviors can influence

815
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,039
the scholars all over the world.

816
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,840
Now he's missing.

817
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,559
I'm afraid it's a big deal.

818
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:36,360
List the visitors

819
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,519
for me.

820
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,440
Yes.

821
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:41,079
I come back to ask for your order

822
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:42,920
to investigate the capital city

823
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,000
thoroughly.

824
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,639
Just forget it.

825
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:49,559
Now you're back.

826
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:51,360
Call back all the Directors

827
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,280
in the capital city.

828
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,679
I have something to say.

829
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:57,920
Yes.

830
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,920
Head. Your Excellency.

831
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,039
I should go back home

832
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:07,519
to see my wife.

833
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,320
I'm also leaving if everything is fine.

834
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,159
Wait!

835
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:21,000
You should meet them.

836
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,480
Everyone is here.

837
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
Let me introduce them to you.

838
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,559
Zhu Ge, Director of the First Division.

839
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,119
Yan Ruohai,
Director of the Fourth Division.

840
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:42,719
You've met them before.

841
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,400
The Director of the Second Division

842
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,199
is working in the frontier.

843
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,119
Black knights,
Director of the Fifth Division,

844
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:50,840
is not in the capital city.

845
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:52,039
Shadow, Director of the Sixth Division.

846
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:54,719
Director of the Seventh Division

847
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:55,599
is still working in the Jiangnan area.

848
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,480
Xuan Jiu,
Director of the Eighth Division.

849
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,639
He's in charge of book publishing.

850
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,559
You just opened a bookstore, right?

851
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,440
He's in charge of that.

852
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:07,079
Your Excellency Xuan, good day.

853
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:08,639
The last one is Fei Jie,

854
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,000
Director of the Third Division.

855
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,119
Fei Jie is not here.

856
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,880
The man taking over the Third Division

857
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:16,079
for the moment is lying over there.

858
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,679
Is he dead?

859
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,960
This is Fan Xian,
Director-General of our Office.

860
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,320
Your Excellencies, good day.

861
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,199
Here comes my junior fellow apprentice.

862
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:34,679
I'm surnamed Leng.
I'm also a student of Master Fei.

863
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:37,239
So we have the same teacher.

864
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,079
Senior Fellow Apprentice Leng,
what's wrong with you?

865
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,239
I developed a new poison.

866
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,519
I took some.

867
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,480
It's good.

868
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:47,360
Didn't you make the antidote?

869
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:48,920
The assassin failed.

870
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,079
It's getting worse.

871
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:52,639
You work so hard.

872
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,719
When I get better,
I'll invite you to dinner.

873
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,199
I'll cook myself.

874
00:43:58,559 --> 00:43:59,760
Please don't. No need to bother you.

875
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:01,719
No problem.

876
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,519
I need some rest now.

877
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,360
Now we've all met.

878
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:11,119
I'll come straight to the point.

879
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:14,400
Today, someone set a trap here

880
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,480
to kill me.

881
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,920
Fan Xian saved me.

882
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,880
It was Shadow, right?

883
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,079
I saw him.

884
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:30,239
You're mistaken.

885
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:32,440
I'm old.

886
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:35,000
In future, Fan Xian can take my place.

887
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,719
You should look after him.

888
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,880
Fan Xian is new to the capital city.

889
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,079
He doesn't know us all.

890
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,679
It's no hurry.

891
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,119
I'm not retiring now.

892
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:53,840
Head,

893
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,320
the Investigator's Office

894
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,400
is the most important organization
in Nanqing.

895
00:44:57,679 --> 00:44:59,199
Not anyone can be the Head.

896
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,679
To me,

897
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,480
Fan Xian is not qualified.

898
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,880
Are you mistaken?

899
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,199
I'm not here to
asking for your approval.

900
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,159
I'm just telling you.

901
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:12,840
I think it's good.

902
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,960
I don't know about others,

903
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:16,719
but our Third Division will definitely

904
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:17,840
support our junior fellow apprentice.

905
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:23,840
I'll say it for the last time.

906
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:27,320
It's settled. It won't be changed.

907
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:29,719
Whoever feels dissatisfied

908
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,440
should find the chance to kill me.

909
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:35,760
Go.

910
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,119
We've been through a lot these years.

911
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:54,800
I originally thought
you would be the one

912
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,199
to take over the Investigator's Office.

913
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,000
But his decision today

914
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,760
is really disappointing.

915
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,360
Yan Ruohai,

916
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,159
let me be clear on one point.

917
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:08,480
I don't want to fight for power.

918
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,679
I'm not competent enough

919
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:10,519
to take that position.

920
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:11,840
I understand.

921
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,920
You don't.

922
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:14,159
Everything I've done

923
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:15,280
is for Nanqing.

924
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:16,880
I know.

925
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,920
I've checked the bodies of

926
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,840
those assassinations.

927
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,599
They were bodacious.

928
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,440
Right.

929
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,360
Quite a few of them

930
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,400
had visited you frequently these days.

931
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,320
Why didn't you tell the Head just now?

932
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,760
Yan Ruohai, what on earth are you up to?

933
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:35,000
Just like you, all my decisions are made

934
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:38,360
for the benefits of Nanqing.

935
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:48,840
Why?

936
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,159
What are you asking about?

937
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:53,960
Handing the Investigator's Office
over to me.

938
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,480
Shadow took the liberty

939
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,000
to test you. That's fine.

940
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,320
We can make things clear.

941
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:05,599
Zhu Ge is right.

942
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,079
I'm not qualified yet.

943
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,159
The Investigator's Office

944
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,960
was founded by your mother.

945
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,800
For all these years,

946
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,760
I've been guarding this place for her.

947
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:17,639
But I'll have to

948
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:19,360
return it to you after all.

949
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,000
Circumstances change
with the passage of time.

950
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:26,519
The time may have passed,

951
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,039
but my original intension
remains the same.

952
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:40,239
You've been to
the Court of State Ceremonials, right?

953
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:43,760
It's a good thing.

954
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,079
Peace negotiation after war

955
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:49,679
is important to the whole county.
Take it seriously.

956
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:51,320
I know.

957
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:52,559
Just do your work.

958
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:55,440
Tell me

959
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:56,360
if anything bothers you.

960
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:58,760
Tell me also

961
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,239
if anyone makes it hard for you.

962
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,880
I'll help you out.

963
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,400
Anything!

964
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,000
Anything!

965
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,079
However difficult it might be,

966
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:11,119
I'll handle it for you.

967
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:21,360
Start again.

968
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:22,960
You must be tired today.

969
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,039
It's getting colder at night.

970
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,079
Add more quilts to keep warm.

971
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,719
You're still coughing.

972
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,480
You're old now.

973
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:41,480
It takes time to get better.

974
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,599
I'll grab you some medicine later.

975
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,000
Fine!

976
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,639
The heaven,
earth and man exist in harmony.

977
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,920
Gentlemen shall not stay up for work.

978
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,239
It's midnight already.

979
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,960
You're upset.

980
00:49:36,519 --> 00:49:37,639
I've been to the imperial palace.

981
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:39,679
Ruoruo has drawn down the map

982
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:41,320
to the Empress Dowager's palace,

983
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:43,880
and I've remembered it.

984
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,719
Then why are you upset?

985
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,400
After all, you took part in

986
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,239
was planned by the Princess Royal.

987
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,400
Do you want to kill the Princess Royal?

988
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,320
She's the mother of Wan'er after all.

989
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:04,079
Do you want to kill her?

990
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:10,679
The Princess Royal
values power over life.

991
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,960
We should take her down
and kick her out of the capital city.

992
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:17,440
To her, that's even worse than death.

993
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,599
That is beyond my ability.

994
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,280
I'll do it myself.

995
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,559
Up to you.

996
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:23,159
Uncle...

997
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,320
We should postpone our plan of

998
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,880
breaking into the imperial harem
to steal the key.

999
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,239
We should wait for a better chance.

1000
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:31,320
It's up to you.

1001
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:48,760
Please!

1002
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,519
Your Excellency,
you're the Deputy Receptionist.

1003
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,639
Sit here.

1004
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:55,679
OK.

1005
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,000
Your Excellency Xin,

1006
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,400
I've never negotiated
with an enemy country.

1007
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,119
I feel a bit nervous.

1008
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,519
I don't know what to say later.

1009
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:14,239
Don't be nervous.

1010
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,679
Negotiation is a verbal battle
between two countries.

1011
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,760
The most important thing is to

1012
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,760
mind our choice of words.

1013
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,559
We should be kind and generous
when talking.

1014
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,239
In other words,
we should be polite and courteous.

1015
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,880
Only then can we demonstrate

1016
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:34,079
the dignity and magnanimity
of a powerful country.

1017
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:35,360
Anyway, later

1018
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,360
just leave it all

1019
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,079
to me.

1020
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:38,079
OK!

1021
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:47,079
We definitely won't return you

1022
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,039
the prefecture taken
by our powerful army.

1023
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,639
That is our territory.

1024
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:51,920
Your territory?

1025
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,719
Really? If you want it back,

1026
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,639
just send your troops.

1027
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,559
How about this?

1028
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,800
I'll announce that

1029
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,679
the talk is suspended.

1030
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,119
We can resume our talk

1031
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:01,119
after the battle.

1032
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:01,880
Will that work for you?

1033
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:05,079
You! You are despicable!

1034
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,400
I know how shameless you are

1035
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,880
long before!

1036
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:12,519
Is that real?

1037
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:13,679
Of course.

1038
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:14,519
Let me tell you in detail.

1039
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:15,280
Mr. Zhang,

1040
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,280
this way, please.

1041
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:17,400
Let's discuss the details in my mansion.

1042
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:18,840
The specialty wine of this house

1043
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,639
is really good.

1044
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:20,679
Waiter!

1045
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,760
There it comes!

1046
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,159
Waiter, come here!

1047
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,280
Change the music for me.

1048
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:26,960
OK.

1049
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:31,320
Your Excellency,

1050
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:33,719
we should resume the talk

1051
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,239
in the afternoon.

1052
00:52:36,679 --> 00:52:38,519
So we'd better drink no wine.

1053
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,679
That's the right music.

1054
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,239
It suits us scholars the best.

1055
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,480
Your Excellency,

1056
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:47,199
are we going a bit far

1057
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,599
in the talk just now?

1058
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,679
We should be aggressive.

1059
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,280
Don't we have to demonstrate dignity
and magnanimity of our country?

1060
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:00,039
Our soldiers risked their lives

1061
00:53:00,039 --> 00:53:00,599
to win the battle.

1062
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:02,400
If we're not aggressive,

1063
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,440
we fail those soldiers.

1064
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,039
Nice tea.

1065
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:16,239
Its fragrance is lingering,

1066
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:21,039
and its taste is profound.

1067
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:29,280
The prefecture occupied by our army

1068
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,480
will not be returned. Moreover,

1069
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:33,920
you'll have to pay for

1070
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:35,360
the marching expenditure of our army.

1071
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:36,800
How can we continue our talk
if you keep acting like that?

1072
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,079
There's nothing to talk about
in the first place.

1073
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:07,480
Your Excellency Xin, we won't

1074
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:10,559
concede in this talk.

1075
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,159
Are you suddenly out of your mind?

1076
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,800
There's a piece of
new information on the paper.

1077
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,440
All our conditions are on it.

1078
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,760
You can have a look.

1079
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,920
We'll talk tomorrow.

1080
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:27,360
You can check the authenticity
of the information.

1081
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,400
Gosh! It's bad news!

1082
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,199
This is a secret report
sent from Beiqi just now.

1083
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:35,159
Head, you want to see me.

1084
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,639
There's something you should know.

1085
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:41,639
Bingyun was held hostage.

1086
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:47,400
The Imperial Guards of Beiqi did it.

1087
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,079
Shen Zhong caught Bingyun in person.

1088
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,039
Is he still alive?

1089
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,119
Yes.

1090
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,679
Beiqi wants to use him

1091
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,840
as a bargaining chip.

1092
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,119
What do they want?

1093
00:55:59,119 --> 00:55:59,840
Firstly,

1094
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:02,079
they want to take back the prefecture.

1095
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:05,360
Secondly, they ask us

1096
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,079
to release the prisoners of war

1097
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:09,239
and compensate for the dead soldiers.

1098
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:10,599
The last

1099
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:11,559
is the most hateful.

1100
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:15,000
They want to exchange Mr. Yan

1101
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,039
for Xiao En and Si Lili.

1102
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:16,679
Xiao En?

1103
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:18,639
The one locked up in the dungeon
of the Investigator's Office?

1104
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,400
That's right.

1105
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,239
He is a vicious villain

1106
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:22,280
from Beiqi.

1107
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,199
He was equally famous as Chen Pingping.

1108
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,679
Back then, Chen Pingping led

1109
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:27,599
the black knights on a long-range raid

1110
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:28,840
and caught him back

1111
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,840
at the cost of his legs.

1112
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:32,039
How can we send him back?

1113
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,239
That's right.

1114
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,880
But we won this battle

1115
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:40,559
so easily because Yan Bingyun

1116
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,800
inquired about military information

1117
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:43,960
and sent us secret reports.

1118
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:45,280
Besides,

1119
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,519
he's the son of

1120
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:50,039
Yan Ruohai
from the Investigator's Office.

1121
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:53,840
No way!

1122
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,599
We can't return the land we've taken.

1123
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,159
We can't return the land we've taken.

1124
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,119
Actually, what they really want

1125
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,039
are Xiao En and Si Lili.

1126
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,519
We can't let Xiao En go.

1127
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:12,119
If he goes back to Beiqi,

1128
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:13,119
he will retaliate like a mad dog!

1129
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:14,239
As a citizen of Nanqing,

1130
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,480
I can't accept that.

1131
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:19,079
We don't release him for nothing.

1132
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,559
It's an exchange.

1133
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:25,239
We can get Bingyun back.

1134
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,000
I'll go north tonight

1135
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,480
to sneak into the capital of Beiqi,

1136
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:30,840
so as to save my son.

1137
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,400
It's extremely difficult to go north

1138
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,440
and save him.

1139
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:34,679
As a father,

1140
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,400
I have to go.

1141
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,159
Exchange or not, it's not up to you.

1142
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:40,280
Head,

1143
00:57:41,159 --> 00:57:42,320
Nor me!

1144
00:57:42,519 --> 00:57:44,760
Only one man can make the call.

1145
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,400
Eunuch Hou.

1146
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:47,039
Yes.

1147
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,239
Ask the Investigator's Office
to release Xiao En and Si Lili right away.

1148
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,559
Your Majesty.

1149
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:51,320
Also,

1150
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:53,079
tell the Court of State Ceremonials that

1151
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:54,679
no land taken by my army

1152
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,679
shall be returned. Not an inch!

1153
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:58,239
The rest are open for discussion.

1154
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,800
Yan Bingyun

1155
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:03,519
must be back alive.

1156
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,199
Yes, Your Majesty.

1157
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,760
That's the decision of His Majesty.

1158
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:13,960
We can't let Xiao En go!

1159
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:14,719
Your Excellency.

1160
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,440
His Majesty has a verbal instruction.

1161
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,960
His Majesty knows

1162
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:25,039
what kind of a person Xiao En is.

1163
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:27,280
If the Investigator's Office
can catch him once,

1164
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,000
then you surely can catch him twice.

1165
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,760
By bearing disgrace and a heavy burden,

1166
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,679
Yan Bingyun lurked
in the capital of Beiqi.

1167
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:35,280
He's worked his heart out.

1168
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,039
I've known it all.

1169
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:40,800
Exchanging a dying old man

1170
00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:43,239
for a promising young man of our county,

1171
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,400
it's really worth it!

1172
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,280
Your Excellency Yan and the rest of you,

1173
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,880
His Majesty also said

1174
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,199
Young Master Yan should come back alive.

1175
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:56,440
I

1176
00:58:57,639 --> 00:58:59,320
accept the imperial edict
and thank His Majesty for showing mercy!

1177
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:05,000
We thank His Majesty for showing mercy!

1178
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:06,079
Your Majesty.

1179
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,480
The Court of State Ceremonials
and Beiqi mission

1180
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,000
have reached an agreement.

1181
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,639
Dongyi mission

1182
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:14,199
has offered all their gifts

1183
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:15,599
and is ready to leave.

1184
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,159
Despite the twists and turns,

1185
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,280
the Court of State Ceremonials
has done a good job.

1186
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:27,679
Pass on my order.

1187
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,760
A banquet will be held at the Hall of Prayer
for Good Harvest tomorrow night

1188
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:34,159
for a joint celebration.

1189
01:00:34,679 --> 01:00:35,159
Yes.

1190
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:37,440
Wait.

1191
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,880
Invite the Beiqi and Dongyi missions
to the banquet.

1192
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:42,000
Go there now.

1193
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,920
I see. I'll handle it.

1194
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:55,440
At the banquet tomorrow night,
Nanqing officials,

1195
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,760
Beiqi courtiers, and Dongyi mission

1196
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,079
will have a joyous gathering.

1197
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,320
What an event!

1198
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:04,960
What about Zhuang Mohan?

1199
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:06,880
Who is it?

1200
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,199
Zhuang Mohan.

1201
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,360
He didn't seem to
take part in the negotiation.

1202
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,840
Indeed!

1203
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,920
He disappeared
once upon arrival in the capital city.

1204
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:19,679
After that, he's never left his room.

1205
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:20,599
He does nothing

1206
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:21,679
but reading books quietly.

1207
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,840
That's weird.

1208
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:25,119
A literary giant came all the way

1209
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,039
to the capital city

1210
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,840
without achieving anything,

1211
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,360
only to enjoy a banquet tomorrow night.

1212
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:33,000
If anything happens in that banquet,

1213
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,239
the world will know it in no time.

1214
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,960
Head, you mean

1215
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,679
Zhuang Mohan will make a move

1216
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:40,679
in the banquet.

1217
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,559
If he's up to something,
he must make a move tomorrow night.

1218
01:01:42,679 --> 01:01:43,639
Then what should we do?

1219
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,760
Nothing.

1220
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:45,800
Just wait and see.

1221
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,400
Will we lose the initiative?

1222
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,159
There's no other way.

1223
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:52,239
Without knowing what he's been up to,

1224
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:53,840
we certainly can't take any precautions.

1225
01:01:57,719 --> 01:01:58,440
One more thing.

1226
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:01,119
According to the information
sent from Beiqi,

1227
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,840
my son was caught

1228
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:05,320
because his identity was disclosed.

1229
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,320
By secret agents from Beiqi?

1230
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,480
No, not from Beiqi.

1231
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,639
You mean from the capital city?
