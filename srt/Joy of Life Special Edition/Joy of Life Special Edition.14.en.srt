16
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,879
One more thing.

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,599
According to the information
sent from Beiqi,

18
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,319
my son was caught

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,799
because his identity was disclosed.

20
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,799
By secret agents from Beiqi?

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,879
No, not from Beiqi.

22
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,120
You mean from the capital city?

23
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,079
He was betrayed by someone
from the capital city.

24
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,400
Bingyun lurking in Beiqi

25
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,120
is a top secret.

26
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,159
Besides His Majesty,

27
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:07,680
only officials from

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,759
our Investigator's Office know it.

29
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,680
Can it be someone from our office?

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,919
Why not?

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,280
Head,

32
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,080
I think we should carry out

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,319
a thorough investigation right away.

34
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,319
No need.

35
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,240
It's a serious problem.

36
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,400
It ends now.

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,199
Never mention it again.

38
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:24,919
Yes.

39
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,879
The Investigator's Office has
been established for so many years.

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,520
Time passes so quickly.

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,439
It's time to replace some old stuff.

42
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,039
Dad, you want to see me.

43
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,520
You're back.

44
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,560
Come and take a seat.

45
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,400
The negotiation

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,439
in Court of State Ceremonials is over.

47
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,199
Be cautious at the Hall tomorrow.

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,039
You mean

49
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,800
the banquet tomorrow night?

50
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,919
What's wrong?

51
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,000
you're elegant and kind.

52
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:18,280
literary giants are all in Beiqi.

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,639
In earlier years,

54
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,919
scholars actually found it an honor

55
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,479
to pass
the imperial examinations in Beiqi.

56
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,719
Though things are better these years,

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,599
when it comes to scholars,

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,919
Nanqing is no match to Beiqi.

59
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,840
Now the Nanqing literary circles

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,120
have anchored their hopes on you.

61
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,759
I...

62
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,080
The literary circles?

63
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,639
Zhuang Mohan and his mission

64
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,800
"A thousand miles from home, I'm grieved at
autumn's plight" which you wrote a few days ago

65
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,120
is rated as
the No.1 Current Seven-character Poem

66
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,680
by scholars of Nanqing.

67
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,879
Many say in private that

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,520
accomplished at such a young age,

69
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,800
you can be better
than Zhuang Mohan in future.

70
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,439
I just wrote one poem.

71
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
They are too hasty
in drawing the conclusion.

72
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,639
One poem is not much,

73
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,439
but we've longed for a talented scholar

74
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,120
for so long.

75
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,080
We may even fight a losing battle.

76
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:15,560
Who will lose?

77
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,399
You, of course.

78
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,560
So tomorrow night,

79
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,439
everyone will watch me

80
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,680
meeting the literary giant

81
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,879
Zhuang Mohan.

82
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,360
You don't need to be amazing.

83
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,279
Just play it safe.

84
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,199
That's enough.

85
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,279
Will you go tomorrow night?

86
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,639
The banquet tomorrow

87
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,879
is especially set for
Court of State Ceremonials

88
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,240
and Board of Rites.

89
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,839
I'm the Assistant Minister
of Ministry of Revenue.

90
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,000
Why would I go?

91
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't worry.

92
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,600
Just a little advice.

93
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,600
Respected as Zhuang Mohan is,

94
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,439
why would he actually
make things difficult

95
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,120
for a young man like you?

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,120
Fan Xian will also attend
the banquet tomorrow night.

97
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,839
Master Zhuang, please ruin his name.

98
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,319
You've hung up a red lantern.

99
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,720
Uncle, for all these years,

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,279
I've been wondering

101
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,040
whether you can see or not.

102
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,399
How come you know

103
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:16,920
I hang up a lantern?

104
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,120
And you even know the color.

105
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,279
It's hard for me to explain.

106
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,480
I can know everything.

107
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,360
But I don't see with eyes.

108
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,800
You see with your heart.

109
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,839
I don't know how to put it.

110
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,120
Uncle...

111
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,480
I find you mysterious all the time.

112
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,639
If anyone dares to piss you off,

113
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,120
he's definitely dice with death.

114
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,319
Take a seat. Take a seat. Take a seat.

115
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,199
Let's get down to business.

116
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,600
Tomorrow night,

117
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,360
the imperial family will hold a banquet at
the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest.

118
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:56,639
The Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest?

119
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,839
How is Wang Qinian involved?

120
00:06:59,319 --> 00:06:59,720
Who?

121
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,959
Wang Qinian,

122
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,480
Uncle,

123
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,120
besides being mysterious,

124
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,240
how come your thoughts

125
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,079
are so hard to follow recently?

126
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,759
Thoughts?

127
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,600
I don't think
the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest

128
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,639
has anything to do with Wang Qinian.

129
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,319
Fine.

130
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,639
Let's get down to business.

131
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,639
The banquet tomorrow is mainly for

132
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,000
the celebration of finishing
the war against Beiqi.

133
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:27,959
It's kind of a big event.

134
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,360
Aren't you going to ask me

135
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,399
why I ask you over?

136
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,160
Aren't you going to tell me
if I don't ask?

137
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,639
You've made a point.

138
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:40,839
Fine.

139
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:43,240
After the banquet tomorrow night,

140
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,560
we'll break into the imperial harem.

141
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,480
Are you sure?

142
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,240
Everyone will relax

143
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,240
after a great event.

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,360
OK, the plan remains unchanged.

145
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,120
I'll lure Hong Sixiang away,

146
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,560
and you should sneak into
the Empress Dowager's palace

147
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,439
to find the key.

148
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:56,680
There's one last problem.

149
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:57,959
I don't know

150
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,079
where the Empress Dowager keeps the key.

151
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,519
It might take time to find it.

152
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,519
There's a secret compartment

153
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,800
on the bed board under her pillow.

154
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,279
All her important things are kept there.

155
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,839
How did you know

156
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:11,079
Your mom searched it before.

157
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,560
Why did my mom

158
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,360
search her secret compartment?

159
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,240
The old lady has lived in widowhood
for so many years.

160
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,160
Though she looks serious,

161
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
I wonder whether she keeps

162
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,319
love letters in private or not.

163
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,399
Those are the words
said by your mom back then.

164
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,679
So she searched the Empress Dowager's

165
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,840
secret compartment only for gossiping!

166
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,600
I've no idea

167
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,639
what gossiping implies,

168
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,759
but yes, you're right.

169
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,960
Didn't she get caught?

170
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,480
I kept watch for her.

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,720
Why are you laughing?

172
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Words can't express

173
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,600
my feelings right now.

174
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,039
What feelings?

175
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,039
Just forget it.

176
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,720
Anyway, back then,

177
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,399
my mom had solved

178
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,279
the biggest problem for me.

179
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,320
Now,

180
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,600
as long as I know where the key is,

181
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,240
I feel quite sure of getting it out.

182
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,120
If we take the key,

183
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,879
the old lady might notice.

184
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,360
We'd better put in a fake one.

185
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,039
Without seeing the real key,

186
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,799
how could you
make a fake one in advance?

187
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,039
I've got an idea.

188
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:14,759
Good.

189
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
Wait for me here tomorrow night.

190
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,799
Someone's here.

191
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,080
I asked him over.

192
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,120
Seriously?

193
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,120
Your Excellency.

194
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,600
Come in.

195
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,159
It's quite late now.

196
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,200
Do you have anything for me?

197
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,679
I have a question for you.

198
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,399
Please go ahead.

199
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,399
Do you have anything to do with the
Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest?

200
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:44,120
I suppose not.

201
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,159
I think so.

202
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,879
What's wrong?

203
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,480
Nothing.

204
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,320
Take a seat.

205
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,120
Your Excellency, thank you.

206
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,200
I might as well stand.

207
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:01,879
Your Excellency,

208
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,919
I heard
that by deterring the Beiqi mission

209
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,480
in the Court of State Ceremonials,

210
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,919
you've made great contributions
to Nanqing.

211
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,039
I will attend the banquet
tomorrow night.

212
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,440
Your Excellency,
charismatic and vigorous as you are,

213
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
you'll definitely be promoted
in the near future.

214
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,440
Is this for me?

215
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:15,879
Yes.

216
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,799
Thank you, Your Excellency.

217
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:22,840
Your Excellency,

218
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:24,799
next time you grant me a reward,

219
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,200
please grant me bank notes instead.

220
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,759
They are easier to hide.

221
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:29,639
I want to break into the imperial harem
at night.

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,399
Your Excellency,

223
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:32,320
pardon, please?

224
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,559
I said I want to
break into the imperial harem at night

225
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,919
and sneak into
the Empress Dowager's palace

226
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,279
to steal a key.

227
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:39,399
Of course,

228
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,000
for fear the old lady might notice,

229
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,759
I have to make a fake key overnight

230
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,320
to replace the real one.

231
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,639
That's my plan.

232
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,200
Are you kidding me?

233
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:48,840
Not really.

234
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,080
Are you serious?

235
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:51,919
Yes.

236
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,159
It's a deadly sin
which could implicate your family.

237
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,120
I suppose it is.

238
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,679
Then why do you

239
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:03,120
tell me about it?

240
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,360
I just told you

241
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,080
I have to make a fake key

242
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,840
overnight.

243
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,399
I have to find
the best locksmith in the capital city.

244
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,080
Since I'm not familiar with
the capital city,

245
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,320
I need someone with connections.

246
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,320
That's you.

247
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,720
If I'm involved,

248
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,840
I will also commit a deadly sin.

249
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,399
You just find me a locksmith

250
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,240
to make a key.

251
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,440
You know nothing else.

252
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,480
Right!

253
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,919
Then you should only ask me

254
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,720
to find a locksmith.

255
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,279
Right? Why tell me

256
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:29,960
the whole plan?

257
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,440
I also want to tell you less,

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,759
but I can't.

259
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,480
You have to wait for me

260
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,679
outside the imperial palace tomorrow.

261
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:38,720
Your Excellency!

262
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,919
Aren't you afraid
that I might tell on you?

263
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,519
Do you really want to

264
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,879
trust me

265
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,879
with your life?

266
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,200
Of course I do.

267
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:51,960
You're a wise man.

268
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,679
You should know that

269
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:57,000
you only need to
take a little risk by helping me,

270
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,679
but you'll get yourself killed
if you dare betray me.

271
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,000
Why do you say that?

272
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,840
You know how Chen Pingping

273
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,519
treats me.

274
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,919
The Head treats you like his son.

275
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,200
So this is the case.

276
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,320
If I tell on you

277
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
and get you killed,

278
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,559
the Head will definitely

279
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,120
cut me into pieces.

280
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,759
You're really wise.

281
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,159
Then why don't you ask the Head

282
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:26,919
to do you the favor.

283
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,799
It's inconvenient for big potatoes

284
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,879
to do such things.

285
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,679
What can I say?

286
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,360
The choice is yours.

287
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,159
I know a good locksmith.

288
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:40,639
Good. Ask him to
wait for me tomorrow night.

289
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,720
OK.

290
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,279
From tonight on,

291
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:45,919
I'll raise your salary
by another ten taels of silver.

292
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,600
This is something
that might get my entire family killed.

293
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,679
You only add ten taels of silver?!

294
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:51,679
Don't you think it's too little?

295
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:52,240
So you don't want it?

296
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,799
I want it.

297
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,240
Give me bank notes instead next time.

298
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,759
What time is it?

299
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:10,840
It's about 1:00 p.m.

300
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,440
Is the Hall of Prayer
for Good Harvest ready?

301
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes, they started decorating

302
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,840
early this morning.

303
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,519
Find me a place for the night banquet.

304
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,399
It's only held
for Court of State Ceremonials

305
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,320
and Board of Rites.

306
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:29,960
It's no big deal.

307
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,120
Just do it.

308
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:32,879
Yes.

309
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,679
I can't wait.

310
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,000
I've asked.

311
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,440
As to the night banquet in the
Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest,

312
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,759
guests can take seats at about 5:00 p.m.

313
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,679
Your Highness, if you eat too much now,

314
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:55,440
you won't feel like eating

315
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,519
in the banquet

316
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:58,960
On such banquets,

317
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,159
there will be
a lot of drinking and praises.

318
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,200
How could I fill my belly?

319
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:03,879
That's right.

320
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,279
Such banquets

321
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,279
are merely a formality.

322
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,360
Your Highness really don't

323
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:08,960
have to go.

324
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,399
Fan Xian completed
his first task successfully.

325
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,240
I certainly should

326
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,159
congratulate him in person.

327
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,039
Hasn't Fan Xian taken the side of

328
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,000
the Crown Prince?

329
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,759
Who told you so?

330
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,720
If not, why would the Crown Prince

331
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,279
send him to
negotiate with the Beiqi mission?

332
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,240
Man like Fan Xian

333
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,440
won't follow the Crown Prince willingly.

334
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,399
I've only met Fan Xian a few times,

335
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,279
but I find him a bosom friend.

336
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,960
Just like me,
Fan Xian won't feel content

337
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,320
to occupy a position below others.

338
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,879
How long has His Highness stood there?

339
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,799
About an hour.

340
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,360
His Highness is afraid to
form folds on his gown.

341
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,279
What time is it?

342
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,279
Your Highness, it's about 5:00 p.m.

343
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,480
Let's go to the Hall of Prayer
for Good Harvest.

344
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,600
Yes.

345
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,759
Your Excellency Fan!

346
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:41,559
Your Excellency Fan!

347
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,159
Your Excellency Xin!

348
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:43,960
What a coincidence!

349
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,000
Indeed!

350
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:46,879
Your Excellency Fan,

351
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,360
why not wear your robe?

352
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:49,600
It's just a meal.

353
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,840
I'm not some high-ranking official.

354
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,080
Well then. I'll have

355
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,200
more drinks with you later.

356
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,799
Your Excellencies, regular examination.

357
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,360
No edged tools

358
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,559
can be taken inside.

359
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,960
Who would bring edged tools
to a banquet?

360
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,519
Your Excellency Fan, listen!

361
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,080
The ritual music

362
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,480
is prepared by the Board of Rites.

363
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,600
Can I bring needles in?

364
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:16,320
Steel needles. About this long.

365
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:17,720
No.

366
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,279
Wait a moment.

367
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,720
That's all.

368
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,200
Your Excellency Xin, let's get inside.

369
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:37,039
I'm cautious
because I was assassinated before.

370
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,600
Yes, you should be.

371
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:39,720
It's right to be cautious.

372
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,919
Can I bring in poisons?

373
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,039
Poisons?

374
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,200
No! No! No!

375
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,879
Fan Xian,

376
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,919
Your Highness.

377
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,200
What's going on?

378
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,400
Don't touch it.

379
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,839
These are poisons made by myself.

380
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:09,680
I'm not allowed to bring them inside.

381
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,200
You're really Fei Jie's student.

382
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,799
Can they kill?

383
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,440
Of course.

384
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,400
Give me a bag.

385
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,079
No.

386
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:19,839
Why?

387
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,480
If anything happens to His Majesty

388
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,039
and the Crown Prince,

389
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,039
I won't be able to justify myself.

390
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,720
Right. Just forget it.

391
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,480
Fan Xian, you've rendered
meritorious services this time.

392
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,480
You'll definitely have a bright future.
Congratulations!

393
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,039
Thank you,

394
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,039
We can see each other more.

395
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,000
I might be able to
help in the imperial court.

396
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,839
I'm so flattered.

397
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,359
Your Highness.

398
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,480
You're from Court of State
Ceremonials. Your name is Wang...

399
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:47,720
Xin!

400
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,240
Xin... Xin... Xin...

401
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,119
Xin Qiwu.

402
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:49,640
Xin Qiwu.

403
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:51,720
I remember you're a follower
of the Crown Prince.

404
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,599
We're all couriers! We're all couriers!

405
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,359
If you feel dissatisfied

406
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:00,359
following the Crown Prince,

407
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,759
you can follow me instead.

408
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,880
There should be none left.

409
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:08,640
Now there's none left.

410
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,039
Don't touch them.

411
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,279
I don't have the antidotes

412
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
for some poisons.

413
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,400
Your Excellency Xin.

414
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,400
What're you thinking?

415
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,319
In your opinion,

416
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,920
why does the Second Prince
come to the banquet?

417
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,319
To draw talents like Your Excellency Xin

418
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,559
over to his side

419
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,720
of course.

420
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,279
Your Excellency Fan,
you're making fun of me again.

421
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,279
It's obvious that the Second
Prince was trying to win you over.

422
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,839
How could it be me?

423
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,440
Your Highness! Please believe me!

424
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,200
I'm definitely loyal

425
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,160
to Your Highness.

426
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,880
I will never follow others.

427
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,440
Your Highness,

428
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,039
Your Highness, I can prove that.

429
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,200
Just now, the Second Prince

430
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,359
did try to win him over,

431
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,079
but loyal as His Excellency Xin is,

432
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:48,240
he didn't take the offer.

433
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:48,960
Yeah! Yeah!

434
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,960
Your Excellency Fan,
thank you for telling the truth.

435
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,119
You're welcome.

436
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,880
Don't worry.
His Highness is open-minded.

437
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,039
Right! Right! Right!

438
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,000
Your Excellency Fan,
something's not right.

439
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,359
The Second Prince actually

440
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,880
said those words to win you over.

441
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,880
How come you become the one

442
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,319
to clear my name instead?

443
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:14,559
a few days later,

444
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,519
Your Excellency, it's not!

445
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,640
The Princess Royal is also here.

446
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,480
Brat, do you dare

447
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,359
to see me?

448
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:05,039
Who are you?

449
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,440
Unbelievable!

450
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,279
You're the one
who beat me on the street.

451
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,480
Now you actually pretend

452
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,240
you don't know me!

453
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,599
Young Master Guo!

454
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,680
Long time no see!

455
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,559
Your wounds are almost healed.

456
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:18,400
Good for you.

457
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,039
How dare you forget me!

458
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,279
Mind your words! Mind your words!

459
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,799
You sound like a whining woman.

460
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,160
You villain!

461
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,440
I'll never forget

462
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,119
what you've done!

463
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:31,400
You sound more like it.

464
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,400
Why are you here? Why is he here?

465
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:34,079
Well, he...

466
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,279
I am the Imperial Compiler.

467
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,960
My father is the Minister of
the Board of Rites.

468
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:37,960
Why can't I be here?

469
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,759
You can! You can!

470
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:39,599
The dishes will be served soon.

471
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:40,799
-Mr. Guo, please take your seat.
-Don't be smug.

472
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,880
Fan Xian, let me tell you.

473
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:42,720
Today, right here,

474
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,759
I'll watch you hit rock bottom

475
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,759
and ruin your name

476
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,240
with my own eyes.

477
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,079
Nonsense!

478
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,839
Father.

479
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,599
What's the occasion?

480
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,480
Go back to your seat!

481
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,200
Yes.

482
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,359
My son is so rude.

483
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,799
Your Excellency Fan, please forgive him.

484
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:17,839
Who are you?

485
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,240
This is Guo Youzhi,

486
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,480
Minister of the Board of Rites.

487
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,720
Minister, it's you.

488
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,039
Your Excellency, do feel relieved.

489
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,759
Your son is mischievous and lovely.

490
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm not angry at all.

491
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,559
Well. Well. Well.

492
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,400
Come on! OK! OK!

493
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,519
Stop looking around.

494
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:48,480
Our seats are over there.

495
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,119
Come on! This way, please!

496
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,279
Let's sit here.

497
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,160
Come on! Have a seat!

498
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,519
Have a seat!

499
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,000
Have a seat!

500
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:57,759
Your Excellency Fan, have a seat!

501
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,000
Your Excellency Fan,

502
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,920
Guo Baokun is also
a follower of the Crown Prince.

503
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,599
You'd better make peace.

504
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:21,480
I'm fine with that.

505
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,720
Just look at him.

506
00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:31,240
Your problem will be solved gradually.

507
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:34,759
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

508
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,000
Did you really beat him?

509
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,799
How could that be?

510
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,079
By reading the books of sages
since childhood,

511
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,279
I've always been denying self
and returning to propriety.

512
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,359
How could I beat others?

513
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,319
But you killed a martial arts master

514
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,839
from Beiqi on the street a few days ago.

515
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,400
Nice wine.

516
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:56,720
Right. Right. Nice. Nice.

517
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:09,920
Xin,

518
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,680
there are two seats left.

519
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,480
For whom?

520
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:16,079
Probably for the two masters

521
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,000
from Dongyi Town and Beiqi.

522
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,880
Beiqi has sent
the literary giant Zhuang Mohan.

523
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,480
Who has Dongyi Town sent?

524
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:26,279
As for Dongyi Town...

525
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,480
Your Excellency.

526
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,799
Are you OK?

527
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,000
How can he carry a sword
into the imperial palace?

528
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,160
Apprentices of Si Gujian

529
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,160
never leave their swords behind.

530
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,599
His Majesty
has made an exception for them.

531
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,519
Apprentice of Si Gujian?

532
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,359
He's the first apprentice of

533
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:02,799
Great Master Si Gujian,

534
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,759
Yun Zhilan?

535
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,079
Yun Zhilan?

536
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,480
Those two female assassins

537
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,000
you killed on the street

538
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,519
were his apprentices.

539
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The Dongyi Town mission

540
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,279
is also sent here to settle that.

541
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:19,079
Does he sell wine?

542
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,440
I've never heard of that.

543
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,440
Your Excellency, why do you ask?

544
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,039
It sounds like a wine's name.

545
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:34,720
Really?

546
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:38,960
Your Excellency Fan,

547
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,079
the Princess Royal asks you over

548
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,119
to tell you something.

549
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,000
Come closer.

550
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:04,559
Don't let her

551
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,400
I've been waiting for you to kill me.

552
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,440
How come there are no surprises?

553
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,319
Your Highness, take it easy.

554
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:13,640
You'll be surprised at any time.

555
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:15,759
If you pledge allegiance to me,

556
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,359
I'll let Wan'er marry you.

557
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,119
I'll let you have
the financial power of the Neiku.

558
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,960
And I'll give you more
whatever you want.

559
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,799
What if I want to kick you out of

560
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:27,960
the capital city?

561
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,759
A great wish.

562
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,480
You should definitely try.

563
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,359
I won't fail Your Highness for sure!

564
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,200
Fan Xian and Auntie

565
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,640
are talking happily.

566
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,240
I wonder what they're talking about.

567
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,240
It's none of my business.

568
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
Your Highness wants to

569
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,359
win Fan Xian over, right?

570
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,799
Let's make a bet on

571
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,359
who will get Fan Xian in the end.

572
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:15,160
What shall we bet?

573
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:16,440
Life.

574
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,160
It seems I've made

575
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:29,839
an improper joke.

576
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,720
Your Highness, please forgive me!

577
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,400
Fine!

578
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Zhuang Mohan is here.

579
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,680
You've never met Master Zhuang, right?

580
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,680
It might be fate

581
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,920
for Beiqi to have

582
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,119
such a literary giant.

583
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,880
After explaining classic texts and
annotating articles for decades,

584
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
he's got many works to his credit.

585
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,640
In some way,

586
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,839
he's even more powerful than an emperor.

587
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,799
Carrying the literary inheritance
all by himself,

588
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,359
doesn't he find it burdensome?

589
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,920
If the scholars heard
what you just said,

590
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,960
you would be accused of
disrespect of the saint.

591
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:51,920
Why would I admit

592
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,960
I said those words?

593
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,119
I heard some people

594
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:56,440
have anchored their hopes on you,

595
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,359
expecting you to become

596
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,759
a literary giant in future.

597
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,839
Your Highness won't hope so for sure!

598
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,880
Well, since Master Zhuang is here,

599
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,599
the banquet should start soon.

600
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,880
Go back to your seat.

601
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,920
I'm leaving.

602
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:16,759
I've given you the chance,

603
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,720
but you've thrown it away.

604
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,000
Here arrives His Majesty!

605
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,119
This way! This way! This way!

606
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:11,119
May Your Majesty
live ten thousand years!

607
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,519
Rise.

608
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,799
Thank you, Your Majesty.

609
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,319
His Majesty has arrived at the
Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest.

610
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,480
Have you checked

611
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,440
all the maidservants,
eunuchs and imperial guards

612
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,480
on shift tonight?

613
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,640
Yes, I have.

614
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:37,160
All of them
have a clean family background.

615
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,279
No one is suspicious.

616
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,400
Among those who entered the Hall,

617
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,960
have you found anyone suspicious?

618
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,680
Yes,

619
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,680
Fan Xian is.

620
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,200
According to
the Division of Imperial Guards,

621
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,720
he carried a dagger and poisons with him

622
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,079
when he arrived.

623
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:53,400
What about Zhuang Mohan?

624
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,640
Zhuang Mohan only took inside

625
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,000
a roll of old paper.

626
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,680
My men took the chance to check it.

627
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,839
There was nothing inside.

628
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,519
I think

629
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,039
Zhuang Mohan doesn't practice

630
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:03,960
martial arts.

631
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,559
He wouldn't be a problem.

632
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,440
Yun Zhilan went inside with his sword.

633
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,039
Right.

634
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,759
But Yun Zhilan is
an apprentice of Si Gujian.

635
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,119
He is not supposed to

636
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:18,880
know Zhuang Mohan.

637
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,240
If Yun Zhilan tries to

638
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:23,480
kill His Majesty with his sword,

639
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,240
who can stop him?

640
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,599
Eunuch Hong Sixiang
is right outside the Hall.

641
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:32,160
Serve the dishes.

642
00:30:46,359 --> 00:30:47,920
Eunuch Hong, it's a night owl.

643
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,480
Chief Musician Fan.

644
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,039
Your Excellency Fan,
His Majesty is calling you.

645
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,000
Calling me?

646
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,839
What does His Majesty call me?

647
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,440
You're the Chief Musician of
the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

648
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,359
That's the name
of your official position.

649
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,279
Your Majesty.

650
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,920
You've seen me a few times,
but you've never knelt down.

651
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,839
I thought
you would remain standing this time.

652
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,119
Then I would piss off everyone.

653
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,720
Look at your blurred eyes.

654
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,720
You must have drunk a lot.

655
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,400
Your Majesty,

656
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,480
On such a big occasion,

657
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,440
I can't help feeling nervous.

658
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:12,880
Yun Zhilan?

659
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,920
Your two apprentices

660
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,240
were killed by him.

661
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,799
I know.

662
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:23,680
Young as he is,

663
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,519
he's somewhat competent.

664
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,720
He's competent if he can kill me.

665
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,920
The apprentice of Si Gujian

666
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,920
is really proud.

667
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,119
I get that.

668
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,559
Fan Xian.

669
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,680
According to the memorial submitted
by Court of State Ceremonials,

670
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,359
you've done a great job this time.

671
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,200
The war was started because of you,

672
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,079
and it was ended by you.

673
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:12,000
I don't want to praise you in public.

674
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,160
Come on! Join me for a drink.

675
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,160
Chief Musician Fan, please wait.

676
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,960
Your Majesty, I have something to say.

677
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:40,880
Go ahead.

678
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,680
Besides being good at martial arts,

679
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:44,200
Fan Xian is also famous for
literary grace.

680
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:45,880
I'm amazed by his talents

681
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,920
in writing poems.

682
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,039
Recently, I've heard that

683
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:49,279
when negotiating with Beiqi,

684
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,880
Fan Xian handled it properly without
being too humble or too pushy.

685
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,599
He can be entrusted
with important tasks.

686
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,480
Just go straight to the point.

687
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,119
Why not put Fan Xian in charge of

688
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,279
the imperial examinations next spring?

689
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,720
Scholars going down in history

690
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,400
under the supervision of a youth talent,

691
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,599
it might become a much told tale.

692
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,320
Though Fan Xian is known for his poems,

693
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
he is inexperienced after all.

694
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,079
Your Majesty.

695
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,559
Though inexperienced,

696
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,679
he is really talented.

697
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,039
I agree.

698
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,840
to put Fan Xian in charge of
the imperial examinations held in spring.

699
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,079
Well...

700
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,159
How could this be?

701
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,760
There're still a few months
before the imperial examinations.

702
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,119
We'll see by then.

703
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,119
You may all leave.

704
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,159
Your Majesty.

705
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,360
Is this young man Fan Xian?

706
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,000
Master Zhuang,
have you also heard of him?

707
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
I've read his poem.

708
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,440
Young as he is,

709
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,880
he's talented in poetry.

710
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,280
Master Zhuang, you should guide and
support the younger generation.

711
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,239
I'm a minister from Beiqi.

712
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,440
I should not interfere with
the political affairs of Nanqing.

713
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,519
But the imperial examinations
held in spring

714
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,199
are of fundamental importance

715
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,599
to scholars around the world.

716
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,519
You should be cautious

717
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,719
when choosing the man in charge.

718
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,840
Master Zhuang, you're absolutely right.

719
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,159
When it comes to
the imperial examinations,

720
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,119
we can't be too cautious.

721
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,159
Master Zhuang, I admire you for being
well versed in the learning of

722
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,360
both ancient and modern times,

723
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,280
but I don't agree with
what you just said.

724
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,280
Though I'm a woman

725
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,440
with little knowledge,

726
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:57,239
I've read the seven-character poem
written by Fan Xian.

727
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,159
He's young indeed,

728
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,920
but this poem alone

729
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,000
can show he's really talented.

730
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,719
What you said just now

731
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,280
is secretly against Fan Xian.

732
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,599
Are you afraid that

733
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,199
this young man might surpass you one day

734
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,960
and gain a better reputation than you?

735
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,840
Everyone else present here
is either a trustworthy minister

736
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,320
or a learned scholar.

737
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,639
They certainly don't like to argue.

738
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,320
Ignorant as I am,

739
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,679
I'm willing to speak up for

740
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,119
our talent of Nanqing.

741
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,079
Are you referring to
that seven-character poem?

742
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:36,960
Exactly.

743
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,599
Master, have you got any poem

744
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,559
better than that?

745
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,559
Yunrui, mind your manners in the Hall.

746
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,639
Master Zhuang, you're broad-minded.

747
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,639
Please forgive her for being rude.

748
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:02,800
The wind so swift,
the sky so wide, apes wail and cry;

749
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,079
Water so clear and beach so white,
birds wheel and fly.

750
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,559
The boundless forest sheds its leaves
shower by shower;

751
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The endless river rolls its waves
hour after hour.

752
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:21,119
A thousand miles from home,
I'm grieved at autumn's plight;

753
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,599
Ill now and then for years,
alone I'm on this height.

754
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,239
Living in times so hard,
at frosted hair I pine;

755
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:38,440
Cast down by poverty,
I have to give up wine.

756
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:43,199
What a fantastic poem!

757
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,480
I've written poems my whole life,

758
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,039
but none

759
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,960
can match that.

760
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:50,920
In this case,

761
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,360
you admit defeat candidly.

762
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,440
The first four lines are wonderful.

763
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,400
But people all say

764
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,320
the essence of the poem

765
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,480
is the latter four lines.

766
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,639
The latter four lines
are absolutely marvelous.

767
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,920
It's a pity that

768
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,280
they were not written by Mr. Fan.

769
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,320
So Fan Xian copied the poem.

770
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,360
Yes.

771
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,480
I also find it strange.

772
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,760
How could he

773
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,000
be so talented?

774
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,639
Fan Xian,

775
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:35,559
do you have anything to say?

776
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,679
Master Zhuang can say

777
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:38,519
whatever he likes

778
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,519
After all,
highly respected as Master Zhuang,

779
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,840
what he says counts even
if he has no proof.

780
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,199
Your Majesty,

781
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:45,639
I can prove that

782
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,920
Fan Xian wrote the poem
at the poetry gathering

783
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,800
held in Prince Jing's mansion.

784
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:51,239
Guo Baokun, the Imperial Compiler

785
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:52,320
was also there.

786
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,079
He can be a witness.

787
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,360
Is Guo Baokun here?

788
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

789
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,039
Did Fan Xian write the poem?

790
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,159
Yes.

791
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,800
In this case,

792
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:15,119
Master Zhuang is trying to
frame Fan Xian up on purpose.

793
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,360
He might be misled by others

794
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,119
to form such a misunderstanding.

795
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,599
What a coincidence!

796
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,360
The latter four lines of the poem

797
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:31,400
were written by my teacher

798
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,199
when he was visiting Tingzhou.

799
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,239
It should to be a good thing to see

800
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,360
such wonderful lines reappearing
in the world.

801
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,039
But Mr. Fan

802
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,480
actually made a name with other's poem.

803
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,199
Is that appropriate?

804
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,000
For scholars,
morality is more important than talent.

805
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:58,519
The first four lines of the poem

806
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,840
are remarkable.

807
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,679
Mr. Fan is definitely talented.

808
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:07,400
But why does he have to be so greedy

809
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,280
as to make a name

810
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,320
with other's work.

811
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,360
I was hesitant about

812
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,559
telling the truth.

813
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,440
But after careful thinking,

814
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:25,000
I feel that by telling the truth,

815
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,199
I might help Mr. Fan

816
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,440
and decided to
return to the correct path.

817
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,360
There's no making without breaking.

818
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,719
He can focus on moral cultivation
in future.

819
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,119
Mr. Fan,

820
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,599
I told the truth

821
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,159
because I cherish your talents.

822
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,000
I mean no harm.

823
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:46,559
Please be introspective.

824
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:47,840
Fan Xian,

825
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,199
feel free to speak your mind.

826
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,039
Master Zhuang,

827
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,079
is your teacher surnamed Du?

828
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,880
No.

829
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:00,360
Never mind.

830
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,559
Master Zhuang is known for

831
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:04,960
respecting teachers and honoring truth,

832
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,199
I suppose
he won't use his teacher's reputation

833
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,199
to frame up an innocent man.

834
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,039
But men are hard to predict.

835
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:14,920
He might feel unhappy

836
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,079
seeing a young man rising to his fame

837
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,480
and make all this up to
destroy his future.

838
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,159
If the Princess Royal

839
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,480
are you suspecting me of
framing this young man up

840
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,199
at the cost of my teacher's reputation?

841
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,320
I dare not.

842
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,320
It's just that unlike Beiqi,

843
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,599
Nanqing emphasizes laws.

844
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,480
If you want to accuse someone,

845
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,360
words alone

846
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,119
won't be enough.

847
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,079
Your Highness, you've made a point.

848
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,079
Look, it was written by my teacher

849
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,320
back then.

850
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,679
Could it be

851
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,280
the proof?

852
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,800
The lines are exactly the same.

853
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:45,039
Even without the handwritten copy,

854
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,920
we can see the truth.

855
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:51,599
The latter four lines of the poem

856
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,960
depict a desolated

857
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:56,199
and frustrated life.

858
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:59,480
Without going through

859
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,280
ups and downs in life,

860
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,960
how could anyone ever depict
such an artistic conception?

861
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,800
But Mr. Fan,

862
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:09,679
you're successful and famous
at a young age.

863
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,800
How could you be so sad

864
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,159
and desolated?

865
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:19,039
When a young man
tries to express sorrow,

866
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,599
he would normally go too far.

867
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:35,800
Your Majesty.

868
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,400
Your Majesty.

869
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,320
Fan Xian gains a reputation
by deception.

870
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,039
He's utterly shameless.

871
00:43:46,679 --> 00:43:47,840
By doing so,

872
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:49,760
he has disgraced

873
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,599
all the scholars of Nanqing.

874
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:51,639
I beg Your Majesty to

875
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:53,599
deprive him of his official title,

876
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:54,599
expel him from the capital city,

877
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,880
and never recruit him
as an official again.

878
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,480
Young Master Guo!

879
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,119
Since I've disgraced

880
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,159
Nanqing,

881
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,039
why are you so happy?

882
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,400
Nonsense!

883
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:06,960
I'm just furious.

884
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:09,559
I feel ashamed to be your colleague.

885
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,760
When did you know that Master Zhuang

886
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,159
would argue about the truth on the Hall?

887
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,400
I just heard him of course.

888
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,800
Then why did you say with certainty that

889
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,920
I would be utterly discredited

890
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,320
the moment I arrived at

891
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,119
the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest?

892
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:31,199
Either you're good at fortune-telling,

893
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,800
or you've hooked up with Master Zhuang

894
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,039
in advance!

895
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
Nonsense!

896
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:38,239
How could you use "hook up" to describe

897
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:39,119
my relationship with Master Zhuang?

898
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:40,119
Well,

899
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:41,719
At such a critical moment,

900
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:43,360
just forget about the choice of words.

901
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,519
Your Majesty,

902
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:52,519
my son doesn't get along with Fan Xian
all the time.

903
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,719
Their dispute matters nothing.

904
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:57,320
What's important now

905
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,480
is Fan Xian's poem.

906
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:01,519
Since he copied other's work,

907
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:03,079
he should be severely punished,

908
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:06,400
or the public anger

909
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,440
won't be quelled.

910
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:11,760
Minister, good for you.

911
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,079
You pointed out the heart of
the matter directly.

912
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,159
I just spoke my mind impartially.

913
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,639
Master Zhuang,

914
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:20,920
you're right.

915
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,920
I copied that poem from others.

916
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:27,880
He really copied from other's work!

917
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,440
Mr. Fan,

918
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,159
you're brave to admit your mistake.

919
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,199
After this, you're sure

920
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,079
to achieve great success in future.

921
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,719
Stop flattering me.

922
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:49,920
Master Zhuang,

923
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,559
I copied poem for myself,

924
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,519
and you copied poem for your teacher.

925
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:56,400
We're no different.

926
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:57,159
In fact,

927
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:58,840
you're not as frank as I am.

928
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,119
This poem

929
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,920
is written by Du Fu, the Saint of Poem,

930
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,239
who is also known as Shaoling Yelao.

931
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:06,400
It has nothing to do with your teacher.

932
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:11,280
Gaining fame for your teacher
by deceiving the public,

933
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,400
Master Zhuang is really a role model
of respecting teacher and honoring truth.

934
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,800
The Saint of Poem?

935
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,360
Which dynasty

936
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,760
was he from?

937
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,360
As the Saint of Poem,

938
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,840
did he go down in history?

939
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,880
We can't find him in historical records.

940
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:33,719
I see.

941
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:35,280
Because his poems

942
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,920
are from another world.

943
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,719
A world lasts for thousands of years

944
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,440
and is filled with splendid poems.

945
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,400
Is it the fairyland

946
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:49,199
existed in legends?

947
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,920
Feel free to laugh! Feel free to laugh!

948
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:58,239
It's definitely the fairyland

949
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,119
compared to your world.

950
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:04,400
Have you been there?

951
00:47:06,679 --> 00:47:08,719
It's a picture scroll
left from my dream,

952
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,960
a memory left in my head.

953
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:13,000
Your Excellency Fan,

954
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,119
you mean

955
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,239
you've travelled to the fairyland

956
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,719
and recited a poem in your dream.

957
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,360
Your Majesty.

958
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:33,159
what Fan Xian said

959
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,519
is utterly ridiculous.

960
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,679
By making up such an absurd story,
he lied to Your Majesty.

961
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,960
Your Majesty, I beg you to punish him!

962
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:47,079
Master Zhuang,

963
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:49,719
has your teacher written a lot of poems?

964
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,599
My teacher has written
many excellent poems.

965
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,880
Does he have many unpublished poems?

966
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,039
I've gone through all his works,

967
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,119
and that is the only poem

968
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,360
that remains unpublished.

969
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,559
Who told you
I only recited one poem in my dream?

970
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,760
Give me paper.

971
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,159
Give me ink.

972
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:30,760
Mr. Fan,

973
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,559
if you want to compose poems,

974
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,280
I'd like to write them down for you.

975
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,320
You want to

976
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,119
improvise more poems

977
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:47,400
to prove that you saw them all

978
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,320
from the fairyland?

979
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,119
you don't know

980
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,079
That memory

981
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:56,280
is literally carved

982
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,719
into my head.

983
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,280
Every word I saw

984
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,480
and every book I read,

985
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:04,840
I can remember them clearly

986
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,320
as if they're right in front of me.

987
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,920
Do you know what you're talking about?

988
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,800
I'm afraid he's so exasperated that

989
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,559
he starts to talk nonsense.

990
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,239
Don't you see
the Yellow River pouring from heaven,

991
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:33,119
rushing to the sea, never to return?

992
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,920
Don't you see, in the hall
the mirror is saddened by the grey hair?

993
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,239
Young and dark at dawn,
but at dusk snowy!

994
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,239
Ah, let's enjoy ourselves while we can.

995
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:53,079
"It's wrong to set goblets idle,
in the glory of the moon."

996
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:58,800
I was created by Heaven,
certainly not for nothing.

997
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,800
As for money,
it scatters and gathers as money should.

998
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:13,039
When will there be no more
moon and spring flowers?

999
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,880
For me who had so many memorable hours?

1000
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,000
If youask me
how much my sorrow has increased,

1001
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:26,119
just see the overbrimming river
flowing east!

1002
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:30,079
I do not know in the celestial sphere.

1003
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,159
what name this festive night goes by?

1004
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,280
I want to fly home, riding the air,

1005
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:40,559
but fear the ethereal cold up there.

1006
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,239
The jade and crystal mansions are so high!
[*It's too high and too cold for me.]

1007
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,199
Dancing to my shadow,

1008
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,760
I feel no longer the mortal tie.

1009
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,519
Though drunk,
we lit the lamp to see the glaive.

1010
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:57,280
Sober, we heard the horns
from tent to tent.

1011
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,119
Under the flags, beef grilled was eaten
by our warriors brave.

1012
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,880
And martial airs were played
by fifty instruments.

1013
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,000
It was an autumn maneuver in the field.

1014
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:19,719
We wished to fly in heaven,
two birds with the wings of one,

1015
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,199
and to grow together on the earth,
two branches of one tree.

1016
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:27,440
On the road ahead
surely will be friends dear and true.

1017
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,280
Throughout the land is there anyone
who knows not you?

1018
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,119
My attic which last night
in vernal wind did stand.

1019
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,639
A few plum twigs
at the corner of the wall

1020
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,840
blossoming all alone, defying the cold!

1021
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,960
Would you have me bow my head
before mighty princes?

1022
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,360
On war-torn land streams flow
and mountains stand.

1023
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:48,800
In vernal town grass
and weeds are overgrown.

1024
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,280
Though I am white-haired,
still I'd sing and drink my fill.

1025
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,880
Hating to part,
hearing birds breaks our heart.

1026
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,679
We can't fly wing to wing
like a pair of phoenixes,

1027
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:03,480
yet our hearts closely linked
beat in harmony.

1028
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:06,679
Here's my precious horse,
here's my priceless fur.

1029
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,679
Tell the boy to give them for the wine.

1030
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,280
I want to fly home, riding the air,

1031
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,440
but fear the ethereal cold up there.

1032
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,239
Hear spring rain
falling in a small mansionall night!

1033
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,519
Till mountains crumble, streams run dry,

1034
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:26,400
thunder rumbles in winter,
snow falls in summer.

1035
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,559
West of the Yangguan Pass
you'll see no more of mine.

1036
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:31,079
I do not know in the celestial sphere.

1037
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:32,760
Men are born sentimental and emotional.

1038
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,039
Myriad footpaths
with no human traces shown.

1039
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,000
For the long years,

1040
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,960
to whom can I my grief convey?

1041
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,480
Youth do not know real depression.

1042
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,920
Time passes indifferently,
turning people from young to old.

1043
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:51,440
Revived even if she be,
could she still know me?

1044
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,800
Near a cottage a stream flows.

1045
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,199
How panic-stricken I was retreating
before the Tartars!

1046
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:02,760
Being a captive,
I lamented over my solitary confinement.

1047
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Who can avert his death
since time immemorial?

1048
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:13,119
Let my heart remain true to
shine in the annals.

1049
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:23,039
No ancients before me,

1050
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:27,559
nor comers from behind.

1051
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:34,679
Reflecting on
the infinite heaven and earth,

1052
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:41,119
Alone, in a sadness sublime,
my tears come.

1053
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:56,599
Is it over one hundred?

1054
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:00,480
Mr. Fan, it's way over one hundred.

1055
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,559
That'll be enough.

1056
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,440
How could there be any fairyland
in the world?

1057
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:08,519
If not,

1058
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:09,119
where do all these poems

1059
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,360
come from?

1060
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,400
They must be written by himself!

1061
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,800
Even if

1062
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,079
he writes them all,

1063
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:24,960
even if he writes thousands of poems,

1064
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,800
it can't prove that

1065
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,039
he didn't copy that poem.

1066
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,519
He can recite marvelous poems
without thinking.

1067
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:34,199
how could he

1068
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:35,800
copy other's work?

1069
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,079
Why should he?

1070
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,639
When it comes to explaining
classic texts and annotating articles,

1071
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,239
you win.

1072
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,800
But when it comes to reciting poems,

1073
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:54,599
I win.

1074
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:58,360
For a literary giant...

1075
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:01,639
...I'm not qualified.

1076
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:05,320
But for a man,

1077
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,840
you're not qualified.

1078
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:24,239
Since I am drunk and sleepy,
you may go...

1079
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,239
What's wrong, Master Zhuang?

1080
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:37,559
What's wrong, Master Zhuang?

1081
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,480
Master Zhuang!

1082
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,199
Master Zhuang, wake up!

1083
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:47,639
Get the imperial physician!

1084
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,400
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

1085
00:55:57,239 --> 00:55:59,079
Come on.
Put the sober soup on the table.

1086
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:01,280
Put it here! Put it here! Right!

1087
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,400
Plump the pillow

1088
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,320
to make it soft.

1089
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:05,519
He drank too much.

1090
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:06,440
Make sure
he won't get a stiff neck tomorrow.

1091
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,000
The plan remains unchanged.
Wait for me outside the palace walls.

1092
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,039
No!

1093
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:15,280
You're so drunk.

1094
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,000
Let's make it another day.

1095
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,079
He's here! He's here!

1096
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,079
Mr. Fan, the poetic genius, is here!

1097
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,440
You're here! Hurry up!

1098
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:21,920
Put him on the bed! Put him on the bed!

1099
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:23,039
Be careful! Be careful!

1100
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:28,840
Slow down!

1101
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:30,920
Cover him up!

1102
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:32,159
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

1103
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,800
Be careful! Cover him up!

1104
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:40,079
Thank you!

1105
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,519
You may go back and rest.

1106
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:48,000
Thank you!

1107
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:51,159
I'll take care of my brother.

1108
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,519
You may go back and rest.

1109
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,639
There're a lot of servants here.

1110
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,400
No need to bother you.

1111
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,480
Save it!

1112
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,599
Enough of that.

1113
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,599
No need to make a fuss.

1114
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,320
He's just drunk.

1115
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,199
Do you know what your brother has done

1116
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:06,119
in the imperial palace?

1117
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:06,840
What?

1118
00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:08,440
He's a well-known poetic genius now.

1119
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,679
His Majesty ordered

1120
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:14,840
the imperial guards

1121
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:17,039
to escort His Excellency Fan home.

1122
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,119
His Majesty also said

1123
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,079
to take good care of him.

1124
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,119
Now,

1125
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:24,320
he is the treasure of

1126
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,400
Nanqing.

1127
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,519
Of course not.

1128
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,840
I mean it.

1129
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,239
Your Excellency, you don't know.

1130
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,559
Mr. Fan composed poems

1131
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:35,320
out of drunkenness tonight.

1132
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:36,760
Everyone in the Hall

1133
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,039
was stunned and startled.

1134
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,840
Many said in private that

1135
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,800
he's really a poetic genius
sent from heaven.

1136
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:52,079
Look at your brother Fan Xian.

1137
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,400
He's such a promising young man.

1138
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:55,239
Look at you! You only want to sleep.

1139
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,119
Just learn from your brother.

1140
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,079
Isn't he also sleeping now?

1141
00:57:59,239 --> 00:57:59,639
He...

1142
00:58:01,159 --> 00:58:02,239
Ask them to leave.

1143
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:03,320
You are different!

1144
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:05,760
Get up!

1145
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,840
It's late.

1146
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:08,639
Go back and rest.

1147
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,599
I'll take care of my bother.

1148
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:10,960
No need to rest.

1149
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,159
He's become a well-known genius.

1150
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,360
We should take good care of him.

1151
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,719
Make some midnight snacks in case that

1152
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,440
he wants something to eat
after waking up.

1153
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:16,880
Go there now.

1154
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:17,719
Hurry up!

1155
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:18,199
Enough of that.

1156
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:22,440
Just leave.

1157
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:23,840
Brother needs to rest.

1158
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:27,960
Go! Go! Leave now!

1159
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:28,719
Let him have a good rest.

1160
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,840
Be quiet! Be quiet!

1161
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,039
It's time to go.

1162
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,960
Let your brother have a good rest.

1163
00:58:38,199 --> 00:58:38,639
Leave now!

1164
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,039
We should leave early.

1165
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,239
Brother!

1166
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:54,159
Brother, are you OK?

1167
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:05,760
I'm fine.

1168
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:16,239
Did Zhuang Mohan really spit blood?

1169
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,039
Yes.

1170
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:22,280
After tonight,

1171
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:26,039
Fan Xian will be known
as a poetic genius.

1172
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:28,639
In this case,

1173
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,719
Zhuang Mohan has made a lie to
frame Fan Xian up.

1174
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,679
His good reputation over seventy years

1175
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,719
was ruined over one night.

1176
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,880
He actually ruined his life

1177
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,320
at such an old age.

1178
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,760
After writing down so many poems,

1179
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,159
your hand must be sore.

1180
00:59:54,519 --> 00:59:57,039
Now that there's good news
from our literary circles,

1181
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,760
it's a happy event rarely seen.

1182
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:01,920
Even if my hand would be broken
for writing down the poems,

1183
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,400
I still feel happy
from the bottom of my heart.

1184
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,880
Your Majesty, are you tired?

1185
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:12,679
I just feel emotional.

1186
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,639
Nanqing was founded
with military forces.

1187
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:17,840
When it comes to civil administration,

1188
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:19,719
we're far behind compared to Beiqi.

1189
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,960
The late emperor

1190
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:24,280
was deeply concerned about it at heart.

1191
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:26,920
God blesses Nanqing.

1192
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,920
Now we have Mr. Fan, the poetic genius.

1193
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:32,719
Poetic genius?

1194
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,880
Or may be a lost genius?

1195
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:42,480
But the poems

1196
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,400
are really good.

1197
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:49,679
But I'm wondering

1198
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,920
whether he wrote them or not.

1199
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,119
Haven't you taken the medicine?

1200
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:06,920
It helps to vomit.

1201
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:09,360
Ruoruo,

1202
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,119
some people in the imperial court

1203
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:12,000
have conspired with Zhuang Mohan.

1204
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:13,440
What happened today is a setup.

1205
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:15,079
Who might they be?

1206
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,320
The Princess Royal and Guo Youzhi.

1207
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:19,159
If the Princess Royal

1208
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:21,400
Didn't she defend you

1209
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:22,800
all the time in the Hall?

1210
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:23,880
You're a smart girl.

1211
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:25,119
How can you fall for her trick?

1212
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,480
I'll sneak into
the imperial palace tonight.

1213
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:31,840
But brother, you're too drunk.

1214
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,079
Because I'm drunk,

1215
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:34,239
no one will suspect me.

1216
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:34,920
Ruoruo,

1217
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:36,840
guard the room for me.

1218
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:37,840
Don't let anyone in.

1219
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:39,599
I know.

1220
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:40,880
As long as I'm alive,

1221
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,119
no one can get in.
