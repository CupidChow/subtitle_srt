00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:43,011
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:44,680
Fan.

4
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,120
Why are you here today?

5
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,319
I want you to help me with one thing.

6
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,359
What is it?

7
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,000
I want to see the girls in your house.

8
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:54,959
Which one?

9
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,359
All of them.

10
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,680
Well.

11
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,400
Once I tell you whom she is,

12
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,840
Ruoruo, you go and grab her.

13
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,480
If I do it,

14
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,400
I'm afraid it's a little rude.

15
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,920
Please rest assured.

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,719
You will never be ruder.

17
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,360
Your Highness, I will get started.

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Come and line up.

19
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,719
One by one.

20
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:28,840
Come here.

21
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:33,919
Do you want this one?

22
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,319
This one?

23
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,919
Next. Next.

24
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,479
Next one.

25
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,599
I think this girl is good, brother.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,400
Come one, next one.

27
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,039
Next one.

28
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,599
Come. You can go.

29
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,479
Next one. Next one.

30
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay. Next one.

31
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,199
Actually, this one is okay.

32
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,919
It must be her.

33
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,159
You haven't found her out?

34
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,080
It's okay.

35
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,680
Just wait.

36
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,280
The next batch. Come on.

37
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,599
You are really picky.

38
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,199
Go. Go. Go.

39
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,159
Don't be afraid. Go. Hurry.

40
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,520
Is it her?

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,439
Fine. It's not her.

42
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,159
Go. Go. Go.

43
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,080
My brother doesn't want to see you.

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,639
Please rise.

45
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,080
Haven't you found her?

46
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't worry.

47
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,479
Brother, we still have another batch.

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
The next batch. Come.

49
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,199
They are all here?

50
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,520
Yes.

51
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
That's impossible.

52
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,639
I saw her on the poetry gathering.

53
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,759
That day,

54
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,279
there were many guests.

55
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:20,959
The maidservant you're looking for

56
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,279
might not be from my mansion.

57
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:24,759
If so,

58
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,839
it won't be easy to find her.

59
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,720
What if I visit all the families

60
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,519
one by one?

61
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,879
I'm afraid
you'll probably be kicked out.

62
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,360
Maybe we should stop.

63
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,240
Actually, there's still another way.

64
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,319
But it's much worse.

65
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,279
Even worse?

66
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,279
Sister, can I go home?

67
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:58,839
Ruoruo,

68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,800
do you know Lin Wan'er?

69
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,120
I've met her several times
and talked a few words.

70
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,040
Where does she live?

71
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,759
Sick with tuberculosis,

72
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,240
she stays in an imperial residence
all the year round.

73
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,240
She is the key to this marriage.

74
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,399
Come on!
Let's go to the imperial residence.

75
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,199
Are you going to

76
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,720
kill her?

77
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,120
Come with me.

78
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,160
You don't go inside?

79
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,079
I don't.

80
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,639
They are crazy!

81
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,399
Lady Ruoruo, wait a moment.

82
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
I will go and report.

83
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:53,439
Thank you.

84
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,439
Fan Ruoruo has gone to
the imperial residence,

85
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,240
saying she has brought a famous doctor

86
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,360
to see Wan'er.

87
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,680
Auntie, why are you smiling so weirdly?

88
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,759
That doctor

89
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:37,720
is Fan Xian.

90
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,120
They're not married yet.
How can they meet in private?

91
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,759
I heard that Fan Xian is
the student of Fei Jie.

92
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,240
Those who are good at using poison
are also doctors.

93
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,079
Let them see Wan'er.

94
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,720
Auntie,

95
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,800
aren't you against

96
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,040
the marriage all the time?

97
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,120
Fan Xian just left
Prince Jing's mansion,

98
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,800
saying that he wants to
find a maidservant.

99
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,959
A drumstick girl.

100
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:05,800
You heard about it?

101
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,480
A little bird told me.

102
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,199
Wan'er doesn't want to marry him.

103
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,800
Nor does Fan Xian.

104
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,600
The only person insist on
them getting married

105
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,160
is His Majesty.

106
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,560
If Wan'er detests

107
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,959
or even hates Fan Xian,

108
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,759
then His Majesty might reconsider it.

109
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,879
I see.

110
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,759
By pretending to be a doctor,

111
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,480
Fan Xian wants to piss Wan'er,

112
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,399
so as to ruin the marriage.

113
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,839
In this sense,

114
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,199
I hope he can succeed.

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,639
Do you think he can see Lin Wan'er?

116
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,199
A patient suffers from a long illness
certainly wants to see a famous doctor.

117
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,759
Choosing a maidservant

118
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,519
over a princess,

119
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,240
it's not worth it.

120
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,519
Indeed.

121
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,759
In this city,

122
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,680
only he will make such a choice.

123
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,759
Second Young Master!

124
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,560
Fan Sizhe.

125
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,120
You must be Fan Xian!

126
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,799
Sorry to keep you waiting.

127
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,879
Lady Ruoruo and doctor,

128
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,200
please follow me to see the princess.

129
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,200
Lustful, aggressive,
mischievous and ignorant as he is,

130
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,919
Wan'er will never marry

131
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,000
your incorrigible brother.

132
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,360
Tell Fan Xian.

133
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,720
If he doesn't give up,

134
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,960
this is what he'll become.

135
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,759
Who's that?

136
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,039
Do you know who Lin Wan'er is?

137
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:09,840
She's the bastard daughter
of the Princess Royal.

138
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,279
Her birth father

139
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,480
is the current Prime Minister Lin Ruofu.

140
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,000
I've also heard that.

141
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,279
The Prime Minister has two sons.

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,919
That's Lin Gong,

143
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,840
the Second Young Master of

144
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,679
the Lin mansion.

145
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,320
So he's the second brother
of Lin Wan'er.

146
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,759
Judged from his attitude,

147
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,639
he doesn't seem to like Fan Xian.

148
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,039
That's understandable.

149
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,919
If I were him,
I wouldn't like Fan Xian, either.

150
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,159
Lin Gong

151
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,159
cares for Lin Wan'er

152
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,679
since childhood.

153
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,960
If I were in his shoes,

154
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,240
I wouldn't want my sister

155
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,120
to marry such a troublemaker.

156
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,159
Just think about all the troubles
Fan Xian has caused

157
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,440
since he arrived in the capital city.

158
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,200
To be honest,

159
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,840
if it weren't for the strict rules
of the Lin family,

160
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,639
short-tempered as he is,

161
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,639
he might have rushed into

162
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,200
our mansion long ago.

163
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:01,639
I've made my point.

164
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,759
Just leave!

165
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,759
Second Young Master, I've brought

166
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,279
a great doctor

167
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,720
to see Wan'er today.

168
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,200
Wan'er has got tuberculosis.

169
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,240
So many famous doctors
failed to offer a solution.

170
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,080
Young as he is,

171
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,679
how dare you call him great?

172
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,279
What are you doing?

173
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,320
Go away!

174
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,080
Three!

175
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,759
Guards!

176
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,000
Kick this fraudulent quack

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,440
out!

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Two!

179
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,360
Ridiculous!

180
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,200
One!

181
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:49,759
I was right!

182
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,279
His disease...

183
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:54,519
You... you...

184
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,480
What did you do to me?

185
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Just let me save him first!

186
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,559
His disease...

187
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
can't be delayed.

188
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,960
His disease...

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,320
His disease...

190
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,559
for a long time.

191
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,639
Luckily, you meet me today.

192
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,919
It can produce
an excruciating pain in the chest.

193
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,600
Once broke out, it can't be delayed.

194
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,759
Or you'll die.

195
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,279
Take this pill right away!

196
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,440
Young Master, if you don't take it,

197
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,240
you'll die.

198
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,480
It's so effective!

199
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,240
What's the name of the disease?

200
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,039
It's called Why Giving Up.

201
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,480
What does it mean?

202
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,320
It means the disease is tricky.

203
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,559
Normally, the cause of the disease
can't be figured out.

204
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,799
And eventually,
the patient has to abandon treatment.

205
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,840
Why are you still here! Get out!

206
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,519
Yes!

207
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,919
I was wrong.

208
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,840
Master, you're really a great doctor!

209
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,039
Will you forgive my ignorance

210
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,360
and see my sister?

211
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,759
As doctors, we should be benevolent.
Just lead the way.

212
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,240
I drugged him.

213
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,240
Second Young Master!

214
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,240
Lady Wan'er has lied down

215
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,399
as you commanded.

216
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,399
Master, sorry for this.

217
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,360
She's unmarried after all.

218
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,759
It's improper for her to show her face.

219
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,399
Master, please.

220
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,360
I'm Fan Xian.

221
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,279
I'm here to see

222
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,039
what my future wife

223
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,639
looks like!

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm most certain that

225
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,240
by making such a fuss today,

226
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,000
you'll have to
let me cancel the marriage!

227
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,919
Fan Xian!

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,519
Master.

229
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,240
I'm thinking about the disease.

230
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,559
I'll feel her pulse first.

231
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,080
I'm so sorry.

232
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,759
I'm also doing this for your benefit.

233
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:49,720
Master, sorry to trouble you.

234
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,720
Who... who are you?

235
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,519
Who is your Young Master?

236
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,840
Master, is there anything wrong?

237
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,120
To treat the disease,
a guiding drug is needed.

238
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,559
What is it?

239
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,120
A greasy drumstick
under the censer table

240
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,519
in the side palace hall
of the Qing Temple.

241
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,399
Such a weird guiding drug.

242
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,080
Why are they still inside?

243
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,440
Lin Gong is inside,
and so does Fan Xian.

244
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:20,720
Will they get into a fight

245
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,399
inside?

246
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
What's so good

247
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,440
about girls?

248
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,559
They are talkative and troublesome.

249
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,360
To me,

250
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,399
I might as well count the money!

251
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,840
You're still young.

252
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,200
I'm not!

253
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,679
Besides,

254
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,879
it's not relevant.

255
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:49,679
Why not have a try?

256
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,320
Try talking to a girl?

257
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:03,200
That one seems nice.

258
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,399
Should I have a try?

259
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,000
She's good.

260
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,919
Lady, wait a moment!

261
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:16,759
Would you like to

262
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,639
play Pai Gow with me?

263
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,799
Who are you?

264
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,399
I'm the son of Earl Sinan.

265
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,879
Fan Xian!

266
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,759
If I were Fan Xian,

267
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,399
will you play Pai Gow with me?

268
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,600
Nothing to look at! Let's go!

269
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,160
Girls are horrible!

270
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,119
What are you doing?

271
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,680
I'm seeing the patient.

272
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:19,839
Don't you need to feel her pulse?

273
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,319
Watching her face will do.

274
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,599
What do you get?

275
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,440
Does she often cough?

276
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:25,359
Yes!

277
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,920
Does she pine away day by day?

278
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,599
Right!

279
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,799
Does she often sweat?

280
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:29,640
Right!

281
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,200
Does she often feel a hot flush?

282
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,200
Do you figure that out simply
by watching her face?

283
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,039
Has she coughed blood?

284
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:34,720
Yes, she has.

285
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,559
What's wrong with her?

286
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,480
I've confirmed the case.

287
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,000
It's tuberculosis.

288
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,079
We've already known that.

289
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,160
No need for you to tell us!

290
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,119
It can be treated
as long as I know her conditions.

291
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,599
Really?

292
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,079
What does she eat?

293
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,440
We've paid attention to that.

294
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,519
No meat and fish.
Keep it plain and simple.

295
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,160
You're risking her life.

296
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,200
How is that?

297
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,359
Tuberculosis is
a chronic wasting disease.

298
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,559
She really needs to eat meat and fish.

299
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,160
If she seldom eats meat and fish,

300
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
she'll grow weak gradually.

301
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,839
Food such as drumsticks

302
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:08,960
can definitely be served more often.

303
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,799
I'm worried by eating meat,

304
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,920
I'll feel nauseated.

305
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:13,880
It's fine.

306
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,599
After vomiting several times,
you'll just get used to it.

307
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:24,920
Is that OK?

308
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,759
I'll write a prescription for her later.

309
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:29,759
In addition,

310
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,079
open that window

311
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,160
more often.

312
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,279
She needs to breathe the fresh air.

313
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,240
Whether it should be closed
or not at night,

314
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,400
it's up to the lady.

315
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,359
After all,

316
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,119
you have to prevent others
from entering your room at night.

317
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,559
Second Young Master, see you later.

318
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,279
Lady Ruoruo,

319
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,680
the doctor is really talented.

320
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,240
Our family

321
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,000
really owes you this time.

322
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,680
But my mind has not changed.

323
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,160
I won't let your brother

324
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,160
marry Wan'er.

325
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,319
Because Wan'er already has someone

326
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,200
in her heart.

327
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,079
-Who? -What?

328
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,519
It must be Guo Baokun,

329
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:28,599
son of the Minister of
the Board of Rites,

330
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,920
who serves as the imperial compiler.

331
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,240
Guo Bao...

332
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,319
Second Young Master, see you later.

333
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,240
Guo Baokun?!

334
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,319
How could it be Guo Baokun?

335
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,799
Guo Baokun?

336
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,759
Second Young Master!

337
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,279
who's that?

338
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,920
A famous doctor invited by Ruoruo.

339
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:50,720
He's really good.

340
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,319
How could it be Guo Baokun?!

341
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,319
It's too dramatic!

342
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,200
Why is Guo Baokun involved?

343
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,279
She spat blood?

344
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,279
Just ask her

345
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,480
about it.

346
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,720
Don't you have a date with her tonight?

347
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,240
Sister,

348
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,319
a date with whom?

349
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,119
Lady Drumstick.

350
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,319
It's all set.
They'll meet through a window.

351
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,279
Are you staying tonight?

352
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,519
Right!

353
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,559
You don't have to.

354
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,319
Moreover, open that window more often.

355
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,920
Whether it should be closed
or not at night,

356
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,480
it's up to the lady.

357
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,119
After all,

358
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,880
you have to prevent others
from entering your room at night.

359
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:53,640
Must it be tonight?

360
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,920
I haven't stayed here for a long time.

361
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,920
Well, you don't want me to stay over?

362
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,319
Lady Drumstick is Lin Wan'er!

363
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,920
Then the girl beat me just now
must be...

364
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:27,799
Ye Ling'er.

365
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,519
No wonder.

366
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,160
Who's Ye Ling'er?

367
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,799
She's the only daughter of Ye Zhong,

368
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,880
the Chief Guard of the capital city.

369
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,799
I've never heard of him.

370
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,839
Ye Liuyun,
who is among the Four Great Masters,

371
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,079
is her granduncle.

372
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:42,119
She's practiced martial arts
since childhood.

373
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,960
And she just loves to fight.

374
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,880
Why did she beat you?

375
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,839
She thought I was you!

376
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,279
Then why does she want to beat me?

377
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,200
Because she's a close friend to Wan'er.

378
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,240
She must have heard
the rumors about you.

379
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,720
So she doesn't want Wan'er to marry you.

380
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,480
The heaven,
earth and man exist in harmony.

381
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,880
Gentlemen shall not stay up for work.

382
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,160
It's midnight already.

383
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,599
Don't cause any trouble recently.

384
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:20,079
Why do you say so?

385
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,839
I've heard that Fan Xian wants to
cancel the marriage.

386
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:27,279
Recently, he's been thinking about

387
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,240
your words.

388
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,480
Then he realized you're right.

389
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,400
Right for what?

390
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,319
Compared to
the financial power of the Neiku,

391
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:35,880
perhaps your mom

392
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,279
would rather see you

393
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,200
with someone you love.

394
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,279
He said he would plead to His Majesty

395
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,720
to cancel the engagement,

396
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,799
so that you can find
that Lady Drumstick.

397
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,240
Whatever

398
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,079
her status is,

399
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,279
Whoever you like,

400
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,680
as long as you like her.

401
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,960
You've been quarreled over this
for so long.

402
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
It's not easy for him

403
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,480
to admit his mistake right away.

404
00:22:58,759 --> 00:22:59,680
I just said all these

405
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,839
on his behalf.

406
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:04,359
Well...

407
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,599
I've also thought about it
for a long time.

408
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,119
What about

409
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,319
we keep this marriage?

410
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:17,759
What?

411
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,400
You're the one who wanted to
break off the engagement.

412
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,519
Now suddenly,

413
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,599
you want to keep it instead.

414
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:26,480
Don't be mad!

415
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,440
I know

416
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,279
it's complicated.

417
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:32,200
What should I do? What should I do?

418
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:33,279
How about this?

419
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,440
I need to go out now.

420
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,200
I'll give you an answer
tomorrow morning.

421
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,559
It's so late. Where are you going?

422
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,119
Well...

423
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,599
Wan'er, the water is ready.

424
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,480
Go and wash up.

425
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,680
What are you looking at?

426
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:03,480
Nothing.

427
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,039
It's cold at night.

428
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,799
I'll close the window.

429
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,359
Why close it?

430
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,279
Today, didn't the doctor ask you

431
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,880
to open the window more often
for good ventilation?

432
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:22,799
Go and wash up.

433
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,240
The water will be cold after a while.

434
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:25,480
Just go!

435
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,880
I'll make the bed for you.

436
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,720
Would you like a drumstick?

437
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,440
Why are you here?

438
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,400
If I say I'm here to
deliver the night snack,

439
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,039
will you believe me?

440
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,680
You're a doctor in the day,

441
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,279
but a pervert at night!

442
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:16,640
That's not true! That's not true!

443
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,279
You misunderstood me! You!

444
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:20,759
I'm gonna kill you! Pervert!

445
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:23,920
You hit me so hard!

446
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:24,839
Can you be gentle?

447
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,279
Dapiguan Palm!

448
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,160
If you don't stop, I'll fight back!

449
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,440
Stop! I'm not a pervert!

450
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,240
You can ask Wan'er
if you don't believe me.

451
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,200
You are good!

452
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,000
You're so violent!

453
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,880
She started it!

454
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,000
I brought it for you.

455
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,519
Does it hurt?

456
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,039
I hardly hit her!

457
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:02,559
Are you

458
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,559
having a date?

459
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,119
A princess and a doctor

460
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,680
who are not afraid of worldly prejudice

461
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,480
get together despite
the difference of their statuses.

462
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,160
It's just like

463
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,400
the stories.

464
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,400
What kind of stories

465
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,319
do you usually read?

466
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:19,839
You're good at martial arts.

467
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,000
The palm technique

468
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,039
you used

469
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:23,759
right here

470
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,000
is really smart!

471
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,839
Which one?

472
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,480
This one! This one!

473
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:28,279
You flatter me.

474
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:29,559
Your palm techniques
are actually marvelous.

475
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,599
What I used is called Dapiguan Palm!

476
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:33,359
Fine. Fine.

477
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,079
I lost to you because I'm lame.

478
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,319
It doesn't mean the martial arts

479
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:37,720
handed down by my family are lame.

480
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,200
Sure. Sure.

481
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,960
If you didn't step on that,

482
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,519
I would never defeat you.

483
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:41,920
That's not the case.

484
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,720
I've thought about it.

485
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,880
You led me here

486
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,519
deliberately

487
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,519
just now.

488
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:57,960
I won't deny my loss.

489
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,200
No need to comfort me.

490
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,640
You've got another move.

491
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,839
What's this called?

492
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,759
Like this!

493
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,839
Well.

494
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,720
I haven't named it yet.

495
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,279
It's just a small trick! See?

496
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,039
Awesome! Awesome!

497
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:13,599
Also! Also!

498
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,400
You've got another move.

499
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,279
Right, Wan'er!

500
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,359
You didn't see it.

501
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:18,079
He's got a really awesome move!

502
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:18,880
Can you repeat...

503
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,319
Sorry.

504
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,119
I'm just too obsessed.

505
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,759
You two should talk in private.

506
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,960
I'll see myself out.

507
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:28,880
I won't let anyone get close!

508
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:30,799
Just talk.

509
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
I finally find you.

510
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,240
What for?

511
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,720
I don't know.

512
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,720
I just want to see you.

513
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,480
Really?

514
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,160
Really?

515
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,359
Since we met last time

516
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,480
in the Qing Temple,

517
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,119
The happiest thing I feel

518
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:56,759
is when I dream every day.

519
00:28:57,759 --> 00:28:58,559
Because I can see you

520
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,359
in my dreams.

521
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
I was scared

522
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,920
every time I woke up.

523
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,279
I was scared that

524
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,160
we could only meet each other once.

525
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:07,880
I was afraid

526
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,759
that I could never see you again.

527
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:11,440
Now it's all right!

528
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,440
I've found you!

529
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,200
I feel so relived after finding you.

530
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:32,680
You're really a good talker.

531
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,759
It must be a skill cultivated

532
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:35,640
through dealing with women all the time.

533
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:36,240
Is there any misunderstanding

534
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,240
between us?

535
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,440
I don't think so.

536
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,279
You said you were
the servant of Guo Baokun.

537
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,319
I've sent Ling'er to ask him.

538
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,680
Guo Baokun has stopped using

539
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,680
a servant for a long time.

540
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:46,720
I see.

541
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,839
You went to Guo Baokun to...

542
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:48,480
Don't move!

543
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,799
...inquire about me?

544
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,480
How rude and presumptuous of you

545
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,960
to break into my boudoir at night!

546
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,720
I've given you a hit in the day.

547
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,759
Don't move!

548
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,039
If you really don't want to see me,

549
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:08,880
you'll take out the dagger

550
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,599
when the other girl was here.

551
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,559
This is an imperial residence.

552
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,960
If you really get caught,

553
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,400
you'll be sentenced to death.

554
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,680
So you worry...

555
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,599
You...

556
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,839
I've known you after all,

557
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,839
so I don't want to see you die.

558
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,359
But

559
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:30,759
I don't want to hear

560
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:31,519
your sweet talks, either.

561
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,160
You really think

562
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:35,680
I am

563
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,599
frivolous?

564
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:49,920
Just leave.

565
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,200
Listen.

566
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,279
The window needs to be opened
for good ventilation.

567
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,440
What are you doing?

568
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,039
But it's cold at night.

569
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,279
-You'd better close it. -You...

570
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,440
I ask you to leave.
Don't you understand?

571
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,599
Put it down! Put it down!

572
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:18,440
Leave!

573
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,079
Well...

574
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,240
Just leave!

575
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,400
Calm down!

576
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,119
I'll leaving now!

577
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,759
I agree to leave,

578
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,000
not because I admit being dissolute.

579
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,359
I'm afraid that you might hurt yourself.

580
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,519
But every word

581
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:49,480
I just said

582
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,240
is from the bottom of my heart.

583
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:54,039
I never mean to show disrespect.

584
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,039
Wait!

585
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Who on earth are you?

586
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,759
What's your name?

587
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:11,759
I'm Fan Xian.

588
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,079
Who do you think I am?

589
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,279
How dare you humiliate me like this?

590
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,839
I'm really Fan Xian!

591
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,920
You know I'm engaged to him,

592
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:21,480
so you said his name on purpose

593
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,319
to tease me.

594
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:23,440
It's not true.

595
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,039
I'm Fan Xian.

596
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,079
Fan Xian is me.

597
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,000
I've been called Fan Xian

598
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,839
for so many years.

599
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,240
I'm Fan Xian for real!

600
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,759
Vulgar as he is,

601
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:33,920
I've already seen him.

602
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,599
Actually, you pointed him to me

603
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,319
on the poetry gathering.

604
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,839
I have my reasons.

605
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,240
I'll explain to you later.

606
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:41,880
How is Fan Xian a vulgar man?

607
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:43,960
He beat people on the streets.

608
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,319
He's arrogant and impolite.

609
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:46,039
Everyone knows about that.

610
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:46,799
If you want to know a man,

611
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,559
you need to meet him in person.

612
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,640
You can't believe the rumors.

613
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,319
What about fooling around

614
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,240
with the singing girl on the carriage?

615
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,200
I've never done that.

616
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,480
Then you can't be Fan Xian.

617
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,440
You're misled by rumors.

618
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,519
I've seen it with my own eyes.

619
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:55,200
I remember.

620
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,559
Fan Sizhe was on that carriage.

621
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,519
I was not there.

622
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,680
You've misunderstood me.

623
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,240
Stop justifying yourself!

624
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:02,400
Listen!

625
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,319
If you continue to be disrespectful,

626
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,559
I can really hurt myself.

627
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,039
Ruoruo came with me in the day.

628
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:09,240
If I'm not Fan Xian,

629
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:09,880
how would Ruoruo

630
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,000
take a strange man

631
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,240
to see her future sister-in-law?

632
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,119
You've lived in the capital city
for a long time.

633
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,519
You should know
what kind of a person Ruoruo is.

634
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,440
She won't be so rude.

635
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:24,960
You...

636
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,119
How can you believe me?

637
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,119
Write down that poem.

638
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,599
Lady Ye, why are you standing here?

639
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,159
I...

640
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,760
I'm appreciating
the beauty of the night.

641
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,400
I did hear

642
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,320
noise upstairs.

643
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,599
I was practicing martial arts upstairs.

644
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,719
I might have made some noise.

645
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,280
Princess is sick and weak.

646
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,159
Why would you practice martial arts

647
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,159
in front of her?

648
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,519
I'll check her up.

649
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,119
Wan'er is asleep.

650
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,239
Even if she is,

651
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,480
I'm responsible for checking her up.

652
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,000
Lady Ye, why do you stop me?

653
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,360
You can't go inside!

654
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:34,840
It's really you!

655
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,320
Many people know this poem.

656
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,920
Why are you sure it's me?

657
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:42,079
Indeed! Many people know this poem,

658
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,880
but only one person

659
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,360
writes so ugly.

660
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
Li Hongcheng gave it to me.

661
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:57,280
Do you believe me now?

662
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,039
How can you be...

663
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:00,320
No need to go inside!

664
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,760
Wan'er is really asleep!

665
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,239
Get out of the way!

666
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,119
You really don't have to check her up!

667
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,440
I told you she's asleep!

668
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:41,239
Do you want a bite?

669
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:43,920
Lady Ye, please rest early.

670
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:45,239
I'm not sleepy yet.

671
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:46,840
I'll go to sleep after eating.

672
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:09,559
Where is he?

673
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,239
This...

674
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:22,920
It's an act out of emergency.

675
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,960
I see. I see.

676
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,599
It's a common plot in the stories.

677
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,159
I'd better wait outside.

678
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:35,920
Ling'er! Ling...

679
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,639
Ling'er is gone.

680
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,039
Why don't you get up?

681
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,079
I'm tired. I need a few more minutes.

682
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,280
You can't!

683
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,079
Why not?

684
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,280
I'll be condemned for this.

685
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,679
We're engaged.

686
00:37:58,039 --> 00:37:59,320
But we're not married yet.

687
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,960
Get up!

688
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,840
Get up!

689
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,719
Just get up!

690
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,559
I'll leave if you don't get up!

691
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,079
I'm up.

692
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:25,159
Why are you still here?

693
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:26,960
I'll leave when you're asleep.

694
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:38,280
Just leave.

695
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:40,079
It's bad to be seen.

696
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:41,599
I'm so lucky.

697
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,199
What?

698
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,079
I fell in love with a girl.

699
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,599
It turns out that

700
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,119
she is my future wife.

701
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,239
The God must have blessed me!

702
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,960
Otherwise, how could I be so lucky?

703
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:01,239
Rumor has it that

704
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,000
Miss Si Lili from Joy Tsin House

705
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,639
loves you dearly.

706
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,840
I have nothing to do with her.

707
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,079
We are complete strangers.

708
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:07,679
Really?

709
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:08,559
Really?

710
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,880
I caused so much trouble

711
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,079
only to cancel the marriage.

712
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,480
Why do you want to cancel the marriage?

713
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,239
Because I'm in love with

714
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:19,119
a maidservant who steals drumsticks.

715
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:24,559
Even if you succeed,

716
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,960
Earl Sinan won't allow you

717
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,800
to marry a maidservant.

718
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
I don't listen to him.

719
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,400
What about the imperial edict
from His Majesty?

720
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,760
Then I'll run away

721
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,920
with her.

722
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,199
If His Majesty leads troops in person

723
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,000
to catch me,

724
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,880
I'll take her out of Nanqing

725
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,119
to the end of the world.

726
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,119
And I'll steal lots of chickens
on the way

727
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,199
so that she can eat lots of drumsticks.

728
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,239
How come His Majesty will try to

729
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,679
catch you in person?

730
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,079
You never know.

731
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,239
Is that really your plan?

732
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:56,159
Really?

733
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,880
So I've been looking for you
all the time.

734
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,519
But I'm sick with tuberculosis.

735
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,079
I can't travel with you

736
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,920
to a faraway land.

737
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,559
When you're cured,

738
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,840
I'll take you out.

739
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:23,559
I've been sick for years.

740
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,159
Even the imperial physicians
couldn't cure me.

741
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:28,079
That's because they were wrong
from the start.

742
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,599
I didn't ask you to eat more meat

743
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:31,920
randomly.

744
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,079
Treated carefully,

745
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,840
tuberculosis can also be cured.

746
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,199
Believe me.

747
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,039
I will cure you.

748
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,599
I believe you.

749
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,280
Thank you, Doctor Fan.

750
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,960
Luckily, it's you.

751
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:44,519
Be careful not to catch a cold.

752
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,800
I feel warm inside.

753
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,440
You've caught a cold!

754
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:54,639
Whose fault is it?

755
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,719
You didn't call me when he's gone.

756
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,880
I fell asleep.

757
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,360
Wanqiu.

758
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:06,159
My Lady.

759
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:07,519
Ling'er has caught a cold.

760
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:08,599
Fetch her some medicine.

761
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:09,599
Yes.

762
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,400
I'm fine.

763
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,719
After finishing breakfast with you,

764
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:14,679
I'll go to the Fan mansion.

765
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:15,800
What for?

766
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,760
To challenge Fan Xian, of course!

767
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,480
Now that you've got someone
in your heart,

768
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,880
I certainly have to give him a good beat

769
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,679
so that he can cancel
the marriage contract himself.

770
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,960
He is Fan Xian.

771
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,480
Who?

772
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,440
He!

773
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:25,519
He...

774
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,440
Right!

775
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,199
Why did he pretend to be a doctor?

776
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:34,159
It's complicated.

777
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:37,679
He didn't know I am me.

778
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,440
He didn't know you are you?

779
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:44,960
It's really complicated.

780
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:46,679
Wait a moment!

781
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,679
What about his improper relationship

782
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:49,599
with Si Lili?

783
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:50,960
He said it's not true.

784
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,199
You really believe that?

785
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:54,960
Where are you going?

786
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,320
To find Si Lili.

787
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,519
Figure out

788
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,400
her relationship with Fan Xian for you.

789
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:20,880
Hold your hand, and age with you.

790
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,519
How come you're back?

791
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,440
Princess,

792
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,280
Her Highness wants to see you.

793
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:34,920
Her Highness...

794
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:39,440
Lady Ling'er.

795
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,719
This is the medicine

796
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,840
My Lady ordered for you just now.

797
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,039
Please drink it before you leave.

798
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,559
Take these medical packages, too.

799
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:46,800
Take the medicine for another two days.

800
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,159
You'll be cured completely.

801
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,159
All right. See you.

802
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:27,039
Mother!

803
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,079
Come on!

804
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:30,039
Take a seat.

805
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:33,719
Yes.

806
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:40,960
Allow me.

807
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,719
I heard you've seen a doctor.

808
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,360
Do you feel better?

809
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,440
His treating method

810
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:52,920
is somewhat special.

811
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:54,920
I must have a try.

812
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:58,559
It's always good to have a new method.

813
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:01,199
I ask you over

814
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:03,360
to tell you another piece of good news.

815
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,519
Good news?

816
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,519
Your marriage with Fan Xian

817
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:08,480
might be cancelled soon.

818
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:12,719
Isn't it an order from His Majesty?

819
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,199
After all, it's not in the written form.

820
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:15,679
There's still room for discussion.

821
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,400
Also, Chengze

822
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:18,519
also heard of it

823
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,039
somehow.

824
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:22,480
He's trying to
cancel the marriage for you.

825
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:24,119
Plus your unwillingness to marry him,

826
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:25,719
It's likely to be cancelled.

827
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,239
Actually...

828
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,920
Actually, there's no rush.

829
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,320
Last time, you said yourself that

830
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:42,400
the marriage must be canceled, right?

831
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,119
There are misunderstandings after all.

832
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,519
Misunderstandings?

833
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:52,519
If there were misunderstandings,

834
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:54,639
when did you address them?

835
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,320
You've met Fan Xian?

836
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,480
How did you meet?

837
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,760
Mother, you're thinking too much!

838
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,800
You have feelings for him?

839
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:21,519
How can that be!

840
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:23,960
You'd better not.

841
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,599
Do you still want to
cancel the marriage?

842
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,400
Just let it be for now.

843
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,199
Judged from your words,

844
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,039
you must like him.

845
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,239
As a mother, I will not

846
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,920
go against your wills.

847
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,320
How would I like him?

848
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:54,719
You can't be too tired.

849
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,639
We should discuss about it later.

850
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,840
Escort the princess back home.

851
00:48:09,239 --> 00:48:09,840
Yes.

852
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:02,119
Take a bite?

853
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,400
No!

854
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:07,760
Stop pulling a long face all day long.

855
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,559
Smile!

856
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,599
I don't make money by smiling.

857
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,159
I won't pay you even if you smile.

858
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:14,960
Fan.

859
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:17,840
Li.

860
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,360
-Li? -How are you?

861
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,880
Li.

862
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:22,559
It sounds close.

863
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,039
What's up?

864
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,400
The Second Prince would like to see you.

865
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:27,079
When?

866
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,039
How about tomorrow.

867
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:28,880
Where?

868
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:29,800
Where?

869
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:31,760
Miss Si Lili's

870
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,599
Joy Tsin House, of course.

871
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:47,480
Brother.

872
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:51,840
How about I go with you?

873
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,599
He invited me to a brothel boat.

874
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,760
It's improper for you to go.

875
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,559
I suppose the Second Prince
wants to draw you over to his side.

876
00:49:58,559 --> 00:49:59,079
I know.

877
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,760
What's your plan?

878
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,960
Getting involved
in their competition for the throne

879
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,880
might bring trouble to the family.

880
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,320
I'd better keep a distance.

881
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:08,000
Ruoruo,

882
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,079
what if I decide to go back to Danzhou?

883
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,480
Then I'll go with you.

884
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,119
Let me think about it.

885
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,280
Well, just go inside.

886
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,800
Brother, be careful!

887
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,079
Since the trial last time,

888
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,880
the Crown Prince hasn't made a move.

889
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:24,840
I'm really worried.

890
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,519
This is the capital city.

891
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,960
Can he really kill me on the streets?

892
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:40,119
Go inside.

893
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:43,000
To the Joy Tsin House!

894
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,360
I rarely see you smile.

895
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,480
Are you in a good mood today?

896
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,199
My son called me last night.

897
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,679
They must be really important to you.

898
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:07,719
If there's no one

899
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:08,719
you're willing to die for

900
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:10,000
in this world,

901
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:11,599
how boring it will be!

902
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:12,880
I understand.

903
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:15,039
Only with someone like that

904
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:15,800
If there's no one

905
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,760
take roots in this world.

906
00:51:18,679 --> 00:51:19,679
I just heard that

907
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,719
you want to go back to Danzhou?

908
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,360
Not until I marry Wan'er.

909
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:25,559
Will you

910
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:26,559
go with me?

911
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:27,760
We could be neighbors.

912
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:28,760
You are really leaving the capital city?

913
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,079
Before I came here,

914
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:34,800
I wanted to find out
the one who tried to kill me,

915
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,039
to explore the past of my mom,

916
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:39,039
and to figure out

917
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:40,000
the secrets of this world.

918
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,360
What now?

919
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:43,480
I realize that

920
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,400
I'm a lazy man after all.

921
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:46,239
I just want to live.

922
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,599
As long as my payment

923
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:49,360
doesn't change,

924
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,360
I can follow you anywhere.

925
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,599
Then you'd better do a good job!

926
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,719
I'm afraid I can't.

927
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:56,000
I owe this life

928
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,159
to my family.

929
00:51:57,679 --> 00:51:58,400
As to you,

930
00:51:58,639 --> 00:51:59,440
when there's some danger,

931
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,199
you should face it yourself.

932
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:02,480
I'll run away immediately.

933
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,360
You're really honest.

934
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,800
Fan Xian should be here soon.

935
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,199
Take it easy. I'm early.

936
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:45,719
I'll get another cup for you.

937
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:54,280
The cup cracked for no reason.

938
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,360
It's a bad omen.

939
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:01,639
This place looks familiar.

940
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,840
It's where you hit Guo Baokun.

941
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,840
Then it's a memorable place.

942
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:09,119
Niulan Street.

943
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,880
Luckily, I went to Danzhou.

944
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,760
Luckily, I met you.

945
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,679
Or I don't know

946
00:53:12,679 --> 00:53:13,360
when I could

947
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,159
see my wife and son,

948
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:15,559
let alone

949
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,199
getting rid of hatred.

950
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:18,800
Fan Xian.

951
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,000
Thank you.

952
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,360
I'll throw up
if you say the phrase again.

953
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,679
Why are you in such a hurry?

954
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,320
Cheng Jushu showed up on Niulan Street.

955
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:13,360
He's fighting someone.

956
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,920
Cheng Jushu from Beiqi?

957
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,440
He's an Eighth Dan Martial Arts Master.

958
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,440
Who can be a match for him?

959
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,400
Did you use poisoned daggers?

960
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:37,800
Yeah.

961
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:39,400
That would be great.

962
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:42,800
You leave now.

963
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,920
Didn't you use poisoned daggers?

964
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:48,320
He's nobody but Cheng Jushu.

965
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:50,719
An Eighth Dan Martial Arts Master.
He's invincible.

966
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,400
I'm afraid he won't be hurt.

967
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:55,199
Let's go together.

968
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,000
Go!

969
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,840
How?

970
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:35,480
He's still alive.

971
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:37,920
He's lucky.

972
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:39,480
If my vitality Qi bursts,

973
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:40,480
he'll definitely die.

974
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:51,119
If I die,

975
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,840
take good care of Ruoruo.

976
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:54,360
Tell Wan'er

977
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,880
phthisis is curable

978
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,119
and she can find someone better than me.

979
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,639
Go to

980
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,639
tell her the crap yourself.

981
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:50,840
Teng Zijing!

982
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,119
Teng Zijing!

983
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,000
Your Excellency.

984
01:00:56,679 --> 01:00:57,719
Your Excellency, wake up.

985
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,079
Your Excellency.

986
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Your Excellency. Don't move.

987
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,239
Don't move
until your wounds are inspected.

988
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,760
Our colleagues

989
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,000
will be here soon.

990
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:21,559
Wake him up.

991
01:01:23,719 --> 01:01:24,840
He'll never wake up.

992
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:28,360
Your Excellency.

993
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:31,199
Your Excellency.
