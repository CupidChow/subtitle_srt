16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,599
Why are you still sighing?

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,239
Am I really

18
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,079
that hateful?

19
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,000
You said all those to me

20
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,400
and wear such a facial expression now.

21
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,639
Aren't you afraid
that I will do something to you?

22
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,840
I'm used to your bullying already.

23
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,000
So you won't stop me

24
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,199
if I really want to do anything to you?

25
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,520
Don't you believe me given
what has happened before?

26
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:25,400
OK!

27
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,360
Let me take a look

28
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,479
at what is held in your left hand.

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,759
You've been holding it

30
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,960
ever since I stepped onto the carriage.

31
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,199
That's exceptional love to it.

32
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,879
Are Your Excellency laughing

33
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:47,000
at my ignorance?

34
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,919
I know you.

35
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,000
Of course,
Your Excellency know everything.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,280
deep in the dungeon for decades,

37
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,759
without day light and hope of survival,

38
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,280
every day you were full of worries

39
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,599
about what will happen tomorrow.

40
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,719
That's a most difficult time
to go through.

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,639
Despite that you're on the way

42
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,719
back to Beiqi now,

43
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,520
I am the one who is escorting you.

44
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,319
After all, you took part in

45
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,520
the Niulan Street assassination.

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,879
Of course, you'll worry
that I might retaliate you

47
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:11,840
or kill you on the way,

48
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:13,879
but what can you do

49
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,759
as a weak lady?

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,240
You can only ingratiate me

51
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,960
like just now.

52
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,360
You think it will give you

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,719
more chances of surviving,

54
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:20,199
right?

55
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,520
And you are afraid I may give full
play to my animal disposition,

56
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:25,719
so you hold it tightly

57
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:26,680
in your hand

58
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,599
because it is your only reliance

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
at this moment.

60
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,360
But both you and I understand that

61
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,039
you can't stab me with it.

62
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,039
You dare not to.

63
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,280
You are afraid to hurt me,

64
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,039
because once you do,

65
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,280
you'll have no chance of surviving.

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,840
Neither do you dare
to spur yourself with it

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,840
because you don't want to die.

68
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,960
Right? Am I right?

69
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,919
You can't stab me

70
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,719
or yourself with it.

71
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,680
In this case,

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,560
what's the point of keeping it?

73
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,560
Your life is grasped

74
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,480
in other's hands.

75
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,959
I know you feel very helpless.

76
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,360
I also know you feel grueling.

77
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,839
Miss Lili,

78
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,720
this is the fault of
the morals of the time.

79
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:41,720
The fight between two states

80
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,680
leaves a weak lady in such a hardship.

81
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,800
I truly understand you.

82
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,360
No one will hurt you on the way.

83
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,240
Just calm down.
I'm sending you back home.

84
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:12,120
Actually, my home is not in Beiqi.

85
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,120
My really name is Li Lisi.

86
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:18,639
Li?

87
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,160
I'm descendent of
the Nanqing imperial family.

88
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,319
In that year,
the Emperor Qing ascended the throne.

89
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,000
Naturally,
there were plenty of bloodbaths.

90
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,279
My tribe were almost wiped out.

91
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,000
So I fled to Beiqi with my family.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,040
I have a younger brother.

93
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,759
He is my only kinsfolk.

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,079
Everything I did

95
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,720
was to make sure he lives well.

96
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,759
Beiqi coerces you with your brother?

97
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,560
Forget that.

98
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,480
There is nothing to discuss about that.

99
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,759
Maybe I can help you.

100
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,360
Help me what?

101
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:01,639
Find your younger brother

102
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,839
and bring him back to Nanqing.

103
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,560
That's not necessary.

104
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,839
The result is the same.

105
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,439
You didn't give away my secret

106
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:12,879
when you were caught

107
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,639
last time.

108
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,360
I owe you one.

109
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,439
So this time,

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,120
you can ask me a question.

111
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,279
Whatever it is.

112
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,360
I'll answer it as an exception.

113
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,800
Whatever it is?

114
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,920
I heard you're getting engaged.

115
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:33,079
Yeah!

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,040
After I get back from Beiqi.

117
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,319
Have you met?

118
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,600
Yes!

119
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,199
Do you like each other?

120
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,120
Yes!

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,920
Is that you want to ask?

122
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,079
So wonderful!

123
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,519
I wish you a long and happy marriage.

124
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,360
Have you baked the meat?

125
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,560
Where is my meat?

126
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,079
Your Excellency,

127
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:21,480
we have it prepared a long time back.

128
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,240
Grand General,

129
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,959
we got message from Nanqing.

130
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,199
The Nanqing mission

131
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,279
is sending Mr. Xiao En back.

132
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,360
Let's meet them
in the territory of Nanqing

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,240
and take over him first.

134
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,079
How do we deal with
the escorting mission?

135
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,120
Who is the leader?

136
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,759
Fan Xian, the poetic genius of Nanqing.

137
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,639
I haven't heard of him.

138
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,199
Kill him when they come.

139
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:11,160
Yes.

140
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,799
We're close to the border.

141
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,679
I've been doubtful over one thing

142
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,000
and I want to ask you about that.

143
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,240
Go ahead.

144
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,759
Why were you not killed at the time?

145
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,960
I know a lot of important things.

146
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,240
Interrogated for information.
I got that.

147
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,600
Then why

148
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,960
didn't they cut your hands and feet?

149
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,440
There should be a bottom line

150
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,120
for everything.

151
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,679
If it goes beyond the line
that I can tolerate,

152
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,759
I'll suicide.

153
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,679
Before they get

154
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,559
the information they want,

155
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,320
Chen Pingping doesn't want me to die.

156
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,519
That still doesn't make sense.

157
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,600
What?

158
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Your bottom line

159
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,480
perhaps should not be crossed
at that time.

160
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,519
But since they are sending you
back to Beiqi now,

161
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,399
why didn't they cut your hands and feet

162
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,919
when you left the capital city?

163
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,039
You still have some chance
to survive now,

164
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,879
so you won't commit suicide.

165
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,799
Cutting your hands and feet now

166
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,360
will make you less threatening
on the way.

167
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,559
That's reasonably

168
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,360
the best for both worlds.

169
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,080
Chen Pingping knows it

170
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,480
better than me.

171
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,039
Why did he become merciful to you

172
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,039
all of a sudden?

173
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,399
That's also the point
I don't understand.

174
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,679
Beiqi wants the live Xiao En.

175
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,600
You might as well
abrogate his martial arts

176
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,799
rather than giving such a big source

177
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:10,600
of disaster to Fan Xian.

178
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,080
You don't need
to worry about Fan Xian's safety.

179
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,840
I know

180
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:16,919
your black knights have been

181
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:18,080
protecting Fan Xian during the way.

182
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,720
However,

183
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,480
Xiao En is not an easy person.

184
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,000
How can I not worry about it?

185
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,399
Put out the lamp!

186
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,639
I don't care!

187
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,080
Maybe they want me

188
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,000
to deal with you.

189
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,080
They want to take advantage of me

190
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,759
to kill you as a promising young man.

191
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,679
You don't need to instigate like this,

192
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,480
Senior Xiao,

193
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,960
Don't trust Chen Pingping too much.

194
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:00,720
You'll regret it

195
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,840
sooner or later.

196
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,399
As you ordered,

197
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,000
all the black knights have withdrawn.

198
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:27,679
Nobody is protecting Fan Xian

199
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,000
as of now.

200
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,080
We got information the other day that

201
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,960
Shangshan Hu traveled south

202
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,799
with his personal guards

203
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,480
and disappeared in the end.

204
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,919
He must have gone to save Xiao En.

205
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,399
Yes!

206
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,600
Then he will run into Fan Xian for sure.

207
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,120
Withdrawing the black knights now

208
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:47,399
will leave Fan Xian high and dry

209
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,440
against the Beiqi War God.

210
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,279
Don't you take him as your nephew?

211
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,120
You're jeopardizing his life

212
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,360
by doing so.

213
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,240
Don't let Fei Jie know

214
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,679
about Shangshan Hu.

215
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,840
What are you going to do to Fan Xian?

216
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,440
He's smart.

217
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,360
It took me a lot of time

218
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,480
and arrangements

219
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,399
to win his trust.

220
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:14,000
This day is finally about to come.

221
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,600
Wang,

222
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,759
His Excellency Fan wants to meet you.

223
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,039
Your Excellency.

224
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:14,919
My dad said

225
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,159
you are trustworthy.

226
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,720
I need your help with one thing.

227
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,279
At your service, Your Excellency!

228
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,080
I need to take Xiao En away.

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,679
What's that for?

230
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,600
The Lady Ye used to travel with Xiao En.

231
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,200
My mom?

232
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,799
She also told me that

233
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,639
she came to this world

234
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,080
because of Xiao En.

235
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,720
I need to ask him for something.

236
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,519
And you're critically important for it.

237
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,080
He is saved by people from Beiqi.

238
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,159
Beiqi is in the wrong.

239
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,320
They won't prevent us from

240
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,200
After taking Yan Bingyun back,

241
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,440
Beiqi?

242
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,159
Shangshan Hu is Xiao En's adoptive son.

243
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,480
You know him, right?

244
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,720
Your Excellency,
are you in contact with him?

245
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,879
I only want to borrow his name.

246
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,639
Grand General sent me to save you.

247
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,600
You're a follower of Hu'er?

248
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,399
Exactly.

249
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,000
As long as Nanqing stays unharmed,

250
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,720
I will take any order.

251
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,519
Good.

252
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:26,960
Later I'll fight Xiao En

253
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,799
with all my strength.

254
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,440
The border is right ahead.
We don't have much time.

255
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,679
Let's do it.

256
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,480
Let's get into the woods

257
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,360
and go north.

258
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:41,919
Leave now!

259
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,480
Grand General is waiting for you ahead.

260
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,639
Xiao En was taken away

261
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,200
by men of Shangshan Hu.

262
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:01,480
Split up and chase him down.

263
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,519
Yes!

264
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:02,960
Hurry up!

265
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,759
It's done.

266
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:16,320
Did anything go wrong?

267
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,840
Your Excellency, you showed up in time.

268
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:18,960
Xiao En didn't have time to ask.

269
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,600
By calling "Grand General",

270
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,759
everyone thinks

271
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,720
Shangshan Hu's men did it.

272
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:23,919
It's time for us

273
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,799
to chase him.

274
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,120
Can we catch up with him?

275
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,639
Don't worry. Someone is following him.

276
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,399
Who is it?

277
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,080
Mr. Xiao, you're really vigilant.

278
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,799
Your lightness skill is good.

279
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,159
I'm flattered.

280
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,879
I grow a bit fat recently.

281
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,279
I'm not so flexible.

282
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,039
You set up the iron chains, right?

283
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:39,120
You're welcome.

284
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,000
You've been leaving marks.

285
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,440
You just keep running.
I'll keep doing my job.

286
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,399
Let's stay focused on our own things.

287
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:05,839
Your Excellency, are you OK?

288
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:09,799
Your Excellency.

289
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,759
Senior, you're old.

290
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,759
Can he run that way?

291
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:42,559
Your Excellency, he's not here.

292
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,680
Young Master, which one shall we kill?

293
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,240
He's not here.

294
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:47,960
Then let's go back.

295
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,640
Nonsense!

296
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,200
Find him! He must be nearby.

297
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,000
So no one came to save me.

298
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,400
My men pretended to be

299
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:04,680
Shangshan Hu's men.

300
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,640
Do you lure me out of the mission

301
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,599
to kill me?

302
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,519
I have a question for you.

303
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,480
Go ahead.

304
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,599
Do you know Danzhou?

305
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,000
I grew up in Danzhou as a child.

306
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,000
I see.

307
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,200
Why do you ask me that?

308
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,400
Never mind.

309
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,680
You can kill me now.

310
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:08,960
Take her!

311
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,039
Your dagger.

312
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,960
If you take another step forward,

313
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,000
I'll kill him.

314
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,920
Go ahead.

315
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,680
You're not here to save him.

316
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:53,720
No!

317
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,039
Kill him if you want. I'm just watching.

318
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:02,559
What's your relationship with Ku He?

319
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,839
So you figured out.

320
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,720
You're Saintess Haitang,

321
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,200
the last apprentice of Ku He.

322
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,200
Haitang Duoduo!

323
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,559
You can call me Haitang,

324
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,559
or Duoduo.

325
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,160
Fan Xian,

326
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,119
I know you,
the poetic genius from Nanqing.

327
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,720
Insidious and ruthless
at such a young age,

328
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,519
you're not a good man.

329
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,200
Are you also here to kill him?

330
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,839
You can kill him.
I'll just stand by and watch.

331
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,440
Fine. Give me the dagger.

332
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,799
Keep an eye on him.

333
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,200
Let's fight.

334
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,519
Are you nuts?

335
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:10,240
I just told you

336
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,359
I'm not here to save him.

337
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,559
We can talk after the fight.

338
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,119
You must be insane!

339
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:30,920
Shameless!

340
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,799
If you don't believe me,

341
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:49,559
you can slash him first.

342
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,680
That makes sense.

343
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:54,119
Well,

344
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,759
This is for you.

345
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,400
Stop! Stop!

346
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,480
Awesome!

347
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,160
You're really above the Ninth Dan!

348
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,359
Excellent! Excellent!

349
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,960
You're not bad

350
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,000
among the younger generation.

351
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,960
You're so insidious.

352
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,000
I didn't mean to.

353
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,079
Besides,

354
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:55,519
fighting should be simple.

355
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,960
No need to include so many tricks.

356
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,319
Why did you pick a fight with me?

357
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,079
Someone once told me

358
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:02,680
if I want to

359
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,880
improve my martial arts skills,

360
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,200
I have to fight someone peerless.

361
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,519
You're really good.

362
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,400
It would be a pity not to fight you.

363
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,400
That's all?

364
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:10,039
What else?

365
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,680
Now that we're done fighting,

366
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:16,039
you should kill him.

367
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,119
Duoduo,

368
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,680
why do you want to kill him?

369
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,880
My teacher wants to kill him.

370
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,160
Why does Ku He want to kill him?

371
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,880
I don't want to tell you.

372
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,559
Look, we're...

373
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,559
Will you kill him or not?

374
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,039
If you don't, then I will.

375
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,759
He doesn't want to kill me.

376
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,160
If he does,

377
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,359
he would have killed me already.

378
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,359
Senior, you're right.

379
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:02,680
I've tried so hard

380
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,920
to keep you under my control.

381
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,839
How can I just kill you?

382
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,640
If you really don't want to kill him,

383
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,160
then I'll kill him instead.

384
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,559
Yan Xiaoyi. Director Yan.

385
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,039
Fan Xian.

386
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,799
I'll make you pay today
for humiliating me in the capital city.

387
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,640
He was trying to shoot me.

388
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,039
Why did you stop the arrow?

389
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,000
I stopped it subconsciously.

390
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,680
Only after stopping it did I realize
that it was coming at you.

391
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,279
That's the Ninth Dan archer of Nanqing.

392
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,160
He's unparalleled in the world.

393
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,200
How is that relevant to me?

394
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,119
Of course it is.

395
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,559
Let me introduce.

396
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,960
This is Haitang Duoduo, Beiqi Saintess.

397
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,079
Director Yan,

398
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,160
by killing the Saintess,
you'll make a name

399
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,400
among the frontier soldiers.

400
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,200
Whatever you say, you'll die today.

401
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:05,400
You should be careful.

402
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,119
I'm afraid
Director Yan wants to kill you.

403
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,880
Shameless!

404
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,240
Right, he's shameless!

405
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,920
Later, we should get out together

406
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,039
and look after each other.

407
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,519
War horses?

408
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,400
Yan Xiaoyi has brought the cavalry.

409
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,799
Miss Duoduo,

410
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,839
we can cooperate with each other...

411
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:40,440
Where is he?

412
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:41,960
She was here just now.

413
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,359
Your Excellency, the horses are coming.

414
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,759
They are wearing Beiqi uniforms.

415
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:58,839
What a coincidence!

416
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,920
I just borrowed Shangshan Hu's name,

417
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
and here he comes!

418
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,640
It's Beiqi army.

419
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,559
Beiqi army?

420
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,519
Why are they here?

421
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:20,559
The border is not far ahead.

422
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,079
They must have crossed
the border secretly.

423
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,880
Father, long time no see.

424
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:31,839
Grand General,
if you take another step forward,

425
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,680
you'll only get his dead body.

426
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,119
Is he also here to kill you?

427
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,079
Be careful.

428
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,640
Are those wounds on my father

429
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,200
in the capital recently?

430
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,880
Another Ninth Dan martial arts master!

431
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,119
I heard you're a poetic genius.

432
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,680
Let me give you a poem for free,

433
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,680
and you should let me go unharmed.

434
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:35,119
You can keep it as your last will.

435
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,400
The moment I heard of your name,

436
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,519
I couldn't help wondering

437
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,119
whether you're surnamed Shang

438
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,359
or Shangshan.

439
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,000
Man's body rots
to nourish all things on earth.

440
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,519
Death is only a start.

441
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,200
That is Fan Xian,

442
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,279
the man I want to kill.

443
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,680
The other is Shangshan Hu,

444
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,160
the Grand General of Beiqi.

445
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,839
Grand General,

446
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,160
If I kill him, will it be counted
as a military exploit?

447
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,720
It is equivalent to attacking cities
and capturing territories.

448
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,079
If I order you to kill him,

449
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:09,799
will you be scared?

450
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,400
Wait! Come back!

451
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,160
You're really courageous!

452
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,440
Young Master, let's do it!

453
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,599
Let's wait till Fan Xian is killed.

454
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,039
If I knew,

455
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,440
I wouldn't have engaged myself
in the two fights just now.

456
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,240
Wait!

457
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,440
Do you know Danzhou?

458
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,799
I grew up in Danzhou as a child.

459
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:29,599
Father,
would you like to kill him in person?

460
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,559
Don't kill him now.

461
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,680
Why don't they kill him?

462
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,240
Maybe they want to hold him hostage.

463
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,200
He's so lucky!

464
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,000
Are we going back to Beiqi?

465
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,160
Yes.

466
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,480
After all we're
within the territory of Nanqing.

467
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,920
We'd better go back as soon as possible.

468
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,400
Take him with us.

469
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:06,839
Shall we attack?

470
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,880
Fine! Fine! Fine!

471
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:09,640
You're really fearless.

472
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,039
You're just a group of peasants.

473
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,119
What do you want?

474
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,160
Are you going
to confront the Beiqi cavalry

475
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,759
face to face?

476
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,720
Follow them quietly.

477
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,160
We should find a chance to attack.

478
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,400
How long have you been in Danzhou?

479
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,440
Since I was a child.

480
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,119
When did you go back to
the capital city?

481
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,039
Not long before.

482
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,799
It's really fast for you
to be promoted as Director-General

483
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:42,920
of the Investigator's Office
in a short time?

484
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,039
My official career is quite successful.

485
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,640
You're quick at answering questions.

486
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:49,799
I was caught.

487
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,200
I should be cooperative.

488
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:54,880
Father!

489
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,480
should we also bring the others?

490
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,359
No need.

491
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,960
I only need him.

492
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,400
Shall we kill them all?

493
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,400
How dare you?

494
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,400
Kill them all!

495
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:10,240
Really?

496
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,759
Shangshan Hu.

497
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,519
take it easy.

498
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,359
I won't prevent you from saving Xiao En.

499
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:32,400
I only want him dead.

500
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,119
I can take one more step back.

501
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,519
You can kill him if you want.

502
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
After Fan Xian is killed,

503
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:41,400
I'll leave right away.

504
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,559
As I said,

505
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
I have to take him back.

506
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:46,599
You heard him.

507
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,519
Then you all have to

508
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:51,839
die here.

509
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,359
Kill them all!

510
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,799
If he doesn't shoot,

511
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:10,320
Shangshan Hu dares not make a move.

512
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,000
Isn't this a good opportunity?

513
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,519
Father, go north.

514
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:27,159
Kill the Beiqi bastards!

515
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,320
Kill the Beiqi bastards!

516
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,320
Oh, my God!

517
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,920
It's actually real!

518
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,119
All of us are veterans

519
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,360
retired from the frontiers.

520
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,079
We're most adept

521
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,280
in murdering and robbing

522
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,239
without any mistakes.

523
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:00,079
Kill Shangshan Hu!

524
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,039
How dare you be distracted
when pointed by my arrow?

525
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,239
Fan Xian!

526
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:33,679
Young Master Guo!

527
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,519
Thank you, Young Master Guo!

528
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,000
Screw you!

529
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,039
This is my dagger.

530
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:47,280
You actually bring it to me specially!

531
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,199
You villain!

532
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:59,039
Fan Xian, I'm gonna kill you.

533
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:00,840
I know! I know!

534
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,000
You're all here to kill me.

535
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,639
Just wait a moment.

536
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,079
Director Yan!

537
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:11,360
Director Yan,

538
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:13,280
I'm Guo Baokun, the Imperial Compiler.

539
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:14,840
I'm also here to kill Fan Xian.

540
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:16,559
They're veterans from Nanqing.

541
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,719
They are not enemies.

542
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,280
Young Master Guo it is!

543
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,159
Director Yan, what're you doing?

544
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:48,719
It doesn't make sense.

545
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,599
Yan Xiaoyi must have left the camp
without permission.

546
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,679
Why would he leave anyone alive

547
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,599
to put himself at risk?

548
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,079
Keep an eye on them!

549
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:55,639
Yes.

550
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,599
If you don't stop him,

551
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,039
we'll all be killed

552
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,119
by Yan Xiaoyi.

553
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:07,280
The Beiqi War God

554
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,639
will die today.

555
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:11,000
Yan Xiaoyi is the only Ninth Dan archer

556
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,840
in the world.

557
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,639
If you don't kill him now,

558
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,760
countless Beiqi soldiers
will be shot dead

559
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,400
on the battlefield in future.

560
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,519
Who can stop me?

561
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:20,400
It's for the righteous
cause of your country,

562
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,679
you can't be intimidated!

563
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,719
My clothes are stained.

564
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,559
Haitang Duoduo!

565
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,239
Nice move.

566
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,880
How do you know I'm here?

567
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:54,760
I don't.

568
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,840
I just cried out for a try.
And I guessed right.

569
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,239
Your Excellency,

570
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:01,960
I see

571
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,239
guards of the mission coming.

572
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,239
Let's go.

573
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,599
You can't have him.

574
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:17,280
Miss Duoduo, why are you still here?

575
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,320
I'll leave after I kill Xiao En.

576
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,679
So many people are killed today.

577
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,119
All of them combined

578
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,559
won't be able to stop me.

579
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,119
They won't try to stop you.

580
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,400
The fight is between us.

581
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,559
You're no match for me.

582
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,880
Courage and uprightness are the most
important in fights between warriors.

583
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,079
Even if I'm no match for you,

584
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,679
I'll fight you fairly and openly.

585
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,599
Well said.

586
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,920
I didn't expect you

587
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,679
to be a brave and strong man.

588
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:45,400
I underestimated you.

589
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,719
You lost. Thank you for letting me win.

590
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,800
Didn't you just say

591
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,480
you would fight me fairly and openly?

592
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,320
I'm a student of Fei Jie.

593
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,119
It's known to everyone that

594
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,400
we fight with

595
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,239
poisons.

596
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,280
Didn't Fei Jie tell you that

597
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,119
poisons are useless to

598
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,199
martial arts masters
above the Ninth Dan?

599
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:20,360
Do you feel hot and flushed

600
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,079
with a racing heart?

601
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,639
Poisons are useless,

602
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:26,800
but it's not a poison.

603
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:29,199
What is it?

604
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,480
Aphrodisiac?

605
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:31,719
You...

606
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,559
Stop fighting with me!

607
00:39:45,239 --> 00:39:46,719
I never take advantage of others.

608
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,880
Just leave!

609
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,920
I do find it hard

610
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,880
to suppress the heat.

611
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:47,800
It's really an aphrodisiac.

612
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:01,079
Hide Xiao En first.

613
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,039
It's too late.

614
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:04,760
Senior Xiao,

615
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,440
please tell them that

616
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,480
I was the one who caught you.

617
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,199
Now I'm the only one

618
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:08,880
who wants to save your life.

619
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:09,880
What about him?

620
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:10,719
Take him along.

621
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:25,440
Beiqi tried to rescue Xiao En,

622
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,199
But His Excellency Fan took the lead

623
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:30,199
and brought Xiao En back.

624
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,920
So, please be relieved.

625
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,039
Don't worry.

626
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,079
Let's take a short break

627
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:37,519
and set off right away.

628
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,719
-OK! -OK!

629
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,559
It's really not easy
for His Excellency Fan.

630
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:42,000
He chased Xiao En all the way!

631
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
Senior, please get on the carriage.

632
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:51,280
Kill the members of the mission,

633
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,599
and I'll tell you anything

634
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:54,519
you want to know.

635
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:56,400
I do want to catch you,

636
00:41:57,239 --> 00:41:58,679
but I don't want to betray my country.

637
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,840
Senior Xiao,

638
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,000
chance is easily missed.

639
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:03,559
Just behave yourself and
get on the carriage.

640
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,119
There's still a chance.

641
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,519
I've been curious.

642
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,239
I didn't kill you

643
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,599
because of your

644
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,639
hidden secret.

645
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,480
But why didn't you kill me?

646
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:19,800
What's so special in Danzhou

647
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:21,840
to keep a ruthless man like you

648
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:23,039
from killing me?

649
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:26,360
The black knights didn't show up

650
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:28,400
throughout the whole process.

651
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,719
If Chen Pingping really cares about you,

652
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,360
how can he forget about this?

653
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:38,559
You should be careful.

654
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,840
We're about to arrive in Beiqi,

655
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,079
but Shangshan Hu still led his men

656
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,000
to attack the mission.

657
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,679
It's obvious that some people

658
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,000
from the imperial court of Beiqi
want to take your life.

659
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,519
You should also be careful.

660
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,519
Find more allies.

661
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,639
Don't rely solely on

662
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,320
Chen Pingping.

663
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,480
Your Excellency, do feel relieved.

664
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,800
I've handled everything.

665
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,719
Have you noticed any trace o

666
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:25,480
fhe black knights around?

667
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,320
No.

668
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,559
Where's Guo Baokun?

669
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:32,360
He's over there.

670
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:33,920
He just sits still

671
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:34,960
after reaching the campsite.

672
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,480
The black knights are not here.

673
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,079
Head must have

674
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,800
forgotten about it.

675
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,400
Your men are

676
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,400
all buried.

677
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:00,800
Bold with good martial arts skills,

678
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:02,039
they must have joined the army.

679
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,519
I gathered them

680
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:04,440
to kill you.

681
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:06,400
Why do you want to kill me?

682
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,119
For my dad.

683
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:09,239
Your dad is dead?

684
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,280
Nonsense!

685
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:11,239
Since he's not dead,

686
00:44:11,239 --> 00:44:11,920
why do you hate me?

687
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,400
My dad was sent to jail because of you.

688
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,079
Then why did you

689
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,000
attack Shangshan Hu?

690
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,039
I want to kill you both!

691
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:17,239
Why do you want to kill Shangshan Hu?

692
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:17,840
By killing him,

693
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,519
I can use my military exploit
to get my dad out of jail.

694
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:20,400
Now that Shangshan Hu is still alive,

695
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,119
how can you get your dad out?

696
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,639
I...

697
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,320
I'll offer you two choices.

698
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,159
One is to kill me right now.

699
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,320
I'll take this one.

700
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,400
The other is
to let me get your dad out of jail.

701
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,719
We don't bear deep hatred
against each other.

702
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:44,480
Nonsense!

703
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:45,880
You beat me.

704
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,800
You don't hate me for sure.

705
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,639
I was caught by Shangshan Hu today.

706
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,599
Anyhow,

707
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:51,079
thanks to you, I escaped.

708
00:44:51,719 --> 00:44:53,199
I kind of owe you.

709
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,480
How about this?

710
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,079
I'll make you a deal.

711
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,639
When we go back
to the capital city with Yan Bingyun,

712
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,280
I'll personally beg His Majesty

713
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,119
to release your dad.

714
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,400
Why would His Majesty listen to you?

715
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,320
He won't

716
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,079
if the Princess Royal is still
in the capital city.

717
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:05,280
But now Li Yunrui

718
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,360
has been kicked out of the capital city,

719
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:07,559
your father's sin of forming a clique

720
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:08,559
matters nothing.

721
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:09,760
What tricks

722
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,719
are you playing this time?

723
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:11,880
I have conditions.

724
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,480
Will you help me

725
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:16,519
you should personally

726
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:18,039
accuse Yan Xiaoyi of
colluding with Beiqi

727
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:18,880
to assassinate the mission members.

728
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:23,960
Stop hesitating!

729
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,360
Even if you don't testify against him,

730
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,960
Yan Xiaoyi will also try to kill you.

731
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,079
What else do you want?

732
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,880
After your dad is released,

733
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,519
your family should ally with me

734
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,559
and share connections with me.

735
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,800
Nobody cared
when my dad was put in jail.

736
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,199
We have no connections.

737
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,519
It's natural that no one cares about
you when you're down and out.

738
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:48,119
Once your father is released,

739
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,599
your former friends and relatives

740
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,280
will swarm to visit you.

741
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,400
It's a cold world after all.

742
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:58,280
You have the support of Chen Pingping
from the Investigator's Office.

743
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:01,280
Why do you need our support?

744
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,760
Just tell me yes or no.

745
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,239
Except me,

746
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,880
but me?

747
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,320
We're about to leave.

748
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:50,079
Aren't you going back to your carriage?

749
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,679
Aphrodisiac?

750
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,320
How do you know that?

751
00:46:58,039 --> 00:46:59,639
Taking an aphrodisiac along with you,

752
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,440
you're really no gentleman.

753
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:05,119
Your Excellency,

754
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,920
I'm the only girl in the mission.

755
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,400
By bringing the aphrodisiac along,

756
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:12,280
whom do you plan to use it on?

757
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:14,239
Well...

758
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:15,559
it's not what you think.

759
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:23,760
Your Excellency.

760
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,360
Yan Xiaoyi.

761
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,639
Help!

762
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:43,840
You're awake.

763
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:46,280
Luckily,
your internal organs are unharmed.

764
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:48,400
It was Yan Xiaoyi.

765
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,920
I was too careless.

766
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,599
I thought it was all settled.

767
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:53,800
I didn't expect him to return.

768
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,039
It's really hard to guard against the
assassination of a Ninth Dan archer.

769
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,559
He's also injured,

770
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,480
so your wound is not deep.

771
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,519
He won't come back in a short time.

772
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:00,280
You'll be fine.

773
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:03,039
Your Excellency.

774
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,360
What do you need?

775
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:08,360
Who took off

776
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:10,760
my clothes?

777
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:19,119
Well...

778
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:19,960
I'm the only one in the mission

779
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,039
who's proficient in medicine.

780
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,679
Your wounds had to be taken care of.

781
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:27,239
All of my clothes?

782
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,239
I had to bind up your wounds.

783
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,039
It's an act out of emergency.

784
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:36,440
You bring medicine along.

785
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:38,000
That is not an aphrodisiac.

786
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,079
Whatever you say.

787
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:40,679
It's really not.

788
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:41,960
What is it?

789
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,519
Your Excellency.

790
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,480
What's up?

791
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:48,519
Just get off and see yourself.

792
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,840
Your Excellency, shall we fight?

793
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,559
We stand no chance.

794
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,280
We can use a strong crossbow.

795
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,840
Don't follow me.

796
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:16,760
Your Excellency.

797
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:25,320
You've dried your clothes
with internal force.

798
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,159
Did you jump into a river?

799
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:29,079
Come with me. Alone.

800
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:30,000
This way.

801
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:39,480
That woman
is really good at martial arts.

802
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,559
Never mind.

803
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:44,559
His Excellency asked us

804
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:45,440
to wait here.

805
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,440
Wang,

806
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:48,280
I'm just worried.

807
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:49,280
No need.

808
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:50,639
Gorgeous as he is,

809
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,119
I actually feel that

810
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:53,960
the Beiqi Saintess

811
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,159
has fallen for him.

812
00:49:56,239 --> 00:49:57,519
She is going to confess her love

813
00:49:57,519 --> 00:49:58,920
in private.

814
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,519
His Excellency drugged her,

815
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,159
yet she falls for him?

816
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,559
The drug is the key.

817
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:07,239
His Excellency is a student of Fei Jie.

818
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,719
That aphrodisiac must be exceptional.

819
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:12,039
The Saintess must have really

820
00:50:13,239 --> 00:50:14,880
fallen in love with him.

821
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,880
How can there be such drugs?

822
00:50:19,039 --> 00:50:20,840
His Excellency has many specialties.

823
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:22,960
Just follow me.

824
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,039
I'll answer your questions.

825
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,360
OK.

826
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:43,119
Give me the antidote.

827
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:44,280
Listen to me.

828
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,320
I'll kill you if you say another word.

829
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,599
It's not an aphrodisiac.

830
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,679
I'm telling the truth.

831
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:49,880
Just think about it.

832
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,159
I was after Xiao En.

833
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,000
In that case,

834
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,039
why did I bring an aphrodisiac?

835
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:57,880
Then what is it?

836
00:50:59,119 --> 00:50:59,639
Why...

837
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:00,960
Why did it make you hot and flushed

838
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,679
with a racing heart?

839
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,239
Actually, I made the drug myself

840
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:04,800
to boost metabolism

841
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,519
and increase energy.

842
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,840
What is metabolism?

843
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,840
Let me put it this way.

844
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,880
If you take this drug
after getting injured,

845
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,840
it can unleash your potential

846
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:17,840
so as
to maintain your military strength.

847
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:19,079
It's not a poison.

848
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:20,280
Instead, it's good for health.

849
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,079
Your heart raced

850
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:22,920
because of the drug.

851
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,280
You may feel hot,

852
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,760
but your reaction ability
can be greatly improved.

853
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,760
Did you feel that?

854
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,159
You lied to me previously.

855
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:31,960
If I didn't say that,

856
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,239
you would kill me right away.

857
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,000
Weren't you afraid
that I might see through your lie?

858
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,800
I suppose you had no experience.

859
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:40,440
Why do you tell me

860
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,360
the truth now?

861
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:43,679
I'm a gentleman.

862
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:44,800
How can I lie to you?

863
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:45,920
Bullshit!

864
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,199
If I don't tell you the truth,

865
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,679
you might kill me just now.

866
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,360
I can still kill you now.

867
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,480
You won't.

868
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:01,239
Then just go to hell.

869
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,639
You won't kill me.

870
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:06,719
Why are you so sure?

871
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,519
Everyone saw you take me away from

872
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:09,880
the official road just now.

873
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:11,280
How will you save Master Xiao En

874
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:14,119
Nanqing will definitely launch a war
against Beiqi.

875
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,239
You're the Saintess of Beiqi.

876
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,159
Would you like to

877
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:18,159
see your people suffer?

878
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,760
I can kill you first.

879
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,320
Then I'll kill everyone in your mission.

880
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,159
You're not bloodthirsty.

881
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:25,880
How could you know?

882
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:28,760
If you are,

883
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,760
you wouldn't let me

884
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,480
kill Xiao En.

885
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,039
You would definitely kill him yourself.

886
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:34,199
I have another question.

887
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,320
you wouldn't bother

888
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,320
asking me for the antidote.

889
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:41,079
Would you like a bite?

890
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:43,159
You're really a piece of work!

891
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:55,320
Wang,

892
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,119
why does it take so long?

893
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,360
It makes sense
that they're not back yet.

894
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,000
What do you mean?

895
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:09,519
Amiable as His Excellency is,

896
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,079
they might be eating fruits together.

897
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Are you really the Saintess?

898
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,159
Doesn't the Saintess wipe her hands?

899
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,559
What a temper!

900
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,480
Tell me.

901
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,119
How on earth

902
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:35,320
can you help me kill Xiao En?

903
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,960
I really can't help you do that.

904
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,800
The mission and the cavalry
are both around.

905
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,800
If I let you kill Xiao En,

906
00:53:41,079 --> 00:53:42,440
I'm sure to lose my job.

907
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,960
You can come to Beiqi instead.

908
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,239
It's too cold.
I'm not used to the weather.

909
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,119
I can assassinate him at the worst.

910
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,599
I'll guard him myself.

911
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,079
Plus the cavalry,

912
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,800
feel free to have a try.

913
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,239
I can hold you hostage.

914
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:00,000
I'm just a little envoy.

915
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,679
Nobody cares about my life.

916
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:06,440
We can join hands.

917
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,679
Why?

918
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,199
To help you of course.

919
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,360
Help me what?

920
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,920
To help you and the Empress Dowager

921
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,159
take over power from

922
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:14,760
your little emperor.

923
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,239
Nonsense!

924
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:17,800
Who told you
I'm with the Empress Dowager.

925
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:21,920
Your teacher Ku He
is the Imperial Tutor.

926
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:24,000
He certainly has to take side.

927
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,159
As to the political fights of Beiqi,

928
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:27,440
there are mainly three forces.

929
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:31,199
One is led by the little emperor.

930
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,039
One is led by the Empress Dowager.

931
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,559
And the other is led by Shangshan Hu,

932
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,679
which remains neutral.

933
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:38,119
what will Shen Zhong do

934
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:39,039
while you want to kill him.

935
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,599
You're certainly not on the same side.

936
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:42,400
I could also be
a follower of His Majesty.

937
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:45,199
The little emperor made it clear that

938
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,320
he wants Si Lili back.

939
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:48,400
If you kill Xiao En in Nanqing,

940
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:49,960
the mission will have to go back.

941
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:51,800
Then Si Lili won't be sent to Beiqi.

942
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,880
So you can't be a follower of

943
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:55,880
the little emperor.

944
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:57,519
In this case,

945
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:00,199
you can only be with
the Empress Dowager.

946
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,599
Even if you guessed right,

947
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,679
how can you help me?

948
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:12,000
I'm the envoy of Nanqing after all.

949
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,000
The two of us joining hands together

950
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,000
is beyond all expectations.

951
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,519
By doing so,
we'll have everything to gain

952
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,280
and nothing to lose.

953
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,639
You actually know you're from Nanqing.

954
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:24,960
Yet you want to interfere with
political affairs of Beiqi.

955
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:29,480
I just have a feeling that

956
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,320
it'll be extremely difficult

957
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,199
for me to bring Yan Bingyun back.

958
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,400
We're kind of helping each other out.

959
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:41,880
You've eaten my fruit after all.

960
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:50,760
Last night the rain was light,
the wind was fierce,

961
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,840
and deep sleep
did not dispel the effects of wine.

962
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,599
When I ask the maid
rolling up the curtains,

963
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,280
she answers,
"The crabapple blossoms look the same."

964
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,440
I cry, "Can't you see? Can't you see?

965
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:00,239
The green leaves are fresh
but the red flowers are fading!"

966
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,079
It's for you.

967
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:06,760
It's kind of
celebrating our cooperation.

968
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,480
Poetic Genius Fan.

969
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,000
What do you think?

970
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:12,159
The crabapple blossoms
can't be exposed to the rain.

971
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,199
Caught in wind and rain,
the pot will gather water.

972
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:15,840
The crabapple blossoms will rot

973
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,000
instead of fading.

974
00:56:19,239 --> 00:56:20,280
I'll take that as a "Yes".

975
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,639
Shen Zhong, Commander-in-chief
of Embroidered Uniform Guards.

976
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,320
will receive the mission in person.

977
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:31,599
Watch out yourself!

978
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:33,159
What's his character?

979
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:34,800
Does he have any weakness?

980
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:36,280
Before reaching Shangjing,

981
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,159
I won't give up on killing Xiao En.

982
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,519
Let's go.

983
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,320
Your Excellency, congratulations!

984
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:55,320
For what?

985
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:57,440
Do you have a thing

986
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,880
for the Saintess?

987
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,480
Your Excellency, do feel relieved.

988
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,320
We won't tell Princess Lin

989
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,079
about this.

990
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,559
Gao, how come you're also

991
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:12,400
making fun of me?

992
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,639
Thanks for Wang's detailed explanation,

993
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:17,239
I've known Your Excellency well.

994
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:23,719
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

995
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,599
Your Excellency!

996
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:21,119
Where is he?

997
00:58:21,719 --> 00:58:24,320
Your Excellency, it's weird.

998
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:25,960
There are people receiving us,

999
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,679
but no one answers back.

1000
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:33,800
I'll say it one more time.

1001
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,039
The Nanqing mission is here
to return prisoners of war.

1002
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:40,320
Who's in charge?

1003
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,159
Please answer back at once.

1004
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:52,599
If you remain silent,
we'll leave right away.

1005
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:18,039
Your Excellency, they're here.

1006
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:19,119
What are you waiting for?

1007
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,000
Your Excellency,

1008
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,000
Are they here?

1009
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,719
Excuse me,
which one is His Excellency Fan Xian,

1010
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:57,159
the Poetic Genius from Nanqing?

1011
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:01,679
This is His Excellency Fan Xian,

1012
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:03,559
Envoy of Nanqing.

1013
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:06,119
Poetic Genius Fan!

1014
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,360
I'm Fan Xian.

1015
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,760
I've looked up to
your great name for a long time!

1016
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:10,840
On seeing you today,

1017
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:12,599
you're really outstanding as expected.

1018
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:13,800
You are?

1019
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,239
I'm Shen Zhong.

1020
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:16,920
Just call me by my name.

1021
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,719
Your Excellency Shen,
Commander-in-chief of Embroidered Uniform Guards.

1022
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:20,760
You two should deal with

1023
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,960
the handover procedures.

1024
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,199
Got it.

1025
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,920
Your Excellency Fan,
have you heard of me?

1026
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:26,800
Yes.

1027
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:28,840
Your Excellency Shen,
why not wear your robe?

1028
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,360
My robe doesn't fit.

1029
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,679
It's being altered in Shangjing.

1030
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:34,920
Your Excellency Fan, I beg you pardon.

1031
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:35,840
I'm fine! I'm OK!

1032
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:38,079
Where's Miss Si?

1033
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,840
This way, please.

1034
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,119
Your Excellency Shen,
won't you check her out?

1035
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:48,599
It's fine. The mammies will handle it.

1036
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:50,480
By the imperial edict of His Majesty,

1037
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:52,679
Miss Si,
we're here to escort you to Shangjing.

1038
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:53,760
Please come with us.

1039
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:55,280
I'm a new official.

1040
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,280
In a high position at such a young age,

1041
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,840
you do have
a successful official career.

1042
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:01,440
I'm just lucky.

1043
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,039
Your Excellency Shen,
I'm really flattered.

1044
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,719
You're the one

1045
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:05,639
who's really in a high position.

1046
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:06,519
Miss Si, you're injured?

1047
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:09,119
Hold her.

1048
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:15,400
Miss Si is injured!

1049
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:16,679
Mammy,

1050
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,800
on our way here,

1051
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:19,079
some bandits pretended to be

1052
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:20,159
the followers of Shangshan Hu,

1053
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:21,280
trying to take Xiao En away.

1054
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,480
Miss Si was shot accidentally.

1055
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:24,320
She's fine now.

1056
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:25,159
How can you

1057
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:26,360
let her be injured?

1058
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,480
Do you want to lose your head?

1059
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,119
Who is she?

1060
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,679
She's an old servant
in the imperial palace.
