16
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,200
What did he say to you?

17
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,319
He's already dead

18
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,519
when I'm here.

19
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,560
You said

20
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,439
you'd only die for your family.

21
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,960
You said you'd run away

22
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,319
in case of danger.

23
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,159
Why did you break your words?

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,599
He's not dead.

25
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,000
Your Excellency.

26
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:43,840
Your Excellency.

27
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,439
Go away.

28
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,159
Get out of the way!

29
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:45,759
Your Excellency.

30
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,879
He is alive!

31
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,639
and avenge Teng Zijing's death

32
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,240
if he dies.

33
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,879
Who will interrogate him?

34
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,000
I also don't know

35
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,080
Take Teng Zijing to the Fan mansion.

36
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,439
Got it.

37
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,080
I will

38
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,840
go to the Investigator's Office
for the result tomorrow.

39
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,919
Your Excellency,
let me go back with you.

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,719
No.

41
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,560
No matter who it is,

42
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll give them one more chance
to kill me.

43
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:49,240
Why is he so seriously injured?

44
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,639
Yeah. Where is he going?

45
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,439
Brother, what's up?

46
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,639
I'm good.

47
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:02,520
I've heard.

48
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,479
It's all in the past.

49
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,599
Send someone to tell Li Chengze

50
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,800
an accident has happened to me

51
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,879
and I can't make it today.

52
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,039
Ruoruo,

53
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,160
we're not going back to Danzhou.

54
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,240
I'm afraid it's bad news.

55
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,680
Cheng Jushu tried
to assassinate Fan Xian

56
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,399
on Niulan Street.

57
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,160
And then?

58
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,759
Two female assassins

59
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,120
and Fan Xian's guard were killed.

60
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:49,800
Is Cheng Jushu still alive?

61
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,000
He's taken away
by the Investigator's Office.

62
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,879
They must want
to find the one behind this.

63
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,279
Here is the capital city.

64
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,800
Who dared to do that here?

65
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,759
I'll be considered
the most likely suspect.

66
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:01,920
Your Highness.

67
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:04,439
It's me that asked Fan Xian to be here

68
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,399
and he was attacked on his way.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Your Highness, let's go back.

70
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:28,120
This matter

71
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,759
may shock the whole city.

72
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,160
Luckily, Fan Xian is all right.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,759
But, you're not shocked at all.

74
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,399
Your Highness, what do you mean?

75
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,920
I don't understand.

76
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,759
You're not surprised

77
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,680
when hearing about
the assassination attempt.

78
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:22,120
Did you expect

79
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,519
it would happen?

80
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,040
What are you going to do?

81
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,319
I didn't mean it.
Don't take it seriously.

82
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,879
Cheng Jushu is in custody
at the Investigator's Office.

83
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,639
Ruoruo

84
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,240
has been waiting at the gate

85
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,240
for the result.

86
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:39,279
Who do you think it might be?

87
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:51,399
Li Chengze is the most likely suspect.

88
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,000
It's he that

89
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,279
asked you to go to Joy Tsin House

90
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,759
and you have to pass through
Niulan Street to get there.

91
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,279
If I were dead,

92
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,399
everyone would suspect him.

93
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,120
So, it's someone else.

94
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,399
I want to know

95
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,920
where the Crown Prince went

96
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:20,920
and what he did today.

97
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,600
You don't have the right

98
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,480
to ask about his whereabouts.

99
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,319
The one behind the scenes
is still a mystery.

100
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:33,320
Don't act rashly.

101
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,879
I'm done.

102
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,399
I've heard.

103
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,919
I've heard it's a fierce battle.

104
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,960
I've been worried about you.

105
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,840
Teng Zijing.

106
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,320
Is he dead?

107
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,600
He was your guard.

108
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,879
No, he wasn't.

109
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,519
He was an idiot.

110
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,759
Who tried to assassinate Fan Xian?

111
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,679
I'm ignorant sometimes,

112
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,399
but I'd never dare to do that.

113
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,279
I've been getting well along
with Fan Xian.

114
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,360
I really have no reason to kill him.

115
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,279
Then who do you think it is?

116
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,799
The assassinators are warriors
from Beiqi.

117
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,879
It may be their plot.

118
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,120
It makes sense.

119
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,559
But I don't understand

120
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,840
why they want to do that.

121
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,320
Are they also angry with Fan Xian

122
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,200
and anxious to avenge
Guo Baokun's injuries?

123
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,200
I'd never do such a thing

124
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,080
for Guo Baokun.

125
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,919
I believe what you said,

126
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:06,320
but I really can't think of anyone else

127
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,480
who has a grudge against Fan Xian

128
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,519
in the capital city.

129
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,799
Chengze, do you know gossip
is a fearful thing?

130
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,080
Do you think

131
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,120
murder is a solution to problems?

132
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,000
Of course not.

133
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,960
There are so many complicated things
in the world.

134
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,480
How could they be solved by murder?

135
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,480
I agree.

136
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,240
I think murder is
a solution to problems.

137
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,000
You can kill Fan Xian
if he's in the way.

138
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,440
You can kill officials
if they suspect you.

139
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,960
You can kill the whole staff
of the Investigator's Office

140
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,159
if they make detailed inquires.

141
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,159
You can also kill me

142
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,039
if I'm suspicious.

143
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,440
Murder seems like a solution
to problems,

144
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,039
but only the unpardonably wicked
would turn to that.

145
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:49,759
I'd be destroyed by heaven and earth

146
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,159
if I meant to do that.

147
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,720
So would I.

148
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:54,840
Then stop sounding each other out.

149
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,519
How can you rule the world

150
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,960
if you aren't large-hearted enough?

151
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,159
You despised the national law

152
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,679
by acting in such a foolhardy manner.

153
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,799
You can leave.

154
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:09,799
Your Majesty,

155
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,879
here is a secret report
from the Investigator's Office.

156
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,159
They want to set Cheng Jushu free?

157
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:20,240
Yes.

158
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,320
Did Fan Xian know that?

159
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,679
Not yet.

160
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,440
Then tell him.

161
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:25,759
Yes, Your Majesty.

162
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,600
Thank you.

163
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:58,879
I must leave.

164
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,360
where are you going?

165
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,159
Teng Zijing died because of me.

166
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,919
His wife and son

167
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,679
still don't know about that.

168
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,639
My Lady!

169
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,120
Lady Fan Ruoruo is here.

170
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,399
Let her in.

171
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,320
Got it.

172
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,080
Brother, Cheng Jushu will be set free.

173
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,240
Your Excellency.

174
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,240
Where is Cheng Jushu?

175
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,279
In the dungeon.

176
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,320
Have you found out the one behind this?

177
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:47,840
He said nothing.

178
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,879
What will you do with him?

179
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:50,120
Your Excellency.

180
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,960
Answer me!

181
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,000
He'll be sent out of town.

182
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:53,720
And then?

183
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:55,759
He'll be set free.

184
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,600
Who made the decision?

185
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,039
Generally, when the Head is not
in the capital city,

186
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,399
Mr. Zhu Ge,

187
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,399
director of the First Division,

188
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,519
will take care of all matters related.

189
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,159
Take me to see him.

190
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:04,759
Your Excellency.

191
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,000
Take me to see him.

192
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,000
Please follow me.

193
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,600
The Investigator's Office
is divided into eight divisions,

194
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,639
each of which performs
its own functions.

195
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,519
The First Division is responsible for

196
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:15,879
supervising officials
in the capital city.

197
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,440
This is the most important unit.

198
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,320
Zhu Ge has followed the Head for years.

199
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,879
He's powerful and influential.

200
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,840
And he's particularly severe.

201
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,440
Right here.

202
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,200
Your Excellency,

203
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,840
please be cautious
with your words and actions

204
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,799
when you see him.

205
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,159
Your Excellency,

206
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,519
Mr. Fan Xian, a disciple of Master Fei

207
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,399
of the Investigator's Office
in a short time?

208
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,200
wants to see you.

209
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,399
I'm not available.

210
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,519
Your Excellency.

211
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,919
Your Excellency.

212
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,559
You want to set Cheng Jushu free?

213
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:00,679
Among the eight directors
of the Investigator's Office,

214
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,960
Fei Jie ranks third

215
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,399
as for his capabilities,

216
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,799
but I look down upon him most

217
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,759
as for the way he behaves.

218
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,080
He can't make a clear distinction
between public and private interests

219
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,639
or between the important
and the less important.

220
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,879
As his disciple,

221
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,679
you'd better not follow him
in this respect.

222
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:21,879
Why do you want to set Cheng Jushu free?

223
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,960
You just need to obey orders.

224
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,039
Don't ask unnecessary questions.

225
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,720
Of the Investigator's Office
in a short time?

226
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,679
I don't need to follow
any of the eight directors.

227
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,120
I have the same seniority as you.

228
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,759
The token is not false, right?

229
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,559
Right.

230
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,919
Okay. Let me repeat it.

231
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,080
Why do you want to set Cheng Jushu free?

232
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,080
According to an urgent report
from the Ministry of War,

233
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,039
there is an emergency deployment
of armies at the northern border.

234
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,039
A war may break out at any moment.

235
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,960
Nanqing has planning a war against Beiqi

236
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,279
for a long time,

237
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,200
but the timing of making war

238
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,840
has to be decided by us.

239
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,240
How is it related to Cheng Jushu?

240
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,279
Cheng Jushu is a martial arts master
from Beiqi.

241
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,200
If he dies in the capital city,

242
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,279
it may give Beiqi an excuse.

243
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,960
The national plans will be destroyed

244
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,120
in case they attack us at this time.

245
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,240
In case?

246
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:24,120
That's why you made that decision?

247
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,759
One of Cheng Jushu's friends

248
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,799
is a general of Beiqi.

249
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,559
He promised

250
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,720
he'd provide us

251
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,840
with details about the deployment

252
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,000
of forces at the border

253
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,200
if we keep Cheng Jushu safe.

254
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,320
So, you did business with him.

255
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,879
No matter what we do,

256
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,000
we have to put
the country's interests first.

257
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,200
But if we can only win at the
sacrifice of the innocent people,

258
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,799
then what's the meaning of it!

259
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,960
It's a matter
concerning national safety.

260
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,679
It's not up to you.

261
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
A life for a life.

262
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,279
This is the law.

263
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,159
It's just a guard

264
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,360
that was killed.

265
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,600
Just a guard?

266
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,759
Your Excellency,

267
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,559
the stone tablet at the gate says

268
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,759
men are created equal

269
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,720
and there is neither lowliness
nor nobleness,

270
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,720
on which the Investigator's Office
is based.

271
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,400
A guard is also a man.

272
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,359
He's a father.

273
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
He's a husband.

274
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,039
He's the only one his family
can depend on.

275
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,839
The victim is dead,

276
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,759
but the murderer will be set free.

277
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,519
Where is the national law?

278
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,240
Where is the justice?

279
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,880
It's already been decided.

280
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,519
There is no room for negotiation.

281
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,240
Guards!

282
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,079
Yes.

283
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,279
Tell everyone

284
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,119
the First Division

285
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,519
is responsible for Cheng Jushu's case.

286
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,480
Nobody should hand him over
to anyone else

287
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,839
even if he has the token
for Director-General.

288
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:11,920
Yes.

289
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,400
Go home and have a good rest.

290
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,640
Does anyone believe

291
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,200
what it says?

292
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,759
Wang Qinian, answer me!

293
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,000
Does anyone believe what it says?

294
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:01,759
Your Excellency!

295
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,839
What's done is done.

296
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,640
you've tried your best.

297
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,960
Fan!

298
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,359
His Highness and I want to say sorry.

299
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
If His Highness hadn't invited you

300
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,559
to go to Joy Tsin House,

301
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,519
such an accident couldn't have
happened to you.

302
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,680
But Fan, please believe us.

303
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,920
His Highness

304
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,039
couldn't have tried to assassinate you.

305
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,440
Can you do me a favor?

306
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,240
Go ahead.

307
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,000
Get Cheng Jushu

308
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
out of the Investigator's Office

309
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,279
and kill him!

310
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,680
Fan,

311
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,519
His Highness could do that

312
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,640
if Cheng Jushu is locked
in the Ministry of Penalty,

313
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,440
the Capital Garrison
or the Prefecture of Capital City.

314
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,920
But he's in the Investigator's Office.

315
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:43,400
His Majesty has given orders

316
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,119
nobody is allowed to step in.

317
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,039
Even the Crown Prince
doesn't have the right to meddle.

318
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,480
How about

319
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,240
compensating that guard's family

320
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,319
with a large amount of money?

321
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,680
If it were you,

322
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:58,960
how much can compensate

323
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,000
for the loss of your family?

324
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,559
then so be it.

325
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,480
Why are you following me?

326
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,079
Let me walk you home.

327
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:29,160
Is there anyone in the capital city

328
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,079
who's not afraid of

329
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,079
the Investigator's Office?

330
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,119
None.

331
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,559
The Imperial Guards
and the Capital Garrison

332
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,359
are in the control
of the Investigation's Office.

333
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,480
The Prefecture of Capital City
is afraid of them.

334
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,519
Members of the royal family
are not allowed to get involved.

335
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:44,480
All officers at court
are worldly-wise and play safe.

336
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
Your token won't work

337
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,680
and your father is just

338
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,519
Assistant Minister of Revenue.

339
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,119
I've thought about

340
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,039
every possible way.

341
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,039
I'm afraid we can do nothing about it.

342
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,759
When will Cheng Jushu

343
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,440
be taken out
of the Investigator's Office?

344
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,920
I think it's this afternoon.

345
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,519
Find out the exact time.

346
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,200
This is all I have with me right now.

347
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,440
I'll get more later.

348
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,359
Please go back and wait at home.

349
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:25,640
Thank you.

350
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:26,720
Your Excellency,

351
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,480
I'll get it done
because you paid for it.

352
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,720
Don't thank me.

353
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,720
Then,

354
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,519
Fan Xian,

355
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,000
is it really okay to put the coffin

356
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,799
in the yard?

357
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,319
I'll send him back

358
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,240
when I get things done.

359
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:11,680
Get things done?

360
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:13,880
What things?

361
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:17,799
Why do you keep sharpening the dagger?

362
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,279
Brother, what can I do for you?

363
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,920
Just stay at home.

364
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:34,319
How is it going?

365
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,640
I've checked it out.

366
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,880
He'll be taken away

367
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,680
from the Investigator's Office
in an hour.

368
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,960
He'll get out of town from the
North Gate and leaves by water.

369
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,240
Wait for my return.

370
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,160
Brother!

371
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,759
Go along this street

372
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:54,279
to be out of town from the North Gate.

373
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,559
There is a small forest
before you arrive at the wharf.

374
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,319
It's the most suitable place

375
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,160
for you to kill Cheng Jushu.

376
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,000
A forest out of town?

377
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,119
Right. This is the only choice.

378
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,839
Find a way to distract the escorts.

379
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:07,759
Then kill Cheng Jushu
while nobody else is around.

380
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,880
In this case,
even if His Excellency knows

381
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,160
it's you that have done it,

382
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,559
he can do nothing

383
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,839
without strong evidence.

384
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:16,079
However, Cheng Jushu

385
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:17,160
is seriously injured,

386
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,680
but he's an Eighth Dan
Martial Arts Master, anyway,

387
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,720
and you haven't made a recovery,

388
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
so, it's a little risky.

389
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:25,279
Your Excellency,

390
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,359
you have to go this way
to be out of town.

391
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,160
Who said I'd do that?

392
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,519
The forest is the only place

393
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,240
where there won't be pedestrians.

394
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,119
Thank you for providing information.

395
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,359
From now on,

396
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,559
stop following me
to avoid getting involved.

397
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,839
Your Excellency,

398
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,519
where are you going to do that?

399
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:00,839
As His Excellency said,

400
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,400
we'll keep you safe in Nanqing.

401
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:03,759
Don't forget to ask your friend

402
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:04,920
to collect information
on deployment of forces

403
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,720
when you go back to Beiqi.

404
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,720
And, keep silent when you go out.

405
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,039
Follow us out of town.

406
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,640
There is a boat at the wharf
and you'll go back to Beiqi by water.

407
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:11,759
Remember.

408
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,359
Never stop when you go out.

409
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:15,319
We'll get into trouble if you're found.

410
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,559
Got it?

411
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:18,000
Let's go.

412
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:51,960
Let's go.

413
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:53,240
-Go. -Go.

414
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,359
Let's go.

415
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:55,920
What are you looking at?

416
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,119
I'm here to kill him.

417
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:19,880
Your Excellency.

418
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,079
We work for the Investigator's Office.

419
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,319
Someone asked me
to kill you when nobody is around,

420
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,160
but I don't like it.

421
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,559
You're so cruel as
to kill people in broad daylight.

422
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
What you did is unforgivable.

423
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,039
I'll kill you

424
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,640
in public!

425
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,279
Someone wants to do business with you,

426
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,480
but I don't.

427
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,519
They don't kill you
for overall interests.

428
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:45,160
Let me do it!

429
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,720
Delay Fan Xian.

430
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,640
Follow me! Go!

431
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,400
Go!

432
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,279
Call for help! Stop Fan Xian!

433
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,359
who can understand the mechanism

434
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,680
you're willing to die for

435
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,799
in this world,

436
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,240
how boring it will be!

437
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,640
I know,

438
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,279
Only with someone like that

439
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,359
can we really

440
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,359
take roots in this world.

441
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:18,680
In public?

442
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:19,200
Yes.

443
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,119
As you have ordered,

444
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,680
in the forest out of town

445
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,880
on your instructions.

446
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:23,960
-So, we can't... -Okay.

447
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,640
I'll go there myself.

448
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,599
Don't come over.

449
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,319
It's horrible.

450
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,759
This is Teng Zijing's dagger.

451
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,559
You should remember the name.

452
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,400
Stop!

453
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:01,880
Take them!

454
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,759
Was Cheng Jushu really killed?

455
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,200
Yes, it's true.

456
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,160
Fan Xian has been arrested
by the Investigator's Office.

457
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,240
How did he do that?

458
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:14,519
He's so arrogant

459
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,480
that he didn't wait
to do it out of town.

460
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,720
He fought and killed Cheng Jushu

461
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,440
just at the gate
of the Investigator's Office

462
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:21,920
under the watchful eyes of people.

463
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,920
Numerous pedestrians

464
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,039
have witnessed it.

465
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,839
He's really a hot-blooded young man.

466
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,720
It seems impossible

467
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,119
to hide the news.

468
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,880
He's not just hot-blooded.

469
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,480
He's made a correct assessment
of the situation.

470
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,039
He killed a guy in broad daylight
and didn't try to hide it.

471
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,599
Can we really say he's made
a correct assessment?

472
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,880
Yes.

473
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,079
He did a good job.

474
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:53,519
Prepare an imperial decree.

475
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,279
Do you know what you've done?

476
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,160
I just enforced justice
on behalf of Heaven.

477
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,759
You idiot. You ruined our plan!

478
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,200
Hold back your anger.

479
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:08,720
How about having some bitter gourd?

480
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,680
The Investigator's Office
never tolerates anyone

481
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,279
that disobey orders.

482
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,559
I didn't. I have
the same seniority as you.

483
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:15,720
Not anymore!

484
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,640
What are you doing?
Mr. Fei gave it to me.

485
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,119
If he is here,

486
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,160
I'll blame him

487
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,400
for hiring the wrong person.

488
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,960
Well, Your Excellency,

489
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,599
are you so powerful

490
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,440
as to blame your peers

491
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,559
in the Investigator's Office?

492
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Fan Xian,

493
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,960
you destroyed

494
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,880
your promising future today.

495
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,559
Shall I say sorry to you?

496
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,039
Will it make you feel better?

497
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:37,839
Take him to the dungeon.

498
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,319
How is the food there?

499
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,400
I don't like spicy food.

500
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:43,440
I need soup every day.

501
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,119
Your Excellency.

502
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,000
Your Excellency.

503
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,519
What's up?

504
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,240
Do you want to rebel?

505
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,960
How dare we do that?

506
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,519
Master Fei asked us to

507
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,839
take good care of Young Master Fan

508
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,440
before he left.

509
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,200
Fei Jie is not in the capital city.

510
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,480
No matter he's here or not,

511
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:25,599
the Third Division

512
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,799
will do as he said, right?

513
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:28,880
Young Master Fan, don't worry.

514
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,880
You're a disciple of Mr. Fei,

515
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,680
so all of us will treat you
as our junior fellow apprentice.

516
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,000
Don't be afraid now that we're here.

517
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,559
Nice to meet you,
Senior Fellow Apprentices!

518
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,039
Hi, junior.

519
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,160
He's really handsome
and highly esteemed.

520
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,119
Enough!

521
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,480
Leng is the acting director

522
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,279
of the Third Division, right?

523
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:48,319
Ask him to come and see me.

524
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,160
Sorry, Your Excellency.

525
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,799
He developed

526
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,599
a new kind of poison the other day.

527
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:53,839
He can't move

528
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,400
after taking some of it.

529
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,160
However, he also asked us

530
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,440
to protect Young Master Fan.

531
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,720
He tried the poison himself?

532
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,640
Let me tell you.

533
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,799
It's a tradition of the Third Division.

534
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,160
Leng is

535
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,759
also one of Master Fei's disciples.

536
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,000
He can be considered
as our senior fellow apprentice.

537
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,920
I have to see him.

538
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:07,759
Definitely.

539
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,880
However, it's a little serious
this time.

540
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:11,400
It may take him 10
to 15 days to recover.

541
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,039
You have to wait.

542
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,880
He's awesome.

543
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,559
Of course.

544
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,720
So who can tell me

545
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,000
what are you going to do to protect him?

546
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,759
Your Excellency, he doesn't
have to be put into the dungeon

547
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,240
no matter what he did, right?

548
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:24,960
Okay.

549
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:26,799
I'm taking him

550
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,920
to the dungeon myself.

551
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,680
Anyone who tries to stop me
will be considered a rebel,

552
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,480
whose family will get into trouble.

553
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,119
Don't try to scare us.

554
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:42,839
Step aside!

555
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,079
Get ready!

556
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,839
Hold on.

557
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,640
It's a minor matter.
I'll take care of it.

558
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:53,599
Are you sure?

559
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,559
Trust me,

560
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,240
Now that Fan Jie
is not in the capital city,

561
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,599
the Third Division could do nothing

562
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,599
without a leader.

563
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,400
I'm much obliged to them.

564
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:23,759
Fan Xian,

565
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,119
you ruined our plan to attack Beiqi.

566
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,799
Nobody can save you.

567
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,319
Have you thought of it

568
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,799
when you killed Cheng Jushu?

569
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,640
Your Excellency, hold on.

570
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:34,839
Wait a moment.

571
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,160
Well,

572
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,279
Even a clerk dares to stop me?

573
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,119
Don't get me wrong.

574
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:42,559
How could I dare to do that?

575
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,039
I'll never stop you.

576
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,359
Get out of the way!

577
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:48,920
Hold on.

578
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,880
Believe it or not. I'll fire you!

579
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:53,319
Your Excellency,

580
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,960
Fan Xian did something good to Nanqing!

581
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,079
Are you crazy?

582
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,400
Your Excellency,

583
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,119
could you tell me which general of Beiqi

584
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,599
wants to exchange their military plan

585
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,640
for Cheng Jushu?

586
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,559
It's none of your business!

587
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,279
Your Excellency, check this out!

588
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,359
What's this?

589
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,240
It's a file

590
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,079
on Cheng Jushu's life.

591
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,799
What on earth do you want to say?

592
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,640
I've read it carefully.

593
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,039
Cheng Jushu is unsociable and eccentric.

594
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,240
He's obstinate and unruly.

595
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,400
He doesn't have any friend

596
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,759
who serves in the army.

597
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,319
Besides,

598
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,319
most of the high-ranking
military officers

599
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,519
of Beiqi at the border

600
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,480
think poorly of him

601
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,160
and even hold grudges against him.

602
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,960
In this case,

603
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,960
who would want

604
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,759
to exchange their military plan

605
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:45,160
for Cheng Jushu's life?

606
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,359
They aim to give you false information

607
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,640
in the name of saving Cheng Jushu.

608
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,000
Your Excellency Fan,
you're really clever.

609
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,599
I agree with you.

610
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,960
They want to take this opportunity

611
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,240
to send us false information.

612
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:05,039
Once we go to war,

613
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,200
such disinformation

614
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,839
will make us fall into deadly traps.

615
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,200
So,

616
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,519
by killing Cheng Jushu,

617
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:14,240
His Excellency Fan did a good job

618
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,839
instead of making a mistake.

619
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:21,400
Your Excellency, did you hear that?

620
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:29,440
Your Excellency,

621
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,480
His Excellency Fan
set things right accidentally

622
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,680
by doing that.

623
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,000
Please give him a lesser punishment.

624
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,079
Wang Qinian,

625
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,519
you've spared no effort

626
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,720
to save Fan Xian.

627
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,359
That's a strong word.

628
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:51,920
I'm taking the matter on its merits.

629
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:53,920
Do you think you're the only one

630
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:55,799
who has noticed that?

631
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:02,279
It's a war of nations.
We all know its importance.

632
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,640
How could I not find out

633
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,480
Cheng Jushu's background?

634
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:06,599
Then,

635
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:07,920
Answer me.

636
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,159
Why do you think

637
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,800
I want to exchange Cheng Jushu's life

638
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,119
for that disinformation?

639
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:21,840
Did you turn their trick to our own use?

640
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,280
You want to make them believe

641
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,440
You're fooled?

642
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,719
By then we'd know

643
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,880
everything about them clearly.

644
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,559
It'd be easy to defeat them.

645
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:33,199
But Fan Xian killed Cheng Jushu.

646
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,000
He's destroyed our plan!

647
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,760
Well, he...

648
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,239
It's understandable, anyway.

649
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,960
Since when could the Investigator's Office
stand such a matter?

650
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,280
Fan Xian, have a guess.

651
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,639
Who else would try to save you?

652
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,760
I'm a people person.

653
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:56,960
I can't guess it.

654
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,239
Head is not in the capital city.

655
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,639
Nobody can save you.

656
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,679
Take him away!

657
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,280
Wait.

658
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,000
Hold on.

659
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,480
Yan Ruohai,

660
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,440
I've thought of many people,

661
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:55,079
but I didn't expect it'd be you.

662
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,239
Who is he?

663
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,880
The Investigator's Office
is divided into eight divisions.

664
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,000
This is His Excellency Yan Ruohai,
director of the Fourth Division

665
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:04,320
that's responsible for supervising
officials outside the capital city

666
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:07,599
and carrying on

667
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,519
Your Excellency.

668
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,719
The name sounds familiar to me.

669
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:17,760
My son was demoted and left
the capital city because of you.

670
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,320
Yan Bingyun is your son.

671
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,280
Let him go.

672
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,039
Bingyun lurks in the capital of Beiqi

673
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,239
it's hard to survive.

674
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,480
It's all his fault.

675
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:35,400
I know.

676
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,840
Why did you help him?

677
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,360
I'm just here to pass on a message.

678
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,440
Head is not in the capital city.

679
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,960
From whom is the message?

680
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,079
It's an imperial decree.

681
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,039
Aren't you going to kneel down?

682
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,599
I'm listening with respectful attention.

683
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:13,679
Wang Qinian, what's going on?

684
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,480
Kneel down.

685
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,159
I can't.

686
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,280
I'm tied up.

687
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,559
Your Excellency.

688
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:20,159
How dare you!

689
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,840
Forget about it.
I don't want to read it.

690
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,599
Look at it yourself.

691
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,159
It's simple.

692
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:32,519
His Majesty asked you
to let Fan Xian go.

693
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,079
I will obey the order.

694
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:43,599
Guards!

695
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,280
Untie the ropes.

696
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,719
Return the token to him.

697
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,320
You're free to go.

698
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,800
Thank you, Your Excellency.

699
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,360
Even if those things
hadn't happened to my son,

700
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,480
I don't like you

701
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,239
because of your casual attitude.

702
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,960
I helped to save you,

703
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,880
but I still look down upon you.

704
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,599
So, don't thank me. Go home.

705
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:28,000
Wang Qinian,

706
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:29,880
walk me home.

707
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,679
I have the same seniority as him.

708
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,920
Your Excellencies,

709
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,559
let me drive His Excellency Fan away.

710
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,280
Let's go.

711
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:47,320
Your Excellency, see you around.

712
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:51,239
Your Excellency.

713
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,079
Your Excellency,

714
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,559
tell me

715
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,360
how you made His Excellency Yan Ruohai

716
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,800
your friend from your enemy.

717
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,159
I didn't know him.

718
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:19,320
Do you know His Majesty?

719
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:20,800
What do you think?

720
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,639
So I just don't get it.

721
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:26,440
You killed Cheng Jushu

722
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,280
at the gate
of the Investigator's Office,

723
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,920
but His Majesty ordered them
to set you free.

724
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,679
Why?

725
00:39:31,559 --> 00:39:32,800
Because I did it in public.

726
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,559
What?

727
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,480
If I killed Cheng Jushu in secret,

728
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:38,880
I'd be punished.

729
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,519
On the contrary,

730
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:42,599
I'd be safe since I did it in public.

731
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,679
Why?

732
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,719
Four words.

733
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,920
People will talk.

734
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,880
That's why His Majesty did that.

735
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,840
Everyone is talking
about the assassination attempt

736
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,400
that was carried out yesterday.

737
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,840
Today, Fan Xian

738
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,719
killed Cheng Jushu in public.

739
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:04,679
Everyone knows that

740
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,000
he did it to take revenge.

741
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,599
So what?

742
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,000
Cheng Jushu is
a martial arts master from Beiqi.

743
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,119
Your Excellency,

744
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,719
Nanqing

745
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,719
is the world's leading power.

746
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,480
People here are always
proud and confident.

747
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:21,079
Now, a gifted scholar in Nanqing killed

748
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,760
a martial arts master from Beiqi.

749
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
Isn't it a story passed
on with approval?

750
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,440
What will the common people think

751
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,880
if we put Fan Xian into prison?

752
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,360
But Fan Xian is also

753
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:38,119
he broke the law anyway.

754
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:41,280
The war will begin soon. It's important to
win support from the common people.

755
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,400
What His Majesty wants to protect

756
00:40:44,039 --> 00:40:45,400
is not Fan Xian

757
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,760
but people's determination to win

758
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:48,239
and their fighting will.

759
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,360
I see.

760
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,960
That's why you wanted
to kill Cheng Jushu

761
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,960
in broad daylight.

762
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,519
When I did that,

763
00:40:58,599 --> 00:40:59,719
I just wanted to take revenge.

764
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:00,800
I didn't figure out the whole thing

765
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,239
until it all had happened.

766
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:03,719
It means

767
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,760
Heaven rewards the good.

768
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,519
What you did conforms
to the will of Heaven,

769
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,639
so you turned ill luck into good.

770
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,199
Wang,

771
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:11,239
do me another favor.

772
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,000
You've already killed him.

773
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,159
I haven't found the one
behind the scenes.

774
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,079
It's not over yet.

775
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,400
But Cheng Jushu is dead.

776
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,400
There were also
two female assassinators.

777
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,519
They're dead too.

778
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,239
It doesn't matter.

779
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:22,239
Find out their background.

780
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,079
Your Excellency,

781
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,280
it's confidential.
I don't have the right to...

782
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:30,800
Fine.

783
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,159
For truth and justice,

784
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,079
it's my bounden duty.

785
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,360
How is it going at you side?

786
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:43,360
This is the token
of the secret agent from Beiqi.

787
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:44,840
Token?

788
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,599
Beiqi has secret agents

789
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:47,800
that lurk in Nanqing.

790
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,320
They use tokens like this
to deploy subordinates

791
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,360
and conduct activities.

792
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:53,159
In that sense,

793
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,599
Cheng Jushu is a Beiqi secret agent.

794
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,679
I'm afraid so!

795
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,360
What an honor to me!

796
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,320
This unknown big hand

797
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,400
unites Beiqi

798
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,000
just to kill me.

799
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:12,159
Your Excellency.

800
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:14,239
It's getting more and more complicated.

801
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,400
Do we still need to continue with it?

802
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,119
Investigate!

803
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,480
We can't let Teng Zijing
die for nothing.

804
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:22,679
I'll never give up

805
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,840
before finding out the true killer.

806
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,400
Why did Cheng Jushu
and the female assassinators

807
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,079
choose Niulan Street
for the assassination?

808
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,480
You were heading towards Joy Tsin House

809
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,920
and would undoubtedly
pass by Niulan Street.

810
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:35,440
How did they know it?

811
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,639
Perhaps they didn't.

812
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,239
They just followed secretly

813
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,760
and planned to do it by chance.

814
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,480
Impossible!

815
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,840
Two assassinators attacked from front
and back respectively that day.

816
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,159
Cheng Jushu hid at the back of the wall.

817
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:48,320
It was an ambush

818
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,280
well planned in advance.

819
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:51,840
They had known I would
pass by Niulan Street well before it.

820
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,719
Who else knew

821
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,719
you were going to Joy Tsin House?

822
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,920
The person who made the appointment
with me naturally knew it.

823
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:58,840
The Second Prince?

824
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,440
He is under too much suspicion

825
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,320
to do it

826
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,079
which makes it seem deliberate.

827
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:07,039
Then there isn't any more suspect left.

828
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:08,639
Aren't you aware

829
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:10,440
since it was an appointment,

830
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,599
Joy Tsin House would need to

831
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:13,480
prepare the banquet in advance.

832
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:15,880
It's the people from Joy Tsin House?!

833
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,320
They also knew

834
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,519
I would pass by Niulan Street.

835
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,239
But Miss Si Lili and you

836
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:22,199
like each other so much.

837
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,039
People from her side

838
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:24,039
shouldn't have any problem.

839
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:25,360
I have no connection

840
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,320
with Si Lili.

841
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,639
In retrospect,

842
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:30,519
this Miss

843
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:31,840
doesn't look like

844
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,800
a courtesan in brothel at all.

845
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:37,559
So we need to go

846
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:38,800
to Joy Tsin House immediately.

847
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:41,159
Exactly.

848
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:43,920
Let me in!

849
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,519
No! No!

850
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:45,960
Sir, you can't come inside.

851
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,039
Why not?

852
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:49,119
Listen!

853
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:50,559
I made an appointment

854
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,440
with Miss Yunjian a long time ago.

855
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:54,159
What's the reason not to let me in?

856
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:55,559
There is no reason.

857
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,440
I must get in!

858
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:56,920
Sir!

859
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,559
Sir!

860
00:44:58,679 --> 00:44:59,880
You probably don't know that

861
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,719
Miss Si Lili's boat

862
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:02,679
has been burnt.

863
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:04,679
The government is investigating

864
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:05,719
the cause of the fire.

865
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:06,880
No one is allowed to go inside.

866
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,800
Please forgive us.

867
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,480
Please forgive me.

868
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,599
-Go. -Go. Go.

869
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,320
Wait!

870
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:13,960
You said the boat got burnt?

871
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,760
When did that happen?

872
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,760
Sir, it was this noon.

873
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,079
It's such a pity

874
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,559
that a good boat got burnt

875
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,320
to ashes.

876
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,679
Where is Si Lili now?

877
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:26,239
She's gone?

878
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:28,239
Someone saw her going out of the city.

879
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:30,480
She must be frustrated

880
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,079
that the boat got burnt.

881
00:45:33,719 --> 00:45:34,280
Gentlemen,

882
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:35,800
please come some other day.

883
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,360
Please...

884
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,440
Excuse us, please!

885
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:42,239
There is no clue

886
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,519
up to this point.

887
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:44,559
Your Excellency,

888
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:47,920
if we can find Si Lili,

889
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,760
there should be some clue.

890
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:51,920
Didn't you hear it?

891
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:52,880
She's gone for quite a while.

892
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,440
How do we find her?!

893
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,239
Your Excellency may not know that

894
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:00,639
the Investigator's Office

895
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,880
has two masters of hunting.

896
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,480
One of them

897
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,039
is called Zong Zhui.

898
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,519
Generally, he follows the Head.

899
00:46:07,719 --> 00:46:08,960
He is not in the capital city now.

900
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:12,679
As for the other one,

901
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:17,559
would you like to have a guess

902
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,320
who the other guy is?

903
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:26,719
Is that you?

904
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,320
I'm afraid yes.

905
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:31,760
It's surprising

906
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,199
that you are just a clerk
with that skill.

907
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:36,039
Being a clerk is pretty good.

908
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,639
It runs no risk
and therefore super safe.

909
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:40,960
Why do you help me?

910
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:42,800
Your Excellency,

911
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,280
I'm driven out

912
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,440
by the Investigator's Office now.

913
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:49,320
But my whole family

914
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,199
still needs sustenance.

915
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:53,400
I learned that by working for you,

916
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,119
I can earn 50 taels of silver a month,

917
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:56,800
and there is land and ox.

918
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:02,280
If you can really hunt her down for me,

919
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,440
I'll give you 10 extra pigs.

920
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,599
Fantastic!

921
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:05,960
Your Excellency,

922
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,159
my girl

923
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,119
loves pork belly best.

924
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:10,719
Are you really able to hunt her down?

925
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,360
That's not a problem to me.

926
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,719
The problem lies in you.

927
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:15,920
What do you mean?

928
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:18,039
Si Lili left the capital city so timely.

929
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:19,760
She could most likely

930
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,679
be the Beiqi secret agent

931
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:23,199
in view of it.

932
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:24,920
Her escape

933
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,039
must be a plan well in advance

934
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:28,039
so as to coordinate
with the backup team.

935
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,719
If Your Excellency must hunt her down,

936
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:31,920
we must go out of the capital city

937
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,559
and run endless risks

938
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:36,440
to our lives.

939
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,400
Your Excellency,

940
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,320
are you willing to step
on such a dangerous journey?

941
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,360
It was my brother who was murdered.

942
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:45,199
In this case,

943
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,159
please follow me to go
out of the capital city

944
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,400
and start up this long journey.

945
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:55,559
Where are you going?

946
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:57,840
Where did you go?

947
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,239
Aren't we going out of here?

948
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,079
What do you want to do here?

949
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:02,599
All my equipment is at home.

950
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:04,880
I need to fetch them.

951
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,280
Is this your house?

952
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:22,360
Yes, it is.

953
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,519
Why don't you just walk in?

954
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,159
My wife is home.
It's better to be careful.

955
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,159
Wang Qinian,

956
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,719
you're henpecked!

957
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,880
Your Excellency may not know that

958
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:38,159
my wife has a nickname,

959
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:42,559
tigress-like Mrs. Wang.

960
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:43,519
What like?

961
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,199
Tigress.

962
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:47,719
Si Lili has gone for a while.

963
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,360
Let's hurry up.

964
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:50,159
It's fine!

965
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:51,559
It's easier to hunt

966
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,960
in day time.

967
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,320
My wife is deeply asleep.

968
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:02,079
Excuse me for a while.

969
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,599
I'll be back soon.

970
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,079
Please keep silent, Your Excellency!

971
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:25,800
Where are you going again, Wang Qinian?

972
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:27,440
Did you hide money in the case?

973
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:28,400
Listen to me, darling!

974
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,960
I've got business to do.

975
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:51,719
Done, Your Excellency!

976
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,760
It's done! Let's go!

977
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,480
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

978
00:49:57,639 --> 00:49:58,880
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

979
00:49:59,119 --> 00:49:59,840
Well done!

980
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:01,639
That's admiring.

981
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:07,239
Did you just say that

982
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,320
it's easier to hunt in day time?

983
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,480
Exactly.

984
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:13,679
Then I also have a person to meet.

985
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:44,840
Why haven't you gone to bed?

986
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:48,440
I heard that you killed a man
on the street.

987
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,039
I'm not fond of killing people.

988
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,480
That was to avenge Zijing.

989
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,599
Avenging friends is what man should do.

990
00:50:59,000 --> 00:50:59,920
But today,

991
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:02,199
you're not here to see me.

992
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,599
How could you say that?

993
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:05,480
You didn't wear the nocturnal costume

994
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:07,599
or the perfume.

995
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:12,559
Wan'er.

996
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,639
Si Lili from Joy Tsin House

997
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:16,679
may have a hand

998
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:18,079
in the assassination.

999
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,320
She is at large out of the capital city.

1000
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:24,599
I have to get her back.

1001
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:26,480
You are leaving soon?

1002
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:27,960
Yes, but I thought you'll be worried.

1003
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:28,840
So here I am to say goodbye.

1004
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:29,719
When will you be back?

1005
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,440
As soon as I get her.

1006
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:31,639
What if you don't?

1007
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,960
I won't stop you

1008
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:39,360
from what you want to do,

1009
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:43,000
but it's impossible for me

1010
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:44,719
not to worry.

1011
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,400
Wan'er.

1012
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,119
How about a hug before I leave?

1013
00:52:08,519 --> 00:52:11,599
It's dawn. I gotta go.

1014
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,079
I'll be worried every day.

1015
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:31,039
If you don't want me to,

1016
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,599
come back.

1017
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,599
Your Excellency,

1018
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:18,960
they said they were
on duty yesterday as well.

1019
00:53:19,239 --> 00:53:20,360
They saw Si Lili

1020
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:21,599
fleeing out of town.

1021
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,519
Which direction did she go?

1022
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:23,199
To the north.

1023
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,280
Then a few horses showed up.

1024
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:27,039
The riders wear bamboo hats
with similar dresses.

1025
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,599
It's difficult to tell
which one is Si Lili.

1026
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,599
Then they went
in their own separate ways.

1027
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:34,960
So well-prepared they are!

1028
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:37,880
What's wrong, Your Excellency?

1029
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:41,440
Nothing.

1030
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,239
I feel like something is not right.

1031
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,159
What is it?

1032
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:48,079
It's hard to describe it clearly.

1033
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,800
It could be the way

1034
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,960
Si Lili escaped.

1035
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,760
Multiple teams starting out together
to create confusion.

1036
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,599
That's a smart way to escape.

1037
00:53:59,039 --> 00:53:59,679
I know,

1038
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,559
but still something is missed out.

1039
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,039
Let's leave it!

1040
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,760
How do you plan to hunt?

1041
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,199
Your Excellency, please follow me.

1042
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:20,239
What are you doing?

1043
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:22,199
Shoot a bird!

1044
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:25,960
Where is the bird?!

1045
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:28,840
It will come

1046
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:29,960
in a minute.

1047
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:38,920
There it comes!

1048
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:52,039
A carrier pigeon?!

1049
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,079
A carrier pigeon
of the Investigator's Office.

1050
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:01,320
Si Lili burnt the boat

1051
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,079
and rode a horse out of town.

1052
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,840
It must attract the attention

1053
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,159
of the Investigator's Office.

1054
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:09,079
Even though she arranged six teams,

1055
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,320
her rough direction is to the north.

1056
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:12,880
Most of the pigeons

1057
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,320
from the north towns

1058
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,599
will go through this place.

1059
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:22,960
Si Lili is already being tracked.

1060
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:25,280
Multiple teams are hunting her down.

1061
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,360
Wait a minute! How do you know

1062
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:31,320
the pigeons of the Investigator's Office

1063
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,239
must go through here?

1064
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:36,719
Honestly,

1065
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:38,119
I have spent some time in the office

1066
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:40,960
raising pigeons.

1067
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,119
Won't it be noticed

1068
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:42,920
that you shot their pigeon?

1069
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,760
The Investigator's Office usually

1070
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,280
sends out several pigeons in one go.

1071
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,440
It's doesn't matter
to have one of them missing.

1072
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,519
Won't anyone notice it?

1073
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:53,440
As pigeons usually come across
predators like eagles

1074
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,320
during their fly,

1075
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:58,880
there is natural loss every month.

1076
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,480
Besides,

1077
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,440
I've raised pigeons for some time.

1078
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:03,199
So I know

1079
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,639
the number of pigeons coming back

1080
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,800
always fluctuates.

1081
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,199
No one will suspect.

1082
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,519
What else have you raised
other than pigeons?

1083
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,599
Why do you ask so?

1084
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,119
Save for a rainy day.

1085
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,719
I must get prepared anyhow.

1086
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,119
Here you go, sir! Tea for you!

1087
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:51,480
Your Excellency,

1088
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:52,559
I collected messages
from different towns.

1089
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,679
Two of the teams have been captured.

1090
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,679
Neither of them is Si Lili.

1091
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,960
The rest four teams
are still being hunted.

1092
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:00,400
How about Fan Xian?
Is he still after her?

1093
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,960
Fan Xian should not
be able to catch up now.

1094
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:07,800
Does Si Lili keep running
towards the north?

1095
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:09,280
Yeah, all the way north.

1096
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:10,519
She should be heading to Beiqi.

1097
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,079
Fetch the map!

1098
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:13,079
Yes!

1099
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,840
It's always passive
to go from the behind.

1100
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,480
As soon as we can figure out

1101
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:18,800
where Si Lili

1102
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,559
is running to,

1103
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,840
we will be able to find the path

1104
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,079
she has to go through.

1105
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,679
Your Excellency, check this out!

1106
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,159
This is a territory map I drew of

1107
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,960
the mountains and rivers in the world.

1108
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:42,239
It's super clear, isn't it?

1109
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:44,880
I don't understand it at all.

1110
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,039
Your Excellency, first of all,

1111
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:49,880
we need to confirm

1112
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:51,679
if Si Lili

1113
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,639
is from Beiqi.

1114
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:54,360
Her token as a secret agent
is confirmed.

1115
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:55,280
She is from Beiqi.

1116
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:56,079
OK.

1117
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:57,719
So she must go north.

1118
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,760
But there are many ways

1119
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,559
to go north.

1120
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,320
But there are
many military passes as well.

1121
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:03,239
There aren't many ways

1122
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,119
to go to Beiqi

1123
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:06,679
without going through these passes.

1124
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:07,360
Just wait a moment.

1125
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,519
What do these triangles

1126
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,400
stand for?

1127
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:12,239
Mountain ranges. Don't you understand?

1128
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,280
How about these circles?

1129
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,920
Can' you see that they are lakes?!

1130
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,840
And these rectangles?

1131
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,840
Some are big and some are small.

1132
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Big ones are castles.

1133
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:20,280
Small ones are passes.

1134
00:58:20,639 --> 00:58:21,079
Well...

1135
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:22,559
Can't you understand all these signs?

1136
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,960
Wang,

1137
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,159
your drawing

1138
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:26,199
is really extraordinary.

1139
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:29,679
Your Excellency, I feel flattered.

1140
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,639
In this case,

1141
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:35,400
Si Lili must go through this little town

1142
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,840
since she wants to go to Beiqi quickly.

1143
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,760
This town is the only way

1144
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,599
to Beiqi.

1145
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,000
If she chooses any other way,

1146
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,800
it will take far more time.

1147
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,119
I'll arrange

1148
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,719
and gather all the secret agents here.

1149
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:49,960
We'll surely capture Si Lili

1150
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:50,880
and take her back to the capital city.

1151
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,360
Go ahead.

1152
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:52,440
Yes!

1153
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,639
Now that I can detect this,

1154
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,280
so can

1155
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,840
His Excellency Zhu.

1156
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:00,320
I don't think we have time

1157
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,159
to capture Si Lili.

1158
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,199
But the Investigator's Office
has a lot of ears.

1159
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,119
They can capture

1160
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,239
Si Lili for sure.

1161
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,679
No, I must interrogate her in person.

1162
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:09,719
Definitely!

1163
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:11,760
We just need to

1164
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,320
go north slowly

1165
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:16,719
and intercept the team

1166
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,039
that escorts Si Lili back
to the capital city.

1167
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:19,840
When it comes, just take out
your token as Director-General

1168
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,960
and require them
to hand over the suspect.

1169
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:22,440
No one will dare to disobey.

1170
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,000
Your Excellency, what's up?

1171
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:45,239
I'm feeling a bit worried

1172
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:46,400
ever since I came
out of the capital city.

1173
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:47,559
What you said just now

1174
00:59:48,199 --> 00:59:49,519
makes it even worse.

1175
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,199
Did I say anything wrong?

1176
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,400
I'm also wondering

1177
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,159
your drawing is simple

1178
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:56,679
but your words

1179
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,559
are full of wisdom.

1180
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,960
Your Excellency,
let's keep going while talking.

1181
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,960
Wait a minute. Let me think about

1182
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,400
which sentence is it

1183
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,320
that makes me feel not right.

1184
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,760
I got it!

1185
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,360
Si Lili burnt the boat

1186
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:20,559
and rode a horse out of town.

1187
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,719
It must attract the attention

1188
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,079
of the Investigator's Office.

1189
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,159
Even though she arranged six teams,

1190
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:27,199
her rough direction is to the north.

1191
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:30,400
Is there anything wrong with that?

1192
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,199
The description is right,
but the story is not right.

1193
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:33,440
have you ever considered

1194
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:34,840
why Si Lili had to escape?

1195
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,400
She is involved in the assassination
at Niulan Street.

1196
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,760
Of course, she needs to escape
as soon as she can.

1197
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,159
Then why would she burn the boat?

1198
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,679
The boat...

1199
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,360
She wanted to escape. Then escape!

1200
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,039
What's the point of burning the boat?

1201
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,679
Perhaps there were confidential letters

1202
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:51,039
on the boat.

1203
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,280
Then just burn the letters.

1204
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:54,280
Right! It would be enough
to burn the letters.

1205
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,400
Why did she burn the boat?

1206
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,440
Second question.

1207
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,440
Why would she ride a horse out of town

1208
01:00:58,519 --> 01:00:59,239
and arrange six teams?

1209
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:01,280
Certainly, to create confusion.

1210
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,800
What if she disguised herself

1211
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:05,519
and went out of town secretly?

1212
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,599
No one ever suspected her yesterday.

1213
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:11,559
If she leaves secretly,

1214
01:01:12,199 --> 01:01:13,440
it would be far more difficult
to find her.

1215
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:14,960
But she still cut a splash

1216
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:16,800
by burning the boat and taking
a horse which is eye-catching.

1217
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,519
What's that for?

1218
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,880
To let everyone know

1219
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,960
she had left.

1220
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,360
At that time point, everyone's attention

1221
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,320
would be on the north
of the capital city,

1222
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,719
trying to figure out her escaping route.

1223
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,199
If I were her,

1224
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,599
it's the right time

1225
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:34,559
to get disappeared

1226
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:35,280
when everyone's attention is diverted.
