16
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:46,319
Mr. Fan, please.

17
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Mr. Fan,

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,840
His Majesty asks you to wait here.

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,240
OK.

20
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,840
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,719
Your Majesty, I'm waiting outside.

22
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,439
Your Majesty.

23
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,919
Kneel down.

24
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,199
Where should I kneel?

25
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,719
Your Majesty, shall I kneel down?

26
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,080
Do you want to kneel down?

27
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,039
Not really.

28
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,039
You don't have to kneel down
if you don't feel like it.

29
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:28,520
Thanks, Your Majesty.

30
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,240
Your Majesty, I wonder

31
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:32,639
why you ordered to see me today.

32
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,240
Have you seen the assassinator

33
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,680
at the door?

34
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:37,360
Yes, I have.

35
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,520
But I don't know him.

36
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,439
I have nothing to do with him.

37
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,360
Eunuch Hou.

38
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,400
Tell him.

39
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,599
The assassinator was from Beiqi.

40
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,599
The first day he arrived
in the capital city,

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,639
the Investigator's Office
reported his name

42
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,439
to His Majesty.

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,400
He formed the idea of assassination

44
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,280
in last October.

45
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
In the following months,

46
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,680
six people consecutively
beat around the bush

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,680
and strengthened his conviction.

48
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,840
Finally, he made up his mind

49
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,680
to come to the capital city
for assassination.

50
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,079
How can you figure out that?

51
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,000
The six people are
secret agents of Nanqing.

52
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:23,600
Then

53
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,439
who sent them?

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,759
I gave the order.

55
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,680
The Investigator's Office sent them.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,839
So

57
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,360
Your Majesty planned
the assassination yourself.

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,439
I've planned to start the war
against Beiqi for a long time.

59
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,199
There must be a reason.

60
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,959
So the assassinator

61
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,839
is the reason for sending troops.

62
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,959
It's just too obvious.

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,560
However, the assassination
on the Niulan Street just happened.

64
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,720
You killed Cheng Jushu,

65
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,480
and interrogated Si Lili at night.

66
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,480
Beiqi's secret agent lurking
in the capital city,

67
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,639
that is a better reason
to start war against Beiqi.

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,839
By killing the murderer
and capturing the secret agent alive,

69
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,639
you've rendered great service
to the country.

70
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,920
I'll make you the Chief Musician of
the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

71
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,240
Which rank?

72
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,079
The eighth rank.

73
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:05,759
It's not high.

74
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,360
Thank His Majesty for his kindness.

75
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,759
Your Majesty, I should kneel down
to thank you.

76
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,160
But you just allowed me

77
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,160
to stand on my feet.

78
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,800
Since it was said by Your Majesty,

79
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,040
I can't disobey it.

80
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,680
So,

81
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,120
I can't kneel down.

82
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,920
How did

83
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,639
Lin Gong die?

84
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,319
I really don't know.

85
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,079
You have the reason to kill him.

86
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,120
I had no enmity against him.

87
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,319
Why should I kill him?

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,439
Lin Gong planned the assassination
on the Niulan Street.

89
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,399
It was him!

90
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,079
You interrogated Si Lili at night,

91
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,519
but you didn't

92
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,079
even get the name?!

93
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:45,759
She really said nothing,

94
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,160
Your Majesty.

95
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,480
The Crown Prince has known about this.

96
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,199
He demands to see you.

97
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,800
I'm wronged.

98
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,160
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince
requests to see you.

99
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,519
Do you want to see him?

100
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,079
Whatever Your Majesty decides.

101
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,879
Your Highness,

102
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,319
His Majesty is meeting
the Chief Musician.

103
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,079
He won't see you today.

104
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,720
The Chief Musician?

105
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,079
His Majesty just made Fan Xian

106
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,439
the Chief Musician
of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

107
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,199
Thank you, Eunuch Hou.

108
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,399
Your Highness, I'm really flattered.

109
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,439
Your Majesty, I'm leaving.

110
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,800
Your Majesty,

111
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,360
the Crown Prince paid the highest respect
by kowtowing.

112
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,720
He's always respectful.

113
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,240
Mr. Fan!

114
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,800
Your Majesty, you don't want
the Crown Prince to see me?

115
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,240
I don't want to ruin the peace.

116
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,160
When you get out later,

117
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,199
the Crown Prince will ask to see you.

118
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,399
I won't stop him.

119
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,600
You have to deal with him yourself.

120
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,600
Well, Your Majesty,

121
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,279
the Prime Minister also
wanted to see me this morning.

122
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,879
Is he also going to blame me?

123
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,800
The Prime Minister originally

124
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,959
disagreed with your marriage to Wan'er.

125
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,480
Now, he might have changed his mind.

126
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:51,360
Why?

127
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,120
You'll know it

128
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:57,680
when you see him.

129
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,839
Doesn't the Prime Minister suspect that

130
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,639
I'm related to the death
of his second son?

131
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,399
It was a top secret of

132
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,600
the Investigator's Office
to capture Si Lili.

133
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,319
Would the Investigator's Office tell it

134
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,199
to the Crown Prince?

135
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:11,600
No.

136
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,560
Then how did the Crown Prince
get the information?

137
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,600
What do you think?

138
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,639
Can it be that someone
of the Investigator's Office

139
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,639
had pledged allegiance
to the Crown Prince?

140
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,920
Your Majesty, do you want me
to investigate it for you

141
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,839
by telling me this implicitly.

142
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,160
you mean

143
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,160
I'm suspecting my own son?

144
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,240
Your Majesty, he's not only your son,

145
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:31,639
but the Crown Prince.

146
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,039
Escort the Chief Musician out.

147
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes.

148
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,519
Chief Musician, this way, please.

149
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,360
Fan Xian.

150
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,200
Since you entered the imperial palace,

151
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,159
you seemed honest and frank,

152
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,120
but every word you said meant something.

153
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,759
Do you want to impress me

154
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,440
as an outspoken official?

155
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,759
Leave us.

156
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,840
His Majesty is really hard to predict.

157
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,120
To be honest,

158
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,759
I wet my back out of fear

159
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,200
for what His Majesty said last.

160
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,799
Mr. Fan,

161
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,440
I just couldn't stop sweating

162
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
out of fear

163
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,000
since you

164
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,720
started talking.

165
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:54,759
In the future,

166
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:57,559
just mind your words.

167
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:58,360
Yes. Yes. Yes.

168
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,519
I really should. Let's go.

169
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,039
So in your opinion, who is tipping

170
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:05,240
the Crown Prince off
from the Investigator's Office?

171
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,879
Oh my god.

172
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,919
How dare I

173
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:09,960
talk about

174
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,120
the Crown Prince?

175
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,759
Just tell me secretly.

176
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,559
I won't tell others.

177
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,440
Then I might as well kneel down.

178
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,440
-Just now... -Fine. Fine. Fine.

179
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,279
I won't ask.

180
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,360
Just stand up!

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,679
You're scaring me to death.

182
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:51,519
What's up?

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,559
I want to see His Excellency Zhu Ge,
the Director of the First Division.

184
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,360
Tell me your name.

185
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:58,960
Yuan Hongdao.

186
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,240
Wait!

187
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,679
Can I wait inside?

188
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,399
Then I'll have to examine

189
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,600
your personal belongings first.

190
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,679
What are these?

191
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,360
Please tell His Excellency Zhu Ge that

192
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm waiting for him here.

193
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:40,080
Tell me why do you want to

194
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,840
see him first.

195
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,039
If I tell you,

196
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,480
I'm afraid you might lose your life.

197
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,879
You even dare to threaten me!

198
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,960
How dare you!

199
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,399
Don't move!

200
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,399
I won't leave.

201
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,480
Please ask His Excellency Zhu Ge out.

202
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,759
Did you kill Lin Gong?

203
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,840
Not me.

204
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,919
My tracer friend

205
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
and I started off on

206
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,120
the wrong foot.

207
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,200
We wasted so much time that

208
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,440
we didn't even leave the capital city.

209
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,679
You know our family is in charge
of garrisoning the capital city.

210
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,799
It's easy for me to figure out

211
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:46,440
whether you left
the capital city or not.

212
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,279
Go ahead, please.

213
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,559
Luckily, it's not you.

214
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,799
Or I'll also

215
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,399
be responsible

216
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,360
for Wan'er's brother's death.

217
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,639
You don't usually

218
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,679
wear plain clothes.

219
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,679
Where have you been?

220
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,360
The Lin mansion.

221
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,279
I'm checking things out for Wan'er.

222
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
It's a pity that Lin Gong's body

223
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,320
is still kept
in the Investigator's Office.

224
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,279
I hope the Investigator's Office

225
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,559
can find the really killer.

226
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,480
How come it's you?

227
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,120
Your Excellency!

228
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,320
Excuse me, may I help you?

229
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,519
I'm Fan Xian.

230
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,879
Earlier today,

231
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:02,960
the Prime Minister asked to see me.

232
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:16,320
Please wait a moment.

233
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,039
Who are you?

234
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,799
Miss Lili,

235
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,440
it won't take long.

236
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,320
I only need to ask you

237
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,799
one question about Lin Gong.

238
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,919
How was Lin Gong related to me?

239
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,360
No need to cover that up.

240
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,360
Second Young Master Lin Gong planned

241
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,879
the assassination on the Niulan Street.

242
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,639
I've known it all.

243
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,519
Now listen carefully.

244
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,720
My question is

245
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,440
did you tell Fan Xian that

246
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:22,000
Lin Gong is the real killer

247
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,120
during the night interrogation?

248
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,639
Who are you?

249
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,879
Yuan Hongdao, the adviser
of the Prime Minister.

250
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,200
Lin Ruofu sent you to ask me, right?

251
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,720
Please answer me.

252
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,919
No. I didn't tell Fan Xian.

253
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,480
Good.

254
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,320
Next,

255
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,440
I'll test you to see

256
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,440
whether you told the truth or not.

257
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,159
How?

258
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,720
One by one.

259
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,399
At last,

260
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,960
if your answer

261
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,000
remains the same,

262
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,759
then you've told the truth.

263
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,960
Miss Lili, which one
do you want to start from?

264
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,080
I told you the truth.

265
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,840
I didn't tell him about Lin Gong.

266
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,000
I can swear.

267
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,799
Be patient. Be patient.

268
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,639
It will only take a while.

269
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,120
It's a bloodstain left years ago.
It can't be wiped clean.

270
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,600
No.

271
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,960
I really didn't tell him.

272
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,440
No!

273
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,480
No!

274
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,559
This one! This one!

275
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,480
The one below

276
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,120
is Hong.

277
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,960
This one. This one.

278
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,840
This is Fu Ling.

279
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:58,080
There is another one.

280
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,679
Jin Xiu! Jin Xiu!

281
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,720
Stop feeding it.

282
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,840
It eats the most every time.

283
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,200
-Jin Xiu. -I see.

284
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,880
Stop eating.

285
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,720
What's your name?

286
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:15,720
I'm Fan Xian.

287
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:17,759
Fan Xian?

288
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,559
Are you here to see someone?

289
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,279
What's your name?

290
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,480
Dad said,

291
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,039
I should be careful with strangers.

292
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,480
I shouldn't tell them easily that

293
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,000
my name is Dabao.

294
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,640
We've talked

295
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,200
for so long.

296
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,359
I'm no stranger to you.

297
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,440
That makes sense.

298
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,759
Then I'll tell you.

299
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,599
My name is Dabao.

300
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:48,680
What a good name!

301
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,480
Yeah.

302
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,160
My name is good.

303
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,039
But,

304
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,240
Erbao doesn't like it.

305
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,400
He doesn't like it
when I call him Erbao.

306
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,680
Is Erbao your younger brother?

307
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,400
No idea.

308
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,000
How do you know that?

309
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,480
Have you seen him recently?

310
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,359
He hasn't been home all the time.

311
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,400
I miss him.

312
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,799
Does Erbao have another name?

313
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,440
Yes.

314
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,079
He's called Lin Gong.

315
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,880
But, I still feel that

316
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:21,920
Erbao is better.

317
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,680
Right?

318
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,519
Do you know

319
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,359
when he will come home?

320
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,720
I have so many questions to ask him.

321
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,559
What do you want to ask him?

322
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,559
I'll answer them instead.

323
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:45,880
Really?

324
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,279
Really?

325
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,319
I want to ask Erbao.

326
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,640
Jin Xiu...

327
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,160
What do I want to ask him?

328
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,000
I want to...

329
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:52,720
No hurry! No hurry!

330
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,279
Take your time.

331
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:56,680
I want to ask...

332
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,359
I want to ask him...

333
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,720
Miss Lili, please answer me again.

334
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,480
No.

335
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:14,839
I didn't tell Fan Xian

336
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,720
about Lin Gong.

337
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,200
Good.

338
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,519
Let's insert the remaining needles

339
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,880
one by one.

340
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,480
Then we'll add something else.

341
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,039
No!

342
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:34,920
No!

343
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,200
No!

344
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,200
No!

345
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,359
Excuse me.

346
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:46,799
Mr. Yuan?

347
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:49,599
Exactly.

348
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,599
She's a prisoner
of the Investigator's Office.

349
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,759
Didn't His Excellency Zhu Ge

350
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,519
tell you?

351
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,319
I did.

352
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,240
The Prime Minister has obtained

353
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,359
His Majesty's verbal instruction
to ask Si Lili some questions.

354
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,720
Your Excellency, don't you believe me?

355
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,720
I believe you.

356
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:07,000
But according to the verbal instruction,

357
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,720
you're supposed to ask her

358
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,279
instead of torturing her.

359
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,920
You've made a point.

360
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,799
Mr. Yuan, have you finished asking?

361
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:20,279
Sort of.

362
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:23,640
Then, I'll see you out.

363
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,440
Fine.

364
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,480
Mister,

365
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,960
you stuff.

366
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,839
Miss, you can keep it as a souvenir.

367
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,480
Your Excellency.

368
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:38,799
Have you seen Si Lili?

369
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,359
Yes, I've seen her and asked her.

370
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,319
She didn't tell Fan Xian that

371
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:44,599
the Second Young Master

372
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,480
planned the assassination.

373
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,559
Did she tell the truth?

374
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:48,680
I used some tricks,

375
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,240
and she didn't change her words.

376
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,440
In your opinion,

377
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,880
why didn't she tell Fan Xian?

378
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,599
A lot of people are involved.

379
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,359
She might want to

380
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,480
trade the secret for her life.

381
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,680
Moreover, when Fan Xian
interrogated her,

382
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,759
he was not a government official.

383
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
It makes sense that she didn't tell him.

384
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:12,200
If Fan Xian didn't know about this,

385
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,599
then he has no motive to kill Gong'er.

386
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:16,799
Exactly.

387
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,640
Mr. Yuan, please go
to the Eastern Palace

388
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,839
and inform the Crown Prince
of the result.

389
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,000
It's my duty.

390
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:26,960
Moreover,

391
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:28,559
as to Fan Xian,

392
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,599
please send a word

393
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,079
to the Crown Prince for me.

394
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,920
Your Excellency, I'm listening.

395
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,480
Why is the sky blue?

396
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,400
Because the ocean is blue.

397
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,720
Why is the ocean blue?

398
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,880
The sun shines into the ocean,

399
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:50,720
so the ocean becomes blue.

400
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,440
Then tell me.

401
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,599
Why isn't the water

402
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:55,799
in the pond blue?

403
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:57,440
Because the pond water is too shallow.

404
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,440
So it is!

405
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,400
Shallow water doesn't appear to be blue.

406
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,160
Master Yuan, good day.

407
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,440
Dabao, good day.

408
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,680
Mr. Fan, you're really learned.

409
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:09,039
So admirable!

410
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,039
I'm just talking nonsense.

411
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:11,079
Please don't take it seriously.

412
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,160
The Prime Minister is waiting
for you in the study.

413
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,559
Where's the study?

414
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:20,519
I have.

415
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:21,759
I'll take you there. Let's go.

416
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,480
Dad,

417
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:26,920
Dad,

418
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,279
I've brought Fan Xian to you.

419
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,000
Dabao!

420
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,039
play outside for a while.

421
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,799
I need a word with him.

422
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,000
Dad,

423
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:46,799
when will Erbao come home?

424
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Dad, then Dabao will go out.

425
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,480
Dabao had a disease when he was little.

426
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,599
He turned into this
after he was recovered.

427
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,559
Having grown up physically,

428
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,039
he's still a kid mentally.

429
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,799
Wan'er can't go back home all the time,

430
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,920
and she's sick with tuberculosis.

431
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,200
Thanks for your treatment,

432
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,200
she is recovering day by day.

433
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,240
It's what I should do.

434
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,319
The future of the Lin family

435
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,359
lied entirely on

436
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,720
Gong'er before.

437
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,039
Shouldering the responsibility of

438
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:48,839
inheriting the Lin family

439
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,680
since childhood,

440
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,799
he never felt happy,

441
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,079
but he never complained

442
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,000
the hardship or suffering.

443
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:00,599
This was written by him
when he was little.

444
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,759
At that time,

445
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,359
I often told him that

446
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,799
the civil and military officials
of the Six Ministries

447
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,279
are like flocks of birds,

448
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,759
clamoring and quarreling without a stop.

449
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,839
In order to ensure

450
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:20,000
continuous family inheritance,

451
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,640
we must stick to our roots

452
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,839
among the chaotic birds.

453
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,079
All the birds will
go to the forest (Lins).

454
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,400
The Second Young Master wanted to make
a permanent place for the Lin family

455
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,599
in the imperial court.

456
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,720
Though the handwriting is poor,

457
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,079
it shows ambition.

458
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,599
But it sounds arrogant and conceited.

459
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,319
It's common for young people.

460
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,079
These are also written
by him when he was little.

461
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,319
Even his handwriting in childhood

462
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,200
is much better than mine.

463
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,480
Since I became an official,

464
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,279
I've gone through three ups
and three downs.

465
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,279
Even when I was locked in the death row,

466
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,440
I never felt desperate.

467
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,240
Until I heard of his death

468
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,160
last night.

469
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,680
Gong'er is the one who planned
the assassination on Niulan Street.

470
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,640
How could it be him?

471
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,160
Prime Minister, you want to kill me!

472
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:52,880
I don't know

473
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,400
how I offended you!

474
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,480
It seems you really don't know this.

475
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,599
It's not me who wants to kill you.

476
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,480
He kept the whole thing

477
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,799
from me.

478
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,240
Well.

479
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,119
Then why did the Second Young Master

480
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,440
want to kill me?

481
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,039
I didn't know anything about it

482
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,200
until the Crown Prince sent someone

483
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,839
to tell me this morning.

484
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:19,359
Is the Crown Prince...

485
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,880
It doesn't matter anymore.

486
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:25,839
You should marry Wan'er

487
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,359
as soon as possible.

488
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,759
In the future, I'll try my best

489
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,000
to promote you in the officialdom.

490
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,039
The Guo family hates you

491
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:42,559
for beating Guo Baokun.

492
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,680
I'll protect you from them.

493
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,440
It doesn't matter you're not recorded

494
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,319
even if the mission fails

495
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,880
In the future, all the properties

496
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,119
and connections of the Lin family
will be handed over to you.

497
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,240
Your Excellency, I still don't get it.

498
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,519
All these are based on

499
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,759
one condition.

500
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,400
Please tell me.

501
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,240
After I die,

502
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,119
you must protect Wan'er and Dabao,

503
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,039
and protect the Lin family

504
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,680
from political enemies.

505
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,000
Give me your promise,

506
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,559
and the Lin family

507
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:29,200
will be the strongest support for you

508
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,920
in the capital city.

509
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,079
It's not for trade.

510
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,559
You actually refused me!

511
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,920
I didn't refuse you.
It's just not for trade.

512
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,440
Wan'er and I fell
in love at first sight.

513
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,480
After meeting and talking
with her over and over again,

514
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,359
I've already put her in my heart.

515
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:03,240
If I marry her,

516
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:04,559
it's my responsibility

517
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
to love her and protect her.

518
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,799
If I marry her,

519
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,880
I'm related to the Lin family by blood.

520
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,559
It's my duty to protect the Lin family

521
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,039
and take care of Dabao.

522
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,279
If I marry her,

523
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,000
it's because she wants
to marry me for love,

524
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,839
not for a trade.

525
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,599
Your Excellency, I'm willing to do

526
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,319
everything you've said just now,

527
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,519
only because I have her in my heart.

528
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,880
So you met and talked with my daughter

529
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,119
over and over again?

530
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,880
When did you meet?

531
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:55,119
How did you meet?

532
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,519
Your Excellency,

533
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:03,440
that's not

534
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,519
the point.

535
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,720
Prime Minister, what do you mean?

536
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,960
If I keep thinking of him,

537
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,359
how could I focus on supporting you?

538
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,400
Now that it has happened,

539
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:25,559
you have to be careful
of the Crown Prince.

540
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:27,559
Do you think

541
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,279
he wants to kill me?

542
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,799
There are two reasons.

543
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,319
Firstly,

544
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,680
you'll take over Neiku

545
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:38,839
from Li Yunrui.

546
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,799
She is Wan'er's birth mother.

547
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,960
I didn't mean to offend her.

548
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:47,960
Secondly,

549
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,519
you've been supporting the Second Prince

550
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,960
since you came to the capital city.

551
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:56,680
The Crown Prince is
not happy about that.

552
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,160
I just met the Second Prince
a few times.

553
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,240
I'm not his supporter.

554
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,319
You should have avoided seeing him.

555
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,680
The capital city is a dangerous place.

556
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,880
If you didn't choose to support someone,

557
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:09,359
it could

558
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,960
lead to your doom.

559
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,559
What should I do?

560
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,279
From now on,

561
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,759
remain neutral.

562
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:19,960
Try your best

563
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,279
to avoid seeing either of them.

564
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,480
But you just said

565
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:26,640
I should choose to support someone.

566
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,759
Now that you're my son-in-law,

567
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:34,279
you'll be on my side.

568
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,480
But if the Crown Prince
holds a grudge against me,

569
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,759
I'm afraid you'll get into trouble
because of me

570
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,400
when he succeeds to the throne.

571
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,400
I'll try to act as a mediator.

572
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,759
If he keeps treating you as an enemy,

573
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,640
I'll help

574
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,240
someone else

575
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,359
succeed to the throne.

576
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,720
It turns out it's not blue

577
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,160
when there is little water.

578
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,319
But I've never seen the sea.

579
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,880
I can take you to see it in the future.

580
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:31,640
Elder brother, are you done talking?

581
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:34,960
Dabao!

582
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,960
I'm going to marry your younger sister.

583
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,359
So, you'll be my elder brother.

584
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,319
Are you going to marry Wan'er?

585
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:44,920
Yeah.

586
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,400
She's a nice girl.

587
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,400
She's never scolded me.

588
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:47,920
Besides,

589
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,680
she...

590
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,880
She also treats me on cakes.

591
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,319
I'll treat you on cakes too.

592
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,079
Really?

593
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:53,519
Really?

594
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,119
Then,

595
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,960
will you take me to see the sea?

596
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,400
Sure.

597
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,319
We have to

598
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,200
take Wan'er with us.

599
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:58,759
Go!

600
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,200
Master Yuan, good day.

601
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,119
-Go. -Go.

602
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,920
Don't worry.

603
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,720
I'll take Wan'er with me
no matter where I go.

604
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:08,480
That's good.

605
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,240
How about Erbao?

606
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,799
What?

607
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,039
Shall we

608
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:13,160
take Erbao with us?

609
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,200
Dabao,

610
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,319
Erbao

611
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,079
has gone somewhere far far away.

612
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,359
You probably won't see him
for a long time.

613
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,079
Is he dead?

614
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,839
I once raised

615
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,119
kittens

616
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:43,839
and bunnies.

617
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,039
But they were gone later.

618
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,960
I looked,

619
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:50,880
looked,

620
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,799
and looked for them.

621
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,519
But I failed to find them.

622
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,799
A maidservant told me

623
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,119
they're dead.

624
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,559
I asked Wan'er what it means.

625
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,160
She said

626
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:07,960
it means they've gone somewhere
far far away

627
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,639
and I won't see them

628
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,000
for a long, long time.

629
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,239
Someday,

630
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,159
I'll also go there.

631
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,360
Then I'll see them again.

632
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,639
So,

633
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,960
in the future,

634
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,360
I'll go to

635
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,960
that faraway place.

636
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,800
I'll see my kittens,

637
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,320
my bunnies

638
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,400
and Erbao.

639
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:54,519
When I see them again,

640
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,400
I...

641
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,559
I'll tell them

642
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,920
it has been a long time

643
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,559
and I miss them.

644
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:05,960
Okay.

645
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:08,239
You can say that.

646
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,599
Wan'er also likes to

647
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:12,760
touch my head like this.

648
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,400
It's comfortable.

649
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,239
Elder brother,

650
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,239
the two of you are quite alike.

651
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:19,840
Dabao,

652
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,800
I told you you'll be my elder brother.

653
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:22,679
Listen to me.

654
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
Don't call me like that again.

655
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,360
Are you younger than me?

656
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,119
Yeah. I'm younger than you.

657
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,320
Call me Fan Xian.

658
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,440
Your...

659
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:34,599
Can I call you Xianxian?

660
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,079
Dabao,

661
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,000
this name

662
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,639
sounds weird.

663
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:45,320
Xianxian.

664
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,480
Don't call me like that.

665
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:47,679
-Xianxian. -Stop calling me like that.

666
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,480
Xianxian! Xianxian! Xianxian!

667
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:52,320
I've told the Crown Prince about it.

668
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:54,840
He didn't say anything.

669
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,599
It's okay as long as he knew it.

670
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,000
Your Excellency.

671
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,039
Are you sure

672
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,920
you'll entrust the future
of your daughter and your clan

673
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,800
to Fan Xian?

674
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,679
I saw

675
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:13,639
Fan Xian play with Dabao.

676
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:15,119
So did I.

677
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:16,920
Actually,

678
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,000
even the servants in my mansion

679
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,199
will laugh at Dabao

680
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,840
behind my back

681
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,920
when they see him.

682
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:28,599
I know most of them

683
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:30,119
look down upon him

684
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,119
and are impatient with talking to him.

685
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,960
But Fan Xian smiled

686
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,440
from the bottom of his heart

687
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,320
when he stayed with Dabao.

688
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:42,719
Indeed.

689
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,960
It seems Fan Xian treats Dabao

690
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,840
as his friend.

691
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:50,519
In that very moment,

692
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,920
I decided to

693
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,679
rely on him

694
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,840
for our future

695
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,199
if he has nothing to do

696
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,559
with Gong'er's death.

697
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,000
Alright. Let's say goodbye here.

698
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,280
Go back. I'll come some other day.

699
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,800
You were not called in by my dad.

700
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:22,800
What?

701
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:27,760
Those who are called in by my dad

702
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,679
don't like to play with me.

703
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,360
They only smile at me

704
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,960
when dad is around.

705
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,559
They ignore me

706
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,119
if dad is not around.

707
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,760
Did you tell your dad

708
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:39,920
about it?

709
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,360
No.

710
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,599
You can't!

711
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,559
I'm telling you.

712
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,559
You can't tell my dad.

713
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
If you do,

714
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:49,039
he'll scold them

715
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,079
and they'll feel depressed.

716
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,920
Dabao!

717
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,559
do you know how long

718
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:57,199
I've been in the capital city?

719
00:37:59,039 --> 00:37:59,639
I've no idea.

720
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:02,199
Since I came here from Danzhou,

721
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,960
I've met many people and

722
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,320
many things have happened.

723
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:07,519
But in my opinion,

724
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,639
you're more lovely

725
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,320
than most of them.

726
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,239
Danzhou?

727
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,079
Do you mean I'm a good guy?

728
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,239
Yes,

729
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,199
you're.

730
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,679
Xianxian, remember

731
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:21,039
to often come play with me.

732
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,000
I told you not to call...

733
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:23,559
Okay.

734
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,079
I promise.

735
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,039
Then, go home.

736
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,800
If you don't,

737
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:30,519
your dad will also scold you.

738
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,360
I'm leaving.

739
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,119
Remember.

740
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:35,239
Don't pick up food

741
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:36,480
that's thrown away by others.

742
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,119
Alright!

743
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,519
Don't jump in puddles.

744
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,360
Don't grab others' candy.

745
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,079
Alright!

746
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,000
And,

747
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:43,239
remember

748
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,920
to put on clothes before you go out.

749
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,079
Alright!

750
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,400
Remember

751
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,719
to use chopsticks when you have a meal.

752
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:49,880
Don't eat with your hands.

753
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,320
Alright!

754
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,400
Your Excellency.

755
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,199
Why is it you again?

756
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:03,039
No idea.

757
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,719
Are you expecting someone else?

758
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,960
The Crown Prince left.

759
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,280
He might have gone to the bathroom.

760
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,519
Please don't crack a joke.

761
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,519
He didn't go to the bathroom.

762
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,320
He left the Eastern Palace.

763
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,239
I see. It's a serious matter.

764
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:15,360
Where is he going?

765
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,599
I also don't know

766
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,239
Why does he want to go there?

767
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,000
he's going to see Si Lili.

768
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:35,519
He wants to save Si Lili.

769
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,840
he'd swear in the name of his identity
as the Crown Prince

770
00:39:38,039 --> 00:39:39,679
he'd get Si Lili out of the dungeon

771
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,559
and keep her safe

772
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:42,480
if she tells the truth.

773
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,119
Let's go to the Investigator's Office.

774
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,000
Your Excellency, don't panic so much.

775
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,760
Maybe Miss Si Lili

776
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,480
is still passionately devoted to you

777
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,559
and refuses to say anything.

778
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,480
Si Lili wouldn't

779
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,400
tell the truth

780
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,440
just for one reason,

781
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:57,920
that is, she knows that

782
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,000
the Investigator's Office
thinks highly of me.

783
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,239
So, she wouldn't tell the truth

784
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,239
as long as she's imprisoned

785
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:02,239
in the Investigator's Office.

786
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,280
If she knows the Crown Prince
would save her...

787
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,920
She'll sell me down the river.

788
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,320
If Si Lili tells the truth,

789
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,119
the Crown Prince, the Prime Minister

790
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,280
and even His Majesty

791
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:13,800
would think

792
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,920
it's me that killed Lin Gong.

793
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:25,239
It's too late.

794
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,280
Your Excellency, you have to find a way

795
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,079
to stop the Crown Prince.

796
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,159
If I stand out at this moment,

797
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,079
it means I admit I did everything.

798
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:39,960
I have an idea.

799
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:41,840
I'll try to delay the Crown Prince

800
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,920
and you go to the dungeon

801
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,880
and kill Si Lili.

802
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I promised not to kill her.

803
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,000
It's urgent.

804
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,960
You'll die if she's alive.

805
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:54,480
But it's of no use to kill her.

806
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,960
If Si Lili is killed at this moment,

807
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,360
it just proves I want to do
away with a witness.

808
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,639
So, what can we do to solve the dilemma?

809
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,320
I just hope

810
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,440
someone can stop him

811
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:03,599
from entering the Investigator's Office,

812
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,440
or I'll come to the end
of a blind alley.

813
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,480
But the Crown Prince is so powerful.

814
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:10,440
Wait. There is still hope.

815
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,360
His Majesty once said

816
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,039
Their Highnesses shall not meddle

817
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:17,559
in the Investigator's Office's affairs.

818
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,400
Besides,

819
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,320
the directors of divisions

820
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,320
wouldn't let him in.

821
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,159
I hope so.

822
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:51,719
Line up!

823
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,960
Mr. Zhu, please step aside.

824
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,559
Your Highness, His Majesty said

825
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:07,920
princes can't come inside.

826
00:42:10,039 --> 00:42:11,000
Do you want to stop me?

827
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,039
I dare not to.

828
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:17,199
It's His Majesty's order.
I hardly dare disobey it.

829
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:18,079
Okay.

830
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,159
From now on,

831
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,400
I'll start to go inside.

832
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:22,920
And I won't stop

833
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:24,159
unless

834
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:24,840
you take actions.

835
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,559
Your Highness.

836
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:29,119
If you insist on doing it,

837
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,280
His Majesty will fly into a rage.

838
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:32,480
Do you dare to take actions?

839
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:48,920
The Investigator's Office
is of great importance.

840
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,320
It's the lifeblood
of the imperial court.

841
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,000
Your Highness, if you
step forward again,

842
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,639
I'll draw my sword.

843
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,159
I just dare not
disobey His Majesty's order.

844
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,400
I'll have no other choice

845
00:42:58,079 --> 00:42:59,320
but to knock you out

846
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,639
and then take you to His Majesty.

847
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,119
I understand.

848
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:05,039
Do you think you can

849
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,239
stop my picked guards

850
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:07,760
by yourself alone?

851
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:18,840
Draw your swords!

852
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,159
Your Highness,

853
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:27,840
here is the capital city.

854
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:29,639
How will you explain it to His Majesty?

855
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,880
Lin Gong is my good friend.

856
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,000
For both private and public reasons,

857
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,599
I'll find out the truth.

858
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,599
The Investigator's Office will do it.

859
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,679
I don't trust you.

860
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,559
Step aside!

861
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,239
The Crown Prince is so tough.

862
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,199
I'm dead.

863
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:46,960
His Excellency Yan
and His Excellency Zhu.

864
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:47,599
are trying to stop him.

865
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,519
They couldn't do it.

866
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,000
I've underestimated the Crown Prince.

867
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,519
What's done is done.

868
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,559
all our plans in the capital city
will come to nothing.

869
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,519
Wang Qinian,

870
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,320
I'll find a way

871
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:57,920
When I fled from the capital city,

872
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:58,760
You just pretend

873
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,719
you know nothing about it.

874
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,039
They won't make things
difficult for you.

875
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,199
Your Excellency.

876
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,760
Farewell, Wang Qinian.

877
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,000
Your Excellency.

878
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:11,119
-Step aside! -Listen.

879
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,360
What's the noise?

880
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,039
Go!

881
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,800
Black knights?

882
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:17,639
-Head. -Head.

883
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,039
What's up?

884
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,280
I've got a cold.

885
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:27,159
I'll send for an imperial physician.

886
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,679
Don't bother.

887
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,039
What happened to his legs?

888
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,360
That very year,

889
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,960
Head Chen travelled hundreds of miles

890
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:57,519
the black knights on a long-range raid

891
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
and defeated Xiao En,

892
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,199
the No.1 villain of Beiqi.

893
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:01,440
However, he was injured
during that battle

894
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,159
and couldn't walk since then.

895
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,320
Your Highness, please go back.

896
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,000
Go away!

897
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,039
Chen Pingping, you're so powerful.

898
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:20,559
Someone said

899
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,719
you're only second to one person
in the capital city.

900
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,039
Your Highness, you misheard it.

901
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,880
I've heard black knights

902
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:36,800
are good at fighting
and have killed numerous people.

903
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:41,559
Do they dare to kill a Crown Prince?

904
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,440
Or will you do it yourself?

905
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,480
Attacking a Crown Prince

906
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,119
is not something
a loyal subject should do.

907
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:53,599
Then you couldn't stop me.

908
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,000
Go away!

909
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:00,159
Go away!

910
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,400
Go away!

911
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,760
He's so tough.

912
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:07,119
What are you doing?

913
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:09,400
Go away!

914
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:10,639
Go away!

915
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,599
Protect His Highness.

916
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:25,679
Get out of the way!

917
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,320
Chen Pingping,

918
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:28,159
Let go of me.

919
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:30,559
Chen Pingping!

920
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,840
Chen Pingping!

921
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:36,800
Protecting Crown Prince

922
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,000
against assassinations

923
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,239
is what a loyal subject should do.

924
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:02,760
Master Shadow.

925
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,239
Head wants to see you.

926
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,679
I've been thinking about

927
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:21,320
why black knights showed up at that time

928
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,079
when I chased Si Lili out of town.

929
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,360
How did they know

930
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,159
about my whereabouts?

931
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:27,280
Seeing you throw a dagger,

932
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,760
I finally understand.

933
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,559
It's true that Head asked me

934
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:36,800
to stay and serve you.

935
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,480
It's also you that sent secret messages

936
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,519
to black knights, right?

937
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:42,599
He

938
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,199
and I

939
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,880
are closest

940
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,400
to Head.

941
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,079
Leave us.

942
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,360
I'll tell him everything.

943
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:51,679
Got it.

944
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,519
You prove yourself to be Head
of the Investigator's Office.

945
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,000
Nobody else could be

946
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,000
more scheming and calculating than you.

947
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,239
Push me in.

948
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,280
Why are you looking at me?
Anything on my face?

949
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,000
Come closer.

950
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,440
You have her eyes.

951
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,400
At that time, she just stood there.

952
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,920
I asked her

953
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,519
what flowers she wanted to plant

954
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,159
when the Investigator's Office
was just set up.

955
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,400
I'd find them no matter
how precious they are

956
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,239
as long as she told me.

957
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:39,719
She scattered those wildflower seeds

958
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,679
she got by the roadside

959
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,719
by the wall randomly.

960
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:45,239
She said,

961
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:47,119
"No need to take care of them.

962
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,880
Life can find its way

963
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:53,079
to thrive."

964
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,639
Who's that "she" you just mentioned?

965
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:03,239
Ye Qingmei.

966
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:04,840
Your mother.

967
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,599
Who's Ye Qingmei?

968
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,119
Wuzhu is in the capital city?

969
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,639
Who is Wuzhu?

970
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,519
He killed Lin Gong.

971
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,800
The truth hasn't been found out

972
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,679
about Lin Gong's death.

973
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:22,400
If you don't believe me,

974
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:26,159
It's alright.

975
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,760
I'll take care of the rest
about Lin Gong's issue.

976
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:46,719
Your Highness.

977
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,360
I want to see His Majesty.

978
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:48,920
Your Highness, what's the matter?

979
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,320
Your Majesty.

980
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:02,599
His Highness wants to see you.

981
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,000
He said

982
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,840
he guessed

983
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:08,840
the real murderer

984
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:10,320
who killed Lin Gong.

985
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:11,880
Who does he think it is?

986
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:13,280
I

987
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,679
hardly dare say.

988
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,639
I'm not asking for your opinion.

989
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:20,599
Just repeat his words.

990
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,800
His Highness said

991
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:26,639
it's probably

992
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,079
the Second Prince.

993
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,880
Your Excellency Wang,
why are you sitting here?

994
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:52,840
Your Excellency,

995
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:54,639
please don't call me like that.

996
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:56,519
You're a trusted follower of Head.

997
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,199
You're closest to him.

998
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:00,000
I'll have to rely on you

999
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,079
in the Investigator's Office.

1000
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,559
Your Excellency, please don't say that.

1001
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,679
Actually,

1002
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:06,719
we just made a deal.

1003
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:08,800
What is it?

1004
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,039
Your Excellency.

1005
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,199
Your Excellency.

1006
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,760
Your Excellency.

1007
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:16,960
Actually,

1008
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,119
I planned to quit
the Investigator's Office,

1009
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:23,039
but Head Chen

1010
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,320
offered me something

1011
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:26,360
and asked me to stay and serve you

1012
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:27,880
before he came back to the capital city.

1013
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:29,480
At first,

1014
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,679
I didn't plan to accept it.

1015
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,519
But since I met you
at the gate of the capital city,

1016
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,400
I began to think about it.

1017
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:37,920
Later on,

1018
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:39,639
I watched you for several days.

1019
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,079
I found

1020
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,079
you're not only handsome and brave,

1021
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,920
but also noble-minded.

1022
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,320
I admire you so much

1023
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:49,320
that I decided to

1024
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,800
stay here

1025
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:52,719
and serve you.

1026
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:53,559
To be honest,

1027
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:57,519
You're generous with your money.

1028
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:58,920
That's why I admire you.

1029
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,639
Why did you want to quit?

1030
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,159
Over the years,

1031
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:12,840
the Investigator's Office has done a lot

1032
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:14,760
and readjusted
the administration of officials.

1033
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:17,400
I'd have a bright future

1034
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,480
if I stay here.

1035
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:20,360
But I don't think

1036
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,559
I still have

1037
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,880
the ambition.

1038
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,920
I don't want to be promoted again.

1039
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:28,760
Speaking of it, maybe
I'm too soft-hearted

1040
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,559
to bear the sight of

1041
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,920
those harsh punishments.

1042
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:34,599
Is it by Chen Pingping's order?

1043
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,360
Of course not.

1044
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,880
Head once said

1045
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,119
such torture can be used

1046
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:41,960
to deal with enemies,

1047
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,119
but should never be used on one of us.

1048
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:46,000
Nobody would listen to him?

1049
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,639
Your Excellency may not know that

1050
00:54:50,679 --> 00:54:51,400
Nowadays,

1051
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:53,639
there are more and more people

1052
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,119
who're willing to die for Nanqing.

1053
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:57,920
They're so loyal

1054
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,480
that they can't tolerate

1055
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,880
a little mistake.

1056
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:02,719
Then they've become

1057
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,119
more and more ruthless.

1058
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:05,920
Even Head

1059
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:07,599
can dare not criticize such loyalty.

1060
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,719
I'm lazy by nature.

1061
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,360
I failed to change with the times.

1062
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,000
I failed to keep pace with them.

1063
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:16,239
So,

1064
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,599
I wanted to quit.

1065
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,599
Where are you

1066
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,320
going in the future?

1067
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,039
Where could I go?

1068
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:23,840
Of course

1069
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,360
I'll keep serving you.

1070
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,480
I see. I see.

1071
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,800
I did lie to you.

1072
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,599
I'll do something to show my apology.

1073
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,800
What are you going to do?

1074
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,639
Hold on.

1075
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,280
What are you doing?

1076
00:55:59,440 --> 00:55:59,960
Your Excellency.

1077
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:01,920
I'll treat you to tasty food.

1078
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:03,199
It's on me.

1079
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,840
Let's go enjoy ourselves.

1080
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:15,119
Your Excellency.

1081
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:16,639
Here you are.

1082
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:17,800
Come here.

1083
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:20,079
It looks small in size,

1084
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,199
but the taste is very special.

1085
00:56:23,639 --> 00:56:25,199
Enjoy it. I've paid for it.

1086
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,880
The two bowls of noodles look different.

1087
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:29,280
You're right.

1088
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:30,280
The essence of the noodles

1089
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,400
lies in the soup.

1090
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:35,719
You'll know its original taste
and flavor like this.

1091
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,480
All the extra toppings

1092
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:38,679
have been omitted.

1093
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,599
They're omitted.

1094
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:40,480
Come on.

1095
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,360
Eat while they're hot.

1096
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:43,840
These toppings are unnecessary.

1097
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:46,159
Unnecessary.

1098
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:02,840
How do you like it, Your Excellency?

1099
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:04,840
Not bad.

1100
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,280
So, you've forgiven me, right?

1101
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,400
I need to think about it.

1102
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:12,519
Let me get you more soup.

1103
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:12,960
Okay?

1104
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:14,000
That's enough.

1105
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:15,880
Young Master.

1106
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,400
Why are you still here eating?

1107
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:19,400
Why are you here?

1108
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,719
I just listened to stories
in the tea house.

1109
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,719
Why did you go there?

1110
00:57:24,679 --> 00:57:25,599
Our bookstore

1111
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:26,760
is going to open.

1112
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,400
Why are you so neglectful?

1113
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,639
We should spend more time

1114
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:30,400
collecting relevant information.

1115
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,199
I just heard a new story.

1116
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:34,719
Chen Pingping,

1117
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,480
Travelled Hundreds of Miles
to Beiqi Alone.

1118
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:39,000
It's amazing.

1119
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,679
If you write a book about it,

1120
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:41,480
it'll definitely sell well.

1121
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:42,840
Chen Pingping,

1122
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:44,239
Travelled hundreds of miles?

1123
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:45,079
Alone.

1124
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,000
Eunuch Hou.

1125
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:57,719
Mr. Fan.

1126
00:57:58,199 --> 00:57:59,760
His Majesty wants
to see you. It's urgent.

1127
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,800
I'm not done with the noodles.

1128
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,440
There is no time for delay.

1129
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,079
They're all waiting for you.

1130
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,039
Eunuch Hou, how did you know
I was there?

1131
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,840
You were not at home,

1132
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,639
so I went to the Investigator's Office.

1133
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:15,079
Head Chen told me you were there.

1134
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:17,480
Chen Pingping,

1135
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:19,639
The Investigator's Office

1136
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:21,320
can find anyone

1137
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,239
in the capital city easily.

1138
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:25,159
He found me so quickly.

1139
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,760
He must have sent someone
to tail after me.

1140
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:28,519
Mr. Fan,

1141
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,400
what Head Chen wants to do

1142
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:32,559
is not something we should think about.

1143
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:39,159
Young Master,

1144
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,199
your brother said

1145
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,679
he'd treat me on noodles,

1146
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,920
but he left

1147
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,800
before he paid.

1148
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,320
Can you give the money to me?

1149
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:48,519
I'll pay for it.

1150
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,320
How much?

1151
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:55,320
Three taels of silver.

1152
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:56,400
Three taels?

1153
00:58:56,679 --> 00:58:57,320
Yeah. It's cheap.

1154
00:58:58,360 --> 00:58:59,079
For the two bowls of noodles?

1155
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:02,480
Even without meat.

1156
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,480
It's profitable.

1157
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,599
More profitable
than opening a bookstore.

1158
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:07,480
How about this?

1159
00:59:07,639 --> 00:59:08,239
I'll buy the store

1160
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:09,239
tomorrow.

1161
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,960
The money you paid today
will be considered your shares.

1162
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,400
Great! I'll make a fortune.

1163
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,320
He wouldn't even pay a cent.

1164
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:28,960
Mr. Fan, hold on please.

1165
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,480
Let me tell His Majesty about it.

1166
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:43,039
Prime Minister.

1167
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,920
I saw you from the distance.

1168
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,960
You have nothing to lose
by calling me uncle.

1169
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:52,320
Uncle, you're also here.

1170
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,800
His Majesty said

1171
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,360
it's something about Gong'er's death.

1172
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:58,199
It's a serious issue.

1173
00:59:58,559 --> 00:59:59,519
Shall we talk about it
just in the Imperial Study?

1174
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,159
With His Majesty there,

1175
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,360
there will be no room for maneuver.

1176
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:12,679
Prime Minister. Mr. Fan.

1177
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:13,679
Please!

1178
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:18,880
Don't be afraid.

1179
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:20,320
Follow me.

1180
01:00:51,239 --> 01:00:51,760
Your Majesty.

1181
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:54,000
Prime Minister and Mr. Fan are here.

1182
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,440
Let them in.

1183
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:03,599
Your Majesty.

1184
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:09,039
They're here.

1185
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,000
You can make things clear

1186
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:12,039
in their presence.

1187
01:01:15,559 --> 01:01:16,400
Prepare a seat and some tea

1188
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,679
for Prime Minister.

1189
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:20,599
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1190
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:27,440
