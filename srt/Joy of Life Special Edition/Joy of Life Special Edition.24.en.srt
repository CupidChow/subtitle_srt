16
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,599
What's this?

17
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,079
The names of

18
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,560
all my trusted subordinates

19
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,640
in the army are on it.

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,560
From generals who lead the army

21
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,000
to military officers of
different battalions,

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,000
no one is left.

23
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,599
As one man, it's impossible

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,199
to control the entire army on my own.

25
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,879
These generals and military officers

26
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,199
form the foundation for me

27
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:24,879
to command the army as I wish.

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,000
You actually hand over
the foundation you've laid

29
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,639
for commanding the army over the years?

30
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,520
Otherwise,

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,240
how can I show my allegiance
to Your Majesty?

32
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,319
Your Majesty, congratulations!

33
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,879
Now with the loyalty of a brave general,

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,960
the turbulent situations
can be settled. It's so...

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,159
So what?

36
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:55,759
So good!

37
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,800
It's not right.

38
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,639
How is Beiqi turbulent?

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Your Majesty, whatever you say.

40
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,919
Shangshan Hu.

41
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,680
Yes.

42
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,120
I've seen

43
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,800
your sincerity.

44
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,479
Since you want to take my side,
do you want anything in return?

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,960
Shen Zhong killed my adoptive father
with schemes.

46
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,599
Your Majesty,
please avenge his death for me.

47
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,439
Xiao En?

48
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,520
Wasn't he taken away

49
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,639
and burnt to death?

50
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,639
How could Shen Zhong kill him?

51
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,560
I'm so sorry.

52
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,800
My adoptive father was saved

53
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,800
by my guards.

54
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,520
Aren't you afraid I might punish you?

55
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:38,879
I'm willing to take punishments.

56
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,000
Go ahead.

57
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,719
I planned to replace my adoptive father

58
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,879
and help him escape,

59
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,919
but Shen Zhong was prepared in advance.

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,039
He asked He Daoren

61
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,240
and Langtao to join hands

62
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,039
in killing my adoptive father.

63
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,560
Your Majesty,

64
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,000
Shen Zhong and I
are absolutely irreconcilable.

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,280
That's not what Shen Zhong said.

66
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,280
We'll know the truth

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
by asking He Daoren

68
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,560
and Langtao.

69
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,000
Mr. He.

70
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,720
Mr. He, where are you going?

71
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,079
Her Majesty wants to see me.

72
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,920
Good, I also want to see Her Majesty.

73
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,680
Let's go together.

74
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,199
Your Excellency Shen, please.

75
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,680
Please!

76
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,759
Your Majesty, He Daoren is here.

77
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,079
Commander Shen is...

78
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,040
Your Majesty.

79
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,959
Rise.

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
Your Majesty,
you're really wise and farsighted.

81
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,680
By inviting His Excellency Shen
to confront face-to-face,

82
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,800
no loyal minister will be wronged.

83
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:14,920
Your Excellency Fan,

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,439
are you playing now?

85
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,480
Your Excellency Shen, don't you know?

86
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,399
As you really summoned by Her Majesty?

87
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,240
Sorry! Sorry!

88
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,160
I saw His Excellency Shen come straight

89
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,279
to the Hall without reporting.

90
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,160
So I guessed wrong. Sorry.

91
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,399
Your Majesty,

92
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,920
Fan Xian is cunning.

93
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,680
I'm too worried about you

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,879
to wait for reporting.

95
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,399
Please forgive me.

96
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,600
You're the most trustworthy minister
of Beiqi

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,680
with ardent loyalty.

98
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,319
Why should I blame you?

99
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,120
It's not so easy

100
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,800
to pit me against you.

101
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,399
Your Majesty,
I'm wronged. I didn't do that.

102
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,360
Mr. He.

103
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,319
Your Majesty,

104
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,120
please call me by my name.

105
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,680
According to Shangshan Hu,

106
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,000
you and Langtao

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,759
were ordered by His Excellency Shen

108
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,360
to kill Xiao En?

109
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,040
Is it true?

110
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,920
No matter what the truth is,

111
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,480
I won't blame

112
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,600
Commander Shen.

113
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,800
Feel relieved to tell the truth.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,959
Her Majesty is asking you.
Why are you hesitating?

115
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,800
I did receive order

116
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,519
from His Excellency Shen
to kill Xiao En.

117
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,480
Commander Shen,

118
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,920
I remember telling you

119
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,120
to spare Xiao En's life.

120
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,879
I acknowledge my sin.

121
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,759
Now thinking back,

122
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,560
I didn't think it through.

123
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,639
Commander Shen, by imprisoning Xiao En,

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,160
you became his enemy.

125
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,399
Of course you would worry that

126
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,680
you might be in danger
if Xiao En was alive.

127
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,600
You killed him

128
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,879
to protect yourself.

129
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,759
Your Majesty,
I'm willing to take punishments.

130
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,279
I know you're loyal.

131
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:24,720
Rise.

132
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:29,480
Well,

133
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,680
do I have to issue an imperial edict

134
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,839
to make you stand up?

135
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,079
Grand General,

136
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:40,319
Yes.

137
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,879
I know you love Xiao En

138
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,120
deeply as a son,

139
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,519
and I know you have a grudge

140
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,800
against Shen Zhong.

141
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,560
But now Beiqi faces domestic strife

142
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,160
and foreign aggression.

143
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,560
For the sake of our country,

144
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,160
I hope you can

145
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,079
let go of resentment

146
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,439
and make concerted efforts
to defend Shangjing and our country.

147
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,560
I'm willing to defend my country.

148
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:23,959
Good!

149
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,240
Rise.

150
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,199
Commander Shen.

151
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,039
Yes.

152
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,480
The Grand General
has let go of resentment

153
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,919
and offered service
to the imperial court.

154
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,159
It's a blessing to Beiqi,

155
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,279
and a blessing from our ancestors.

156
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,240
I'm really happy.

157
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,000
Fan Xian, as to you,

158
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,360
you've rendered great service
by persuading the Grand General.

159
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,320
You've really given thoughts

160
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,440
to my gift.

161
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,480
I owe you for that.

162
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,799
I'm so flattered.

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,639
Your Excellency,

164
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,720
I am the one
who persuaded the Grand General.

165
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,039
From today on,

166
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,480
you two are colleagues.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,159
Try to be good buddies.

168
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,159
Your Majesty,

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
I have another birthday gift for you.

170
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,440
What is it?

171
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,399
It's Neiku's branch in Shangjing Town,

172
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,840
which belongs to
the imperial family of Nanqing.

173
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,440
I know that.

174
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,720
Please let me explain.

175
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,559
When I return to Nanqing,

176
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,919
I'll take over

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,320
the financial power of Neiku.

178
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,080
Marrying the princess
and taking over the financial power,

179
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,720
I've heard of that long ago.

180
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,159
Nothing in the world

181
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,120
can escape Your Majesty's eyes.

182
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,879
How is it relevant to my birthday gift?

183
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,919
When Li Yunrui was in charge of Neiku,

184
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,960
she smuggled goods with Beiqi secretly
to gain profits.

185
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,639
Now,

186
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,080
since I'm going to take over Neiku,

187
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
it's a pity to hand in

188
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,080
such a large sum of money.

189
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,720
In my opinion,

190
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,799
we can keep doing

191
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,159
the business.

192
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll take over the business.

193
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,639
Your Majesty, I beg your approval.

194
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,039
As to the profit,

195
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,320
I'll give 30% to
the imperial family of Beiqi.

196
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,440
Take it

197
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,039
as my gift

198
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,080
for your birthday.

199
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,639
What profit from smuggling?

200
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,240
Well, Your Majesty,

201
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,639
don't you know?

202
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,759
Our Nanqing Neiku's branch

203
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,720
has been cooperating with
His Excellency Shen to gain profits.

204
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,240
It's a lot of money.

205
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,159
Your Excellency Shen,

206
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,360
haven't you told Her Majesty yet?

207
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,960
Commander Shen.

208
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,600
Your Majesty,

209
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,840
the accounts of Neiku's branch

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,440
were falsified,

211
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,679
but the money

212
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,679
had flowed into Nanqing.

213
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,399
The Embroidered Uniform Guards
didn't gain profits from that.

214
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,000
Really?

215
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,200
I can assure that with my life.

216
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,919
Your Majesty, please investigate the secret files of
the Embroidered Uniform Guards thoroughly.

217
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,440
I've never made profits from it.

218
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,720
No need to investigate.

219
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:36,879
Of course I trust you.

220
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,919
It turns out Your Excellency Shen
is so warm-hearted

221
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,759
as to help others make money.

222
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,320
Doing good deeds
and accumulating virtues this way,

223
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,399
you're really admirable.

224
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,519
Your Majesty,

225
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:47,919
the smuggling is related to

226
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,919
high-rank officials of Nanqing.

227
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,360
I thought by conniving at it,

228
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,120
we've sowed the seeds of

229
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,840
Nanqing's turbulence in future.

230
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,320
So I offered my help

231
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,679
to make it happen.

232
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,480
I see.

233
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,360
It's just a small accident. It's fine.

234
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,440
When I take over Neiku,

235
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,440
we can keep doing the business.

236
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,480
Your Majesty,

237
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,879
you can still gain profits from it.

238
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,279
As a Nanqing minister,

239
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,840
why smuggle goods with Beiqi?

240
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,080
It's such a large sum of money.

241
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,120
Even if I hand it in,

242
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,519
it'll do me no good.

243
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,879
Why not gain profits together?

244
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:27,679
I'm a bit greedy. Sorry.

245
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,639
Pay more attention to that.

246
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,240
Arrange it properly

247
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,039
before you leave.

248
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,600
I need another favor.

249
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,799
Go ahead.

250
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,480
Please ask His Excellency Shen
to tell me

251
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,919
the name of the smuggler

252
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,000
in the imperial court of Nanqing.

253
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,440
No way!

254
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Your Excellency,

255
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,159
by taking over Neiku
after returning to Nanqing,

256
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,600
I pretty much cut off
his source of income.

257
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,000
He certainly hates me to the core.

258
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,639
Your Excellency Shen, tell me his name

259
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:58,039
so I can protect myself.

260
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,639
Then our business can last long.

261
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,120
Your Majesty,

262
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,679
the smuggler is of great importance.

263
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,759
If he rises in rebellion someday,
Nanqing will be a mess for sure.

264
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,840
By then,

265
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,320
It'll be a good opportunity for us.

266
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
We can't give him away now!

267
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,840
Don't worry.

268
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,240
I'm not a silly old fool.

269
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,440
Shen Zhong has made it clear.

270
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,200
The smuggler

271
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,600
in the imperial court of Nanqing

272
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:24,039
has nothing to do with Beiqi.

273
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,440
No need to ask him anymore.

274
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,600
I see.

275
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,559
Now that everything has settled,

276
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,720
I'll leave first.

277
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,360
Your Excellency Fan,

278
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm confused about one thing.

279
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,960
May I ask you?

280
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,519
Your Excellency Shen, please go ahead.

281
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,480
Your Excellency Fan, you're so
outstanding in literary accomplishments

282
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,240
that you're respected as poetic genius
from heaven in Nanqing.

283
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,200
I'm so flattered.

284
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,559
Nanqing boasts strong military forces
but is poor in literary achievements.

285
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,639
Talented as you are,

286
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:56,919
you're bound to have

287
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,639
a great future in Nanqing.

288
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,320
Thank you for your blessings.

289
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,759
In that sense,

290
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,799
you'll become a nobleman
or a minister in the near future.

291
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,960
So I just don't get it.

292
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,000
By smuggling goods
from the Neiku of Nanqing,

293
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,360
you can obtain a lot of money.

294
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,000
But money can't buy you

295
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:17,080
a bright future like that.

296
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:20,840
By doing so,

297
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,799
you're handing your life

298
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,799
over to Beiqi.

299
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,919
Your Excellency Fan,

300
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,320
are you really so shortsighted

301
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,440
as to value money over life?

302
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,480
Your Majesty,

303
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:38,200
this is what confuses me.

304
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:41,679
Fan Xian.

305
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,279
Yes.

306
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,279
Are you going
to forsake darkness for light

307
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,960
and join us in Beiqi?

308
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,960
Your Majesty, that's not my plan.

309
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,440
Then what you do

310
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,759
makes no sense.

311
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,960
Actually,

312
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,720
I do have a reason that

313
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,200
I've never told others.

314
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,120
Tell us about it.

315
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,080
Your Majesty, by persuading

316
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,360
the Grand General to serve you

317
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,159
and offering you profits gained from

318
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,039
future smuggling,

319
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,720
I hope

320
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:21,000
to ease our relation

321
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,480
and have more contacts.

322
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,960
Why?

323
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,919
I ask this world: what is love on earth

324
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,960
that binds the lovers up
in life and death?

325
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,600
I fell in love with your Saintess

326
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,559
at first sight.

327
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,200
I planned the whole thing carefully

328
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,480
for Miss Duoduo's sake.

329
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,519
Your Majesty,

330
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,120
I'm mad

331
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,360
about Duoduo.

332
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,600
Please give us a chance.

333
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,399
Well,

334
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:18,120
before I came to Beiqi,

335
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,559
I thought there would be

336
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,360
no grass

337
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,519
or tree here.

338
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,159
I didn't expect

339
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,840
it's so vibrant here.

340
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,519
It's full of vigor.

341
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,360
Well, how wonderful life is!

342
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,559
Well, you're laughing.

343
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,879
Fell in love with me at first sight?

344
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,919
I couldn't tell that old lady

345
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:41,480
I did everything

346
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,679
to kill Shen Zhong, right?

347
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,440
I just need an excuse.

348
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,320
Don't take it seriously.

349
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,919
You persuaded Shangshan Hu
to follow the Empress Dowager

350
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,600
to kill Shen Zhong?

351
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:51,799
The Empress Dowager is sure

352
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,039
to be tempted by the military power.

353
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,799
But she won't kill Shen Zhong for that.

354
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:56,679
Now the border troops

355
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,519
are controlled by the Empress Dowager.

356
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:58,679
Haven't you gained approval
from His Majesty?

357
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,759
This is the name list of

358
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:05,960
Shangshan Hu's subordinates in the army.

359
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,799
I copied it.

360
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,160
All the men on the list
are generals and military officers.

361
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,680
To win them over or crack them down,

362
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,319
to take or lose the military power,

363
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000
it's up to His Majesty.

364
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:20,720
Well,

365
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:22,400
I didn't do you harm, right?

366
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,880
But Shen Zhong is still safe and sound.

367
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,960
Shen Zhong is talented and confident.

368
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,559
That is his strength,

369
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,240
but it might also get him killed.

370
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:33,599
Your Majesty,

371
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,359
Fan Xian is

372
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:36,759
too cunning to be trusted.

373
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,759
He's young after all.

374
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,599
So many young men

375
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,559
in Shangjing Town fancy Duoduo.

376
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,920
Fan Xian

377
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,720
is no different.

378
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,519
Your Majesty, by thinking so,

379
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,720
I'm afraid
you're tricked by Fan Xian already.

380
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,200
Is Her Majesty

381
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,200
less wise

382
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,359
than you are?

383
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,960
I don't mean that.

384
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,920
Though Shen Zhong remains safe today,

385
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,440
the seeds have been sowed.

386
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:04,519
What seed?

387
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:06,000
Seeds of suspicion and fear.

388
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,559
By killing Xiao En,

389
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,559
Shen Zhong defied
the Empress Dowager's order.

390
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,599
He didn't report

391
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,839
the smuggling, either.

392
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,799
The Empress Dowager didn't blame him.

393
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
But she'll remember it in heart.

394
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,759
After all,
the Empress Dowager trusts him.

395
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,720
So if it happened before,

396
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,240
she wouldn't blame him at all.

397
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,680
Even if she felt dissatisfied,

398
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,519
she would just let it go.

399
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,880
But now it's different.

400
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,720
What is different?

401
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,400
Now the Empress Dowager

402
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,039
has Shangshan Hu by her side.

403
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,400
Commander Shen, I'm delighted

404
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,400
that you're concerned about our country.

405
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,920
How can I blame you?

406
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,440
Your Majesty,
you're really bright and perceptive.

407
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,880
The smuggling can

408
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:53,400
really be profitable.

409
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,799
In this case,

410
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,839
if we tell the truth,

411
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,480
Fan Xian will surely be punished
by Nanqing.

412
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,880
His life is somewhat

413
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,160
controlled by us.

414
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,640
Your Majesty, please think twice.

415
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:10,839
We can't follow

416
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,279
our enemy's will.

417
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:14,160
No matter how much money,

418
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,359
we shouldn't be tempted.

419
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,039
Perhaps,

420
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,240
we can take the offer first,
and see what happens later.

421
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:38,680
Forgive me for being outspoken.

422
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:41,079
We'd better be cautious.

423
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,920
Then I'll think it over.

424
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,480
Exactly.

425
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,519
Let's put it aside for the moment.

426
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,240
You may all leave.

427
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,160
I'm leaving.

428
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,319
Your Majesty, I bid you farewell.

429
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,039
As a first rank military official,

430
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,599
you don't have to kowtow to me.

431
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:13,720
Proprieties must be observed.

432
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,759
I'm loyal

433
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,279
in heart and in behavior.

434
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,480
Well said.

435
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,359
In heart and in behavior,

436
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,559
it's

437
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,160
so well said.

438
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,240
Though Shen Zhong is important

439
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,200
for controlling
the Embroidered Uniform Guards,

440
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,200
Shangshan Hu is more powerful

441
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,960
in the army.

442
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:54,039
The more cautious
and low-pitched Shangshan Hu is,

443
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,359
the more arrogant
and bossier Shen Zhong appears.

444
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,640
Your trick

445
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,279
is too simple.

446
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,039
I'm afraid the Empress Dowager
can see through it.

447
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,079
Of course she understands

448
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,279
Shangshan Hu takes the chance

449
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,039
to attack Shen Zhong.

450
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
But it's an overt scheme.

451
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:10,799
Even if the Empress Dowager

452
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,920
understands it all,

453
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,039
she'll grow dissatisfied gradually.

454
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
People change.

455
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:17,519
It's human nature.

456
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,240
Then it will be a situation of

457
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,359
check and balance at most.

458
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,160
The Empress Dowager
won't kill Shen Zhong.

459
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,839
Someone will if she doesn't.

460
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,400
Do you have another plan?

461
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,720
Tell His Majesty that

462
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,720
I promised to kill Shen Zhong for him,

463
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,359
and I'll definitely make it happen.

464
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,799
That's what he said.

465
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:49,400
Exceptionally tactful and resourceful,

466
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,119
and good at writing books as well,

467
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,920
what an excellent man!

468
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,000
Did he copy the name list himself?

469
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,200
Yes.

470
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,799
His handwriting is poor.

471
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,400
Auntie, what else do you tell him?

472
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,440
Nothing else.

473
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,960
I just warned him

474
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,160
when he left.

475
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,519
About what?

476
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,200
After thinking about it,

477
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,279
I'd better warn you about one thing.

478
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,400
Did I miss anything?

479
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:39,200
Since you told the Empress Dowager

480
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,079
that you have feelings for me.

481
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,680
You can't let others

482
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,400
see through your lie.

483
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,359
What are you talking about?

484
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,599
I said you can't let others

485
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,519
see through your lie.

486
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,920
Don't worry.

487
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:50,519
During this period,

488
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:51,319
I'll visit you often.

489
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,319
It's getting cold.

490
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,599
Take showers with ice water more often.

491
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,400
Why?

492
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:57,880
To keep your mind clear

493
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,200
and suppress your nature.

494
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,839
What are you talking about?

495
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,559
When you see me often,

496
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,680
do remember to control yourself.

497
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Keep alert all the time.

498
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,519
Control your feelings.
Don't take it seriously.

499
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:16,480
I'm just afraid

500
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,279
you might hurt yourself.

501
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:39,799
You said that?

502
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:42,440
What's wrong?

503
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,119
Auntie, you're really...

504
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,279
Really what?

505
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,240
Nothing.

506
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,960
I suddenly feel Fan Xian and you

507
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
are made for each other.

508
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,359
His Majesty must be confused.

509
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:04,240
Your Excellency,

510
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,920
the water is cold.

511
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,119
Let me add some warm water for you.

512
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,960
Why do I have to suppress my nature?

513
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,640
Why would I hurt myself?

514
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,440
She seems to keep a low profile usually,

515
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,839
but she's so narcissistic actually!

516
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,519
Do I have to marry her

517
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:16,720
by simply looking at her?

518
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:18,519
How ridiculous!

519
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,839
Your Excellency, you're so angry.

520
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,359
Do you feel a bit regretful?

521
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:22,920
Bullshit!

522
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:24,440
Regret for what?

523
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,599
I'm just angry! I'm so mad!

524
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:28,680
It feels like...

525
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,400
like...

526
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,039
Do you understand?

527
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:32,839
Yes.

528
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,119
Get insulted by someone,

529
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,039
who runs away in time,

530
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:36,559
right?

531
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,039
Yes!

532
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:39,599
No!

533
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,839
It doesn't sound right!

534
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:42,839
Your Excellency, please calm down.

535
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,079
If you

536
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,160
feel angry,

537
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,839
you can use your charm

538
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,920
to bewitch her

539
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,960
and make her lose her mind.

540
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,480
Later, just ignore her.

541
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:52,599
By then, you can

542
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:53,359
vent your anger.

543
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,079
Fine.

544
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,359
When we go back to the capital city,

545
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,359
repeat what you just said

546
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,839
to Wan'er.

547
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:58,359
No! No! No!

548
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,200
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

549
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,160
Your Excellency, please forgive me.

550
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,240
I'll never say that again.

551
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,640
Are you here

552
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,880
to say that?

553
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,240
Of course not.

554
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:07,960
Have you heard

555
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:08,880
what I've done clearly?

556
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,039
Conspiring with the imperial family

557
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,880
of Beiqi on smuggling in private.

558
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,279
I'll report that
when we return to the capital city.

559
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,519
If I really want to smuggle goods,

560
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,599
will I tell you about it?

561
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,400
Your Excellency, you want
to use the smuggling as an excuse...

562
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,279
To associate with

563
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,799
the imperial family of Beiqi openly

564
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,000
From now on,

565
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:24,920
with money clearing the way,

566
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,440
it'll be way easier
to pry into information.

567
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,119
Shen Zhong won't allow it.

568
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,119
So we have to

569
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,200
crush him completely.

570
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,559
I need your help for that.

571
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,079
I'm not recovered yet.

572
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:34,319
How can I help you?

573
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,960
Hand the intelligence network of
the Investigator's Office

574
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,759
in Shangjing Town over to me.

575
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,640
It's an order from Chen Pingping.

576
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:46,519
Then after you go back,

577
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,200
I'll ask the Head in person.

578
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,440
That's too late!

579
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,279
Our intelligence network is in the dark.

580
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,200
It's the safest.

581
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,240
How can that be late?

582
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,920
We have to destroy Shen Zhong now.

583
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,880
We need a push.

584
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,160
Are you still suspicious of me?

585
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,680
Considering your temperament,

586
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,880
I'm just worried.

587
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:05,799
It's all for

588
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:06,759
getting the smuggler's name

589
00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:08,119
out of Shen Zhong.

590
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:09,519
No hurry.

591
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,200
Aren't you eager to find out the truth?

592
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,079
I've thought about it.

593
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,319
After going back to the capital city,

594
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,240
I'll tell the Head the whole thing.

595
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,160
He surely can find the chief culprit.

596
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,279
Then Chen Pingping will get the credit

597
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,279
instead of me.

598
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,839
Do you want to take the credit?

599
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,519
I'm just tired of being a chess piece.

600
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,839
You don't trust the Head?!

601
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,079
Now I trust no one.

602
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,200
Then it's more unlikely for me

603
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,720
to give you what
the Investigator's Office has achieved

604
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
after years of painstaking labor.

605
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,400
The man behind the smuggler

606
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
must be paramount and powerful.

607
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:46,920
If we investigate into the case
when we're back,

608
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:48,960
any leak of information

609
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,480
is bound to cause turbulence.

610
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,240
If you really put Nanqing first,

611
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,200
you should help me figure out the truth.

612
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:05,759
I also don't know

613
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,000
how many secret agents of

614
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,880
the Investigator's Office

615
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,319
are hiding in Beiqi?

616
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,160
Why?

617
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,839
It's not long since I was transferred
to Shangjing after all.

618
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,160
Then how do you
use the intelligence network?

619
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,480
Through one man.

620
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,839
I dispatch secret agents in Shangjing

621
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,400
through him.

622
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:20,920
Tell me who he is.

623
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,000
It's all for Nanqing.

624
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,759
Miss, don't worry.

625
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,039
I'll deliver it to your home later.

626
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,400
Boss, I want to buy oil.

627
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,440
Sir, which oil do you want?

628
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,480
Half jin of palm oil.

629
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,279
OK.

630
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:07,359
Yes,

631
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,160
three coins for one pot.

632
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,400
Do you have sesame oil?

633
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,119
The sesame oil is too expensive.

634
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,000
Unless it's time
for worshipping the Heaven,

635
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:20,160
no one buys it normally.

636
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,079
Besides worshipping the Heaven,

637
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:22,519
it can also be used to mourn people.

638
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,039
Fine.

639
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
How much do you want?

640
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:30,160
We can order it for you.

641
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:32,359
Seven jin six taels
nine qians four haos.

642
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:40,799
Boss,

643
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,640
why do you close

644
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,480
so early today?

645
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,839
Sorry, please come back tomorrow.

646
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:44,359
But I...

647
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,200
Finally, you're here.

648
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,759
After the Chief was caught,

649
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,680
no one has been sent by
the imperial court to take over.

650
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:57,839
I thought

651
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,920
they want us to stay quiet.

652
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,319
Yan Bingyun was rescued.

653
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:04,400
That's good.

654
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,079
He told me that

655
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,279
you're in charge of dispatching

656
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,440
the secret agents in Shangjing Town.

657
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,359
Is there a secret order for us?

658
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,799
I've persuaded Shangshan Hu

659
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:14,799
to serve the Empress Dowager of Beiqi.

660
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,039
Now, what you should do is

661
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:18,839
to spread my words with Shen Zhong

662
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,160
in the imperial palace today

663
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,240
on the street

664
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:23,079
as chitchat.

665
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,200
It's a piece of cake.

666
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:27,680
I'll inform our agents in a moment.

667
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,640
He will work with you.

668
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,400
But Your Excellency,

669
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,759
identities of secret agents in Shangjing

670
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,279
are top secrets.

671
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,839
How long have you stayed
in Shangjing Town?

672
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:42,720
Over ten years.

673
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,279
Do you miss home?

674
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,559
Of course I do.

675
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:45,960
When this is over,

676
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,200
you can go home.

677
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,480
He will replace you to

678
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,279
manage the intelligence network
of Shangjing Town.

679
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,759
I didn't receive such an order.

680
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,799
I just made the decision.

681
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:04,319
Your Excellency,

682
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,720
what's your position

683
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,839
in the Investigator's Office?

684
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,480
Director-General!

685
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:15,880
Do you have any other question?

686
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,759
It's a big deal.

687
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:19,599
It's my decision.

688
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,000
I'll take

689
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,000
any consequence.

690
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:24,759
If Yan Bingyun

691
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,920
doesn't agree with the appointment,

692
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,559
he wouldn't send me to you.

693
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,799
I know,

694
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:29,839
but...

695
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:30,960
But after staying in Shangjing
for ten years,

696
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,119
you must have made some new friends.

697
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,200
Yes.

698
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:37,559
It's also for maintaining
my current identity.

699
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:39,240
Now that you're reluctant
to take the order,

700
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,920
is it because you're unwilling
to leave Shangjing

701
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:45,240
and part with your Beiqi friends?

702
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,400
Absolutely not!

703
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:47,839
I'll

704
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:49,920
take the order.

705
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:52,799
But

706
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,680
I wonder

707
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,240
which division he is from

708
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,440
and which Director he is working for.

709
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,799
He's not from the Investigator's Office.

710
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,480
What?

711
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,400
Let me introduce.

712
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,759
This is the son of Guo Youzhi,
the Minister of Board of Rites.

713
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,960
You can call him Guo Baokun.

714
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,000
But Your Excellency,

715
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,480
the secret agents of Shangjing

716
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,559
are managed by
the Investigators Office all along.

717
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,079
He's my subordinate.

718
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,200
If you have a problem with me,

719
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
you can submit a memorial

720
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,200
to impeach me
when you're back to the capital city.

721
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,920
But now, just do what you're told.

722
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,440
I dare not.

723
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,000
Fine.

724
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:39,400
You may leave.

725
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:40,480
I need a word with him.

726
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,559
I'll get things ready in the backyard.

727
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,359
In a little while,

728
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,680
I'll introduce him to

729
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,319
all the secret agents

730
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:53,559
in Shangjing.

731
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:02,480
Think it over.

732
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,240
From now on,

733
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,119
you'll stay in an enemy capital alone

734
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,559
and face great danger.

735
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,079
You promised to save my dad.

736
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,960
I will.

737
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,279
Why me?

738
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,440
The intelligence network of Shangjing
Town is of great importance,

739
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,279
the one in charge must be my man.

740
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,799
I'm not your subordinate.

741
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,359
Except me,

742
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,319
who else will save your dad?

743
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,720
Who else can save your dad?

744
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,440
I'm your only option.

745
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:39,920
Dare you lie to me,

746
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
I'll kill you with my own hands.

747
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:43,799
No,

748
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,640
you must let me kill you.

749
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,160
Rest assured.

750
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:07,160
Moreover,

751
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,400
Shen Zhong knows me.

752
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,519
He'll be a hidden danger.

753
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,480
Don't worry.

754
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:15,039
You're a shield

755
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,599
especially for Shen Zhong.

756
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:18,319
You only need to run the business

757
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,599
and give bribes.

758
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,920
Matters concerning the secret agents

759
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:21,920
will be managed by others.

760
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:26,839
Who?

761
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,359
What if someone comes
to examine the shop?

762
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,599
The smuggling

763
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,519
is a deal with the Beiqi's upper class.

764
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,680
Once the profit chain spreads out,

765
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,599
many people will benefit.

766
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:39,880
No matter what happens,

767
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,839
they'll handle it for you.

768
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:47,640
Unbelievable!

769
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,400
It's dangerous and inefficient

770
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,599
to risk your life
inquiring about information

771
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,240
and hide yourself.

772
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,799
It's time to change your mind.

773
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,799
From now on,
with money clearing the way,

774
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,920
we can have our enemy protect us.

775
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,240
But Shen Zhong is against this.

776
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,519
Shen Zhong won't be a problem.

777
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,920
It's an irresistible trend.

778
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,759
One man alone can't stop it.

779
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:08,719
That makes sense.

780
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,199
Don't smirk.

781
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,920
If it succeeds,

782
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,239
our Division will benefit.

783
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,559
I'm afraid it won't be easy.

784
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:27,559
A couple of days ago,

785
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,639
Commander Shen said on the Hall that

786
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,000
he wouldn't help to make it happen.

787
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,400
Really?

788
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,719
Haven't you heard about
their talks on the Hall?

789
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,480
Tell us about it.

790
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,679
A couple of days ago,
Commander Shen said

791
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,039
in front of Her Majesty that...

792
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,119
Your Excellency,

793
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,480
your words with Fan Xian

794
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,079
in front of Her Majesty

795
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,840
are spreading everywhere.

796
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,239
Fan Xian has made a nice move.

797
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,679
However, he forgot that the capital is

798
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,280
controlled by
Embroidered Uniform Guards.

799
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,159
Pass on my order
to each battalion commanders.

800
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,800
Spare no efforts in blocking the rumor

801
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,039
and check strictly.

802
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,480
Are these vegetables picked today?

803
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,000
Yes.

804
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:14,079
They're fresh. Just picked.

805
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:16,960
Have a look!

806
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,079
Fresh pork.

807
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,119
Ribs also.

808
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,039
Lady, do you want anything?

809
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,320
It looks good.

810
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,280
Just picked.

811
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,119
Give me two.

812
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,719
Shouldn't all Saintesses love

813
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,119
ancient calligraphy and paintings

814
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
or magic weapons?

815
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,800
But I prefer eating.

816
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,119
Please trim them for me.

817
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:35,920
Remove the leaves outside.

818
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:36,800
OK! OK!

819
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,320
The leaves outside are not fresh.

820
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,199
Don't put them inside.

821
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,559
These are all fresh.

822
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,000
Should you pay attention?

823
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,719
To what?

824
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,119
You're a Saintess after all.

825
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,719
The basket doesn't
go with your temperament.

826
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,719
I'm not in the imperial palace.

827
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,599
You should pay attention to

828
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,679
your temperament all the time.

829
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,559
It's not only for pretending

830
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,199
in the imperial Palace.

831
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,079
You've got a point.

832
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:07,679
Carry it for me.

833
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,519
I have a question for you.

834
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:15,079
Go ahead.

835
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,000
Are you responsible for the rumor

836
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,760
in the capital recently?

837
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:19,719
Yes.

838
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,360
Then do you know

839
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,360
Shen Zhong has ordered
Embroidered Uniform Guards

840
00:36:24,679 --> 00:36:25,679
to block the information?

841
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,440
It won't work.

842
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,239
The power of Embroidered Uniform Guards

843
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,800
is beyond your imagination.

844
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,960
I know, but it still won't work.

845
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,719
How about making a bet?

846
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,199
So you're really confident.

847
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:55,960
Your Excellency.

848
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,159
Do you want to see me?

849
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,079
Haven't I given the order?

850
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,360
How come the rumor

851
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,639
is still rampant these days.

852
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:04,559
Your Excellency,

853
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,079
all the battalion commanders said

854
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,480
they had acted according to your order,

855
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,039
but it doesn't work.

856
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,679
I've urged them repeatedly,

857
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,400
but they said

858
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,360
they had tried their best.

859
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:15,039
Well...

860
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:35,880
Why are you so sure

861
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,440
the Embroidered Uniform Guards
won't take it seriously?

862
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,159
Because they're human.

863
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,199
So what?

864
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,000
Humans are selfish.

865
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,039
If the smuggling falls into place,

866
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,960
Embroidered Uniform Guards
will all benefit

867
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,679
by controlling the financial power.

868
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:48,880
Who doesn't want to

869
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:50,760
live a better life while alive?

870
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,719
Shen Zhong gets in their way,

871
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,320
so no one wants to help him for sure.

872
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,960
But there must be people
who don't seek profits.

873
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,599
Even if they don't seek profits,
they will seek power.

874
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,800
Shen Zhong controls

875
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,280
Embroidered Uniform Guards
all by himself.

876
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,360
If he doesn't step down,

877
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,480
how can others move up?

878
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,599
If so,

879
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,480
why didn't they challenge Shen Zhong

880
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,280
as the Commander-in-chief

881
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,159
in earlier years?

882
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:11,039
In earlier years, he was deeply trusted
by the Empress Dowager.

883
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,840
They knew they couldn't beat him,

884
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,159
so they bowed at his feet.

885
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,000
What about now?

886
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,559
Now with Shangshan Hu rising sharply,

887
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,920
Shen Zhong is no longer
the most powerful minister

888
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,840
serving the Empress Dowager.

889
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,719
Exactly.

890
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
Have you planned all of that?

891
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,320
Cutting off others' source of income

892
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,400
is similar to killing their parents.

893
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,960
The Embroidered Uniform Guards aren't

894
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,039
the only ones
to gain profits from the smuggling.

895
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,400
Believe me.

896
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,320
If Shen Zhong goes his own way,

897
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,239
he'll become the target of
public criticism in the end.

898
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,039
But as long as
the Empress Dowager trusts him,

899
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,480
he'll be fine.

900
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,519
Keep the birthday celebration simple.

901
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:57,599
Just share the happiness
with the people.

902
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,000
I see.

903
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,199
I'll handle it.

904
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,239
You're occupied.

905
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,079
No need to worry about

906
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,679
such a miscellaneous thing.

907
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,280
No, that one.

908
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:12,960
But your birthday celebrations
have been prepared

909
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,559
by Embroidered Uniform Guards
all the time.

910
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,800
Yes, indeed.

911
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,440
I remember that

912
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:23,119
your subordinator, the deputy commander,

913
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,280
is quite alert and resourceful.

914
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,760
You can leave this to him.

915
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:29,519
Your Majesty,

916
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,199
I'm afraid that you might be too tired.

917
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,559
I have to find someone capable

918
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:36,360
to assist you.

919
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,559
It's my turn.
I haven't put down my chess piece.

920
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:43,599
No.

921
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,280
That one.

922
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,639
Thank you, Your Majesty.

923
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,719
You may leave.

924
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:55,639
I win!

925
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,360
Good! Let's play another round.

926
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,320
Right, it's different now.

927
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:12,360
Now the Grand General

928
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,760
is most favored by Her Majesty.

929
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,480
Contradicting Her Majesty in face,

930
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,320
no wonder Her Majesty is displeased.

931
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,039
I heard!

932
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,760
He's not so trusted as before.

933
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,119
Her Majesty seldom summons him.

934
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:49,800
Your Excellency,

935
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,199
the tailor has finished

936
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,079
altering your robe.

937
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:55,079
The python pattern bestowed by

938
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,400
Her Majesty has been embroidered on it.

939
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,280
Your Excellency,

940
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,920
isn't today the day
when battalion commanders

941
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,480
from different battalions
come to report to you regularly?

942
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:27,719
How come no one

943
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:28,360
is here?

944
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,199
Do I remember

945
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,599
the wrong day?

946
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,239
Two deputy commanders
and two assistant commissioners

947
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:36,079
have important things to attend to.

948
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,119
Those battalion commanders

949
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,199
are busy working.

950
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:41,920
They should at least

951
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,960
inform Your Excellency.

952
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,400
It's not bad to be idle.

953
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:15,480
Tell me.

954
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,199
why does the Empress Dowager

955
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,000
suddenly treat Shen Zhong so coldly?

956
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,719
Shen Zhong is too aggressive.

957
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,760
The Empress Dowager
didn't mind that before.

958
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,239
It's because he could control

959
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:25,679
the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

960
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,199
She surely would tolerate

961
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,519
a capable subordinate.

962
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,360
But now is different.

963
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,320
The Embroidered Uniform Guards
are divided.

964
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,800
Your Empress Dowager sees it all.

965
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,159
Actually, she can eliminate

966
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:38,480
the conspiracies

967
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,840
and recover Shen Zhong's power easily.

968
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,320
Why should she?

969
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,920
Ministers getting separated

970
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:43,840
in different cliques

971
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,119
by competing for power

972
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,840
is better for check and balance.

973
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,960
It's much safer than

974
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,639
having only one powerful minister.

975
00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:51,280
But Shen Zhong does everything

976
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,360
out of his loyalty

977
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:53,519
instead of selfness.

978
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:55,239
What does loyalty have to do with that?

979
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,719
In past dynasties,

980
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,159
so many loyal ministers were killed.

981
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,239
Where are we heading?

982
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:07,039
I remember you drugged me

983
00:43:07,639 --> 00:43:08,920
when we first met.

984
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,079
Why do you bring that up again?

985
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:14,079
You lied to me
that it was an aphrodisiac.

986
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,280
I had no other choice.

987
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,159
I thought it's over.

988
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,199
I remember.

989
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:21,280
Now I'm taking you to

990
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,519
an extremely dangerous place

991
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:24,079
to avenge the drug.

992
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:25,360
If you're scared,

993
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:26,440
just don't follow me.

994
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,079
To avenge the drug.

995
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:32,880
You even make a word.

996
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:41,800
Whose home is this?

997
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:43,920
Mine.

998
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:52,599
Did you grow up here?

999
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:54,880
Not really.

1000
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,519
My master asked me to stay in Shangjing.

1001
00:43:58,679 --> 00:43:59,559
I love to stay quiet,

1002
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:01,519
so I took this place to grow vegetables.

1003
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:02,960
I visit here whenever I'm free.

1004
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,320
Are these all grown by you?

1005
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,559
As to the flowers,

1006
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:09,760
I just scattered the seeds randomly.

1007
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,639
I seldom took care of them.

1008
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,519
They grow on their own.

1009
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,960
She scattered the wild flower seeds

1010
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,119
she picked along the road

1011
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,119
by the wall randomly.

1012
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,639
She said,

1013
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,760
"No need to take care of them.

1014
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:25,559
Life can find its way

1015
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,800
to thrive."

1016
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:33,000
Who's that "she" you just mentioned?

1017
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:35,440
Your mom said

1018
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,239
it has its own destiny.

1019
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,480
Let it grow as it likes.

1020
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:42,960
You sound like

1021
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,800
a woman

1022
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,400
I know.

1023
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:47,760
Is she also a Saintess?

1024
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,719
It's a pity that

1025
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,559
the vegetables are not fully grown,

1026
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:55,440
or I wouldn't have to
buy vegetables outside.

1027
00:44:59,480 --> 00:44:59,960
I'll take it.

1028
00:45:02,679 --> 00:45:03,599
So you like farming?

1029
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,360
It calms my mind.

1030
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,880
Others calm their minds

1031
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:12,280
Others calm their minds

1032
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,400
by playing the zither
and burning incense.

1033
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,079
I like it this way.

1034
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:22,760
Why not sit down?

1035
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:26,039
The soil

1036
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,440
should be turned.

1037
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:30,719
Soil?

1038
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:11,679
Thank you.

1039
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,760
The water is fresh and sweet.

1040
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:18,000
Why do you know how to farm?

1041
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:20,639
When learning poisons,
I've planted poisonous weeds.

1042
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:21,639
It's the same.

1043
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,199
You're

1044
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,840
really weird.

1045
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:29,880
So are you.

1046
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,360
I can't see through you till now.

1047
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,480
Why do you want to see through me?

1048
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:35,880
What's the fun of that?

1049
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,280
It's no fun.

1050
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:40,880
If so,

1051
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,760
why do you do that?

1052
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,719
If we do nothing,

1053
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:44,840
how can we prove we're alive?

1054
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,960
Do we need to prove that?

1055
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:50,519
The common answer is

1056
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,440
"Don't we"?

1057
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,760
Which answer is uncommon?

1058
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:55,360
I've no idea.

1059
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:58,840
It seems we've been talking nonsense.

1060
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:01,159
I like it this way.

1061
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,800
Lazy and loosened,

1062
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,840
sit under the sun and talk nonsense.

1063
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,679
I don't find it hard.

1064
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,119
Do you often find it hard?

1065
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:16,519
Intriguing against each other
with crafty tactics,

1066
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:19,239
it's like walking across an abyss

1067
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,599
on a vine.

1068
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,119
I just feel strained all the time.

1069
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,079
So I need time like this

1070
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,800
to sit idly with friends

1071
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,800
without thinking anything

1072
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:30,039
and talk casually.

1073
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,280
Is that so hard?

1074
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,159
It's hard to have free time,

1075
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:36,320
and it's even harder to find a friend.

1076
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:39,039
Are we friends?

1077
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:43,039
To some extent,

1078
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,239
we are enemies.

1079
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:46,000
But you know,

1080
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,679
the most dangerous people in the world

1081
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,760
are not your enemies.

1082
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,599
You are right.

1083
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:54,559
Now those who rally together

1084
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:55,920
to attack Shen Zhong

1085
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,719
are all his subordinates

1086
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,559
and friends.

1087
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,119
They're not his friends.

1088
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:04,079
I just said

1089
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,480
it's hard for people
like us to have friends.

1090
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,239
If I didn't hear it wrong,

1091
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,360
Your Excellency, you're depressed.

1092
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,639
I'm just dissatisfied.

1093
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,000
Born into an influential family,
having a successful official career,

1094
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,920
and known as the poetic genius
sent from Heaven,

1095
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:22,440
how can you be dissatisfied with

1096
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,039
such a life?

1097
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:25,960
I feel lonely.

1098
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,519
It sounds affected.

1099
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:30,519
It sounds affected.

1100
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,119
I'm affected all the time.

1101
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:36,440
Now in the Investigator's Office,
you're only second to the Head.

1102
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,159
You'll marry a beautiful wife
when you're back.

1103
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,440
Your younger sister
is known for her talent.

1104
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:43,639
Your father is a high-rank official.

1105
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:46,199
You associate with
talented people of the time.

1106
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,880
How can you be lonely?

1107
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,039
Father is father, wife is wife,
and sister is sister.

1108
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,519
They're my family,

1109
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,000
not my friends.

1110
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,760
As to others,

1111
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,320
we're tied up by interests.

1112
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,320
Call me a hypocrite

1113
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:06,079
or call me a fool.

1114
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:08,400
Anyway,

1115
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,519
I find it hard to be a minister,

1116
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,440
and unhappy

1117
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,639
to be a son.

1118
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,800
Do you really have no friend?

1119
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,760
Teng Zijing was my friend,

1120
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,639
but he died for me.

1121
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,400
Now,

1122
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:39,760
Wang Qinian can be counted as my friend.

1123
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:42,039
You really

1124
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,360
speak highly of him.

1125
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,639
Wang Qinian lives
a more authentic life than I am.

1126
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:48,079
What do you mean by authentic?

1127
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,039
He fears his wife
and loves his daughter.

1128
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,760
He lives his life

1129
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,079
for them.

1130
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:55,960
Though it's not easy

1131
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,000
for him sometimes,

1132
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,519
at least he's happy.

1133
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:00,280
Isn't your life authentic?

1134
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,599
I have so many secrets in my heart.

1135
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,199
I can't tell them

1136
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,199
and I have no one to tell them to.

1137
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,599
Like what?

1138
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:13,880
For example, I'm actually

1139
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:14,800
the son of Emperor Qing.

1140
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,679
I was born noble

1141
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,199
but brought up
in the Fan family secretly.

1142
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,360
Don't tell me if you don't want to.

1143
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,039
No need to talk rubbish.

1144
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,400
Do you have anything else to say?

1145
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:33,880
Yes.

1146
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:36,719
I'm hungry.

1147
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,400
Stop staring at me.
I won't eat in advance.

1148
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,599
I didn't expect you can cook.

1149
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:52,760
My senior fellow apprentices and I

1150
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,719
lived in the valley with my master.

1151
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:54,719
I was in charge for cooking.

1152
00:50:56,039 --> 00:50:57,119
Aren't you his last apprentice?

1153
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:58,679
The last apprentice to cook.

1154
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,559
Well said.

1155
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,079
Wait over there. It won't take long.

1156
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:12,920
Have a try.

1157
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:20,400
It's really good.

1158
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,440
Aren't you afraid
I might poison the dishes?

1159
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:24,159
Just go head.

1160
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,199
Right, you're a master of poison.

1161
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,320
What now?

1162
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,559
Do you have any wine?

1163
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:34,559
You're really making yourself at home.

1164
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:35,599
Better be good.

1165
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:57,679
It's really good.

1166
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:59,599
It's from Qingyu Hall in Nanqing.

1167
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:01,760
Really?

1168
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,039
Back then, Ye Qingmei

1169
00:52:04,039 --> 00:52:05,199
was absolutely brilliant.

1170
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,320
Qingyu Hall gathered
the wealth of the world.

1171
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:08,480
Anything good

1172
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,920
must be from her firm.

1173
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,519
She was really amazing.

1174
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,320
Do you think

1175
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:27,880
I pretend to

1176
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:29,440
drown my sorrow

1177
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:31,679
despite an infinite bright future?

1178
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:35,000
I have no time to think about that.

1179
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,719
I can't let you

1180
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:37,559
drink up the good wine

1181
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:38,519
all alone.

1182
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,039
It's tuneless.

1183
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,840
I suddenly remember a piece of poetry

1184
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,440
which suits me well.

1185
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,159
Tell me about it.

1186
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:18,199
Leave behind a residue of happiness!
Leave behind a residue of happiness!

1187
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,639
Unexpectedly
you will come across a benefactor!

1188
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,400
Fortunate enough your mother,
your own mother,

1189
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:26,599
will have laid by a store of virtue
and secret meritorious actions!

1190
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,960
My advice to you, mankind,

1191
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:30,880
Relieve the destitute
and succour the distressed.

1192
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,039
Do not resemble those

1193
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,679
who will harp after lucre and show themselves
unmindful of the ties of relationship:

1194
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,039
that wolflike maternal uncle of yours
and that impostor of a brother!

1195
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,320
For far above the constellations,

1196
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,559
one watches all
and makes just calculations.

1197
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,280
It sounds familiar.

1198
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,239
It's the sum-up for Sister Qiao

1199
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,599
in the Red Mansions.

1200
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,880
What's it called?

1201
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:03,119
Leave behind a residue of happiness!

1202
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:07,400
Relieve the destitute
and succour the distressed.

1203
00:54:08,199 --> 00:54:09,519
It actually reflects a kind heart.

1204
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:11,519
It's so hard.

1205
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:14,519
My master said

1206
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,639
the more difficult a thing is,

1207
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,960
the harder
one should work to make it happen.

1208
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,679
You're trying to strengthen me out.

1209
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,559
Why are men different from animals?

1210
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:28,880
It's only
because men value righteousness.

1211
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:30,480
Your Excellency Fan,

1212
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:32,119
though we're from different countries,

1213
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:33,960
but all the people in the world

1214
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,119
are the same.

1215
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:38,039
I hope that you spare no efforts

1216
00:54:38,119 --> 00:54:40,119
in preventing the war after going back,

1217
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,239
thus saving all the people from hell.

1218
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:46,039
You wanted to kill Xiao En before.

1219
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:49,400
Wasn't him a living man?

1220
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,719
Saving thousands of men
by killing one man,

1221
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,840
what's wrong with that?

1222
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:57,199
It's not a simple calculation.

1223
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,800
If one hundred men

1224
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:01,280
will die one day.

1225
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,360
By killing 49 of them, you can save 51.

1226
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,639
Will you kill them or not?

1227
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:19,519
In this sense,

1228
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:24,360
we're both heartless.

1229
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:28,639
Let me be.

1230
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,840
Let me

1231
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,559
get drunk today.

1232
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:43,239
Drink less.

1233
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,800
Don't get drunk.

1234
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:15,760
You are?

1235
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:20,920
You're awake.

1236
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,239
Miss Lili,

1237
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,159
I thought

1238
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,760
you'll sleep the whole night?

1239
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:30,800
It's almost dawn.

1240
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,880
I have no status,

1241
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,199
so I still live outside
the imperial palace.

1242
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:41,920
But it won't take long.

1243
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,000
After the Empress Dowager's birthday,

1244
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,960
I can move into the imperial palace.

1245
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:48,679
I...

1246
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:56,320
I don't know

1247
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,920
why I

1248
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:01,719
keep thinking of you

1249
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:04,679
like I've lost my mind.

1250
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,400
I just want to see you

1251
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,920
before moving into the imperial palace

1252
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,199
and tell you about my feelings.

1253
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,039
Fan Xian,

1254
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:27,639
I like you.

1255
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,519
Miss Lili,

1256
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,159
I have a fiancée named Lin Wan'er.

1257
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:39,039
I've sworn

1258
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:40,400
to only love her in my life.

1259
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,639
It's not easy

1260
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:44,840
is long, but it's also short.

1261
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,440
I'm narrow-minded.

1262
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,400
I can't have someone else

1263
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,360
in my heart this life.

1264
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,639
You don't have to say that.

1265
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,360
I just want to tell you.

1266
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:05,920
You love the one in your heart,

1267
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,559
and I love the one in my heart.

1268
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:13,760
Let's not bother each other,

1269
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,400
OK?

1270
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:21,559
After tonight,

1271
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:23,519
we may not see each other.

1272
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,519
In the future,

1273
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:30,880
we probably

1274
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,000
won't meet again.

1275
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,400
I just want to talk to you.

1276
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,119
I asked Duoduo

1277
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,639
to help me.

1278
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,159
It might be absurd,

1279
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,039
but I don't regret it.

1280
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:53,800
Don't be nervous.

1281
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:00,000
I just want to talk.

1282
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:11,039
Or we may

1283
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:14,079
talk about the girl

1284
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,480
in your heart.

1285
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,119
How did you meet?

1286
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:23,000
How did she walk into your heart?

1287
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:30,280
Tell me your story

1288
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,519
so my curiosity can be satisfied.

1289
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,880
You really want to hear?

1290
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,000
Yes.

1291
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,360
Actually we met

1292
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:52,920
by accident.

1293
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,280
I just arrived in the capital city
from Danzhou.

1294
00:59:56,599 --> 00:59:57,480
In the Qing Temple,

1295
00:59:58,679 --> 00:59:59,239
I...

1296
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,400
when I first met her,

1297
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,480
she had a...

1298
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:09,960
The cocks are crowing.

1299
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:13,280
What?

1300
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,840
All the cocks are crowing.

1301
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:22,239
Do you know what that means?

1302
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:25,480
What does that mean?

1303
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:27,639
It's dawn.

1304
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:36,199
Finished talking?

1305
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:39,239
When did you drug me?

1306
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,239
You're the apprentice of Fei Jie.

1307
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:42,519
Why would I drug you?

1308
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,679
Then why did I pass out?

1309
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,480
The wine is strong.

1310
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,800
You were not drugged,

1311
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,719
but drunk.

1312
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,079
Then why were you OK?

1313
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,280
I'm gifted.

1314
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:51,480
I've never got drunk
since I was a child.

1315
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,159
You...

1316
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:54,400
I told you

1317
01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:56,159
I would avenge the drug.

1318
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,280
You were careless yourself.

1319
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:03,480
What's wrong with you?!

1320
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:25,000
Python pattern bestowed by Her Majesty.

1321
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:27,280
Your Excellency,
in the imperial court now,

1322
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,480
only you have the honor.

1323
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,639
Your Excellency,
today is Her Majesty's birthday.

1324
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,239
When you enter the Hall,
you might as well...

1325
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,440
What?

1326
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:38,079
You might as well take a step back

1327
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:39,840
and agree on the smuggling.

1328
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,360
Your Excellency,
not only the Embroidered Uniform Guards,

1329
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,360
but all the ministries
are paying attention to this.

1330
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:47,199
If you still refuse to compromise,

1331
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,719
you'll really offend

1332
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:49,880
all the ministers in the imperial court.

1333
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,119
As long as you take a step back,

1334
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,320
Her Majesty will surely be happy.

1335
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:53,119
By then,

1336
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,480
you'll still be in charge of
the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

1337
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:01,719
If I worry about my life,

1338
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,079
I don't deserve the robe.

1339
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:08,159
Your Excellency.

1340
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,000
Please.

1341
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,519
Your Excellencies,

1342
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:43,599
that way, please.

1343
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,480
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

1344
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,639
It's over there!

1345
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:58,360
Can we sit here?

1346
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,079
Yes, your seats are here.

1347
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:04,719
If he doesn't let us sit here,

1348
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,280
we'll have to sit outside the Hall.

1349
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,440
Langtao wants to challenge Fan Xian

1350
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,320
on the Hall.

1351
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,440
Your Excellency.

1352
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,320
Your Excellency.

1353
01:03:58,920 --> 01:03:59,440
Are you OK?

1354
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,360
I'm fine.

1355
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,559
Take him to a cool place,
and let him drink more water.

1356
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,039
She's in the imperial palace.

1357
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:44,599
Who?

1358
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:46,000
Si Lili.

1359
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,320
How dare you mention her?

1360
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,599
I'm about to settle the score with you.

1361
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:50,159
I'm the envoy of Nanqing,

1362
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:51,039
and she belongs to His...

1363
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,320
She likes you.

1364
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,320
I have to help her.

1365
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,719
His Majesty is your little nephew.

1366
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,199
But Lili is my sister.

1367
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,559
What a messy relationship!

1368
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,280
She just wanted to talk to you before
going into the imperial palace.

1369
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,679
She didn't ask you to marry her.

1370
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:04,559
Why do you panic?

1371
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,239
How's she now?

1372
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:13,119
She's learning etiquette

1373
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:14,840
and getting ready to meet His Majesty
in the imperial palace at any time.

1374
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:15,679
I'm afraid

1375
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,199
you won't be able to see her again.

1376
01:05:17,199 --> 01:05:18,039
I don't want to see her.

1377
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,400
To you,

1378
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:22,440
it was

1379
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,360
just a talk.

1380
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:24,920
But to Lili,

1381
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,079
she drifted along all her life

1382
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:29,119
struggling for survival.

1383
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,719
A talk with you

1384
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:31,920
might be one of

1385
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,119
her few good memories.

1386
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,000
If you still feel angry,

1387
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:38,159
don't blame her but me.

1388
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,360
Your Majesty, happy birthday!
May you live as long as the Heaven!

1389
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,400
May you live a thousand of years!

1390
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,199
Thank you for your

1391
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:04,840
best wishes.

1392
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:06,800
Please!

1393
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,480
Take your seats.

1394
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1395
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:26,079
Let's eat!

1396
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,639
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager!
Your Majesty the Emperor!

1397
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:45,239
I'm Langtao.

1398
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:47,639
I'd like to compete

1399
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:48,920
with His Excellency Fan from Nanqing,

1400
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,199
so as to add fun
to the birthday celebration.

1401
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:54,639
Mr. Fan,

1402
01:06:55,159 --> 01:06:56,320
do you want to compete with him?

1403
01:06:57,559 --> 01:06:58,360
Your Majesty,

1404
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,760
I'm willing to

1405
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,800
admit defeat.

1406
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:04,000
No need to compete.

1407
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,400
Then,

1408
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,159
so be it.

1409
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:12,920
Your Excellency,

1410
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,159
are you admitting that Nanqing is weak

1411
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:17,679
without competent martial arts masters?

1412
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:19,039
I admit defeat for myself.

1413
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:20,679
It has nothing to do with Nanqing.

1414
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:22,719
After entering Shangjing,

1415
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:24,119
didn't you keep the flag unharmed on
your way to the imperial palace?

1416
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,119
How come you chicken out

1417
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:29,119
in front of me?

1418
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:34,559
Is it
because the Nanqing martial arts masters

1419
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:37,119
all tend to bully the weak
and fear the strong?
