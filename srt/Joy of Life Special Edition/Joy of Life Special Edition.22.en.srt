under the Empress Dowager's order

18
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,040
to keep watch on me
and the little emperor?

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,239
You're talkative.

20
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,040
I can't believe

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,000
you're a double agent.

22
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,680
Come on. Is it related to you?

23
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,719
No.

24
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,920
I'm already engaged.

25
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,599
You're the Saintess.

26
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,360
Can't you be more like a lady?

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,560
Your Majesty, here I am.

28
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,520
Good job.

29
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,599
Shen Zhong took strict precautions
against you,

30
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,280
but you really managed to

31
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,159
find Yan Bingyun's whereabouts.

32
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
Your thought and skills

33
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,199
are outstanding.

34
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:48,280
I'm just lucky.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,199
If Shen Zhong didn't have a sister,

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,639
how would you find Yan Bingyun?

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,280
Of course to turn to you.

38
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,560
How do you know if I'd help you out?

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,240
You want me

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,240
to kill Shen Zhong.

41
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,759
We should help each other.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It'll be a story on everyone's lips.

43
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,360
So, do you agree to kill Shen Zhong?

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,639
I have a condition.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,560
Go ahead.

46
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,639
I want to know where Xiao En is.

47
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,439
And then?

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,879
To get him out.

49
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,039
How?

50
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,800
By cooperating with Shangshan Hu.

51
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Xiao En was
a high-ranking official of Beiqi.

52
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:29,919
Exactly.

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,599
Shangshan Hu is
a famous general of Beiqi.

54
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,719
He's important.

55
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,479
You want to collude with our general

56
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,639
to break into a jail
and rescue a prisoner.

57
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,439
And you're telling His Majesty about it.

58
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,080
I'm not just telling him.

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,360
I'm turning to him.

60
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,280
Your Majesty,
you tell me where Xiao En is.

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,560
Shangshan Hu and I will get him out.

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,560
We can be considered partners.

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,560
You want to break into a prison of Beiqi

64
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,120
and conspire with the emperor of Beiqi?

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,080
As I said,

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,879
we should help each other.

67
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,039
As I said,

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,879
he's extremely daring.

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,120
Mr. Fan, tell me

70
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,080
why I should conspire with you.

71
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,800
Your Majesty,

72
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,080
what will Shen Zhong do

73
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,520
if Shangshan Hu tries to save Xiao En?

74
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,919
He'll do all he can to stop it.

75
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,159
Who is better at martial arts,

76
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,039
Shen Zhong or Shangshan Hu?

77
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,759
Shen Zhong is no match for Shangshan Hu.

78
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,280
Okay.

79
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,719
While Shangshan Hu
wants to save Xiao En,

80
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,680
Shen Zhong is bound to stop it.

81
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,439
In this case, they're sure to fight.

82
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,759
Do you want to see Shen Zhong be killed

83
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:21,480
by Shangshan Hu?

84
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,360
Yes, for your sake.

85
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,279
If Shen Zhong is killed,

86
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,759
Shangshan Hu deserves
the harshest punishment.

87
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,000
So, you can arrest him

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,720
and execute him later.

89
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
You want to kill

90
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,560
both Shen Zhong and Shangshan Hu.

91
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,079
Are you aiming to

92
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,160
weaken Beiqi?

93
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,040
Shangshan Hu doesn't
take orders from you

94
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,000
or from the Empress Dowager.

95
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,399
And he enjoys an awe-inspiring
reputation in the military.

96
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,879
Can you set your mind at rest

97
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,560
if he's alive?

98
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,759
Mr. Fan, you're really brainy.

99
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,680
I guess so.

100
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,240
What if Shen Zhong survives?

101
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,560
Even if he's not killed,

102
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,040
he's neglected his duties
because Xiao En is saved.

103
00:04:59,480 --> 00:04:59,839
By then,

104
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,319
you can punish him
and remove him from office.

105
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:02,319
In that case,

106
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,680
he can be killed any time.

107
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:06,959
You've considered

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,399
everything about it.

109
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,680
It took me lots of efforts

110
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,600
to think of these ideas.

111
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,360
It's for the sake of you.

112
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,199
You did all this

113
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,399
for the sake of me?

114
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,439
Or else?

115
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,759
Your Majesty,

116
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,920
you haven't told me where Xiao En is.

117
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Is he going to the bathroom?

118
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:36,160
Xiao En is imprisoned out of town.

119
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:37,160
I'll tell you

120
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,600
the specific place when I see you out.

121
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,759
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

122
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,959
We're cooperation partners!

123
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,800
Did Fan Xian go to see Shangshan Hu?

124
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:55,879
Exactly.

125
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,279
Not in a sneaky way?

126
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,399
No. He was fully at ease.

127
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:04,000
Where did he go before that?

128
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:06,360
The imperial palace.
He was called in by His Majesty.

129
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,480
Called in again?

130
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,279
What did they talk about?

131
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,120
According to a message
from the Empress Dowager,

132
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,040
the Saintess stayed with them.

133
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,920
They just talked about
some poems and essays

134
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,199
instead of anything else.

135
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,480
Why did Fan Xian go to see Shangshan Hu?

136
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
And he did it openly,
not afraid of being seen.

137
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,160
You came to see me

138
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,600
openly like this.

139
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,319
Shen Zhong is bound to find it out.

140
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,199
Won't he find it out

141
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,319
if we meet in a concealed place?

142
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:06,399
Even if I choose a concealed place,

143
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,199
your subordinate Tan Wu

144
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,040
showed up twice
at the gate of the mission's residence.

145
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,920
Do you think Shen Zhong
wouldn't notice it?

146
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:12,959
Besides,

147
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,079
even if I don't come to see you,

148
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,839
will Shen Zhong stop

149
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,759
taking strict precautions against you?

150
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,199
Now that you dare to see me,

151
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,759
I don't think you're afraid of

152
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,439
Shen Zhong.

153
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,720
Am I right?

154
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:54,800
I really want to kill you.

155
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,439
Why do you say that?

156
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,959
Judging from your style,

157
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,399
you'll be a formidable enemy of Beiqi.

158
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,839
How will you save Master Xiao En

159
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,560
if I'm dead?

160
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,120
Have you found out where he is?

161
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,079
Exactly.

162
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,480
How did you know

163
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,519
It's not important.

164
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:10,399
Where is he?

165
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,480
I think

166
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,680
it's better to figure out a plan first.

167
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,360
We shouldn't do it hastily, right?

168
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,399
What do you want to do?

169
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,920
Shen Zhong is so cruel

170
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,759
to Master Xiao.

171
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,480
Do you want to take revenge?

172
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,000
Go ahead.

173
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,960
Actually, it's easy to guess.

174
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,480
What he wants

175
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,679
is just Xiao En.

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,879
But Fan Xian doesn't know

177
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,360
where Xiao En is imprisoned.

178
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,960
Do you know why

179
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,919
I detained Xiao En?

180
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,240
No. I don't.

181
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,679
Just for this moment.

182
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:53,240
Go to

183
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,360
get He Daoren and Langtao here.

184
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,440
Got it.

185
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,120
Thank you, Grand General!

186
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,399
It's such a pleasure

187
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:12,120
to ride a horse

188
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,799
and chat with you.

189
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,759
See you!

190
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,480
Spread the word.

191
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,440
Do as planned

192
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,679
by Fan Xian.

193
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,799
Do it tomorrow!

194
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,840
Fan Xian is not necessarily
helping us with sincerity.

195
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,799
He wants to take advantage

196
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,480
of me

197
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,200
to kill Shen Zhong!

198
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,679
Your Excellency see it through?

199
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,519
Not quite!

200
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,960
I must kill

201
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,399
Shen Zhong anyway!

202
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,120
Yeah!

203
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,639
According to the plan,

204
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,879
after getting adoptive father out,

205
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:53,000
Fan Xian is bound
to coordinate in person.

206
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,039
After getting out the Old Master,

207
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,679
we can only run to Nanqing.

208
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
When it comes, just take my order

209
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,519
to kill Fan Xian.

210
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,440
Then how will we go to Nanqing?

211
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:04,360
Who said

212
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,320
we have to go to Nanqing?

213
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,039
After killing Fan Xian,

214
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,759
we should run to the border quickly

215
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,039
and gather the army.

216
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,840
To revolt?

217
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,519
Fan Xian's misjudgment

218
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,039
is that he thinks

219
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,320
running towards Nanqing

220
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,720
is our only way to survive.

221
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,840
Everything is ready now!
We'll start tomorrow.

222
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,159
I've met Shangshan Hu.

223
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,279
Considering Shen Zhong's intelligence,

224
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:40,799
he must know
someone will rescue Xiao En.

225
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:42,240
You want to create the deadlock

226
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,320
like the tug of war?

227
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,399
Either of them has to die anyway.

228
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,120
Which one of them?

229
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,480
It makes no difference.

230
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,039
It's good to Nanqing

231
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,000
for either of them

232
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,679
to die.

233
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,519
Shen Zhong can't be killed.

234
00:10:58,559 --> 00:10:59,000
What?

235
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,840
Shen Zhong can't be killed.

236
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,039
Why?

237
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,519
He Daoren lets you

238
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,000
take over the Neiku's shop at Shangjing,

239
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,639
right?

240
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:07,360
Yes!

241
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,000
The account book has problems.

242
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,480
What are the problems?

243
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,759
All the account books
handed in by Shangjing

244
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,320
to the capital city will be reviewed

245
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,200
by the Investigator's Office
over the years.

246
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,120
It is very different from
what is recorded here.

247
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,200
So,

248
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,559
So all the account books

249
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,039
received by the Investigator's Office
are fake.

250
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,000
Judging from these,

251
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,480
someone in the middle

252
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,000
has held back

253
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,919
a big amount of money.

254
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,240
Trafficking!

255
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:44,200
That looks like
the Princess Royal's idea.

256
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,240
The worse thing is

257
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:47,759
that this sum of money

258
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,919
was delivered to Nanqing territory

259
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,600
by Shen Zhong's
Embroidered Uniform Guards.

260
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,200
Why would Shen Zhong help

261
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,240
Li Yunrui with her illegal dealing?

262
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:56,919
To make money from it?

263
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,720
Shen Zhong is not greedy for money.

264
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,600
There is only one possibility

265
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,279
for him to agree with it.

266
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,840
As to the profit,

267
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,879
will eventually lead to the civil strife
of our dynasty.

268
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,120
How much is it?

269
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,679
It's enough
to raise a camp of private army

270
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,039
after so many years of accumulation.

271
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,000
Armors, weapons, provisions,

272
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,039
and horses

273
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:22,759
are all the best type.

274
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,080
They are enough to revolt

275
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,240
at critical times.

276
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,360
I'm afraid Princes Royal

277
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,440
is not the only one involved.

278
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,279
Princess Royal has been
with the Crown Prince all the time.

279
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,240
Is it a scheme from the Eastern Palace?

280
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,559
We have to ask Shen Zhong

281
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,159
for the truth.

282
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:42,919
Who?

283
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,960
properly.

284
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,919
He won't tell us.

285
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,879
Then think of a way.

286
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,240
Or you may marry

287
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,799
his younger sister

288
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,200
and become his family member.

289
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:56,120
He will tell you

290
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,799
whatever you ask.

291
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:57,679
Fan Xian,

292
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,399
this is critically important

293
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:00,559
and allows no jokes.

294
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,039
So you are aware this is a joke!

295
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,639
Mr. Yan,

296
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,200
do you know what you're talking about?

297
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Do you know

298
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,399
how much efforts I made

299
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,399
to work
between different powers in Beiqi

300
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,240
before I finally get tomorrow's chance

301
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,639
to kill Shen Zhong?

302
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,320
And you just said

303
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,639
Shen Zhong can't be killed.

304
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,600
And you want me

305
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,960
to ask something confidential from him.

306
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,039
Who do you think I am?!

307
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,120
Do you think I'm god?

308
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,240
Try to catch him alive

309
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,639
and extract his confession by torturing.

310
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,440
This is Shangjing.

311
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,039
You want me to

312
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,360
catch Shen Zhong alive here and extract
his confession by torturing!

313
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:53,679
If Yan Bingyun

314
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,679
I'm not ready to die yet.

315
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,840
Head asked He Daoren to give you hints.

316
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,799
He probably found something suspicious.

317
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,200
That's the mission

318
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,519
given to you and me by Head.

319
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:09,159
Fine!

320
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,360
Then ask Chen Pingping

321
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,320
to come and investigate in person.

322
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,879
Fan Xian, mind your identity!

323
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:14,600
What's my identity?

324
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:15,840
Director-General of
the Investigator's Office.

325
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:16,720
So what?

326
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,720
Since you and I have joined
the Investigator's Office,

327
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,559
we should follow the Head's command

328
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:22,879
to fight for Nanqing

329
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,120
regardless of life and death.

330
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:27,799
What if

331
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,919
I want to stay alive?

332
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,639
I was right.

333
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,480
People like you

334
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,639
don't deserve to be the Director-General
of the Investigator's Office.

335
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,080
It's a deal.

336
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,399
We rescue Xiao En tomorrow

337
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,960
and take the chance to kill Shen Zhong.

338
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,039
This is an

339
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:55,759
unstoppable plan!

340
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,159
You're still not physically recovered.

341
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,759
It's better for you to stay indoors.

342
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,039
According to what Fan Xian said,
this is the place.

343
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,159
Go to the top of the mountain

344
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,759
and act according to the plan.

345
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,399
Yes!

346
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,039
Commander,

347
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,519
some people broke in the yard.

348
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,240
Set out!

349
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,039
Split up and sneak in!

350
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,399
Find adoptive father
as soon as possible!

351
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:27,840
Yes!

352
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,599
Your Excellency, I am Tan Wu!

353
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,599
I'm here to get you out
as requested by the Grand General!

354
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,279
Your Excellency, I found him.

355
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:39,839
I got him!

356
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:40,880
Let's rush out!

357
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,240
It's a trap!

358
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,200
Let's escape from the back yard!

359
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,880
Go back! Go!

360
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,680
We're besieged.

361
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,079
It is planned in advance.

362
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,000
Is it a trap set up

363
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,880
by Shen Zhong and Fan Xian?

364
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,000
That doesn't matter anymore.

365
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,440
Brothers,

366
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:25,400
let's fight to death together.

367
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:26,240
Grand General,

368
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,799
you're of the Ninth Dan.

369
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,240
There is still chance

370
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,319
to survive

371
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:31,039
if you fight alone.

372
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,559
Running away on my own

373
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,279
is not something I will do.

374
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,240
If you don't go,

375
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,759
who will avenge us?

376
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,400
Grand General,

377
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,160
Stop it!

378
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:51,319
Please avenge us!

379
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,920
Please avenge us!

380
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:20,680
Commander!

381
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:21,519
How is it?

382
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,920
We have besieged them.

383
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,400
Let's take a look!

384
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:33,480
Yes!

385
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,400
Stop!

386
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,400
properly.

387
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,799
Where is Shangshan Hu?

388
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,599
Commander,

389
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,680
they are all the ones left

390
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,400
when we besieged them.

391
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,960
It's not easy to catch
a martial arts master of Ninth Dan

392
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,519
if he wants to escape.

393
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,559
Tan...

394
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,680
Tan Wu!

395
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:39,480
I have met you before!

396
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:43,359
I keep Xiao En

397
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,880
as a bait to attract Shangshan Hu.

398
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,519
I'm already too eager
to wait any longer.

399
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,400
Shangshan Hu.

400
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,039
What does this have to do with him?

401
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,319
You still want to protect him?

402
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,000
We started this simultaneously.

403
00:20:58,079 --> 00:20:58,880
It has nothing to do with others.

404
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,359
It's doesn't matter
whether you admit it or not.

405
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,839
You are Shangshan Hu's personal guard.

406
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:04,920
Catching you

407
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,039
is enough to convict him.

408
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,680
The border army
has gone through many battles.

409
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,759
No one ever allows himself to be
seized without putting up a fight.

410
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,079
I know you want to fight to death.

411
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,759
I don't care!

412
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:20,480
Your corpse is equally enough

413
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,880
to convict Shangshan Hu.

414
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,720
What will be the charges?

415
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,319
You will be the charges.

416
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,599
How do you convict him

417
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,680
with a bunch of faceless corpses?

418
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:51,559
You want to burn up the traces?

419
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,920
Your gravestone will not even

420
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,640
have any names.

421
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,160
We've been arrogant
and rebellious while living.

422
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:00,559
It's fair enough
to die into lonely ghosts.

423
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,319
His Excellency Xiao
is unimaginably outstanding

424
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,240
and shall not be humiliated
with another kidnapping.

425
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,720
Let him go with us together today!

426
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,519
Do it! Do it now!

427
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:13,839
Protect His Excellency!

428
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,880
Fan Xian set me up
and Shen Zhong killed me!

429
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:29,480
Fan Xian set me up
and Shen Zhong killed me!

430
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,880
Hurry up!

431
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,119
Fetch more water!

432
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,680
They deserve to
be the border army of Beiqi!

433
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,720
What a pity!

434
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,400
They are all charred.
Absolutely no chance of surviving!

435
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,799
This is Xiao En judging
from the body shape.

436
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,440
How about the leg injury?

437
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,920
The leg injury matches as well.

438
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:29,799
Is it a new injury?

439
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,680
Yes!

440
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,240
It's an injury caused recently.

441
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:34,279
How about teeth?

442
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,640
Three teeth missing.
The position is correct.

443
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
So this is Xiao En without a doubt.

444
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:42,640
Your Excellency.

445
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:45,279
I think it's a bit strange

446
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,960
that Xiao En just died like that.

447
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,720
It's sort of...

448
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,400
I think he is Xiao En.

449
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,839
Yeah, he surely is!

450
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,200
I'm just curious about

451
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,680
where Fan Xian is right now.

452
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,440
There it comes!

453
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,640
The last load?

454
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:46,359
Yeah, the last load.

455
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:56,279
31, 32,

456
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,400
33,

457
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,759
34,

458
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,400
35,

459
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,519
36,

460
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,279
36, 37,

461
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,359
38,

462
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,680
39.

463
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,559
Well...

464
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,359
Well...

465
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
How come there is an extra one?

466
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:09,799
They are warriors.

467
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,400
Bury them together.

468
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:12,480
Sure!

469
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,839
Let's get back to town

470
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,759
and visit the Grand General.

471
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,160
It's all blocked
in the direction to town

472
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:58,480
especially

473
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,200
in the direction to
the Grand General's residence.

474
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,319
Commander-in-Chief of
Embroidered Uniform Guard

475
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,559
Shen Zhong pays respects

476
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,759
to the Grand General!

477
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,359
Greetings to you, Grand General!

478
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,799
I have something to report

479
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,160
and have to bother you with it.

480
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,200
Today, we got some rebels
that tried to break in the prison

481
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:09,759
and take Xiao En away.

482
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:11,799
Fortunately, they didn't run away.

483
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,079
We caught them.

484
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:14,960
What are these people like?

485
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,759
I've no idea.

486
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,119
Those rebels burnt themselves.

487
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,640
It's hard to tell their identity.

488
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,559
Why do you

489
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,200
report something like this to me?

490
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,720
Because Xiao En

491
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,839
was also burnt to death.

492
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,640
He is, after all, your adoptive father.

493
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,279
It's necessary to report it to you.

494
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,240
Alright!

495
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,200
These rebels from today charged

496
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,039
with spears like this as well.

497
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,640
What do they look like?

498
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,440
We can't tell
as they have their face masked.

499
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,599
Do you know anyone else

500
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,960
who uses this type of spear,
Grand General?

501
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:12,000
I don't know.

502
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,039
Grand General,

503
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,720
you spear seems
to have the smell of blood.

504
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,799
So what?

505
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,680
It's just off the top of my head.

506
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:32,920
Good spear!

507
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:35,200
Well,

508
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,440
I've got one more thing to report.

509
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,240
Empress Dowager

510
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,039
has been hesitant about

511
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,359
whether to use Xiao En or not

512
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,559
in future.

513
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,799
You know it very well that

514
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,680
I've been cruel to Xiao En.

515
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,839
If he is really used,

516
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,279
what shall I do

517
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,599
in future?

518
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,559
What do you think?

519
00:29:58,759 --> 00:29:59,920
You do feel afraid?

520
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,839
I'm timid as always

521
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,680
and naturally feel afraid.

522
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,559
I've considered killing Xiao En,

523
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,000
But Her Majesty

524
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,559
the Empress Dowager won't spare me.

525
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,839
Those rebels tried
to break into the prison

526
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,160
only to have him killed,

527
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,200
which helps me
eliminate the hidden danger.

528
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,960
I should congratulate you on this then,

529
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,200
Your Excellency,

530
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,839
Grand General, do you know

531
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:35,200
I'll have Langtao

532
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,680
and He Daoren guarding in the dark.

533
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:39,200
If there is really someone

534
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,279
replace Xiao En secretly,

535
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,440
only with two Ninth Dan masters
joining hands

536
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,920
can we really eliminate a hidden danger.

537
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,400
If someone escapes in the chaos,

538
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:51,880
is it possible that

539
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,160
he runs to your residence?

540
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,640
If no one comes till now,

541
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,440
I think he should probably

542
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,000
be dead already.

543
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,920
This is really a good spear.

544
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,799
If nobody saves him,

545
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,640
there is really no reason
for me to kill him.

546
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,400
Grand General,

547
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,319
who do you think

548
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,160
victimized Xiao En?

549
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,920
I probably should leave for now.

550
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:37,440
Excuse me!

551
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,079
Shangshan Hu is invincible.

552
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,720
His prestige in the army
is increasing each day.

553
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:08,240
If we leave him like that,

554
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,920
he will become a great threat to Beiqi.

555
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,880
If he attempted to kill me today,

556
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,640
we can surely convict him with it.

557
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
It's a pity that

558
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:19,519
If he really attempted to,
Your Excellency...

559
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,319
As Embroidered Uniform Guards,

560
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,480
we take charge of the prison
and punishment.

561
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,720
We usually arrest thieves,
bandits and malefactors secretly

562
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:26,440
and often interrogate them

563
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,039
in the most merciless and ruthless way.

564
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,519
All that is to ensure safety of Beiqi.

565
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:31,279
If my death today

566
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,920
can be traded for
the imprisonment of this rebel,

567
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,920
it's nothing to be afraid of.

568
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:42,640
What a pity!

569
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,519
It's a pity that

570
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,039
He Daoren.

571
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,960
Shen Zhong is adept in scheming.

572
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,279
What are you waiting for?

573
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,679
He is old anyway.

574
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,960
Time kills most,

575
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:14,320
doesn't it?

576
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,800
Shen Zhong sent you here?

577
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:21,840
Yes!

578
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,840
Tell Shen Zhong you lost him

579
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,599
and give him to me.

580
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,199
No,

581
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,360
Or tell Shen Zhong

582
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,400
he slipped off the precipice.

583
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,440
Don't worry!

584
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,920
I won't allow him to show up again.

585
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,840
I'm not the only one
who come to kill him.

586
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,320
Langtao is there!

587
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,320
Shen Zhong really thinks too much of me.

588
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,880
How about Ku He?

589
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,679
Why hasn't he come?

590
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,039
My master enjoined me

591
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:33,880
not to let you live.

592
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,760
I can't disobey it.

593
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:37,599
Please excuse me for that.

594
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,440
As Ku He's apprentice,

595
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,199
you're just like him.

596
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,800
Seemingly righteous and merciful,

597
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,199
but actually crafty and wicked

598
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,920
in private.

599
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,559
Kill me as you wish!

600
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,880
Don't make it seem so aggrieved.

601
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,960
I must save him.

602
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,559
I can't help you.

603
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:33,079
Shen Zhong has started to doubt me.

604
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,159
You don't need to do it publicly.

605
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,239
Just stop him
with a few moves in the dark.

606
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,800
It's an abyss over there.

607
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,840
You can't escape.

608
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,760
That's not your business.

609
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,320
Watch out!

610
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,119
Your Majesty!

611
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:42,800
Your Majesty!

612
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:44,639
Your Majesty!

613
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,679
I'm fine! I'm OK!

614
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,840
I just had a bad dream.

615
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,119
I was worried and rushed in abruptly.

616
00:38:57,679 --> 00:38:58,519
I'm willing to take penalty.

617
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,000
Any news from our mission to Beiqi?

618
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,000
Your Majesty,

619
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,639
the Beiqi capital city

620
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,360
is too far away from here.

621
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:09,519
It takes a long time

622
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,840
to deliver messages.

623
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:13,280
We haven't got any till now.

624
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:15,960
Your Majesty.

625
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:17,960
you've been away from the palace

626
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,559
for a few days.

627
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,599
Empress Dowager

628
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,000
is a bit worried.

629
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,400
OK!

630
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,599
Leave me! Leave me!

631
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,079
Yes!

632
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,599
There is no trace.

633
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,199
I'm afraid they are dead.

634
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:56,800
Who is the guy bumping in?

635
00:39:58,159 --> 00:39:58,800
I've no idea.

636
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,400
We must find their corpses if dead.

637
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,000
Search down there!

638
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,360
We just sorted out
the battlefield report

639
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,519
for Fan Xian's battle at the border.

640
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,199
The news has been intermittent

641
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,360
ever since they reached Beiqi

642
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,639
and stopped altogether

643
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,079
after they reached Shangjing.

644
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,960
Yan Bingyun was captured.

645
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,920
The agent network lurks in Shangjing.

646
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:08,119
That's something beyond our control.

647
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:10,719
Fei Jie is investigating
Fan Xian's affair.

648
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,920
Don't let him see this report.

649
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:14,440
Don't worry. This is the only copy.

650
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,199
Fan Xian's whereabouts
is unknown at the moment.

651
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,199
Don't you have any other agent

652
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,920
in Shangjing?

653
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:25,440
If I had,

654
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:28,280
Yan Bingyun wouldn't have been captured.

655
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,719
Go there and check it out.

656
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:36,559
Yes!

657
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,000
You guys go to the woods.

658
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:49,679
Yes! Yes!

659
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:58,360
Report, no one on this side.

660
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,400
How is Xiao En's injury?

661
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:06,239
The cut on his chest
leaves him no chance of surviving.

662
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,960
He can't be saved.

663
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,840
Whoever wants to save him,

664
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,679
it will end up in vain.

665
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,519
Wait for a few more minutes!

666
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:24,119
If we can find the corpse,

667
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,960
it will be an explanation

668
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,719
to Commander Shen.

669
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,760
Report, no findings.

670
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,599
Search harder!

671
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,360
Yes!

672
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,800
Any news from Fan Xian?

673
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,800
Nothing abnormal
after they reached Shangjing.

674
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:44,480
Is there any battlefield report?

675
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,239
No.

676
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,880
Shadow!

677
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,599
Why?

678
00:42:54,679 --> 00:42:55,199
Because you've been holding

679
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,760
something back from me.

680
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:07,800
Nobody ever sees

681
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,280
what Shadow looks like

682
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,159
over the years.

683
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:18,960
It's you.

684
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:56,000
What's wrong with Shadow?

685
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:56,880
He fell asleep.

686
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,159
Did you see his face?

687
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:01,239
I did.

688
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,440
Don't disclose his identity!

689
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:06,679
Fan Xian encountered

690
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,440
Haitang Duoduo,

691
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,559
Yan Xiaoyi and Shangshan Hu
in the battle at the border.

692
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:15,119
His life is in grave danger.

693
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,800
Where are you black knights?

694
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,159
I withdrew the black knights
from the mission.

695
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:21,360
You know well that

696
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,960
the journey is full of danger.

697
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:26,039
You're killing him.

698
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:27,000
He is still alive.

699
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,119
Chen Pingping,

700
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,280
I won't allow you

701
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,119
to let Fan Xian be your puppet.

702
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,440
He is the only and last apprentice

703
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,480
I have.

704
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:39,239
I'll ensure his safety

705
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,360
even if it means to work against you.

706
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,039
I've hidden the report

707
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,400
about Fan Xian very well.

708
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:47,199
Your technique of applying poison
is indeed unparallel,

709
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,000
but

710
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,920
perceiving chances

711
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,320
is not something you're good at.

712
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:52,719
There must be someone helping you.

713
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,760
He is right here, isn't he?

714
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:00,760
He's got it right.

715
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,159
Come out for a meeting then!

716
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,159
I knew it is you!

717
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,599
It's not detected

718
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:15,119
in the yard till now.

719
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:17,039
Only you are able to do so.

720
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,639
You said

721
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:20,960
it was meant to help Fan Xian

722
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:22,239
to gain success and fame
for him to go to Beiqi.

723
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,199
I did say that.

724
00:45:23,719 --> 00:45:24,760
You also promised

725
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,880
to ensure his safety.

726
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:26,960
I did!

727
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:28,320
But you withdrew the black knights

728
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,559
protecting the mission anyhow

729
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:31,079
and allowed him to take the risk alone.

730
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,519
You want to victimize him.

731
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:34,239
He is alive!

732
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:35,559
You leave him

733
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:37,199
facing several Ninth Dan
martial arts masters alone.

734
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,119
Allow him to continue!

735
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,199
What I did

736
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,239
is meant to figure out

737
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,280
the secret of Xiao En.

738
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:45,800
What does it have to do with Fan Xian?

739
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,679
He didn't disclose it
in all those years,

740
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,280
surely not to Fan Xian either.

741
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,440
I think he will.

742
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:51,599
Why?

743
00:45:56,199 --> 00:45:57,880
I can tell you the reason behind,

744
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:01,280
but he can't listen to it.

745
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:04,599
Do you think

746
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:05,519
I dare not take action against you?

747
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,360
We're going to meet him.

748
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,360
Whom?

749
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:10,880
Whose arrangement was it

750
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,760
to withdraw the black knights?

751
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,360
Trust me!

752
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,679
I'll go with him

753
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:19,119
for this matter.

754
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,000
You can't go!

755
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:24,679
Wait! What if

756
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:25,559
I do?

757
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:30,440
I know you don't fear death,

758
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:32,079
but you can help Fan Xian

759
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,440
as long as you stay alive.

760
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,000
I promise.

761
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:37,519
if Fan Xian really dies,

762
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,719
I'll avenge him with you
in the capital city.

763
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,320
If it were only He Daoren

764
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,920
and Langtao

765
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:57,239
in those years,

766
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,519
there is no chance for me to lose.

767
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:01,800
If an old man keeps talking
about his past years,

768
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:03,920
he is dying soon.

769
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:07,119
I am dying already.

770
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:20,119
The antidote is a waste on me.

771
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,079
Let me stop the bleeding first.

772
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:29,719
It's useless.

773
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:31,000
I know.

774
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:33,800
Langtao's cut
has broken my heart vessel.

775
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,039
What are you laughing at?

776
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:48,480
I'm laughing at you, Fan Xian.

777
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,679
What is there to laugh about me?

778
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:52,360
Nothing,

779
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,159
but you saved me.

780
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:56,400
I'm happy.

781
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,360
You start to talk nonsense.

782
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:06,280
So, black knights were withdrawn

783
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,119
so that Fan Xian got into trouble

784
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,199
because you gave the order,
Your Majesty.

785
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:12,840
If you want to kill Fan Xian,

786
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,079
you just need
to issue an imperial edict.

787
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,800
It's unnecessary to drag
in so many people

788
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,239
and even send him to Beiqi.

789
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:19,639
In the final analysis,

790
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:21,559
he's just a common official.

791
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:24,079
His life is up to you.

792
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,679
His Majesty sent Fan Xian there

793
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:30,800
to get the secret out of Xiao En.

794
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,559
How is it related to Fan Xian?

795
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,239
Xiao En has said nothing over the years.

796
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,639
Will he tell Fan Xian about it?

797
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,000
I think so.

798
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,320
You're not bleeding.

799
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:49,360
Haven't you laughed enough?

800
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:55,159
Life is full of mysteries and surprises.

801
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:00,480
Did you save me to get that secret?

802
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,360
I've given up on it.

803
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:05,679
I saved you for Shangshan Hu.

804
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,440
I fooled him once,

805
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:09,480
so I have to save you

806
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,480
if I want him to listen to me again.

807
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,920
It makes sense.

808
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,880
The wound left by Langtao
is so deadly that

809
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:17,800
even I can't save you.

810
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,920
It's true you're dying.

811
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,079
In this case,

812
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:22,000
I'll tell you

813
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,119
the secret.

814
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:25,480
Tell me?

815
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,639
It's a secret,

816
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:28,039
but actually, it's something simple.

817
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:28,559
Wait!

818
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:30,559
What?

819
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:32,880
I'm going to tell you about it.

820
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,000
Don't you want to listen?

821
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,159
You have no reason to do that.

822
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,760
Who's your father?

823
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:43,559
He's called Fan Jian.

824
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,079
Fan Jian.

825
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,119
What does he do?

826
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,119
He serves as Assistant Minister
of Ministry of Revenue.

827
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:52,320
I remember.

828
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,840
Chen Pingping and he
know each other well.

829
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,079
So what?

830
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,079
Now that Fan Jian
has been staying in the capital city,

831
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,960
why were you left in Danzhou?

832
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:02,960
Is it related to you?

833
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,039
Because I'm a bastard.

834
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:10,719
Who is your mother?

835
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:13,920
She's dead when I was born.

836
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:17,280
So you've never seen her.

837
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,480
What on earth do you want to say?

838
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:21,360
Do you know

839
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:24,559
your mother was murdered?

840
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,320
Of course I do.

841
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:30,239
Fan Jian is not your biological father.

842
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,360
Your real father

843
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,639
died long ago.

844
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,079
What did you just say?

845
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:37,679
Kid,

846
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,239
my son is your father.

847
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,760
You're my grandson.

848
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:47,760
What the heck?

849
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,880
What did Shen Zhong do to you?

850
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,639
I know.

851
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,400
You may have doubts

852
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,800
more or less.

853
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:00,559
Come on.

854
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:02,000
It's sheer nonsense.

855
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:09,079
Xiao En's grandson?

856
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,039
Chen Pingping, are you muddleheaded?

857
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,360
When Xiao En was caught,

858
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:15,039
both his son and his daughter-in-law

859
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:16,079
died on the spot.

860
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:17,559
How could he have a grandson?

861
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:18,840
Before getting married,

862
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,320
Xiao En's son

863
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,480
stayed with another woman.

864
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:22,360
Who was she?

865
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,400
She was a prostitute.

866
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,519
Xiao En's son bought back her freedom

867
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,679
and hid her in a private house.
Then she got pregnant.

868
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,559
When Xiao En found it out,

869
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,280
he ordered his son to break up with her

870
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,599
because he was strict with his son.

871
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,519
Then he asked his son

872
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:38,039
to marry a girl

873
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,280
from a family of equal status.

874
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,559
By rights, such a woman

875
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:43,599
should be killed
to avoid trouble later on.

876
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:44,920
But she was pregnant, anyway.

877
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:46,639
So I hid her somewhere,

878
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,599
I wanted to decide

879
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:49,679
whether to kill her or not

880
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,480
after she gave birth.

881
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:55,920
She's your mother.

882
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,159
When she was in the whorehouse,

883
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,559
she was called Yuxiang.

884
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,039
It became her name.

885
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,960
Yuxiang? Come on.

886
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,199
What the heck

887
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:10,920
are you talking about?

888
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,400
Since I was arrested,

889
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:16,119
I'd been cruelly tortured.

890
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:18,039
The only thing that made me want to live

891
00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:20,079
is that kid.

892
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:21,880
But in the end,

893
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:23,880
Chen Pingping found it out.

894
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,599
Didn't they kill him?

895
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,159
but who will mourn Master Xiao

896
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:27,920
I'd find no point

897
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,079
in living anymore.

898
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:31,159
During that period,

899
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:32,920
he kept

900
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,599
telling me something about you

901
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,039
to sound me out and threaten me.

902
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,840
But you said nothing.

903
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:40,920
If I had,

904
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,400
both of us would've died.

905
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,119
Only by keeping silent

906
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:46,360
would you be safe.

907
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,519
At that time,

908
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:53,719
I wanted to push Xiao En

909
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:55,480
to tell us the secret

910
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,280
by threatening to kill that kid.

911
00:52:58,119 --> 00:52:58,800
And then?

912
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:01,639
What tortures a person most
is not threats,

913
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:03,679
but hope.

914
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:05,880
His Majesty is far-sighted.

915
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,559
No one else can match him.

916
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,079
It's true that

917
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,039
Xiao En

918
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:12,239
wouldn't give in

919
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:14,360
to threats.

920
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,960
Finally,

921
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:17,960
as His Majesty suggested,

922
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,280
I told Xiao En I'd make the kid

923
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,719
become one of Nanqing people

924
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:22,559
and a solider

925
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,519
that hates Beiqi.

926
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:26,760
I said I'd let the kid

927
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,239
ruin all his hopes

928
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:30,360
when the kid grows up.

929
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,880
That's malicious.

930
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,960
It's your style.

931
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,639
That's why he believed.

932
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:42,599
Over the years,

933
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,199
I told him

934
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:45,360
all little things

935
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:46,000
about the kid.

936
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:47,679
Did you tell him

937
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:50,039
the kid was brought up in Danzhou?

938
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:51,920
No, I didn't.

939
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:54,360
He didn't say where you were living,

940
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:56,079
but he didn't know

941
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,360
I'm familiar with

942
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,920
many cities of Nanqing

943
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,920
to better fight against them.

944
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:03,480
So,

945
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,320
according to all the details

946
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,400
and the layout of streets

947
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:08,559
he revealed by accident,

948
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,199
I'm sure you were in Danzhou.

949
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:12,440
You guessed?

950
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,039
I put all the fragmented information

951
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:15,760
together

952
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,480
and then found the answer.

953
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,599
I couldn't get it wrong.

954
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,000
Xiao En is suspicious

955
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,519
and confident by nature.

956
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,519
If I told him it's Danzhou,

957
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:31,000
he couldn't believe it.

958
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:33,840
I have to let him guess the answer.

959
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:35,679
Then he'd have no doubts.

960
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,280
What if he failed to guess it?

961
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,039
He's smart.

962
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,599
A smart person

963
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:42,760
considers himself

964
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:45,599
always right.

965
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,000
I guessed you were in Danzhou,

966
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,440
but

967
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,519
I'd never showed any signs.

968
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:55,079
Danzhou is a big place.

969
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,280
Why is it me?

970
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:57,719
You're at the right age.

971
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,519
There are lots of guys at my age.

972
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,400
It's you that took me back to Beiqi.

973
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:03,239
So what?

974
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:05,079
If Chen Pingping

975
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:06,360
wanted to advance your career,

976
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,239
he couldn't have withdrawn
black knights.

977
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,639
The Investigator's Office is powerful.

978
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:11,639
They must've guessed

979
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:12,519
Hu'er would come to save me.

980
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:14,280
He withdrew black knights

981
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:16,199
to let you deal with that all alone

982
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,079
just because

983
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,239
he wanted to see me kill you.

984
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:25,880
He is Fan Xian,

985
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,400
Director-General of
the Investigator's Office.

986
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:28,119
He'll escort you.

987
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:29,679
Nice to see you, Senior Xiao.

988
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,079
Are you going to escort me?

989
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:31,880
Yup!

990
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:33,239
Who are these people to you?

991
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,400
Master Fei is my teacher.

992
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,840
The Head is my senior friend.

993
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:38,320
They all treat me like families.

994
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,559
Take a good look at this kid.

995
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:42,679
This will be your last chance.

996
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:46,079
It doesn't make sense.

997
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,679
Let me guess.

998
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:49,000
They asked you to kill me

999
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,079
on the way here, right?

1000
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,400
Don't you think they're contradictory?

1001
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,639
They wanted you to kill me

1002
00:55:58,639 --> 00:55:59,880
but they didn't care about your safety.

1003
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,360
So, who on earth did he want to kill?

1004
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,639
Either.

1005
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:04,840
You kill me

1006
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,599
or I kill you.

1007
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,599
He'd be glad to see either of us die.

1008
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:09,920
If I kill you,

1009
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,239
he'll tell me the truth

1010
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,280
and let me realize

1011
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,199
I've killed my only grandson.

1012
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,159
In this world,

1013
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,320
crueler than that.

1014
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:23,039
It's just a guess.

1015
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:24,519
But it makes sense.

1016
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,559
In this case,

1017
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:27,480
everything makes sense.

1018
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:30,280
Over the years,

1019
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,280
they left you alone in Danzhou,
showing no interest at all.

1020
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:35,119
But suddenly,
you were transferred to the capital city

1021
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,119
and promoted quickly.

1022
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:39,320
They just wanted
to create an opportunity

1023
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,880
so that we hurt each other.

1024
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:41,519
Moreover,

1025
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:44,119
why didn't they disable me before I left

1026
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,119
so that I can't use my martial arts?

1027
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,920
Because they want to see me kill you

1028
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,159
and regret it.

1029
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:56,559
Do you have any concrete evidence?

1030
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,360
Such as a jade pendant or a birthmark

1031
00:56:58,559 --> 00:56:59,280
that can prove my identity.

1032
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:02,920
No.

1033
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,400
Why didn't you prepare

1034
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,800
some concrete evidence?

1035
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,039
Keep your voice down.

1036
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,679
You scared the fish away.

1037
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,960
It's His Majesty's idea.

1038
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,760
What's most amazing about it

1039
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,039
is that no concrete evidence
is prepared.

1040
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,320
The more concrete evidence there is,
the more suspicious he'd be.

1041
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,559
The more contradictions I created,

1042
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,000
the more convinced he'd be of
Fan Xian's identity.

1043
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,119
What a good plan!

1044
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:36,039
A battlefield of human feelings

1045
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,360
is most breathtaking.

1046
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:43,880
The only thing Chen Pingping got wrong

1047
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,000
is that he didn't expect

1048
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,960
I've guessed

1049
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,079
you were in Danzhou.

1050
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,119
In the end, the only loophole

1051
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,119
made me

1052
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:51,800
find out the truth

1053
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:53,880
and stop us

1054
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:55,880
from fighting against each other.

1055
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:57,199
That's why

1056
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,679
you stopped Shangshan Hu killing me
at that time?

1057
00:57:59,000 --> 00:57:59,480
Yes.

1058
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:01,679
But you said nothing later

1059
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,760
on the way.

1060
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:04,760
Would you believe it

1061
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,199
if I had told you suddenly?

1062
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:08,800
But you're telling me about it now.

1063
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:10,920
Because I'm dying.

1064
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,000
No matter if you believe it or not,

1065
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:16,719
I have to tell you the truth.

1066
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:20,559
There is something weird.

1067
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,039
Why did Chen Pingping do so much

1068
00:58:23,039 --> 00:58:24,519
to torture you?

1069
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,159
Because it was me

1070
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:28,960
that broke his legs that year.

1071
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:30,599
He hates me like poison.

1072
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,519
When a person like Chen Pingping

1073
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:35,360
holds a grudge against someone,

1074
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:37,800
he wouldn't let it go

1075
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:39,360
even if 10 or 100 years have passed.

1076
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,880
He'd take revenge

1077
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,679
no matter

1078
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:46,159
how long he has to wait

1079
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,039
Xiao En knows me well.

1080
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:53,840
He knows that once I hate someone,

1081
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:56,760
I'd never forget about it.

1082
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,880
But there is one thing

1083
00:58:58,639 --> 00:58:59,599
he got wrong.

1084
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:02,280
I don't hate him.

1085
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:05,119
I caught him and killed his family,

1086
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,320
so he broke my legs.

1087
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:07,519
It's fair.

1088
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:10,480
I have no reason to hate him.

1089
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:12,079
If I didn't mishear it,

1090
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:13,800
you began to make up lies

1091
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,159
soon after you caught him.

1092
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:16,679
Yes.

1093
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,559
You've never stopped doing that
over the years.

1094
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,840
They became more convincing

1095
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,760
as time went by.

1096
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,960
You used Fan Xian as a pawn

1097
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,679
while he was just a baby.

1098
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,639
You know, it's not easy

1099
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,199
to deceive a smart person.

1100
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:33,239
It takes a long time.

1101
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:35,800
Have you ever thought about the risks?

1102
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,360
What if black knight were withdrawn

1103
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:39,599
and Xiao En was not that smart?

1104
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:40,719
What if he didn't get fooled

1105
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,920
and really killed Fan Xian?

1106
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,599
What would you do?

1107
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,239
Xiao En wouldn't believe it

1108
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,599
unless black knights were withdrawn.

1109
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,800
So, you're

1110
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,599
risking

1111
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,239
Fan Xian's life?

1112
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:53,880
Are you done yet?

1113
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,480
He's

1114
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,840
Ye Qingmei's son.

1115
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,039
Do you know

1116
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:09,519
The secret of Xiao En

1117
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:10,880
Xiao En's secret is about?

1118
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,840
The secret I mentioned

1119
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,440
is about a place

1120
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,960
and a person.

1121
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,239
Have you heard of the divine temple?

1122
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:24,199
Any temple for worshipping
is a divine temple.

1123
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:27,800
When heaven was separated from earth,
giant monsters ran wild.

1124
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,159
Master from the divine temple came
to earth with dignity and virtue,

1125
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:31,920
teaching mankind characters
and etiquette

1126
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,280
and helping mankind
cut mountains and make seas,

1127
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:35,039
thus laying foundation
for the human race.

1128
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:36,880
How could you not know that?

1129
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:38,960
The divine temple?

1130
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,840
Isn't it imaginary

1131
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:44,360
and nobody has ever been there?

1132
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:45,840
I saw it.

1133
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,000
Where?

1134
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,440
In the north. The farthest north.

1135
01:00:50,199 --> 01:00:50,840
The north?

1136
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:55,199
Do you know I have an elder brother?

1137
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:56,280
Zhuang Mohan?

1138
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,320
It turns out you knew it.

1139
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,199
He's my brother,

1140
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:02,880
so he's your granduncle

1141
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:03,719
or

1142
01:01:04,519 --> 01:01:05,440
great-uncle.

1143
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,920
He spit blood because of me

1144
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:10,199
in the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest.

1145
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,079
I heard!

1146
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,320
We're a family. It doesn't matter.

1147
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,599
Rising to fame at a young age,

1148
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,320
he's a famous literator.

1149
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,519
I didn't accomplish incredible things
at that time.

1150
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:22,639
I served as

1151
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:25,119
Head of Embroidered Uniform Guards,

1152
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,440
but many people thought

1153
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:28,719
I profited from association with him.

1154
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:30,239
I was not convinced,

1155
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,079
so I took my mother's surname.

1156
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,920
That is, your great grandma's surname.

1157
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,199
Enough.
Stop talking about the relatives.

1158
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:38,760
I've got so many elders

1159
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,679
in a short time.

1160
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:41,960
Fine.

1161
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,760
Let's get to the point.

1162
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,599
I got a new surname

1163
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,519
and decided to do something big.

1164
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:48,440
At that time,

1165
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,960
the late emperor focused on

1166
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,519
immortality.

1167
01:01:52,519 --> 01:01:54,360
He spent lots of time and money on it

1168
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,039
and finally got some clues

1169
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:57,280
Go ahead.

1170
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,719
