16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,159
Miss Si was shot accidentally.

17
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,000
She's fine now.

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,879
How can you

19
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,040
let her be injured?

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,120
Do you want to lose your head?

21
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,719
Who is she?

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,400
She's an old servant
in the imperial palace.

23
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,599
Your Excellency Shen,
no need to be flattering.

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,480
Unlike Nanqing,

25
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,920
Beiqi is a great country.

26
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,480
Such a great country was actually

27
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,199
so defeated as
to cede territory for mercy.

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,719
What did you just say?

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,159
I said Beiqi lost the war

30
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:11,960
and was utterly humiliated.

31
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,000
How dare you!

32
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:14,840
Let go of me!

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,240
Mammy!

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,759
Let go!

35
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,479
-Let go! -Fine.

36
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,039
We Nanqing people are straight-forward.

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,080
You asked me to let go,

38
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,039
so I let go.

39
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:25,400
Come on! Get up!

40
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,360
Look at you!

41
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,000
How could you watch him violate me

42
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:35,840
on our territory?

43
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,719
Humiliating the envoy

44
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,120
equals humiliating Nanqing.

45
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,759
If the war is restarted,

46
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,719
whose responsibility might that be?

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,680
You! You!

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,360
Mammy! Mammy!

49
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,039
Calm down!

50
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,400
-Come on! -I'm so pissed!

51
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,120
Come on! Calm down! Calm down!

52
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,240
That bastard

53
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,080
is too arrogant!

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,479
Take care!

55
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,240
Your Excellency Fan.

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,639
Where is Xiao En?

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,560
Your Excellency Xiao En!

58
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,520
Who are you?

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,800
I'm Shen Zhong,

60
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,520
Commander-in-chief
of Embroidered Uniform Guards.

61
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,800
I don't know you.

62
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,000
Sure! Sure! Sure!

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,000
When Your Excellency Xiao
rode the whirlwind in Nanqing and Beiqi,

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,360
I was nobody.

65
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,319
Your name is widely known.

66
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,879
I feel so excited

67
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,919
to finally see you in person.

68
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,360
Your Excellency Fan,

69
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,719
we'll escort His Excellency Xiao

70
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,159
from now on.

71
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,360
Of course.

72
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,920
Your Excellency Fan,

73
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,120
you just said that some people tried to

74
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,079
save His Excellency Xiao along the way.

75
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
I stopped them.

76
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,360
Your Excellency,

77
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,680
that's not right.

78
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,439
Have a look!

79
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:40,839
You're home now.

80
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,639
Why do you want to run away?

81
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,639
If you run away again halfway,

82
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,680
I won't be able to fulfill my task.

83
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,439
What do you think?

84
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:52,959
What do you want to do?

85
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,160
We should take our work

86
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,759
seriously.

87
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,480
Now it should be fine.

88
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,199
Your Excellency Xiao,
I'll take you to your carriage.

89
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,160
Knowing that you're coming back,

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,319
the Embroidered Uniform Guards

91
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,480
have specially made

92
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,519
an iron carriage for you.

93
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,240
It's an honor

94
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,720
no one else can enjoy.

95
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,560
Sorry to let you see this.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,720
Your Excellency,

97
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,240
how can you be so cruel to your people

98
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,639
but flattering to someone from Nanqing?

99
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Shame on you!

100
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,120
Calm down! Calm down!

101
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,319
Calm down!

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,759
I'll report your behaviors to

103
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,879
the Empress Dowager.

104
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,560
Wait a moment, please.

105
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,040
Please come with me.

106
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,040
What do you want?

107
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,240
I have my difficulty.

108
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,360
You'll know it after I tell you.

109
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,199
Come closer! Come closer! Come closer!

110
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,199
Come on! Come on!

111
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,920
Your Excellency Fan, wait a minute.

112
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,639
Why do you have to

113
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,759
talk here?

114
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,959
I know after serving the Empress Dowager
for many years,

115
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,480
you're bonded with Her Majesty.

116
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,519
Do you want me to spare your life?

117
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,480
It seems that

118
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,519
you don't know me after all.

119
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,639
Sorry to keep you waiting.

120
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,120
Sorry to keep you waiting.

121
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,839
It's weird.

122
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,000
Anyhow,

123
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,480
after talking with her,

124
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:42,879
she felt so ashamed

125
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:43,839
that she left on her own,

126
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,399
saying that she would never
go back to Shangjing.

127
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,279
Do you have anything to say?

128
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,040
Different people have
different aspirations. Just let her go.

129
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,879
Let's get ready and set off soon.

130
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,839
His Majesty is anxious

131
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,879
to meet His Excellency Fan.

132
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,639
Meet me? Why?

133
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,240
You'll know
when you arrive in Shangjing.

134
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,279
By the way, Your Excellency Fan,

135
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,920
how's Head Chen doing recently?

136
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:13,680
He's fine.

137
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,800
Your Excellency Fan,

138
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,560
a word please.

139
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,480
Come here.

140
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,199
Your Excellency Fan,
did Head Chen give you

141
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
any task this time?

142
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:32,919
To take Yan Bingyun back.

143
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,519
Nothing else?

144
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,000
What else can there be?

145
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Let me make a bold guess.

146
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,679
If I guess wrong,

147
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,919
please don't laugh at me.

148
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,200
Firstly,

149
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,879
you should take Yan Bingyun back
of course.

150
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,360
Secondly,
since His Excellency Xiao is back,

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,279
Head Chen must be too worried to sleep.

152
00:08:50,919 --> 00:08:53,039
Perhaps he asked you to

153
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,120
assassinate His Excellency Xiao.

154
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,320
Find the chance to kill Xiao En

155
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,960
after taking back Yan Bingyun.

156
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,399
Anything else?

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,759
His Majesty himself specially requested

158
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,720
Si Lili be sent back.

159
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,600
It's a good chance to set a trap.

160
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:09,080
On our way back,

161
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,279
I'll check whether Miss Si Lili

162
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,159
is OK or not.

163
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,360
I made the poison of

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,320
Red Sleeve Edict myself.

165
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,360
Well,

166
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,200
Yan Bingyun is caught,

167
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
but he isn't the only secret agent

168
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,000
from the Investigator's Office

169
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,200
in Beiqi.

170
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,440
Did Head Chen send you here

171
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,960
to reorganize the intelligence network?

172
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,840
Stay vigilant to one person.

173
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,840
Shen Zhong, Commander-in-chief of
Embroidered Uniform Guards.

174
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,200
You must be careful with him.

175
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,600
It mustn't be someone good

176
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,279
who can be remembered by you.

177
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,440
If so,

178
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,440
what are you going to do?

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,759
Nonsense! Nonsense!

180
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,360
Your Excellency Fan, never mind.

181
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,879
Whatever you want to do

182
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,120
in Shangjing,

183
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,440
I'll keep you company.

184
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,240
Let's set off.

185
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,679
Your mission can follow us.

186
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,200
Your Excellency.

187
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,039
All my tasks in Beiqi,

188
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,639
he has guessed them right.

189
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,080
Shen Zhong does live up to his name.

190
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,879
Then what should we do?

191
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,440
Just wait and see.

192
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,720
Shangjing Town of Beiqi

193
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,639
will be our battlefield.

194
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:51,919
Xiao En suffers a lot

195
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,120
from Shen Zhong along the way.

196
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,000
Your Excellency,

197
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,840
I just don't get it.

198
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,840
Xiao En used to be

199
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,799
an important official of Beiqi.

200
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,120
Why does Shen Zhong torture him?

201
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:04,759
Who knows?

202
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,279
Who are you?

203
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,559
Assassin! Catch that assassin!

204
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,000
Everyone! Assassin!

205
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,879
Assassin!

206
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,120
There's an assassin raiding the camps.

207
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,559
What would you do?

208
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,080
The assassin is raiding Beiqi's camps.

209
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,279
We're kind enough

210
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,480
not to join the attack.

211
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,000
That's right.

212
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,799
Here!

213
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,240
Circle the assassin around!

214
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,159
Don't let the assassin run away.

215
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,559
The assassin failed.

216
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,639
Get the assassin! Come on!

217
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:05,519
Stop.

218
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,519
The assassin runs into Nanqing's camps.

219
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,840
There's no one in the tent behind me.

220
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,879
Thank you.

221
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:47,320
A woman?

222
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,240
Who's she?

223
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,559
Who else can she be?

224
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:55,919
Which one?

225
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,639
That Saintess he fought at start
but fell in love with later.

226
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,720
Cut the crap! Don't seek death!

227
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,559
Put your weapons down! Put them down!

228
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,440
Make no mistake.

229
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,720
Your Excellency Fan,
sorry to bother you.

230
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,080
An assassin raided our camps.
Sorry to let you see this.

231
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,840
I saw the assassin running this way.

232
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,600
I wonder
whether you saw the assassin or not.

233
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,360
I saw her.

234
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,840
She's in the tent behind me.

235
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,159
Just go inside and search.

236
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:53,440
Don't you want to imply

237
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,799
our Nanqing mission
is behind the assassination?

238
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,279
Your Excellency,

239
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,720
what about capturing me as well?

240
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,480
Your Excellency Fan,

241
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,320
don't be angry.

242
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,120
If the assassin takes order from you,

243
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,639
she wouldn't have run to you.

244
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,159
How can I not know that?

245
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:09,679
She was running towards that direction.

246
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,360
You still don't believe me, right?

247
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:19,279
Come closer! Come closer! Come closer!

248
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,200
Your Excellency,

249
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,480
search the tent yourself.

250
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,159
No need! No need! No need!

251
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,279
Go back.

252
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,039
Leave!

253
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,200
Your Excellency Fan,

254
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm really sorry.

255
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,159
Sorry to bother you.

256
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,879
Please accept my apology.

257
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,320
Your Excellency Fan,
you also love to eat sweet potatoes.

258
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,039
They are good stuff.

259
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,320
Fragrant and sweet to eat.

260
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,799
Your Excellency Shen,
won't you chase after the assassin?

261
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,480
I didn't catch the assassin just now.

262
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:19,840
Now I won't be able
to catch the assassin.

263
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:21,799
Was the assassin injured by you?

264
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:25,879
It's Xiao En's blood.

265
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,639
I was talking with Senior Xiao

266
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,519
just now.

267
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,159
Your Excellency,

268
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,600
what on earth do you want to know?

269
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:34,600
I've no idea.

270
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,000
I've no idea.

271
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,480
I really don't.

272
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,240
I just know that

273
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,879
Chen Pingping kept him alive for so long

274
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,480
because of the secret he knows.

275
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,320
The Empress Dowager and His Majesty

276
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,600
want to know what it is.

277
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,399
Since Senior Xiao
doesn't want to tell me,

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,240
I have to ask him often.

279
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,799
He was an important official

280
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:57,919
of Beiqi.

281
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,559
Circumstances change
with the passage of time.

282
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,279
Plus he's the adoptive father
of Shangshan Hu,

283
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,200
he needs to be warned.

284
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,679
Isn't Shangshan Hu the Beiqi War God?

285
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,279
He's good at fighting battles indeed.

286
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,360
But that may not be a good thing.

287
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,480
Your Excellency Fan, to be honest,

288
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,159
Shangshan Hu is transferred
back to Shangjing.

289
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,200
Nominally, he is the Grand General,

290
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,360
but actually he's only got
one hundred private soldiers by his side.

291
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,279
A promotion nominally
but a demotion in fact,

292
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,279
he has lost the military power.

293
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,240
Indeed.

294
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,799
But he is to blame

295
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,799
for not understanding the situation.

296
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,559
In such a complicated situation,
he neither pledges allegiance to His Majesty

297
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,200
nor visits the Empress Dowager.

298
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,840
As officials,

299
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,360
if you're not loyal,

300
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
what can you get? Right?

301
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,480
Then whose side are you on?

302
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,759
I'm loyal to the Empress Dowager.

303
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,279
Your Excellency Shen,

304
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,319
you're really outspoken.

305
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,000
I admire scholars

306
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,240
all the time.

307
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,000
Your Excellency Fan,
talented as you are in poetry,

308
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,559
have you written
any masterpiece recently?

309
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,480
Well, have you figured out

310
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,799
the secret?

311
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,279
He refuses to talk. No hurry.

312
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,400
There's still a long time ahead.

313
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
You've made

314
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,759
Xiao En suffer.

315
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,480
If he stages a comeback

316
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,839
in future,

317
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,680
he surely will get back at you.

318
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,720
Chen Pingping is worried, right?

319
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,319
When you're back, tell Head Chen that

320
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,279
Xiao En has no chance.

321
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:55,720
Just think about it.

322
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,240
Even now, there's an assassin

323
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,200
trying to kill him.

324
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,440
Many people want him dead in Beiqi.

325
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,039
The number is no less than
that of Nanqing.

326
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,839
Well then, I will interrupt you no more.

327
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,200
is arriving in Shangjing soon.

328
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,079
Just like I said,

329
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,160
man should understand the situation.

330
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:17,359
Your Excellency Fan,

331
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:18,640
don't make it hard for me.

332
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,839
Take your time and enjoy the food.

333
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,000
Take them away.

334
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:54,319
He serves the Empress Dowager.

335
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,000
So do you.

336
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,279
How come you two

337
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,119
are fighting each other?

338
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,119
My teacher wants to kill Xiao En.

339
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,000
As an apprentice,
I have to obey her order.

340
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,119
So I kind of saved your life.

341
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,480
You lifted the curtain just now.

342
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
I'm bluffing. Don't you understand?

343
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,400
What if your plan doesn't work

344
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,720
and he actually catches me?

345
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:21,920
Then so be it.

346
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,960
How is that relevant to me?

347
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,799
Is it a joke for you?

348
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,240
Will you assassinate Xiao En again?

349
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,640
I have no chance.

350
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,759
After entering Shangjing,
I have no way to kill him.

351
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,279
Then when we reach Shangjing,

352
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:36,079
let's cooperate with each other.

353
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,640
How?

354
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:38,559
Anyway you like.

355
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,079
Whoever you find annoying,

356
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,119
I'll help you deal with him.

357
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:43,079
By collaborating with me from within,

358
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,079
we can bring trouble to the country.

359
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:45,880
What's in it for you?

360
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,240
I'm from Nanqing.

361
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,839
The more chaotic Beiqi is,

362
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,839
the happier I will be.

363
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,480
See you!

364
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,359
Just think about it.

365
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,279
She's gone?

366
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,519
Really?

367
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,440
She's gone.

368
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,680
It seems that Beiqi is really chaotic.

369
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,799
This might be our chance.

370
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,720
Right,

371
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,880
we can seize the chance
to take the Saintess back.

372
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,200
What're you thinking?

373
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,920
It's our chance
to fulfill the mission task.

374
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,279
Right! Right! Right!

375
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,279
It's a good excuse to fool the public.

376
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:33,920
Right!

377
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,319
Lend me some money.

378
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,319
Give me silver instead of bank notes.

379
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:44,960
I'll pay you twice as much
when we go back to the capital city.

380
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:46,640
Twice?

381
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,839
You two, turn around.

382
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:09,200
What's up?

383
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,480
At dawn tomorrow,

384
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
you should leave on your own.

385
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,240
Don't let others see you.

386
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,680
Go south to Shangjing Town,

387
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,920
and find a Tiaowang Inn.

388
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:18,119
Take the money, get yourself a room,

389
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,920
and stay there.

390
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,319
Why should I listen to you?

391
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,319
Only by helping me complete
the task of the Investigator's Office

392
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,440
can you get your father out of the jail.

393
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,359
Your Excellency, as you commanded,

394
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,880
our agents watch the place closely

395
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,119
and see a man from the Nanqing mission

396
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,359
slip away secretly.

397
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,279
Now he stays in
an inn south of Shangjing.

398
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,359
Should we catch him?

399
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,559
Leave him alone.

400
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,559
Let him stay there

401
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:10,640
as if we don't know.

402
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,559
Let's see what His Excellency Fan

403
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,319
will do next.

404
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,160
Yes.

405
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:25,960
Your Excellency,
we've arrived in Shangjing Town.

406
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,039
After taking Yan Bingyun back,

407
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,279
we can go home.

408
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,400
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

409
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,039
Your Excellency,
you feel something might go wrong.

410
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:39,759
Look!

411
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:41,960
Here comes trouble.

412
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:50,359
Greetings to you, Grand General!

413
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:52,960
Whatever it is,

414
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,000
just send me a message.

415
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,359
How come you're here in person?

416
00:22:56,119 --> 00:22:57,079
I want to see him?

417
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,440
See whom?

418
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,640
My adoptive father.

419
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,000
Who's your adoptive father?

420
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,200
Xiao En?

421
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,839
So Senior Xiao

422
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:10,319
is actually your adoptive father.

423
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,359
It's true that man
from a military family

424
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:13,359
is bound to be extraordinary.

425
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:14,799
Where is he?

426
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
He's here! He's here!

427
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,160
What happened?

428
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,920
I interrogated him
according to the imperial edict.

429
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,640
in the capital recently?

430
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,079
Exactly.

431
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:50,720
Grand General, since he's your father,

432
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,079
you can have a closer look at him.

433
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,559
What a pity!

434
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,000
I broke his legs,

435
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,759
or you might see him

436
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:00,200
stand up.

437
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,759
Grand General,
are you satisfied with what you see?

438
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:10,559
Give him to me.

439
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,519
I'm afraid I can't.

440
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,279
How dare you defy my order?

441
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:16,359
Grand General, you don't know.

442
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,319
His Majesty and
the Empress Dowager of Beiqi

443
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,960
ordered me to lock Xiao En up

444
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,920
in the Division of
Embroidered Uniform Guards.

445
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,559
I can't defy the imperial order.

446
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,720
Grand General,
what else can I do for you?

447
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,960
properly.

448
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:45,839
good for you.

449
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,839
Grand General,
thank you for the compliment.

450
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,960
I'm just loyal to my country.

451
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,319
Your Excellency.

452
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,240
Shen Zhong is not good at
dealing with other officials.

453
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,400
Right.

454
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,759
He's vicious and cruel,

455
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,559
but he's too arrogant

456
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,839
to restrain himself.

457
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,559
It will definitely get him into trouble.

458
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:16,839
Exactly.

459
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,480
Shangshan Hu almost

460
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,000
attacked him just now.

461
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,680
He did it on purpose.

462
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:23,920
On purpose?

463
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,519
From breaking Xiao En's legs
on the border

464
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,720
to torturing Xiao En cruelly
along the way,

465
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,640
he did all that to provoke Shangshan Hu.

466
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,359
Make Shangshan Hu attack him?

467
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:35,559
After all, Shangshan Hu
has brilliant achievements in war.

468
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,960
To punish him,

469
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,440
there should be a reason.

470
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:41,920
By making him attack the mission,

471
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,079
Shangshan Hu can be accused of
defying the imperial edict.

472
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,279
I'm afraid he will also

473
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,279
be accused of treason.

474
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,799
Who gave the order,

475
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,200
the Empress Dowager of Beiqi
or the little emperor?

476
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,319
Maybe both.

477
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:56,599
I didn't expect Shangshan Hu

478
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,400
to be so feared in Beiqi.

479
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:01,799
It's a good thing.

480
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,559
Really?

481
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:06,359
Your Excellency Fan,

482
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,599
His Majesty is anxious to see you.

483
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,680
I'm sorry that

484
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,680
you'll have to first meet His Majesty
in the imperial palace

485
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,920
and then go to your residence.

486
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,559
We can go inside now.

487
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,000
Won't Miss Si Lili
go to the imperial palace?

488
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,240
She has no status.

489
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,920
She should live outside the imperial palace
and wait for the chance.

490
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,839
Are you familiar with Miss Lili?

491
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,599
I caught her.

492
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,799
Won't Xiao En's carriage
go inside the town?

493
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,039
He will go inside from the West Gate.

494
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,839
You also see what happened just now.

495
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,680
We don't know what will happen

496
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,759
when we go inside.

497
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,319
When two counties are at war,
no messengers shall be killed.

498
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,559
Nanqing has won a landslide victory
this time.

499
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,960
When entering the town,

500
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,480
we certainly won't see people
welcoming us on both sides of the street,

501
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,440
but they can't go so far as
to throw rotten eggs at us.

502
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,759
Get out of Beiqi!

503
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,960
No envoy from Nanqing is welcome!

504
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,240
You! Get off!

505
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,359
Nanqing dogs!

506
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:24,160
You're not welcome! You're not welcome!

507
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,640
Get out of Beiqi! Get off!

508
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
Throw at him!

509
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,799
Get off! Get off!

510
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,880
Get off! Get off!

511
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,079
You're not welcome in Beiqi!

512
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:37,960
There're vegetables and eggs

513
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:39,160
enough for several meals.

514
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,079
Let's add dishes tonight.

515
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,599
Got it.

516
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,160
Get off!

517
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,279
Get off, Nanqing dogs!

518
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,599
You're not welcome!

519
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,599
Get out of Beiqi.

520
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,599
Our people are concerned
about national affairs.

521
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,240
Since we lost the battle,

522
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,359
they can't help feeling angry.

523
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,839
I'm afraid they're not
all common people.

524
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,359
You killed Cheng Jushu,

525
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,599
the martial arts master of Beiqi,
on the street.

526
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
Men in the army and on the streets
who practice martial arts

527
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,680
want to learn from you.

528
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,000
They are not bound by rules.

529
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,599
They might assassinate you
or make a sneak attack.

530
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:10,279
You'd better hide in the carriage.

531
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:12,400
It won't take long.

532
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,839
The Embroidered Uniform Guards

533
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:15,599
can't even keep their own capital
under control?

534
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,880
I'm really not competent enough.

535
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,519
Sorry! Sorry!

536
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,400
As the envoy of Nanqing,

537
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,759
if I hide in the carriage

538
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,079
on my way to the imperial palace,

539
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
I'm afraid I'll dishonor

540
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,279
my country completely.

541
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,640
If you don't hide,

542
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,279
with more rotten vegetables
and worn-out shoes coming,

543
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,000
it's not so honorable, either.

544
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,759
So I'll dishonor

545
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:35,960
my country either way.

546
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,079
I just can't quell the public anger.

547
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,319
You're really good.

548
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,799
You misunderstood me.

549
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,640
Wait!

550
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,640
Gao!

551
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,960
There's a long roll of cloth
on the carriage

552
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,119
which carries cargoes.

553
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:54,960
Bring it to me.

554
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,000
Yes, Your Excellency.

555
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:07,559
Your Excellency.

556
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,960
Wang, drive steadily.

557
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:14,640
I got it.

558
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:41,599
Everyone,

559
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,759
this is the battle flag of
the seventh battalion of

560
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,000
our frontier forces.

561
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:47,440
Fan Xian encountered

562
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,160
this is the first flag

563
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
put on

564
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,720
your territory.

565
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,519
Your Excellency Fan,

566
00:29:58,039 --> 00:29:59,200
it's dangerous
to incur the public anger.

567
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,559
If you do so, I can't help you.

568
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:09,880
Gao,

569
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,720
borrow me your sword.

570
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,519
OK.

571
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,000
Now,

572
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,240
this battle flag will also

573
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,200
be taken into your imperial palace.

574
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,119
This can make a much-told story.

575
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,519
Only the weak keep talking.

576
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,319
Whoever with courage and uprightness

577
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,799
should knock me down

578
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,079
and break the flagpole.

579
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,400
However,

580
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,319
I'm afraid there's no such man

581
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,640
in Beiqi anymore.

582
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,559
Next.

583
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:13,720
Your Majesty,

584
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,319
news comes from palace guards that

585
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,079
Fan Xian, the Nanqing envoy,

586
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,359
stands on the carriage roof

587
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:19,599
and provokes the public
by putting on the battle flag.

588
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:21,519
He's so arrogant and rebellious!

589
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,960
Your Majesty, please issue

590
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,440
an imperial edict to reprimand him!

591
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,759
Your Majesty,

592
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,319
an urgent report
from the border says that

593
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,599
all the divisions of
Nanqing's border forces

594
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,960
have moved forward 15 km
at the same time,

595
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:42,000
and stopped right on the border line.

596
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:50,079
Your Majesty,

597
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,920
news comes from Ministry of War that

598
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,400
with the Nanqing frontier forces
pressing on to the border,

599
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,680
Beiqi is thrown into a panic.

600
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:55,640
They avoid us most of the time.

601
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,039
There's no dispute so far.

602
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,839
Tell the frontier forces

603
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,359
to stay where they are.

604
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,720
Don't charge or retreat.

605
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,079
Then Beiqi will tremble with fear.

606
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,640
According to time,

607
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:11,839
Fan Xian should have arrived

608
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,079
in the capital of Beiqi.

609
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,519
He should if everything goes well.

610
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,640
Will he cause any trouble?

611
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,200
Your Majesty, are the frontier forces

612
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,839
pressing on to the border for Fan Xian?

613
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,799
He's the envoy of Nanqing.

614
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,519
Even if he causes any trouble,

615
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,640
there will be
millions of frontier soldiers backing him up.

616
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,960
Well done! Good work!

617
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,079
Your Excellency, do you want a try?

618
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,440
Whoever is shameless

619
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,039
can make a sneak attack.

620
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,400
I'll take it.

621
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,799
Your Excellency, watch out!

622
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,880
He Daoren.

623
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,240
The Investigator's Office has his records.
He's a Ninth Dan martial arts master.

624
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,400
Even a Ninth Dan martial arts master
dares to block my way.

625
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,359
Your Excellency,

626
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,519
that Chen Jushu you killed

627
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,359
is his apprentice.

628
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:07,200
Are you here
to avenge your apprentice's death?

629
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,039
Your Excellency.

630
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:32,639
You have profound vitality Qi.

631
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,880
Next round, I'll kill you with my sword.

632
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
How can you point your sword
at the envoy?

633
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,559
Where are your manners?

634
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,400
Your Excellency Fan,

635
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,760
the imperial palace is right ahead.

636
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,800
By making such provocation,

637
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,840
do you want to restart the war?

638
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,320
Let's go.

639
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,519
I'm really scared.

640
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,559
Will anyone throw things at me again?

641
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,760
Your Excellency,

642
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,000
you may stay here for a moment.

643
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,639
I'll go ahead to get things ready.

644
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,760
Your Excellency, please go ahead.

645
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,519
Your Excellency,
have you reached the Ninth Dan?

646
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,119
You are injured!

647
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:36,679
I'm fine.

648
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,440
So you're close to the Ninth Dan!

649
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,800
I've been practicing
Overbearing Vitality Qi.

650
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,360
What a cool name!

651
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,920
It's special for its strong power.

652
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,519
By fighting with Shangshan Hu

653
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,559
and Haitang Duoduo along the way,

654
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,320
I've made a breakthrough.

655
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,559
Competing solely
on the strength of vitality Qi,

656
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,639
I can fight
a Ninth Dan martial arts master.

657
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:56,559
But I'm far behind
in terms of subtle control.

658
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,960
Your Excellency, no wonder

659
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,599
you put the flag on the carriage roof.

660
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:02,159
Why?

661
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,559
I stood on the carriage roof

662
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,320
to avoid bodily movements.

663
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,639
If He Daoren

664
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:08,679
wanted to knock me down,

665
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:09,800
he had to go up.

666
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,880
Competing solely
on the strength of vitality Qi,

667
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,280
it's to my advantage.

668
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,519
If He Daoren attacked me
with his sword again,

669
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:16,440
I would have to step aside,

670
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:17,480
or I would be severely injured.

671
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,480
Then why did Shen Zhong

672
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,599
stop him just now?

673
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,280
I'm the envoy of Nanqing.

674
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
If anything bad happens to me,
there'll be a war.

675
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:28,199
Now Beiqi can't afford

676
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:28,840
another war.

677
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:31,400
Shen Zhong uses Beiqi people
to humiliate me

678
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,519
so as to undermine
the morale of our mission.

679
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
But he dares not

680
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,559
hurt me.

681
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,320
At least,

682
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,079
I can't be hurt under his protection.

683
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,320
So we're

684
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,280
in an invincible position.

685
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,400
On this occasion,

686
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,800
I'm afraid it might be difficult

687
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,320
to fulfill our task this time.

688
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,679
It's so big here.

689
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,079
Well, guys,

690
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,159
what do you think?

691
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,199
It's solemn and magnificent.

692
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:26,440
Beiqi is the most orthodox
of all countries.

693
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,320
Young and superficial as Nanqing is,

694
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,639
you even copied our imperial palace.

695
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,719
Though young and superficial,

696
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,679
we actually won the war.

697
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,119
Your Excellency,
you have a sharp tongue.

698
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,360
It's no worse than
your martial arts skills.

699
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:40,079
Your Excellency,
I've learned that from you.

700
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:43,679
Let's go.

701
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
His Majesty is waiting for us.

702
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,679
Let's go.

703
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,480
Your Excellency.

704
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,079
His Majesty only wants to see you.

705
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:05,800
Let's go.

706
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,679
The envoy of Nanqing is here.

707
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,400
Nanqing envoy Fan Xian

708
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,599
pays respects to Your Majesty of Beiqi.

709
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,719
I hereby present the credentials

710
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:32,679
personally drafted by
His Majesty of Nanqing.

711
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:05,320
Mr. Fan, you should

712
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:07,880
have you finished lately?

713
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,039
That's all for today.

714
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:29,800
Ministers, you may leave.

715
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

716
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:43,280
Mr. Fan,

717
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:45,440
you should stay

718
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:47,000
and talk with me.

719
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,639
You can come up.

720
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,320
Mother,

721
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,480
I'm so happy

722
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,519
to see Fan Xian

723
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,719
that I forgot about
diplomatic etiquette.

724
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,960
So happy?

725
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:27,519
Please forgive me.

726
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,039
Are you the poetic genius of Nanqing?

727
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,639
I'm so flattered.

728
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,239
to bear the title.

729
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:12,360
Fan Xian pays respects to
Your Majesty the Empress Dowager.

730
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:15,679
Rise.

731
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,480
His Majesty loves your poems.

732
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,000
Your Majesty,
what do you want to talk with him?

733
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,480
Just talk about poems casually.

734
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:33,920
Please allow us.

735
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,519
You're the emperor.

736
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,480
You can make the call.

737
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,880
If you want to talk poems with him,

738
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,599
just go ahead.

739
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,400
The hall is too majestic.
It's not a place to talk.

740
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,599
I'd like to go out for a walk
with Fan Xian.

741
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:53,480
Mother, you must be tired after
handling all the political affairs.

742
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,400
You'd better go back to
your palace for a rest.

743
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,559
Is the hall too majestic,

744
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,199
or am I too majestic?

745
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,639
Mother, it's known to the world that

746
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,280
you're elegant and kind.

747
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,159
Well then.

748
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,199
Let me walk

749
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,280
with you.

750
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:15,920
Mother, you must be tired.
How dare I bother you?

751
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,239
That being said,

752
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:22,360
I might as well go back to my palace.

753
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,920
Your Auntie is here.

754
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:27,960
If you want to talk casually,

755
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,559
your Auntie can keep you company.

756
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,679
Mother, see you.

757
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,599
Auntie,
when did you get back to Shangjing?

758
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,039
I got back yesterday.

759
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,840
My teacher is afraid there might be too
many villains in the imperial palace,

760
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:54,440
so he sends me here.

761
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:55,639
Villains?

762
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,639
Yes, there are all kinds of villains
in the world.

763
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,639
Some are cunning and deceitful,

764
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:02,039
some are shameless and insidious,

765
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:05,320
and some may even drug others.

766
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:06,480
It's impossible to guard against them.

767
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,199
Let's have a rest here.

768
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:13,320
Holding on to the balustrade clean,

769
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,920
I feel the chill of the wind
blowing watery smoke onto my face.

770
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,039
Good!

771
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:20,960
I sing aloud dispersing
the fleeting clouds apace.

772
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,039
Excellent! Wonderful!

773
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,920
There are many people
trying to flatter me.

774
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,199
But Fan Xian, you're the first one

775
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,280
to flatter me in a careless way.

776
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:37,960
I'm so flattered.

777
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,440
Auntie, you're seldom here.

778
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,159
Now that you're here,

779
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,159
you can appreciate the scenery.

780
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,159
The imperial palace is so beautiful

781
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:52,119
that I never thought of

782
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:54,320
taking a walk outside the palace walls.

783
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,039
Mr. Fan,

784
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,400
how do you like the scenery here?

785
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,119
Good.

786
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,800
What is good?

787
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:05,320
There are trees.

788
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:12,199
You're so good at making compliments.

789
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:18,920
Mr. Fan, do you know

790
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,639
why I ask you to stay?

791
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:23,280
Your Majesty, please tell me.

792
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,760
There're two reasons.

793
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:26,159
Firstly,

794
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,480
I love your talent in literature.

795
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,400
I can hardly bear
to put down the Red Mansions

796
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,599
written by you under a pseudonym.

797
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,360
However, it does take a long time

798
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,719
for you to release the new chapter.

799
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,360
I'll try my best to finish it.

800
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,880
Secondly, it's your poem collection.

801
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,519
You actually composed
so many marvelous poems overnight.

802
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:45,920
Once it's released,

803
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:48,800
even I dare not compose any poems.

804
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,719
I'm so flattered,

805
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,840
but your Majesty's poem is really good.

806
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:54,119
Take a seat.

807
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,559
Actually, there's another reason.

808
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:07,599
Mr. Fan, you went all the way up north.

809
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:09,840
How do you like the scenery in Beiqi?

810
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:12,119
The scenery is picturesque and the land
is endowed with nature's treasures.

811
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,320
How is it compared to Nanqing?

812
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,000
It's far better.

813
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:15,800
The palace walls of Nanqing

814
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,880
are much lower

815
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:17,719
and closer to ditches,

816
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:18,639
which smell like horse urine.

817
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,519
When Auntie said you're a rascal,

818
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:27,599
I didn't believe her.

819
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:30,960
Today by meeting you in person,
I think she's right about you.

820
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,360
It should be the first time

821
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,960
for me to meet your Auntie.

822
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:38,320
How could she make such a comment?

823
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,199
You really haven't met her before?

824
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,119
No.

825
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:45,400
She's Haitang. Do you remember?

826
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:49,800
So she's Miss Haitang,

827
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,880
the Beiqi Saintess.

828
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,280
I've heard so much of you!

829
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,119
In my opinion, Mr. Fan,

830
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:57,079
you must have a poor memory.

831
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:02,400
It really is my first time

832
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,599
to meet her.

833
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,320
How could you forget your recent fight
in the stone forest?

834
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,639
You drugged her, remember?

835
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,079
How do you...

836
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,360
You also told her that

837
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:15,039
you would help her and my mother

838
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,199
take over power from me.

839
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,199
To help you and the Empress Dowager

840
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:22,039
take over power
from your little emperor.

841
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:23,400
Who told you
I'm with the Empress Dowager.

842
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,400
Your teacher Ku He
is the Imperial Tutor.

843
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:26,480
He certainly has to take side.

844
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,960
One force is led by the little emperor.
One force is led by the Empress Dowager.

845
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,960
And the other is led by Shangshan Hu,

846
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:32,199
which remains neutral.

847
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,480
what will Shen Zhong do

848
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:35,480
while you want to kill him.

849
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,039
You're certainly not on the same side.

850
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:38,840
I could also
be a follower of His Majesty.

851
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,079
You thought I wouldn't order Auntie

852
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,239
to attack in Nanqing,

853
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:45,280
so you believed she's with my mother.

854
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,320
I cry, "Can't you see? Can't you see?

855
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:51,280
The green leaves are fresh
but the red flowers are fading!"

856
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,639
What a wonderful poem!

857
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,800
So you're not...

858
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,079
You actually guessed wrong.

859
00:47:58,559 --> 00:47:59,920
You seem to serve the Empress Dowager,

860
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,480
but...

861
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,320
But she's actually on my side.

862
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:13,599
Does anyone else know about this?

863
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:16,000
In the imperial palace,

864
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,119
no one knows but the three of us.

865
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:28,360
His Majesty only loves

866
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,719
Fan Xian's literary talent,

867
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:31,440
so he keeps Fan Xian for a casual talk.

868
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,079
No need to be worried.

869
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,239
But Fan Xian is also

870
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:37,280
the Director-General of
the Investigator's Office.

871
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,280
He's very resourceful.

872
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:41,880
If he meets alone with His Majesty,

873
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:44,599
I'm afraid...

874
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:46,159
I asked Haitang to keep them company.

875
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:49,639
If the Saintess is with them,

876
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:51,559
it should be fine.

877
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,239
Mr. Fan, are you nervous?

878
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,800
By telling me

879
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,880
such an important secret,

880
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,840
I'm afraid
Your Majesty might kill me next.

881
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,079
If I kill you,

882
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,960
who can finish writing the Red Mansions?

883
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,519
If you have any question,
just feel free to ask.

884
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:22,039
Your Majesty, did you give the order

885
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:23,039
to kill Xiao En?

886
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:24,039
What about Si Lili then?

887
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:26,079
I didn't give the order.

888
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:27,800
That's an order from my teacher.

889
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:29,039
His Majesty has nothing to do with it.

890
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,239
Your relationship network in Beiqi
is really complicated.

891
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:32,440
Indeed!

892
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,239
Your Majesty, you told me

893
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:35,920
the secret,

894
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,880
yet you spare my life.

895
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,639
What are you up to?

896
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:39,320
Don't you want to find an ally?

897
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,719
You can help anyone.

898
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,960
Why not help me?

899
00:49:43,559 --> 00:49:45,039
Your Majesty, what can I do for you?

900
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:46,559
Shen Zhong

901
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,960
enjoys great power and
has followers everywhere.

902
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,119
Yet he's extremely loyal to my mother.

903
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:54,159
I remember that Shen Zhong

904
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:55,360
killed a mammy from the imperial palace

905
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,119
at the border.

906
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:57,760
She was an old servant of
the Empress Dowager of your country.

907
00:49:58,239 --> 00:49:59,559
How can he be called loyal?

908
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,639
I've figured it out.

909
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,800
The family of the mammy

910
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,880
have received
a large sum of money recently.

911
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:07,199
Tracing the source, it was paid

912
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,920
by Ceremonial Propriety Division.

913
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,960
His Majesty bought her over?

914
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:14,519
We should get rid of her.

915
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,920
Though His Majesty is young,

916
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:23,119
he's really shrewd and deep.

917
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:26,119
Why can't he see that

918
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,960
everything I've done

919
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,440
is for protecting Beiqi?

920
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,599
Your Majesty, you're definitely doing
everything for the country.

921
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:37,239
By killing her,

922
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,039
His Majesty won't be happy.

923
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:42,199
I can't help with that.

924
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:43,679
I only want to clean up

925
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:45,519
the traitors around Your Majesty.

926
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:53,320
Then why not

927
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,519
dismiss him from his post?

928
00:50:57,079 --> 00:50:58,800
By dismissing him,
the whole situation will be affected.

929
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,599
Shen Zhong has many connections,

930
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:03,320
and he is shielded by my mother.

931
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:04,599
It takes a long time.

932
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:07,360
Then how will I be able to help?

933
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:09,440
Mr. Fan, you protected the battle flag

934
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:10,480
all the way into the imperial palace
with only one sword.

935
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,440
You also killed Cheng Jushu

936
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:13,840
in the capital city of Nanqing.

937
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:18,360
Skilled as you are,
it won't be difficult

938
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:20,639
for you to kill Shen Zhong, right?

939
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:24,519
Miss Haitang
is exceptionally good at martial arts.

940
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:25,880
She is a better killer than I am.

941
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:28,920
If Auntie kills him,

942
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,519
will my mother still believe her?

943
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:31,760
Your Majesty, don't you have

944
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,960
other martial arts masters
at your command?

945
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:34,639
Shen Zhong is thoroughly

946
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:35,920
familiar with my men.

947
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,159
Whenever they move,
he'll be vigilant right away.

948
00:51:39,559 --> 00:51:40,320
I see.

949
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:43,159
So I'm the best choice.

950
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,559
I'm from Nanqing.

951
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,519
If Shen Zhong is killed by me,

952
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:47,840
no one will suspect Your Majesty.

953
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:49,599
That's right.

954
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,360
Then by cutting off my head in public,

955
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,760
Your Majesty can draw people
over to your side,

956
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,960
and I will die in a strange land.

957
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:55,960
What a good story of

958
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,360
helping each other!

959
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,079
Mr. Fan, are you refusing my offer?

960
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:07,360
Why should I take the risk?

961
00:52:09,639 --> 00:52:11,239
Why do you come to Beiqi?

962
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,320
To return Xiao En and
take Yan Bingyun back.

963
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:15,400
Yan Bingyun is in Shen Zhong's hands.

964
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,679
But he will release Yan Bingyun
sooner or later.

965
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,000
Even the Empress Dowager of your country

966
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,320
does not want another war, right?

967
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:20,639
Yan Bingyun will be released,

968
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:21,960
but it's hard to tell when.

969
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,960
Then how could he

970
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,039
keep me in Shangjing?

971
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,519
You should ask him about that.

972
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:27,360
Fine, I'll leave and ask him now.

973
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,159
Your Majesty,
if you don't want to kill me,

974
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,239
I'll leave now.

975
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:32,840
Auntie,

976
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:35,400
escort Mr. Fan out for me.

977
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:38,639
Your Majesty, I bid you farewell.

978
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,960
We'll meet again.

979
00:52:58,719 --> 00:52:59,440
What's so funny?

980
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:02,039
I remember that

981
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,199
when country women feel lazy,

982
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:05,239
they may walk like this.

983
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:07,400
I'm also lazy. Is that funny?

984
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:08,719
I love your posture.

985
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,519
If I'm not honest,
I'll be condemned by the God.

986
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,079
I thought Your Majesty

987
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:24,079
wouldn't let me leave.

988
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:24,800
Why?

989
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,199
Because I've known your secret.

990
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,840
He loves your book,

991
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,679
so he won't kill you.

992
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:29,679
Isn't that an excuse?

993
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,320
No.

994
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,280
You talk less than before.

995
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:34,800
Weren't it for the same walking posture,

996
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,679
I wouldn't recognize you.

997
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,440
I'm the Saintess.

998
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:42,360
How could I be saint if I talk too much?

999
00:53:43,239 --> 00:53:44,320
Do you care about others' opinions?

1000
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:48,119
My teacher asks me to behave like

1001
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:49,119
a Saintess in the imperial palace,

1002
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,840
so I don't like to come here.

1003
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,599
When you're with me,

1004
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:53,400
you don't have to restrain yourself.

1005
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,079
Are we friends?

1006
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:57,559
You even drugged me!

1007
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,880
If you really mind it so much,

1008
00:53:58,880 --> 00:53:59,960
you can also drug me.

1009
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:02,239
Yes, I can.

1010
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:04,440
There aren't many drugs in the world

1011
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,199
which can affect me.

1012
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,079
Just wait. I'll have a try.

1013
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,440
Then you should hurry up.

1014
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:10,719
I'll go back to Nanqing

1015
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,840
right after getting Yan Bingyun.

1016
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:15,320
His Majesty said

1017
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:16,440
you won't be able to go back
for the moment.

1018
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,280
Shen Zhong won't give Yan Bingyun

1019
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,159
to you easily.

1020
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,239
Your Majesty is too young

1021
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:25,119
to understand political affairs.

1022
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:27,039
If he wants to keep me in Shangjing,

1023
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:28,159
he has to find an excuse.

1024
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:29,039
He can't keep me by force.

1025
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,559
That excuse should be sensible

1026
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,960
and acceptable to both our countries.

1027
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:34,159
It's not easy

1028
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:35,639
to find such an excuse.

1029
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,000
What did you just say?

1030
00:54:41,559 --> 00:54:43,480
Our Empress Dowager's birthday
is around the corner.

1031
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,719
Your Excellency, you can
take the chance and stay a little longer

1032
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,840
to congratulate Her Majesty,

1033
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:49,519
thus promoting the friendship
between our courtiers.

1034
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:50,840
I'm here with a task.

1035
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:52,639
It's approved by your country.

1036
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,800
By whom?

1037
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:54,920
Wait a moment.

1038
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:56,760
Officials,

1039
00:54:58,159 --> 00:54:59,920
you can go back to your residence first

1040
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,360
with other mission members.

1041
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:03,760
I'll take a walk with His Excellency.

1042
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,239
Your Majesty, Minister Fan is here.

1043
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:19,039
Let him in.

1044
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,280
What's up, Head Chen?

1045
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,760
Did you know in advance
that I would come and visit?

1046
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,000
How could I know that?

1047
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,159
It's prepared by me.

1048
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:38,760
Your Majesty.

1049
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:40,480
Beiqi wants to keep Fan Xian there.

1050
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,159
They're obviously up to something.

1051
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:43,639
The longer he stays in the capital of

1052
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:44,440
the enemy country,

1053
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,760
the more risky it'll be.

1054
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,760
How could you grant their request?

1055
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:49,320
Sit down and fish with me.

1056
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:15,119
To keep the mission,

1057
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,760
we certainly have to gain approval

1058
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:17,519
from your emperor.

1059
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:21,159
Your Excellency, do you want
to defy the imperial order?

1060
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,239
If so, you won't be able to

1061
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,679
stay in Nanqing anymore,

1062
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,119
please feel free to

1063
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:29,079
join us in Beiqi anytime.

1064
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,760
You're welcome
to forsake darkness for light.

1065
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:34,360
I can stay for the birthday,

1066
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,119
but you should let me

1067
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:37,000
take back Yan Bingyun first.

1068
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:40,920
Let's talk about hostage exchange till

1069
00:56:41,039 --> 00:56:42,599
you're heading back to Nanqing.

1070
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,480
Your Excellency,
do you want to detain him?

1071
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,239
I still have some questions for him.

1072
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,880
Your Excellency,
please wait a little longer.

1073
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,440
Then let me see him first.

1074
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:52,599
Fine.

1075
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:54,559
I'll arrange it for you gradually.

1076
00:56:56,239 --> 00:56:56,880
When can I see him?

1077
00:56:58,239 --> 00:57:00,760
No hurry.
The procedures are complicated.

1078
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,920
Your Excellency,
you should wait patiently.

1079
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,679
What if I want to see him now?

1080
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:10,519
Then Your Excellency,

1081
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:12,599
you'd better look for him yourself.

1082
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,079
If you don't calm down,

1083
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,920
fish won't bite.

1084
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:45,719
It's been quite a while,

1085
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,280
but Your Majesty,
you haven't got a fish, either.

1086
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,480
There's no fish in the lake.

1087
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:52,480
Then what are we

1088
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,159
fishing for here?

1089
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,639
Our past.

1090
00:57:58,639 --> 00:57:59,440
Have you forgotten?

1091
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:01,840
We used to fish here

1092
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,760
together.

1093
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:05,840
Just like old times,

1094
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,760
it's still the three of us.

1095
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,920
It's different.

1096
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:13,400
Except Your Majesty, we're all old.

1097
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:15,239
What do you mean?

1098
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,239
Do you mean that I'm an evil spirit
that doesn't age?

1099
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:20,199
Your Majesty, as the son of Heaven,

1100
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,679
you're exceptionally good at handling
things and making decisions.

1101
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,000
How can we be the same?

1102
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:26,480
He's complaining.

1103
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:28,639
I just don't get it.

1104
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,440
Why don't you let Fan Xian

1105
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,480
come back earlier?

1106
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,559
Do you want Fan Xian

1107
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:35,760
to take over the Neiku?

1108
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,119
After all, it's the property of his mom.

1109
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:39,960
Chen Pingping,

1110
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,320
do you want Fan Xian

1111
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,400
to take over the Investigator's Office?

1112
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:45,880
I'm old.

1113
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,039
He's perfect for the post.

1114
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,079
He's good,

1115
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,400
but he's far from

1116
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,440
perfect.

1117
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:56,760
Do you know

1118
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,320
what his biggest problem is?

1119
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,480
His casual personality.

1120
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,599
He's too emotional.

1121
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,000
No.

1122
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:07,039
His life is too smooth.

1123
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:09,880
Overprotected by you,
he has sailed through life

1124
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,840
without ever hitting the rough waters.

1125
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,760
Without facing mortal danger,

1126
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:16,519
how can he become

1127
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,360
the most powerful minister in the world?

1128
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:21,320
Your Majesty, you leave him in Beiqi

1129
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,079
so that he can improve himself

1130
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:24,079
through conspiracies
and plots of the enemy country.

1131
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:26,719
What if something bad happens to him?

1132
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,079
Beiqi is weak after losing the war.

1133
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,280
Under this circumstance,

1134
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:33,880
he might go through hardships,

1135
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,960
but he won't die.

1136
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,079
Your Majesty,

1137
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,880
it's your last test for him.

1138
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,360
It's too risky after all.

1139
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,199
Learn from Chen Pingping.

1140
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,239
You have to be hard-hearted
to make achievements.

1141
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,719
There's really fish here.

1142
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,280
How do you like it here?

1143
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,519
Cut the crap!

1144
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:31,960
Shangjing Town is the base camp

1145
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,159
of Embroidered Uniform Guards.

1146
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:34,920
It's inconvenient for Wang Qinian
and I to appear in public.

1147
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,840
Now you're the only one

1148
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,639
remaining hidden.

1149
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:38,800
We have to count on you.

1150
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:40,440
What do you want me to do?

1151
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,159
Chat with people on the street,

1152
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:42,880
trying to find out the location

1153
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,960
of Embroidered Uniform Guards Prison.

1154
01:00:44,199 --> 01:00:45,119
Prison?

1155
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:47,679
I need to find Yan Bingyun.

1156
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:50,440
You promised me that

1157
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:52,519
you'll save my dad
after completing your task.

1158
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:53,480
Yes.

1159
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:10,480
Follow him.

1160
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,440
I'll watch here.

1161
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:20,320
Prison.

1162
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,480
The Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison.

1163
01:01:36,199 --> 01:01:36,599
Your Excellency.

1164
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:39,400
How is it?

1165
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,840
Fan Xian and Wang Qinian sneaked to

1166
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:43,079
Tiaowang Inn south of the Town.

1167
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:45,960
When entering the town,

1168
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,360
the man slipped away
from the Nanqing mission

1169
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:50,360
is hiding in that inn, right?

1170
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,519
Exactly.

1171
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:53,840
Now Fan Xian and Wang Qinian

1172
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,440
are hiding in the room,

1173
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,480
while that man hidden in advance

1174
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:57,920
sneaked out of the inn secretly.

1175
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:01,199
He's smart to plan in advance.
