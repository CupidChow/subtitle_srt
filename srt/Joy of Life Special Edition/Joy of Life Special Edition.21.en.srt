=Episode 21=

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,239
When entering the town,

17
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:47,599
the man slipped away
from the Nanqing mission

18
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,560
is hiding in that inn, right?

19
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,799
Exactly.

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,040
Now Fan Xian and Wang Qinian

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,760
are hiding in the room,

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,719
while that man hidden in advance

23
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,200
sneaked out of the inn secretly.

24
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:00,439
He's smart to plan in advance.

25
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,079
But Shangjing Town

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,719
is controlled by us.

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,040
Follow the man
who sneaked out of the Inn.

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes.

29
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,520
Haven't you finished the alteration?

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,919
Your Excellency,
please give me more days.

31
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,840
I still need to alter some parts.

32
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,080
Fine,

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,680
as you wish.

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,240
Yes.

35
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,240
Your Excellency,

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,120
it's not right.

37
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:30,680
What's wrong?

38
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,879
They're watching us outside.

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,439
According to years of experience

40
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,599
in tracking and sneaking,

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,800
I can't be wrong.

42
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,080
It's the Shangjing Town of Beiqi.

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,439
It's their job

44
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,719
to watch us.

45
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:45,919
Your Excellency,

46
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,719
Guo Baokun was followed

47
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,759
when he left just now.

48
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,719
I'm afraid

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,680
Guo Baokun is exposed.

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,520
Of course he is.

51
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,199
He jumped off the cart in public

52
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,840
and checked into an inn
after wandering about the streets.

53
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,599
If he hadn't been found out,

54
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,199
His Excellency Shen and
the Embroidered Uniform Guards would be punished

55
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,000
for their failure in duty.

56
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,599
Your Excellency, did you expect

57
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,560
Guo Baokun would fail to hide himself?

58
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,759
I asked him to go out on purpose

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,039
to distract Shen Zhong.

60
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,680
You want to use him

61
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,159
to divert attention from us.

62
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,639
Prison.

63
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,840
The Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison.

64
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,120
The Embroidered Uniform Guards.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,639
The Embroidered Uniform...

66
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,439
What can I do for you?

67
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,639
Can you tell me

68
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,280
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards'
prison is?

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,800
Here is a pharmacy.

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,159
Are you feeling under the weather?

71
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:53,960
No. I'm well.

72
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,080
Can you tell me

73
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,759
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards'
prison is?

74
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,080
Prison. Prison.

75
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:58,840
A building
where people are kept as a punishment.

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,599
This medicine helps reduce hysteria.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,039
Sir, you can have it for free.

78
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,599
Take it home.

79
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,560
Did he ask people on the streets

80
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
about the Embroidered Uniform Guards'
prison?

81
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,800
Yes. He asked everyone he met.

82
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,120
He's really rampant.

83
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,560
But don't worry.

84
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,519
The Embroidered Uniform Guards
is well-known.

85
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,800
Nobody answered him.

86
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:19,680
He was ignored.

87
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,279
I didn't expect Fan Xian would

88
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,040
let such a guy...

89
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,079
Your Excellency.

90
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,199
Your Excellency.

91
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,319
Can you tell me

92
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:34,000
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards'
prison is?

93
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
No idea.

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,720
I've no idea.

95
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,759
Can you tell me
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison is?

96
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,839
No idea.

97
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,759
Can you tell me

98
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,639
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards'
prison is?

99
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,839
No idea.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,839
Isn't he afraid of death?

101
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,839
Do you know

102
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,839
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards'
prison is?

103
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,600
No. No. I don't.

104
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,240
No idea. No idea.

105
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,279
Does anyone know

106
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,879
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards'
prison is?

107
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,079
He must be insane.

108
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,399
He must want to die.

109
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,079
Can you tell me
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards' prison is?

110
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,079
Go that way and
pass through three intersections.

111
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,600
Then turn west. You'll find it.

112
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,120
Thank you.

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,040
Your Excellency, shall we arrest him?

114
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,639
The Investigator's Office

115
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,079
couldn't send such a crap here.

116
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,120
Let's go to the inn.

117
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,680
Got it. Go to the inn.

118
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:02,600
Your Excellency,

119
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,680
our scouts are just around.

120
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,279
They didn't find Fan Xian going out.

121
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,560
Search the room!

122
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,399
What's wrong?

123
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,560
Do you even want to

124
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,600
search under bed?

125
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,480
Your Excellency,

126
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,079
did they vanish into thin air?

127
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,519
It fell off from above.

128
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,959
They left from the roof?

129
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,399
Dispatch my orders

130
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
to search for them

131
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,600
in the surroundings radiating
from the inn.

132
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,360
Avoid catching people's eyes.

133
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:50,959
Yes.

134
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,319
It's such a lame trick.

135
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,439
The smarter a person is,

136
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,439
the more liable he's to be taken in.

137
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:17,040
Any inexperienced guy

138
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,879
would choose to

139
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,279
search under bed first.

140
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,199
Only a smart guy like Shen Zhong

141
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,199
would think too much

142
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,319
after noticing some details.

143
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,519
Search carefully. Don't be too worried.

144
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,759
Even if we fail to find them
for a while,

145
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:38,639
it'll be difficult for them

146
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,639
to do anything big without support.

147
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,160
Also keep watch on
that guy who asked about the prison,

148
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,480
in case

149
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,519
Fan Xian does exactly the opposite

150
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,279
and plays dumb to make trouble.

151
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,040
You're really thoughtful.

152
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:48,959
It's admiring.

153
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:54,439
Your Excellency,

154
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,319
we shook them off for the time being.

155
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
But where should we start to find him?

156
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
What shall we do next?

157
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,399
Let's go.

158
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,639
What are we going to do?

159
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:04,879
To see someone.

160
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,199
How did you know this place?

161
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,439
Who wrote it?

162
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,279
Does anyone in this imperial palace

163
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,720
work for the Investigator's Office?

164
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,000
On the way.

165
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:23,920
Huh?

166
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,639
Which way?

167
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,959
Why did I keep the flag alone

168
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:28,800
to provoke them?

169
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,199
To gain face.

170
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,919
It makes sense,

171
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,639
but what's more important,

172
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,120
I came to Beiqi

173
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,240
to reactivate the spy network,

174
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,440
but secret agents are in hiding,

175
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,879
and I know nothing about
their whereabouts.

176
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,799
I'd rather let them know I'm here

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,960
than look for them

178
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,559
one by one.

179
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,960
That's why you decided
to make a big deal out of it

180
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,720
and catch people's eyes.

181
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,679
I see

182
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,919
why we're here with the banner
of the border troops.

183
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,039
Do you mean

184
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,279
even if Shen Zhong

185
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,679
didn't make things difficult for us,

186
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,360
you've decided to

187
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,279
make trouble.

188
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,919
When you can't find people
you need in thick fog,

189
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,720
make yourself a beacon to attract them.

190
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,919
Who gave you the address?

191
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
Why didn't I find it?

192
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
He Daoren.

193
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,440
I've found out

194
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:39,960
where the Embroidered Uniform Guards'
prison is.

195
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,519
Chen Pingping asked me

196
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,360
to give you a hand
when you're in Shangjing.

197
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:57,840
How will you prove your identity?

198
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,200
It is the stamp of
the Investigator's Office.

199
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,240
The wood pattern is specially made.

200
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,200
An outsider couldn't figure it out.

201
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:22,919
Keep it.

202
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,840
I only promised Chen Pingping

203
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,519
that I'd help you this time.

204
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,320
It's of no use to me in the future.

205
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Your disciple Cheng Jushu

206
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,039
was killed by me.

207
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,039
I have a lot of disciples.

208
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,279
What would Chen Pingping do
for you in return?

209
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,240
None of your business.

210
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,480
How will you help me?

211
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,600
I won't take action

212
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,879
or fight for you.

213
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,399
I won't expose my identity rashly.

214
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,600
I'll just convey information.

215
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:46,399
About what?

216
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,799
About the branch of Neiku in Shangjing.

217
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,279
What do I need to do?

218
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,679
Chen Pingping said

219
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,919
you're going to

220
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,639
I'll take over

221
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,440
You can take the chance
to look through the account book

222
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,000
and get familiar with the branch.

223
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,799
I'm under close watch.

224
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,320
It's fine

225
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:09,519
Both government officials
and common people here

226
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,360
know that

227
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,000
it's the branch of Nanqing's Neiku.

228
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:12,879
They all know?

229
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,480
But it's not closed down?

230
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,879
It's about commerce and trade.
It's the source of wealth.

231
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,480
Relevant parties all benefit from it.

232
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,320
Nobody hates to make money.

233
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:21,360
Even the Embroidered Uniform Guards
let it go?

234
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,759
It's the Embroidered Uniform Guards

235
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:24,960
that does business with Neiku.

236
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,200
Princess Royal even did business

237
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,559
with them.

238
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,759
Who do you work for in Shangjing?

239
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,919
I'm a follower of the Empress Dowager.

240
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:37,840
Do you know

241
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,080
where Yan Bingyun is imprisoned?

242
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,440
I've no idea.

243
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,039
He was imprisoned
by Shen Zhong personally.

244
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,679
Few people know the exact location.

245
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,200
Do you know
where the other secret agents

246
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,279
of the Investigator's Office are?

247
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,720
I've no idea.

248
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,799
I have to tell you something.

249
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,879
I promised Chen Pingping
I'd help you this time,

250
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,799
but it doesn't mean

251
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:55,879
I work for the Investigator's Office.

252
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,039
Do you know

253
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,480
the last place Yan Bingyun went

254
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,320
before he was arrested?

255
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:05,919
This tree...

256
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:06,720
Yeah.

257
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,639
I wonder how Head Chen

258
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,559
managed to let

259
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,399
the Ninth Dan swordsman of Beiqi

260
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,440
work for him.

261
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,039
We're pressed for time.

262
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,080
Let's act separately.

263
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,879
I'll go to
Yan Bingyun's former residence

264
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
and you go to Neiku's branch

265
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,600
to get an account book.

266
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,200
Do you want to

267
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,159
find some clues

268
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,240
at Yan Bingyun's residence?

269
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,159
Some traces must've been left

270
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,200
if he stayed there.

271
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,000
We can find out some secrets

272
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,840
from the layout of his room

273
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,440
and arrangement of furniture.

274
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
Your Excellency, be careful.

275
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,759
Let's go there next time.

276
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,919
Okay. Take care.

277
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,559
See you.

278
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,679
Boss, a cup of hot tea!

279
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:57,440
OK.

280
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
I'm from the south.

281
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,600
Since you disappeared,

282
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,279
I've been thinking

283
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,279
where I'd go

284
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,679
if I were you.

285
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:53,679
In the final analysis,

286
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,639
what you want to do most

287
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,360
is to find Yan Bingyun.

288
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,200
Where should you go to look for him?

289
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:03,840
If I were you,

290
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,039
I'd go to

291
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,480
where he used to live

292
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,360
and see if there are any clues.

293
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:16,159
So, I decided to wait here.

294
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,039
As expected, you came here.

295
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,919
Only me.

296
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,639
You won't arrest me?

297
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,440
It's unnecessary.

298
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,200
The next day
when Yan Bingyun was arrested,

299
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,720
I got everything

300
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:39,879
moved from this place

301
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,440
to the Embroidered Uniform Guards

302
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,759
and dismantled.

303
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,279
Each and every tile on the roof

304
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,879
has been changed.

305
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,399
Each and every brick on the ground

306
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,000
has been turned over.

307
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,799
What did you find?

308
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:00,960
Nothing.

309
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:02,840
He hid nothing.

310
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,240
You must've been tired to do that.

311
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,879
It's official business.

312
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,399
I have to try my best.

313
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,360
Your Excellency Fan,
I'll wait for you outside.

314
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,799
Search it carefully.

315
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:15,720
Take your time.

316
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,840
I hope you can find something useful.

317
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:40,840
So quick!

318
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,480
Don't you want to search again?

319
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,679
I don't think

320
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,519
there would be any omissions

321
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,639
now that you've had it searched.

322
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:49,519
Your Excellency Fan,

323
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,399
you'd better give up.

324
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,480
This is Shangjing.

325
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,159
Without support,

326
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,480
you couldn't do anything here.

327
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,840
But I still want to have a try.

328
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,759
Shangjing is a big city.

329
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,320
Many people went
into the depths of streets

330
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,200
and then disappeared forever.

331
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,399
I'm not bragging.

332
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,279
Nobody could stop me

333
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,080
unless he's achieved Ninth Dan.

334
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,399
Your Excellency,

335
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,120
after Fan Xian and Wang Qinian

336
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,320
went back to the residence,

337
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,279
they didn't go out any more.

338
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,000
We've found out

339
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:26,879
what Wang Qinian did earlier.

340
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,279
He went to the branch of Nanqing's Neiku

341
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,200
and took an account book back.

342
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,159
Your Excellency.

343
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:42,480
Please!

344
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:46,480
In my opinion,

345
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,039
Fan Xian is going to take over Neiku.

346
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:50,519
They took an account book back

347
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,159
probably to prepare for the future.

348
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,440
He won't give up on Yan Bingyun.

349
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,360
Don't worry. It's like searching
for a needle in a haystack.

350
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,399
We'd better be careful, just in case.

351
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,399
Your Excellency, you can trust me.

352
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,000
I've increased secret sentries.

353
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,480
Fan Xian reminded me of something today.

354
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,160
He has superb martial arts skill.

355
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,480
We need a Ninth Dan martial arts master

356
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,720
to keep an eye on him.

357
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,160
There is
no Ninth Dan martial arts master

358
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,519
available in
the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

359
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,240
It's okay. We can borrow one.

360
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:29,759
Huh?

361
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:32,960
There it comes!

362
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,279
Mr. He.

363
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:44,960
Mr. He.

364
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,200
I asked the Empress Dowager
to send you here

365
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,559
because I hope you can

366
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:50,440
keep someone under watch.

367
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,640
Who is it?

368
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,519
Fan Xian

369
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,640
from Nanqing.

370
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:55,720
You asked me to keep an eye on Fan Xian?

371
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,960
I know you're overqualified,

372
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,920
but you're the most suitable person.

373
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,960
Shen Zhong is right.

374
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,079
You're the most suitable person.

375
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,160
You're lucky.

376
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,000
It's not about luck.

377
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,519
I said some words during the day

378
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,759
to remind him of it on purpose.

379
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,880
There are so many Ninth Dan
martial arts masters in Shangjing.

380
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,319
How did you know he'd come to me?

381
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,119
There are few

382
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:28,920
Ninth Dan martial arts masters here.

383
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
You, Shangshan Hu and Haitang Duoduo.

384
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,519
It couldn't be the Saintess.

385
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,079
Shangshan Hu is anxious

386
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,519
to take Shen Zhong by the throat.

387
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,039
You're the only choice.

388
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,559
Your disciple was killed by me

389
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,240
and both of you work
for the Empress Dowager of Beiqi.

390
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,119
Of course he'd turn to you.

391
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,480
Did you get the account book so easily?

392
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:51,480
Got it.

393
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,240
Without any twists and turns.

394
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:57,599
We couldn't find anything wrong
like this.

395
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:00,359
Let's take it back

396
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,680
and compare it with what's recorded
in the Investigator's Office.

397
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,400
Then we'll know if anything goes wrong.

398
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,160
It'll be pretty soon.

399
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,960
When we find Yan Bingyun

400
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,720
and the birthday ceremony is held,

401
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,799
we can go back.

402
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,160
I don't think Shen Zhong

403
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:10,960
would set him free easily.

404
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,240
That's
why I have to look for him myself.

405
00:19:16,119 --> 00:19:16,960
You couldn't find him.

406
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,480
Actually,

407
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:22,960
I've got an idea of how to find him.

408
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,200
Your Excellency, did you find any clue

409
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,240
in his former residence?

410
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,079
No.

411
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:29,920
It was cleaned out.

412
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,799
But Shen Zhong doesn't know

413
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,079
what I want to find

414
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,839
is not in that house.

415
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:36,200
What do you mean?

416
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,200
The Embroidered Uniform Guards

417
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
can empty a house,

418
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,079
but they can't kill

419
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,119
all residents in the street.

420
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,519
I drank tea with some local people

421
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,359
and chatted with them

422
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,519
near that house today.

423
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:48,519
Sir.

424
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,359
why are you sighing in despair?

425
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,599
I came here for my relative,

426
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,079
but I was driven out.

427
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:54,960
Really?

428
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,160
Men's feelings are changeable.

429
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,240
What will you do next?

430
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,440
No idea.

431
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:01,359
I have to rent a house

432
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,200
and settle down.

433
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:03,559
I'm going to turn to a broker.

434
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,079
You're lucky.

435
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,920
It happens that house is available.

436
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,599
Has it always been vacant?

437
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,400
Nah. Someone once lived there.

438
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,240
Something happened to him.

439
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:14,559
Who lived there?

440
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,480
What happened?

441
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,839
A young man lived there.

442
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,759
He associated with

443
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,759
either high ranking officials

444
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,880
or the rich.

445
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Later, a girl came to his house.

446
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,279
After coming to Shangjing,

447
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,400
Yan Bingyun asked others

448
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,440
to call him Mr. Yun.

449
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,880
It's said he spent money like water

450
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,160
and made a lot of friends.

451
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,559
There were lots of visitors.

452
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:35,519
He just took the opportunity

453
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,559
to collect military information.

454
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,319
When he was arrested,

455
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,279
it was some big guys
dressed in plain clothes

456
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:40,920
that took him away.

457
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:42,240
They are secret agents
of the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

458
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,319
The common people like
to watch the scene of bustle most.

459
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,799
When he was taken away,

460
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:47,000
lots of people watched from distance.

461
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,480
Nowadays, this issue

462
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,440
has become a topic of conversation.

463
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,400
Did someone follow them all the way

464
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,440
and happen to find

465
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,359
where Yan Bingyun was imprisoned?

466
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,400
Of course not.

467
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,880
They're not that curious.

468
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,000
Then what's the point of knowing this?

469
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,839
It's said that

470
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:01,160
he's romantic and wealthy.

471
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,799
He also got to know a good girl.

472
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,480
Is that all you found out?

473
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,400
What's more,

474
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,480
the same day when he was arrested,

475
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,960
that girl came in advance

476
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,400
to ask him to run away.

477
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,079
When those big guys arrived,

478
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,839
she became a weeping beauty

479
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,680
beating and kicking them.

480
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,079
But owing to their strength in numbers,

481
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,559
Yan Bingyun was taken away, anyway.

482
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,519
Songs and dramas

483
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
are full of such stories.

484
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,440
It's nobody
but Yan Bingyun that was caught.

485
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,319
It's nobody but the Embroidered Uniform Guards
that caught him.

486
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,480
How did that girl

487
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,799
know about it before hand

488
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,039
to ask him to run away?

489
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,039
She beat and kicked
the Embroidered Uniform Guards

490
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,680
when they arrived.

491
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,799
People turn pale even at the mention
of the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

492
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,079
How did the girl dare do that?

493
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:41,599
Why didn't those guys hit back?

494
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,440
Something is wrong with that girl.

495
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:45,200
Is there any young girl

496
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,200
in the Embroidered Uniform Guards?

497
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,279
Definitely not.

498
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,319
Then it's weird.

499
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:51,400
How did that girl know

500
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,119
Yan Bingyun would be arrested that day?

501
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:54,960
Why did those secret agents dare
to do nothing to her?

502
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,680
You must've got an answer.

503
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,319
Does Shen Zhong have a daughter?

504
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,119
No.

505
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,640
He's not married.

506
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,279
But he has a younger sister.

507
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,000
How are they
getting along with each other?

508
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,319
Their parents died early.

509
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,880
His sister is much younger than him.

510
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,480
She was brought up by him.

511
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,279
To his sister,

512
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,839
he's an elder brother and a father.

513
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
I want to see her.

514
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:25,440
You're kept under close watch

515
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,000
by the Embroidered Uniform Guards.

516
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:28,279
Even if I let you go,

517
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,920
you would be tailed after by them.

518
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,559
You can reason things out.

519
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,079
Reason things out?

520
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,319
Your Excellency.

521
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,960
Mr. He sent a message.

522
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:46,920
He asked you to

523
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,039
withdraw those secret agents
around the mission.

524
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,759
Why?

525
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,599
He said

526
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,559
the guy who stays with Fan Xian

527
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,519
is called Wang Qinian

528
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,079
and he's a tracking expert of Nanqing.

529
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:58,440
Common secret agents

530
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,839
are easily found out by him.

531
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,200
That explains why Fan Xian

532
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,440
shook them off during the day.

533
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,480
Mr. He said

534
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,440
we can withdraw those secret agents

535
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,640
and he'll tail after them.

536
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,440
Let them go out?

537
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:13,920
Exactly.

538
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,839
If there is anyone
from the Investigator's Office

539
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:17,599
who makes contact with Fan Xian,

540
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,079
we can catch the whole lot in an action.

541
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,119
Sounds reasonable.

542
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,559
Shall I withdraw them?

543
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,400
Check Wang Qinian out.

544
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,119
If it's true,

545
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:32,519
do as He Daoren said.

546
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,759
Yes.

547
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,279
That is Shen Zhong's younger sister.

548
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,839
What will you do?

549
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,039
Kidnap her?

550
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,759
That's extreme.

551
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:44,799
Won't you follow her?

552
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,119
Wang Qinian is better at
lightness skill.

553
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:39,279
Your Excellency,

554
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,160
the further south I went,

555
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:44,119
the more heavily guarded it is.

556
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,720
I'm afraid I'd be found out
if I continue,

557
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,200
so I came back.

558
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,680
The south of the city?

559
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Did you see her get off?

560
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:53,720
No.

561
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,400
Do you think Lady Shen

562
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,480
is going to see Yan Bingyun?

563
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:58,440
It's hard to say.

564
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,720
Just a guess.

565
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,319
Even if it's true,
the south of the city is too big

566
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,240
to find him.

567
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,920
I found that

568
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,079
it's guarded loosely
and then more closely.

569
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:14,079
Something must've been hidden inside.

570
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,200
I can't go in,

571
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,680
so I looked around

572
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,039
in the neighboring streets.

573
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,720
I found that the guards

574
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,279
mainly gather

575
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,480
in these four to five streets.

576
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:29,559
So, Yan Bingyun must've been

577
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,079
imprisoned somewhere inside.

578
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,160
Can you sneak in?

579
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,279
No. There are too many secret agents.

580
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:38,880
Once you show up,

581
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,519
Shen Zhong would know about it at once.

582
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,680
It's a large scope.

583
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,000
He can transfer Yan Bingyun
to somewhere else anytime.

584
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,400
In the final analysis,

585
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:45,839
only the two of you

586
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:47,319
can't get it done.

587
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:48,720
Besides,

588
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:51,039
we're not sure if Lady Shen

589
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,880
is going to Yan Bingyun.

590
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,079
Wait for a few more minutes!

591
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,880
Waiting for what? She's left.

592
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,160
Let's wait for her to come back.

593
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:55,359
She cried.

594
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,319
There seems to be a blood stain
on her sleeve.

595
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,960
Seems?

596
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,519
I can't see it clearly
unless I get closer.

597
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,640
Here is Shen Zhong's mansion.

598
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,680
It's already risky

599
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,680
to stay here.

600
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,519
You'll be found out

601
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,680
if you get closer.

602
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,680
He's right.

603
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,640
There are secret agents here.

604
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,319
Let's go.

605
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,279
Have a look at this.

606
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,440
This is

607
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,599
finished dosage formulation.

608
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,079
And this.

609
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,880
Take it home.

610
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:07,960
Okay. Thank you.

611
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:15,839
Knickknacks!

612
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,880
Rattle-drums!

613
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,119
Knickknacks!

614
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,839
Bric-a-brac!

615
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:29,039
Just some medicine for flesh wounds.

616
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
There is also cold cure.

617
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,599
I'm sixty percent sure it's Yan Bingyun.

618
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,279
How about keeping waiting

619
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:35,880
before making a decision?

620
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:38,880
You don't have much time.

621
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:40,799
Why not?

622
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,000
Langtao is on the way to Shangjing.

623
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,079
Who is Langtao?

624
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,319
Ku He's first disciple.

625
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,759
Haitang Duoduo's
senior fellow apprentice?

626
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,440
Right.

627
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,279
He's more capable than Haitang.

628
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,039
He also works for the Empress Dowager.

629
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:54,599
Once he arrives,

630
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,240
I'm afraid he'll take the place of me

631
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,680
to keep watch on you.

632
00:29:59,039 --> 00:29:59,799
What to do?

633
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,559
We're in the capital of Beiqi.

634
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:04,759
It's enough to be sixty percent sure.

635
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,240
Who are you?

636
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,799
Tell Lady Shen

637
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,039
to let the cart

638
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,400
stop at the second crossroad tomorrow

639
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,519
if she wants to save him.

640
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,720
Who on earth are you?

641
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,440
To save who? I don't understand.

642
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,359
Lady Shen knows well

643
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,240
what will happen to him

644
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,759
if it's delayed.

645
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,680
Wait!

646
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,000
There it comes!

647
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,480
It doesn't stop.

648
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:31,279
What a waste of effort!

649
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,039
I'm going over.

650
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:42,000
Your Excellency, it's risky.

651
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,720
Time is not on our side.

652
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,000
Do as I said.

653
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,039
Be careful.

654
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:52,119
Report to Shen Zhong

655
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,480
as I told you.

656
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:25,839
Who are you?

657
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:26,920
Fan Xian,

658
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:30,119
The envoy of Nanqing?

659
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,319
Take me to see him.

660
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:32,640
Who?

661
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,319
I don't understand.

662
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,720
If you really don't,

663
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,000
you couldn't have stopped
to wait for me.

664
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,599
You have to help me.

665
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:44,000
I want to save Yan Bingyun.

666
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,920
Why do I have to help you?

667
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,960
You're from Nanqing.

668
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,039
He's seriously injured, right?

669
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,039
I'm the only one who can save him.

670
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,279
An agreement has been achieved

671
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,200
between the two countries.

672
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,960
Yan Bingyun will go back to Nanqing
sooner or later.

673
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,400
I just want to take him back
a few days earlier.

674
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,559
So, you are not betraying your country.

675
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,839
Now that he'll be set free

676
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:06,400
a few days later,

677
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,279
why do I have to help you do it now?

678
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,160
Before he leaves,

679
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,559
the Embroidered Uniform Guards
is bound to torture him more severely.

680
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:11,920
Do you really have the heart to

681
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,519
see Yan Bingyun become disabled?

682
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,359
He's a secret agent of the enemy.

683
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:16,960
Why don't I have the heart?

684
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,039
Then why did you buy

685
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:18,759
the cold cure?

686
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:21,799
And the food.

687
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,079
You take food to him personally.

688
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,480
It's prepared by you.

689
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:33,319
If you don't believe me,

690
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,240
you can drive me out.

691
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,319
As long as you say it,

692
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,960
I'll leave immediately.

693
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:46,440
Your Excellency.

694
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,319
Yan Bingyun has said nothing.

695
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,200
Torture him more severely.

696
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,759
Just make sure he's not dead.

697
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:55,720
Got it.

698
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:57,319
Oh. Your Excellency.

699
00:33:57,799 --> 00:33:58,480
Langtao

700
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,759
is arriving in Shangjing soon.

701
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,640
Once he arrives,

702
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:05,880
we couldn't fail

703
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,440
under any circumstances.

704
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:08,159
Got it.

705
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:15,800
Shouldn't you be tailing after Fan Xian?

706
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,360
He and Wang Qinian are gone.

707
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,639
What happened?

708
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,320
They slipped out of the residence today

709
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,480
and I tailed after them.

710
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,440
Unexpectedly,
someone stopped me halfway.

711
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:28,960
Who is it?

712
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,400
He wore a mask. I can't tell.

713
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,559
He chased and fought me

714
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:32,360
and then ran away.

715
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,440
Fan Xian disappeared at that time.

716
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,039
You're a Ninth Dan martial arts master.

717
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,199
So is that guy.

718
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,159
Which style?

719
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,039
Not sure.

720
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,000
On the whole,

721
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,800
it's grand in scale and imposing.

722
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:47,719
Mr. He,

723
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,760
there are only a few Ninth Dan
martial arts masters in Shangjing.

724
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,639
How could it be possible?

725
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,400
But he just appeared.

726
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,719
Impossible!

727
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,199
I don't think so.

728
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,239
Your Excellency,

729
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:01,480
there is no Ninth Dan
martial arts master

730
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,599
available in Shangjing.

731
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,440
Shangshan Hu is also
a Ninth Dan martial arts master.

732
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,400
Grand General,

733
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,280
These days,

734
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,000
Shangshan Hu has been looking
for Xiao En

735
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,519
in public and in secret.

736
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,400
To save Xiao En,

737
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,360
he could cooperate with anyone.

738
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,360
Fan Xian colluded with Grand General?

739
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,440
Shangshan Hu's martial arts style

740
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,880
is to be grand in scale.

741
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,760
Do you think it is him?

742
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:31,800
I can't tell.

743
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,320
Right.

744
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,239
He won't give the show away easily.

745
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,880
If he gets involved,

746
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:46,960
things will be more complicated.

747
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:47,880
Your Excellency,

748
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,800
let me go to his mansion
and ask him about it.

749
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,400
Shut up!

750
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,800
Be patient

751
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,320
till we get hard evidence.

752
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,400
Got it.

753
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:03,599
I'm wondering

754
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:06,199
where Fan Xian would go

755
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,480
with his help.

756
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:26,320
We're almost there.

757
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,000
He's imprisoned

758
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,920
in an old house
in the south of the city.

759
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,719
It was arranged by my brother.

760
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,960
How is he doing?

761
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,480
There are many wounds.

762
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:36,639
And he caught a cold.

763
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,360
Oh.

764
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:45,000
What will you do?

765
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,320
When will you save him?

766
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,079
Just today.

767
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,480
Today?

768
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:51,719
Tonight?

769
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:52,639
Now.

770
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,159
No. Not now.

771
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:56,679
It's closely guarded.

772
00:36:57,079 --> 00:36:57,920
You couldn't go in.

773
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,079
Tell them I'm your attendant.

774
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,159
I'm here to carry things for you.

775
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,599
They only allow me to go in alone.

776
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,760
I can't even take my servant girl

777
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,599
with me.

778
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,159
We're almost there.

779
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,679
You have to get off.

780
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,119
Take more helpers here to save him.

781
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,639
I don't have any other helper.

782
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:21,760
How can you save him in this case?

783
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:23,760
You have to help me.

784
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,719
I can't.

785
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,760
It's impossible to take you in.

786
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,000
It's not you that take me in.

787
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:30,960
It's me that take you in.

788
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,400
Fan Xian.

789
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,159
You all know me.

790
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,440
A hostage?

791
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,000
He's a formidable foe.
How can you hold back?

792
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,079
You should've taken action at once.

793
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,119
Just ask him if he needs

794
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:24,800
your help.

795
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,719
Even if he's suspicious of you,

796
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,719
your offer will remove his doubts.

797
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:32,000
In that case, with eyes watching,

798
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,320
I can't give you a chance to run away.

799
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,400
He won't let you go with him.

800
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:35,800
Why?

801
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
Whose cart is it

802
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,840
that the secret agents

803
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,719
let go so easily?

804
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,440
It's really...

805
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,679
Your Excellency,

806
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,800
the hostage

807
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,760
is your sister.

808
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,119
We've already...

809
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Do you need me to go with you?

810
00:38:58,679 --> 00:38:59,960
Just stay and take care of things here.

811
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,800
I'll get it done.

812
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:01,480
Your Excellency!

813
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,360
Your Excellency!

814
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,880
Don't come in. Stay outside.

815
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,400
Lady Shen did a good job.

816
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,119
She has a talent for playacting.

817
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,039
If Yan Bingyun

818
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:26,599
I'm Fan Xian.

819
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,239
You stopped me

820
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,960
on my way to the capital city
from Danzhou.

821
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:30,039
Do you still remember?

822
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,360
Yes.

823
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:36,800
Give me the token for Director-General.

824
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,800
So you want to take it by force?

825
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:40,280
Give it to me!

826
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,960
It's a new wound.

827
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,920
Did they just torture you?

828
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:50,599
Thanks to your intelligence,

829
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,639
Nanqing gained a complete victory.

830
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,920
Beiqi sued for peace.

831
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:54,400
As the envoy of the mission,

832
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:55,840
I'm here to take you home.

833
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,079
You gave in to Beiqi?

834
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,599
Do you think I'm lying?

835
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,079
It's not a long time
since you went to the capital city.

836
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,199
How could you become the envoy?

837
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:09,079
He's telling the truth.

838
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,159
He's here to save you.

839
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,000
Now that he's the envoy,

840
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,480
why did he come in by kidnapping you?

841
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,199
Shen Zhong wouldn't set you free.

842
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,320
So you came here yourself?

843
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,639
Shen Zhong is crafty.

844
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,079
How could he let you find me easily?

845
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,400
Come on.

846
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
I'm not stupider than him.

847
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,360
The spy network of Nanqing is hidden.

848
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,159
You plan to gain my trust

849
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,480
by saving me

850
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,119
and then catch the whole lot
in an action

851
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,239
when I contact them

852
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:38,639
after going out.

853
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,199
Shen Zhong wants you to do that, right?

854
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,119
Are you suffering from
persecution mania?

855
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,559
I've never heard of that.

856
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,880
As for how I got promoted

857
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,199
and how I became the envoy,

858
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,920
I'll explain it to you

859
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,920
when we go back.

860
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:56,760
Even if you're telling the truth,

861
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,000
tell me

862
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,400
how you'll get out of here.

863
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,119
Shen Zhong wouldn't

864
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,280
let me go easily.

865
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,079
I have a subordinate called Wang Qinian.

866
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,000
Wang Qinian,

867
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:09,480
The clerk of the First Division?

868
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,440
He's already

869
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,559
chosen to work for me.

870
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:12,880
Before I came here,

871
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,119
I asked him to seek help.

872
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:17,599
It's more ridiculous.

873
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,199
Here is Beiqi.

874
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,320
Who can you turn to?

875
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:23,159
Who can match
the Embroidered Uniform Guards?

876
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,599
I finally see

877
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,079
why you're severely tortured.

878
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:28,639
Mr. Yan,

879
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:29,719
nobody would like you

880
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:30,679
because of your character.

881
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,400
Be gentle.

882
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,719
Sorry.

883
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,199
I forgot you're injured.

884
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,320
I have another question.

885
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:39,440
I took back what I said.

886
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,599
Someone does like you.

887
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,079
I've told you.

888
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,320
I got close to you

889
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,559
just to take advantage of you

890
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,840
and find out more military information.

891
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,480
I've never been into you.

892
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,199
I'll get you a cup of water.

893
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,199
Your Excellency!

894
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:15,719
Are they inside?

895
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,400
Yes. They're surrounded.

896
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,639
There is no hot water here.

897
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,079
Make do with it.

898
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,199
Your brother and I

899
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,280
will be enemies forever.

900
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,280
You're helping me get out,

901
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,559
but I'm not sure
what'll happen in the future.

902
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,559
If you kill my brother someday,

903
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,920
just kill me too.

904
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,480
Lady Shen cares about you so much.

905
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:11,440
Why are you iron-hearted and ruthless?

906
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:12,280
And, guys,

907
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:14,159
can you continue talking

908
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:14,679
after we get back to the mission?

909
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:15,480
There is hot water in my place.

910
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:21,800
Catch me.

911
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,360
Brother,

912
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:25,760
they said they wouldn't spare my life

913
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:26,800
unless they escape.

914
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,400
You're muddle-headed.

915
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,840
They are secret agents of the enemy.

916
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,679
I... I was kidnapped.

917
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,159
I'm not an idiot!

918
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,599
Your Excellency Fan.

919
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,239
Well done.

920
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,320
You came in alone.

921
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:18,559
Aren't you afraid

922
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,280
I'd also kidnap you?

923
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,280
I just gave them an order.

924
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:26,599
They have to shoot arrows

925
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,519
at all of us

926
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,360
if you threaten me.

927
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:31,280
Brother!

928
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:34,440
Your Excellency Shen,
you don't have to do that.

929
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,320
You have to hand over Yan Bingyun

930
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,320
to us sooner or later.

931
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,760
Now that I found him,

932
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,159
it's better to let me take him back.

933
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:41,760
No problem.

934
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:44,639
As long as he gives me

935
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:45,239
the list of spies in Shangjing,

936
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,599
he'll be set free immediately.

937
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,320
How about telling him about it?

938
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,239
Okay.

939
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,960
All the ministers and
assistant ministers

940
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,880
of the six ministries of Beiqi

941
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,920
are secret agents of Nanqing.

942
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,079
If you kill them,

943
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,639
all will be at peace

944
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:19,280
and there'll be no spies here.

945
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,320
See?

946
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:29,960
Did you hear what he said?

947
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:35,000
I was kidnapped.

948
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:44,920
Your Excellency Fan, you're free to go.

949
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,280
He has to go with me.

950
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,000
No. Not now.

951
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,280
I'm not asking for your permission.

952
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,000
Then both of you stay.

953
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:53,800
Guards!

954
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:01,599
Your Excellency Shen, if you kill me,

955
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,599
aren't you afraid the two countries
will go to war again?

956
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,599
Nobody knows you're here.

957
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,079
Your Excellency Fan
disappeared suddenly.

958
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,679
We tried our best to look for you,

959
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,960
only to find your body.

960
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,960
I feel deeply grieved.

961
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,039
I'm bound to find the murderer

962
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,079
to avenge your death.

963
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,639
Kidnap me.

964
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:32,760
Kill him!

965
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:33,760
Your Excellency!

966
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,480
Guys, hold on.

967
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:49,559
I've got a helper.

968
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:04,400
How did you get a helper?

969
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:05,960
I get well along with people.

970
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,840
Saintess, why are you here?

971
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,800
Now that they found him,

972
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:26,639
the Embroidered Uniform Guards

973
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:27,639
lost this round.

974
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,920
Save face and let them go.

975
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,119
It's our own business.

976
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,199
Please stay out of it.

977
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,679
These are not my words.

978
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:42,679
His Majesty asked you to do that.

979
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,920
I only take orders
from the Empress Dowager.

980
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,559
She also said so.

981
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,280
Shall I wait here

982
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,840
so that you can go to
the imperial palace to confirm it?

983
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:12,119
Let them go.

984
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:14,559
Got it.

985
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,320
Why are you looking at me like that?

986
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:42,599
The Saintess of Beiqi is your helper.

987
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:44,159
Do you think I'd buy your story?

988
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,119
Come on.

989
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,119
It's really weird.

990
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,599
Have a good rest.

991
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,440
Don't think too much.

992
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:11,280
Your Excellency,

993
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,880
I went to Miss Haitang

994
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,679
as you said.

995
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,519
As expected,

996
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,920
you really took him back.

997
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,320
Wang Qinian.

998
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:19,639
It's really you.

999
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,760
Mr. Yan,

1000
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,320
I haven't seen you for a long time.

1001
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:24,960
Nanqing won a landslide victory.

1002
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:28,199
You've made great contributions.

1003
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,039
Even you gave in to Beiqi?

1004
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,360
What does he mean?

1005
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,239
Ignore him.

1006
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:38,079
What's most incredible

1007
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,400
about this

1008
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:41,239
is the Saintess of Beiqi

1009
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:42,599
helped us out.

1010
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,639
I can understand why you're confused.

1011
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:46,719
Actually, the Saintess

1012
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:48,239
didn't aim to help us,

1013
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:51,119
but to help His Excellency Fan.

1014
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:55,239
They work for different countries,

1015
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,280
but the two of them
have feelings for each other.

1016
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:03,920
Once a woman falls in love,

1017
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,880
she'll do something
beyond comprehension.

1018
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:06,840
Do you think I can't hear you

1019
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,639
because you lower down your voice?

1020
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,119
How could they fall in love?

1021
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:13,519
I have to

1022
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,519
start the story

1023
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:16,719
from his aphrodisiac.

1024
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:17,239
Speaking of...

1025
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,760
I can hear you.

1026
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:26,280
Miss Duoduo.

1027
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:28,039
Don't worry.

1028
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,880
From today on,

1029
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:31,920
I'll keep my mouth shut

1030
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:33,519
and never spill the beans.

1031
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,360
You got it wrong.

1032
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,519
Miss Duoduo,

1033
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,800
I see. I see.

1034
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It generated because of the medication,
but it's restrained because of love.

1035
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,679
Actually,

1036
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:48,119
it's a beautiful love story.

1037
00:50:57,039 --> 00:50:58,320
What a martial arts master!

1038
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,000
It's not easy for His Excellency.

1039
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,079
How can you do this?

1040
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:12,800
What's wrong with the guy?

1041
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,280
Shame on him.

1042
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,840
He ran away after harassing girls.

1043
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:17,679
Aphrodisiac?

1044
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:18,840
It's a misunderstanding.

1045
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:26,679
Have a good rest now that you're back.

1046
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:39,639
Mind your step.

1047
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:48,840
Thank you, Saintess.

1048
00:51:51,639 --> 00:51:53,280
Why did you let Wang Qinian come to me?

1049
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:54,360
To save us.

1050
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:57,760
What if I hadn't shown up?

1051
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:58,840
But you did.

1052
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:01,760
It'sbecause His Majesty
asked me to do that.

1053
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,239
Please convey my thanks to him.

1054
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:05,679
He'll see you in a few days.

1055
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:07,079
For what?

1056
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,000
To talk about killing Shen Zhong.

1057
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,119
No.

1058
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,440
Without his verbal instructions,

1059
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,119
you couldn't have saved Yan Bingyun.

1060
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,559
But I have

1061
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:17,960
taken him back.

1062
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,480
I want nothing nowadays.

1063
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,760
Why do I have to kill Shen Zhong?

1064
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,079
Do you always

1065
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:24,079
act shamelessly?

1066
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,920
Anyway, I have to thank you.

1067
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,079
I can't believe you said that.

1068
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:31,400
It turns out you'd also
lose your temper from embarrassment.

1069
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,159
What are you talking about?

1070
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:35,119
I'll teach Wang Qinian a lesson

1071
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:36,000
and stop him talking nonsense again.

1072
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,199
You're birds of a feather.

1073
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,159
We're not.

1074
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,880
I can't quite follow

1075
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,559
Wang Qinian's brain circuits.

1076
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,800
What's "brain circuits"?

1077
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,920
It means mind and thoughts.

1078
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:57,719
Your Excellency Shen,
I wonder what's worrying you.

1079
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,000
Two things.

1080
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:01,920
One

1081
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:04,639
is about Yan Bingyun of course.

1082
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,599
Your Excellency Shen,
don't need to blame yourself.

1083
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,119
He'll be set free sooner or later.

1084
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,079
It's all my sister's fault.

1085
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:16,400
She's really muddleheaded.

1086
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:18,880
She's young.

1087
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,360
A girl at her age

1088
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,079
usually focuses on love.

1089
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:23,599
I'm ashamed of her doing that.

1090
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,320
She must've been laughed at.

1091
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,119
I wonder what's the other thing

1092
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,239
that worries you.

1093
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:48,880
Of course it's something about you.

1094
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:50,840
Why did you say that?

1095
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,679
As a Ninth Dan martial arts master
in Shangjing,

1096
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:57,119
you failed to keep Fan Xian under watch.

1097
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,159
It's really weird.

1098
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:02,480
As I said,

1099
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,239
someone wearing a mask

1100
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:05,119
stopped me that day.

1101
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,320
Didn't you also suspect

1102
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:09,440
it's Shangshan Hu?

1103
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:15,679
I...

1104
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,639
I just tried to give you an out.

1105
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,840
That guy's timing

1106
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,119
was perfect.

1107
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:26,360
It means he had kept in contact
with Fan Xian.

1108
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,519
But since Fan Xian

1109
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:29,639
came to Shangjing,

1110
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:32,320
he's always been monitored.

1111
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:33,840
Mr. He,

1112
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:37,039
how do you think he managed to

1113
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:38,239
communicate with Shangshan Hu?

1114
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,920
Your Excellency Shen, what do you mean?

1115
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,320
That guy appeared at the perfect time.

1116
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,320
It was really weird.

1117
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:47,199
What if there was
no such a person at all?

1118
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,599
What if

1119
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:49,559
it was a lie you made up

1120
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,440
and it's you that let Fan Xian go?

1121
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:53,119
Are you suspicious of me?

1122
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,360
Yes.

1123
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:56,400
In this case,

1124
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,159
why didn't you put your cards
on the table last time?

1125
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,079
You're a Ninth Dan martial arts master.

1126
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:09,639
In case we fell out,

1127
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,920
I was not sure if I could defeat you.

1128
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:14,079
Well,

1129
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,079
are you sure you can do it this time?

1130
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,320
Langtao.

1131
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:41,800
You'd better lie down and have a rest.

1132
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,920
Now that you asked He Daoren to do that,

1133
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:47,320
Shen Zhong is bound to suspect him.

1134
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,000
Just because I have no contact

1135
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:50,760
with Shangshan Hu?

1136
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:52,199
Shen Zhong is suspicious.

1137
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,280
One loophole is enough.

1138
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,519
Loophole?

1139
00:55:57,679 --> 00:55:58,159
Come in.

1140
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,960
Your Excellency, Tan Wu...

1141
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:04,119
It's alright.
If you have something to report,

1142
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:05,199
you can say it
in the presence of Mr. Yan.

1143
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,440
Shangshan Hu's subordinate asked me

1144
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:09,719
when we'll take action.

1145
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:11,880
Tell him

1146
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,760
I'll give him a reply
in two or three days.

1147
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,360
Okay. I'll do that.

1148
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:18,360
I'll leave you alone.

1149
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:29,440
Have you kept in contact
with Shangshan Hu?

1150
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,000
He Daoren

1151
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:31,920
works for Head Chen.

1152
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:33,559
I won't let him
lose his life for nothing.

1153
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:44,559
My master said

1154
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,760
among all Ninth Dan
martial arts masters,

1155
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,639
I'm ranked the third.

1156
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,280
The top two

1157
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,119
are not in Beiqi.

1158
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,719
If you fight me,

1159
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,239
you'll definitely die.

1160
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,199
I've never betrayed Beiqi.

1161
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,159
Then put down your sword.

1162
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,159
Let's have a talk.

1163
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:21,239
If I put down my sword,

1164
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,400
I'd place myself at the mercy of you.

1165
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:41,760
Your Excellency.

1166
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:44,920
We found that

1167
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:46,639
Shangshan Hu's subordinate Tan Wu

1168
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,239
Why didn't you report it until today?

1169
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,599
He went there on the first day.

1170
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,039
Then he never showed up again.

1171
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,159
But Tan Wu showed up again today.

1172
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,440
Those guys

1173
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,920
neglected their duties.

1174
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:06,039
Punish them at hard labor for a year.

1175
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:06,639
Got it.

1176
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:16,760
So, Shangshan Hu

1177
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,000
really has kept in contact

1178
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,719
with Fan Xian.

1179
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:23,159
It may not be true.

1180
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,599
Maybe

1181
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:27,000
it's a trap set by me.

1182
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,320
I thought too much.

1183
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:33,079
Mr. He, please forgive me.

1184
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,239
It's all for the sake of Beiqi.

1185
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,679
If you're angry,

1186
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,800
you can stab me

1187
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:44,960
to vent your anger.

1188
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,840
The timing is perfect.

1189
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,320
Why did Tan Wu

1190
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,480
reappear today?

1191
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,880
He's here to discuss

1192
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,719
the cooperation.

1193
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,000
What will you do?

1194
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:14,519
To save Xiao En.

1195
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,199
Why do they want to cooperate with you?

1196
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,440
Shangshan Hu doesn't know

1197
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:20,800
where Xiao En is imprisoned.

1198
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,440
Our cooperation is based on the premise

1199
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:24,119
I find out where Xiao En is.

1200
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,639
Why does he believe you can do that?

1201
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,119
He didn't at the beginning,

1202
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:30,039
so I asked him to wait.

1203
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:31,760
If I save you,

1204
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,039
my capabilities will be proven.

1205
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:38,280
So, you asked He Daoren to tell lies

1206
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,599
to save me.

1207
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:41,519
When you do that,

1208
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:43,360
Tan Wu would show up,

1209
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,159
which in turn

1210
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,119
would spare He Daoren

1211
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:47,519
from suspicion.

1212
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:50,840
These things linked with each other
and interacted as both cause and effect.

1213
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,280
You're really capable.

1214
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,440
You can say such words more often.

1215
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,960
So, you know where Xiao En is?

1216
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:03,440
No idea.

1217
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,599
Can you find him?

1218
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:05,559
No.

1219
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:07,800
I found you

1220
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,519
just because Lady Shen loves you.

1221
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:12,599
I don't love her.

1222
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,159
I got closer to her

1223
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,480
just to collect military information.

1224
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,239
Enough. Enough.

1225
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:17,360
You don't need to explain it to me.

1226
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:21,800
Now that you can't find Xiao En,

1227
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,039
you're deceiving Shangshan Hu.

1228
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:24,599
No.

1229
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:26,599
I sincerely want to cooperate with him

1230
01:00:26,599 --> 01:00:28,360
and get Xiao En out.

1231
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:30,119
Don't you want to kill Xiao En?

1232
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,480
You can't do that
if we can't get him out.

1233
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,960
How will you get him out
if you can't find him?

1234
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,239
Haitang Duoduo told me

1235
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:41,280
the little emperor of Beiqi
wants to see me.

1236
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,039
What on earth do you want to do?

1237
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,320
It doesn't matter what I want to do.

1238
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:50,960
It matters
what relevant parties of Beiqi

1239
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:51,920
want to do.

1240
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:55,000
I'm just helping them

1241
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,880
achieve their goals

1242
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,719
respectively.

1243
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:11,880
As the Saintess,
you're showing me the way personally.

1244
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:13,719
I feel flattered.

1245
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:17,920
Or are you

1246
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:19,880
under the Empress Dowager's order

1247
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:21,400
to keep watch on me
and the little emperor?

1248
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:22,679
You're talkative.

1249
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,440
I can't believe

1250
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,360
you're a double agent.

1251
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:28,039
Come on. Is it related to you?

1252
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,079
No.

1253
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:30,280
I'm already engaged.
