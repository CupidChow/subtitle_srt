16
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,079
They're here.

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,040
You can make things clear

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,040
in their presence.

19
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,719
Prepare a seat and some tea
for Prime Minister.

20
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

21
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,480
Your Majesty, how about me?

22
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,359
You...

23
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,000
Just stand here.

24
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,599
Your Highness, you don't
need to bow to me.

25
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,840
The Investigator's Office
has checked Lin Gong's body.

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,960
He was killed by a skilled swordsman
with a fast sword.

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,800
Among all swordsmen in the capital city,

28
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,439
only Xie Bi'an that works
for the Second Prince

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,039
has the ability to do that.

30
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,280
Your Highness, you mean...

31
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,280
Your Highness, you mean...

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,039
I'm the one who killed Lin Gong.

33
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,319
Are you the killer?

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,919
You have to ask Fan Xian about it.

35
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:38,000
Your Highness,

36
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,400
how is it related to me?

37
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,879
During 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. of the day
when Lin Gong was killed,

38
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,479
I happened to
meet Fan Xian on the street

39
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,080
and we had a small talk.

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,719
Xie Bi'an was also there.

41
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,280
I just asked you to be here
to give witness.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,400
Xie Bi'an is known as

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,879
"Faster than Light."

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,000
He is the best swordsman

45
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,159
in the capital city.

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,240
Faster than light?

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,159
Fast sword.

48
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,280
Is it true?

49
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,719
Yes.

50
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,719
The Investigator's Office has confirmed

51
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,159
Lin Gong was killed
during 9 a.m. to 11 a.m.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,960
In this case,

53
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,120
Xie Bi'an didn't have enough time

54
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,680
to rush out of town to do that.

55
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,680
There is another possibility.

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,159
Fan Xian and you joined hands

57
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,280
to let Xie Bi'an kill Lin Gong.

58
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,639
He was giving false testimony

59
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,599
to help you stay out of it.

60
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,639
It's more ridiculous.

61
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,039
Why did I want to kill Lin Gong?

62
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,159
Why did Fan Xian want to do that?

63
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,919
Lin Gong is the one behind
the assassination attempt on Niulan Street.

64
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,599
Fan Xian holds a grudge against him.

65
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,639
Your Highness,

66
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,879
I have no idea about that.

67
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,560
He's the Crown Prince.

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,240
We have to bear it
if he wants to declare us guilty.

69
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,080
Then tell me

70
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,919
who else is so skilled at swordsmanship

71
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,560
if it's not Xie Bi'an.

72
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,919
It's not hard

73
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:43,479
to hire a sword master

74
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,639
who is unrecognized, right?

75
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,080
To whom are you
making pointed allusions?

76
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,319
I'm just trying to reason.

77
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,680
It's enough.

78
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,479
Prime Minister,

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
the victim is your son.
What do you think?

80
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,759
In my opinion,

81
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,400
the person to blame

82
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,399
is Chen Pingping.

83
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,800
The Investigator's Office is responsible
for the safety of the capital city.

84
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,759
Up to now, they haven't reported

85
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,199
the truth about my son's death.

86
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,720
It means Chen Pingping

87
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,639
has neglected his duties.

88
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,160
It makes sense.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,839
I hope to

90
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,680
confront Chen Pingping

91
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,959
and see him be punished
according to law.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,759
It seems you enjoy standing there.

93
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,279
Your Majesty, shall I kneel down?

94
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,600
Rise.

95
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:21,480
Pass on my order.

96
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,000
And ask Chen Pingping to come here.

97
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,079
Yes, Your Majesty.

98
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,439
Chen Pingping,

99
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,000
Your Majesty.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,839
Do you know your sin?

101
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,439
Why do you say that?

102
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,560
The Prime Minister's son was killed.

103
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:54,360
As Head of

104
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,199
the Investigator's Office,

105
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,839
you haven't found out
the killer up to now.

106
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,319
You have to take responsibility.

107
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:00,680
Your Majesty,

108
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,720
we've found out the killer.

109
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,160
You found it out?

110
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,040
Good.

111
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,120
In the presence
of Prime Minister and others,

112
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,160
tell me who is the killer.

113
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,079
Prime Minister,

114
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,399
I'm surprised to hear
the sad news upon my return.

115
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,879
I'm sorry for your loss.

116
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,360
naturally.

117
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,600
Si Gujian from Dongyi Town.

118
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
One of the Great Masters?

119
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,920
If it were not a Great Master,

120
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,680
who else could use a sword so quickly?

121
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,800
As a Great Master,

122
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,879
he travelled hundreds of miles
to the capital city

123
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,120
to kill the Prime Minister's son?

124
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,040
Why did he do that?

125
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,360
Lin Gong joined hands with Si Lili

126
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,519
to try to assassinate Fan Xian
on Niulan Street,

127
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,439
but Si Gujian lost
a disciple and a follower

128
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,319
during the process.

129
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,759
The two female assassinators

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,439
were killed by Fan Xian.

131
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,680
Why did Si Gujian kill Lin Gong

132
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,160
to take revenge?

133
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,720
Everyone knows that

134
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,120
Si Gujian is obsessed
with swordsmanship.

135
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,680
Fan Xian killed the two assassinators

136
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,240
when he was attacked.

137
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,160
Si Gujian would think highly of him

138
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,120
because of his capabilities.

139
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,000
And he'd only take revenge on

140
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,920
Lin Gong and Beiqi

141
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,319
that are behind all this.

142
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,199
Wait!

143
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,319
How does it relate to Beiqi?

144
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:37,839
Your Majesty,

145
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,600
Lin Gong tried to assassinate Fan Xian

146
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,560
because he was fooled by secret agents.

147
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,480
Beiqi disturbed the peace
in the capital city

148
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,879
and then got Si Gujian

149
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:49,600
involved into this case.

150
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,879
They're really evil-minded.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,079
Your Majesty, please dispatch troops

152
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
and go on a punitive expedition
against Beiqi.

153
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,360
What? Dispatch troops?

154
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,439
To revolt?

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,759
To revolt?

156
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,519
We can't do that
without careful thought.

157
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,480
Prime Minister, what do you think?

158
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,240
Prime Minister.

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,600
Your Majesty,

160
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,120
I beg you to bring fair back

161
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,399
to my dead son.

162
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,080
Prime Minister, you're
the most important official.

163
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,279
Come on. Rise.

164
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,279
Your Majesty,

165
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,360
I beg you to bring fair back

166
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,120
to my dead son!

167
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,039
In this case, I'll order

168
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,080
Dongyi Town to hand over the killer.

169
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,200
As for Beiqi...

170
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:13,919
Beiqi?

171
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,279
getting into a fight with them,

172
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,440
but they've gone too far in bullying us.

173
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,799
They're pressing on step by step.

174
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,279
So,

175
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,480
let's go to war.

176
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,120
I'll take a nation's strength

177
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,480
to punish the wicked.

178
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,080
I see.

179
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,080
I see.

180
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,919
Everything is clear now.

181
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,279
You...

182
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,039
Your Majesty.

183
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,559
You slandered your brother,

184
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,600
so you'll be grounded for three days.

185
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:00,879
Read more classics.

186
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,919
Both of you can leave.

187
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Your Highness,

188
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,240
As brothers,

189
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,759
we haven't had
a heart-to-heart talk for long.

190
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,440
How about getting together someday?

191
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,600
I'll be grounded for three days.
I don't dare to disobey the order.

192
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:40,559
Prime Minister,

193
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,720
you lost your son.

194
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,440
I understand how you're feeling,

195
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:47,720
but the war is going to start.

196
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,759
You have to take good care of yourself.

197
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:51,440
The six ministries need your management.

198
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,399
I have

199
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,960
mixed feelings

200
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,679
that are beyond words.

201
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,080
It's okay as long
as it's clear in your mind.

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,720
Your Majesty.

203
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,919
I have one more request.

204
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,759
Go ahead.

205
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,879
Now that the whole thing came to light,

206
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,960
I hope Head Chen

207
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,759
can have my son's body

208
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,600
sent to my mansion.

209
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,639
He made a big mistake,

210
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,559
but he's my son, anyway.

211
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,320
I want to have his bones buried.

212
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,559
It's only right and proper.

213
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,639
I'll have him

214
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,879
sent back later.

215
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,559
In this case, your subordinate
takes his leave.

216
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:52,919
Prime Minister.

217
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,279
Prime Minister,

218
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,159
considering what happened
between your son and Fan Xian,

219
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,200
Your Majesty, it seems that

220
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:05,360
invalidate Wan'er's marriage contract

221
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,720
to Fan Xian?

222
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,320
It's my son that made a mistake.
It has nothing to do with Fan Xian.

223
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,679
Besides, Fan Xian did a lot

224
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,080
to chase secret agents of Beiqi.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,200
We don't need to

226
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,240
invalidate their marriage contract.

227
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,000
You lost your son.

228
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,360
According to etiquette,

229
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,600
no wedding ceremonies should be
held in three years in your mansion.

230
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:32,559
Wan'er.

231
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,600
has nothing to the Lin mansion in name.

232
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:37,639
They can get married

233
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,120
as scheduled.

234
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:41,919
Right. It makes sense.

235
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,159
Their marriage contract
will remain unchanged.

236
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,120
But the war is going to begin,

237
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:47,759
so let's talk
about their wedding ceremony

238
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,039
after the war ends.

239
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,960
Your Majesty, it's a wise decision.

240
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,720
See Prime Minister out.

241
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,039
Your Majesty, I'm leaving too.

242
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,840
You're still here?

243
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:02,519
Yes.

244
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:03,240
Okay.

245
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,919
Eunuch Hou, don't bother.

246
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,320
We'll leave by ourselves.

247
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,519
I'd better see you out.

248
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,639
Let's go.

249
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,679
Si Gujian killed Lin Gong?

250
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,559
It's ridiculous.

251
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,120
It's true that Lin Gong was killed

252
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,200
by a skilled swordsman.

253
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,039
Do you think Lin Ruofu bought the story?

254
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,000
It doesn't matter as long
as the common people are convinced.

255
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,360
Did you

256
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,399
really see the Second Prince

257
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,399
and Xie Bi'an that day?

258
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,279
Yes, I did.

259
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,720
Then the Second Prince
couldn't have done that.

260
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,519
Isn't it Si Gujian?

261
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,720
Did a Great Master come here

262
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,399
to kill Gong'er

263
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,679
just for his two unknown followers?

264
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,080
Uncle, you don't believe that?

265
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,840
I'm not stupid.

266
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,399
In this case,

267
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,519
why didn't you say it out?

268
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,080
His Majesty acted in concert
with Chen Pingping

269
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,279
just to draw a final decision.

270
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,039
Nobody cares if I believe it or not.

271
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,480
Is it the answer His Majesty wants?

272
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,000
It's the answer Nanqing wants.

273
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,480
It'll be used as a perfect excuse

274
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:58,559
to send armed forces to attack Beiqi.

275
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,679
The common people will be filled
with a common hatred.

276
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,639
What a good answer!

277
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,000
How about the truth
about Lin Gong's death?

278
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,879
There'll be no truth at all.

279
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,360
The reason why Nanqing
wants to attack Beiqi

280
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,080
has to be beyond all doubt.

281
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,480
I won't be able to find out
the truth anymore.

282
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,320
All our grievances

283
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,519
and sorrow

284
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,759
have to be hidden behind that.

285
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,919
I'm not a qualified father.

286
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,320
I don't deserve to be his father.

287
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,360
Lin Gong was really killed

288
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,320
by a martial arts master.

289
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,320
Is Wuzhu in the capital city or not?

290
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:26,840
I've no idea.

291
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,159
No matter if he's here,

292
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,519
we have to insist the killer
should be Si Gujian.

293
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:34,919
We can't let anyone else

294
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,559
know that Wuzhu is alive.

295
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,080
The Investigator's Office

296
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,759
is erasing all information about him.

297
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,080
Try to find him.

298
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,240
Don't believe Chen Pingping.

299
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,320
Stay away from him as much as possible.

300
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,399
What kind of person is he?

301
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,399
He's well known for being resourceful,

302
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,120
capricious and ruthless.

303
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,679
Nobody can gain an insight
into his mind.

304
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,559
Do you hold a post

305
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,759
in the Investigator's Office?

306
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,399
Yeah.

307
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,400
Don't get involved too much.

308
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,000
After you marry Wan'er,

309
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,720
I'll find a way

310
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,279
to transfer you
to the Ministry of Personnel.

311
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,680
It'll be safer to work there.

312
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,319
Moreover,

313
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,960
don't be curious

314
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,319
about the truth of Gong'er's death.

315
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Don't investigate it anymore.

316
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,720
Of course I won't.

317
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,240
The secrets behind all this

318
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,680
will be more than you can bear.

319
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,039
Uncle, did you

320
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,640
guess who is the killer?

321
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,160
Chen Pingping,

322
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,200
wouldn't forge the wounds.

323
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm afraid he was really killed

324
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,240
by a Great Master.

325
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,680
Among the four Great Masters,

326
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,960
Ku He is in Beiqi,

327
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,279
Si Gujian is in Dongyi

328
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,480
and Ye Liuyun roams about the world.

329
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:01,240
The three of them
couldn't have done that.

330
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,240
How about the last one?

331
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,920
The last one

332
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,079
is in the imperial palace.

333
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,400
Who can order him to kill?

334
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:18,319
The Great Master in the imperial palace

335
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,680
will only listen to His Majesty.

336
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:23,599
Uncle,

337
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,319
Gong'er's death

338
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,279
just gives His Majesty a good excuse

339
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
to start the war.

340
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,200
The timing is perfect.

341
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:35,559
Do you suspect...

342
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,640
I'm just

343
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,599
talking about current affairs with you.

344
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,839
I suspect nobody.

345
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,599
Let's forget about it.

346
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,720
Don't mention it again.

347
00:18:59,279 --> 00:18:59,839
I see.

348
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,599
Spend more time with Wan'er.

349
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,680
She has a good relationship with Gong'er

350
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:10,559
and she's been in poor health.

351
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,480
Don't let her

352
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,279
come over for the funeral.

353
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,599
Go to see her

354
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,880
and try to cheer her up.

355
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:24,839
Got it.

356
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,599
I have something else to do.
You can leave.

357
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:42,119
What's up?

358
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,680
Her Highness wants to see you.

359
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:50,880
Show me the way.

360
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,319
Take this. It must be sweet.

361
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,839
You won't give short weight, right?

362
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:03,599
Which one do you prefer?

363
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,640
This one. I want this.

364
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,079
Okay.

365
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,599
Ruofu, don't be too sad.

366
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,640
Your Highness, thank you for your care.

367
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:57,880
I really appreciate it.

368
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,160
Gong'er is not my son,

369
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,680
but I also want to

370
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
find out the killer.

371
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,079
Your Highness, don't bother.

372
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,359
His Majesty is wise.

373
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,039
He's found out the murderer.

374
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,759
I know you're not convinced.

375
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,720
Why do you want to see me?

376
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,759
I've heard you insisted on

377
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,720
Wan'er marrying Fan Xian.

378
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,799
Your Highness, you're well-informed.

379
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,640
She's my daughter.

380
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,400
I don't want her to marry Fan Xian.

381
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,319
He's a bumpkin.

382
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,319
Do you hate to part with Wan'er

383
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,400
or to lose control of Neiku?

384
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:33,000
I didn't expect you'd look down
upon me so much.

385
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,920
Li Yunrui,

386
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:36,440
we know each other so well.

387
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,680
Don't pretend to

388
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:38,839
be sad and sorrowful

389
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,759
before me.

390
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,759
I'm Wan'er's mother.

391
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,240
I don't want her to marry him.

392
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,720
Why don't you go to His Majesty?

393
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,240
Do we really have to

394
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,640
talk like this?

395
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,200
Wan'er likes him.

396
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,319
So what?

397
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:57,920
Her marriage

398
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,720
is up to you and me.

399
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,079
Since she was born,

400
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,640
I've seen her

401
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:05,880
ever since I was born.

402
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,039
I owe her too much.

403
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,480
So, I don't want to stop her

404
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:12,480
doing what she likes to do anymore.

405
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,799
Besides,

406
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,200
Fan Xian is nice to Dabao.

407
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,640
I'll be relieved

408
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,720
to let Fan Xian take care
of the Lin family.

409
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,160
Do you know

410
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,319
he's a bastard son?

411
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,599
It's easier to support someone
without influence.

412
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,519
Wouldn't you ever think about me?

413
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,920
-Hurry. -Hurry.

414
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,680
Slow down.

415
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:38,519
Your Highness. Prime Minister.

416
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,160
Li Yunrui,

417
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,640
I've thought about it.

418
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,599
Let it go.

419
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:53,279
We'd better

420
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,960
not see each other again.

421
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,519
Come here for fun!

422
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:15,680
Sir,

423
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,319
can you watch my kite for me?

424
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:18,680
I want to go and play for a while.

425
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,000
Go ahead.

426
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,039
Thank you.

427
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,519
Have you got over your cough?

428
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:29,759
Why are you here alone?

429
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,119
My second brother is dead.

430
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,839
I know.

431
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,240
I heard that

432
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,200
it's he that plotted
the Niulan Street assassination.

433
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,559
Is it true?

434
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,400
Yes.

435
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,680
I remember.

436
00:23:59,119 --> 00:23:59,960
Teng Zijing's death

437
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,119
is a big blow to you.

438
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,480
You'd been trying
to find out the one behind it,

439
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,279
Right?

440
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,079
Yeah.

441
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,279
I have a question for you.

442
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,839
Don't lie to me.

443
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,640
Tell me.

444
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:29,880
I won't lie to you.

445
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,480
Did you

446
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,599
kill my second brother?

447
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:49,599
Not me.

448
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,440
Look at my eyes.

449
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:58,920
I didn't

450
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,559
kill Lin Gong.

451
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,480
Knowing he was killed,

452
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,359
I was both sad and worried.

453
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,839
I was afraid it's you

454
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,400
that killed him.

455
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,440
Did you plan to kill me with that sword

456
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,519
if it were me?

457
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,079
I'd kill myself.

458
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,440
It'd be too much for me to bear

459
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,720
if it were you.

460
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,640
I'd kill myself
to keep Lin Gong company.

461
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:28,920
Head,

462
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,799
it's the cart of Assistant Minister
of Ministry of Revenue ahead.

463
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,319
Stop him.

464
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
I have something to say to him.

465
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:36,400
Got it.

466
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,000
Keep your distance.

467
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,359
It was quick.

468
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:53,119
You took him back

469
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,200
while I was not here.

470
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,240
And you also found a good girl for him.

471
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,000
I just want to use it as a chance

472
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,039
to seize back Neiku.

473
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:02,519
It's just about some money.
Why don't you let it go?

474
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,680
The Investigator's Office
couldn't have been set up

475
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,960
if she hadn't aided you financially.

476
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,640
Neiku is the source of revenue
for the royal household.

477
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,839
If Fan Xian takes it over,

478
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,039
he'll become a target for all.

479
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,319
Listen to me.

480
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,279
Invalidate their marriage contract.

481
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,480
It's too late.

482
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:20,240
He wants to marry that girl.

483
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,039
The Ye family has lost control of Neiku.

484
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,000
Why do you get Fan Xian involved?

485
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,160
You wouldn't have given him that token

486
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,880
if you wanted him to stay away
from all this.

487
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:31,839
You did that in the hope of

488
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,559
letting him take
over the Investigator's Office, right?

489
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,440
I want him to inherit it.

490
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,400
Both the Investigator's Office

491
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,599
and Neiku are of great importance.

492
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,440
His Majesty is of great talent
and bold vision.

493
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,200
I don't think he'd let Fan Xian
hold the two posts concurrently.

494
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,160
The Investigator's Office
is in the teeth of the storm.

495
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,799
Isn't it great to let Xian'er

496
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:47,519
just be a rich guy?

497
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,160
Without power, his wealth will finally

498
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:53,680
become a castle in the air

499
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,519
or an unrooted tree.

500
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:55,640
I'll protect him.

501
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,319
Don't forget

502
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,799
After all, you took part in

503
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,160
on Niulan Street.

504
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,920
I won't let such a thing

505
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,039
happen again.

506
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:03,880
He'll have nothing to worry about

507
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,200
if he takes over
the Investigator's Office.

508
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:07,519
It's the best way of survival

509
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,359
to stay away from power struggle.

510
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,039
It seems

511
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,319
you can't convince me and vice versa.

512
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:16,559
It's always the case.

513
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:20,319
Fine.

514
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,200
Let's try to do all we can respectively.

515
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:24,319
Fan Xian's future

516
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,079
will be up to himself.

517
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:26,880
Okay.

518
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:35,400
Si Lili.

519
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
I'm Chen Pingping.

520
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,039
You must've heard that

521
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,880
I'm in charge of everything
in the Investigator's Office.

522
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,079
I have a question.

523
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,839
Did you tell Fan Xian

524
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,400
it's Lin Gong

525
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:51,000
that plotted
the Niulan Street assassination?

526
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:55,960
No. I didn't.

527
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,519
You shouldn't have hesitated.

528
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,960
Tomorrow morning at the imperial court,

529
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,799
His Majesty will tell everyone
secret agents of Beiqi

530
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,799
sowed discord between Nanqing
and Dongyi Town

531
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,160
and assassinated

532
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,440
the second son of the Prime Minister,

533
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,680
so we'll declare war on Beiqi.

534
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,079
The Nanqing army will

535
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:18,720
set foot on the border

536
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,160
and attack Beiqi in a day.

537
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,880
Sowed discord between Nanqing
and Dongyi Town?

538
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,720
Si Gujian killed Lin Gong.

539
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,519
It's Beiqi

540
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,680
that plotted this matter.

541
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,920
Si Gujian?

542
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,119
As a secret agent of Beiqi,

543
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:39,640
you're supposed to be killed
before the war starts.

544
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,359
But I'm the only one

545
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,359
that can keep you safe.

546
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:49,400
Got it?

547
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,160
What's the price for it?

548
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,559
From today on,

549
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,799
no matter who asks you

550
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,720
the question I asked just now,

551
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,759
don't hesitate.

552
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,319
There is only one possibility.

553
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,400
you didn't tell Fan Xian the truth.

554
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,480
Fan Xian doesn't have reason
to kill Lin Gong.

555
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,559
Who is he to you?

556
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,920
What's your relationship?

557
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,279
If you give the wrong answer,

558
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
nobody can keep you safe.

559
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,119
Uncle...

560
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,160
Be careful when you come here again.

561
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,480
Shadow from the Investigator's Office

562
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,119
keeps following me.

563
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,799
He's gone back
to the Investigator's Office.

564
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,720
You knew that?

565
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,559
Chen Pingping wants to protect you.

566
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,759
No.

567
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,640
Of course it's because of Lady Ye.

568
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,839
Who is my mom to him?

569
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:07,680
I can't remember.

570
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,440
I just know

571
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,799
it's Chen Pingping's black knights

572
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,599
that took revenge in the capital city

573
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,720
after Lady Ye was killed.

574
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,680
It turns out it's him.

575
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,359
I remember that

576
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,880
you have her eyes.

577
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,200
Who's that "she" you just mentioned?

578
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,839
Ye Qingmei.

579
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,960
What's so magical about my mom?

580
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,839
She's the guider

581
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,359
and the betrayer.

582
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,039
She's like Nuwa who repaired the heaven.

583
00:32:57,559 --> 00:32:58,559
She's the cause
of every phenomenon on earth.

584
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,079
She's the end of finality.

585
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:03,400
Uncle...

586
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,559
What am I talking about?

587
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,119
You don't know

588
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,680
what you just said?

589
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:24,000
I said them out

590
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,519
before I knew it.

591
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,599
They might come
from the depths of my memory,

592
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,519
but I can't remember.

593
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:47,880
I'm fine.

594
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,519
Take your time if you can't remember.

595
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:51,960
Uncle...

596
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,160
What's up, Uncle Wuzhu?

597
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,279
Uncle...

598
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,160
Uncle...

599
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,759
Uncle Wuzhu.

600
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,920
Uncle...

601
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:15,559
Uncle...

602
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,119
I think I remember

603
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,320
where the Taiping Residence is.

604
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,440
Where?

605
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,440
2.5 km east of the city.

606
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,800
The key to my mom's box

607
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,760
might be hidden

608
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,480
in the Taiping Residence.

609
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,400
If we find it,

610
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,119
you may get your memory back.

611
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,159
Let's go there tomorrow.

612
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,000
No,

613
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,280
If I rush to

614
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,039
the Taiping Residence now,

615
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,280
I will draw a lot of attention.

616
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,280
Then I will go.

617
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,000
Neither can you.

618
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,519
I have an idea.

619
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,960
But I need a few days for preparation.

620
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,320
For this trip out of the capital,

621
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,719
we'll need a lot of company.

622
00:34:58,559 --> 00:34:59,119
Why?

623
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,679
Crowds can make it easier

624
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,039
to hide the truth.

625
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:15,960
Good! Good! Good!

626
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,920
We've made a large purchase of paper,

627
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,559
and the unit price is three qian
higher than expected.

628
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,559
Luckily, we've
cut the number of servants.

629
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:26,599
That might make up to it.

630
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,199
Don't think about this
on a trip out of the city.

631
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:30,880
What's your problem, Fan Xian?
Give it to me.

632
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:32,960
What should you call him?

633
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:34,519
Brother.

634
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,280
Give it to me!

635
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:37,079
You don't have to worry about that.

636
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,639
Then who will take care of it?

637
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,639
Our bookstore is going to open soon.

638
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,719
You don't write books.

639
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:43,800
You only fool around.

640
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,880
Who asked to come along?

641
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,199
I just want to keep an eye on him.

642
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,480
Your Excellency, the girls are in front.

643
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,440
You can't go inside!

644
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,840
Ling'er also wants to go for an outing.

645
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:32,400
Do you mind

646
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,920
if we can go out together?

647
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:35,920
I don't mind.

648
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,639
More people, more fun.

649
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,840
I don't know how you made it.

650
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,199
The northern side
of our country is at war,

651
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,320
but His Majesty actually

652
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,559
agreed on us coming out.

653
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,159
We should enjoy life

654
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:48,440
even when the war is intense.

655
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,039
So the enemies can feel our confidence

656
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,880
in winning the war.

657
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,039
You're talking nonsense.

658
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,760
Walking out more often

659
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,800
is good for your health.

660
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:57,599
Whatever you say.

661
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
Really?

662
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,920
I miss you already.

663
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:14,039
If only we could get married sooner.

664
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,719
Then we can be together every day.

665
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:19,360
Good! Good! Good!

666
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:21,079
I'll take another carriage.

667
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,320
Enjoy yourselves.

668
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,880
Lady Ye,

669
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,679
how can you get off alone,

670
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,880
leaving My Lady alone with that...

671
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:32,239
If I stay for another minute,
I'm gonna puke.

672
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:32,960
If you can tolerate that,

673
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,719
you can go inside.

674
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,719
Can you be gentle?

675
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:38,639
You...

676
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,760
How come it's you, tigress?

677
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
Where do you hide my brother?

678
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,440
Lady Fan Ruoruo,

679
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,519
someone acted so shamelessly

680
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:48,159
in Princess Lin's carriage.

681
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,639
It's really awkward

682
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,440
for me to stay there.

683
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,960
If you don't mind,

684
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,960
I will stay with you.

685
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,400
Come over and take a seat.

686
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,639
Sister!

687
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:03,159
How can you let her

688
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,280
stay with us?

689
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,320
You must protect me!

690
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,559
Sister, you must protect me!

691
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,280
Your trick works. Are you happy now?

692
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,480
Those words are
from the bottom of my heart.

693
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,400
Why aren't we leaving?

694
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:34,000
There's one more person to come.

695
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:35,960
One more person?

696
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,519
Xianxian!

697
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:49,880
Dabao!

698
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:51,280
Wan'er.

699
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:52,599
I invited him.

700
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,519
Dabao, come over now.

701
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,559
I'll stay here.

702
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,679
Dad said,

703
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,360
I should...

704
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,719
I should...

705
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,639
give

706
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,840
Xianxian and Wan'er

707
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,760
more private space.

708
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:07,960
Good boy! You're the best.

709
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,320
Dabao, sit well in the carriage.

710
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,239
Let's go for an outing.

711
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:13,159
Xianxian, you really know how to play.

712
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,440
Don't call me Xianxian.

713
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,480
OK.

714
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,400
Xianxian!

715
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:31,159
The war is on.

716
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,719
Yan Ruohai is at the border

717
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,320
dealing with secret information.

718
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,639
He's terribly busy.

719
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,079
God blesses Nanqing.

720
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,360
We're doing really well in the war.

721
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,440
But recently,

722
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,800
officials from the Six Ministries
start to clamor,

723
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,480
advocating that

724
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,000
we should capture Beiqi

725
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:52,480
at one fling.

726
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,679
Who started it?

727
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:57,079
We don't know yet.

728
00:39:57,719 --> 00:39:59,480
But officials who take part

729
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,000
are from Six Ministries.

730
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,360
Investigate them thoroughly.

731
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:04,159
Head,

732
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,679
The "gnawing-away" scheme

733
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,119
set by His Majesty is the safest.

734
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:11,360
The war is about to end.

735
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,440
Whoever advocate capturing Beiqi

736
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,440
are traitors.

737
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:19,360
Many officials from our Office

738
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,360
also hold this view.

739
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,440
In their opinion,

740
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,239
it's the best chance
to unify the whole world.

741
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,360
Investigate them, punish them,

742
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,280
or even kill them if you have to.

743
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:31,599
Yes.

744
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,039
Many people hope
to capture Beiqi with one blow.

745
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:45,199
The louder they advocate,
the sooner they'll give up!

746
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,880
Is Fan Xian OK?

747
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,079
He goes for an outing

748
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:49,920
with Lin Wan'er.

749
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,039
Why don't you go along?

750
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,199
I can't.

751
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:53,599
If anything happens to you,

752
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,480
I won't be able to get back.

753
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:57,519
How can anything happen to me?

754
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,519
Recently,

755
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,480
there's been a secret voice against
you in the Investigator's Office.

756
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,400
Someone is fed up with

757
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,599
your control.

758
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,880
Who might that be?

759
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,440
If I know, I'll kill him.

760
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,400
Chen Pingping, be careful
about the people around you.

761
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,480
What's up?

762
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:25,840
The Head wants to investigate

763
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:28,880
which officials from
the Six Ministries advocate war.

764
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,760
That's the job of your division.

765
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,320
Recently,

766
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,760
there have been officials meeting
secretly everywhere,

767
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,320
planning to submit a joint memorial

768
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,079
for wiping out Beiqi at one blow.

769
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,840
You really should carry out
a thorough investigation.

770
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Last night,

771
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,880
in the residence of the Assistant
Minister of Ministry of Penalty,

772
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,199
someone from our Investigator's Office

773
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:48,239
was also there.

774
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,480
Do you know

775
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
what you've been doing?

776
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,960
My son is still at the capital of Beiqi.

777
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:58,880
The earlier Beiqi is captured,

778
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
the sooner

779
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:01,760
he can be safe.

780
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,840
I haven't told the Head about it.

781
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,480
It's not too late to stop.

782
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,360
With the "gnawing-away" scheme,

783
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,960
how many years will it be

784
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,800
to capture Beiqi.

785
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,239
We don't have a say in this.

786
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,960
Everything I did

787
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,360
is for Nanqing.

788
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:16,679
So does the Head.

789
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,480
He's old.

790
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,159
Enough!

791
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,719
Don't make me arrest you myself!

792
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,559
Can I poke it?

793
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:29,159
No! It will bite you.

794
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:30,760
Is it poisonous?

795
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:32,400
I don't know.

796
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,480
Look, there's another hole here.

797
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,559
Will it

798
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:39,719
hide something inside?

799
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,719
Childish!

800
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:46,960
Poke it! Poke it!

801
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:52,880
Dabao!

802
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,760
Don't play with worms.

803
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,840
How about learning

804
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,360
How's it going?

805
00:43:59,119 --> 00:43:59,920
Self-defense moves!

806
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:01,199
Is that fun?

807
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:02,880
Dabao!

808
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,159
Don't talk to her.

809
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:10,440
No!

810
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:13,400
She is a tigress.

811
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:15,920
She eats people. She's horrible.

812
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,360
She's not.

813
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,880
She's Wan'er's friend.

814
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:20,000
She's not scary.

815
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:22,239
I'm Fan Xian's younger brother.

816
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,280
Don't you believe me?

817
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:25,480
Xianxian?

818
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:29,880
If you don't believe me,

819
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,239
don't you believe Xianxian?

820
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,079
Sister,

821
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,760
he told me you're a tigress.

822
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,400
Will you eat people?

823
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:38,920
What?

824
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,880
Fan Sizhe, do you need a good beat?

825
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,480
I didn't say that.

826
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,159
Stop!

827
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:44,519
Hurry up! Run!

828
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,920
Little one, just run!

829
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,400
Stop!

830
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,559
The tigress will eat you.

831
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:48,639
Hurry up and run! Hurry up and run!

832
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:49,400
I didn't expect them

833
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,280
to have fun together.

834
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:53,920
Dabao still retains childlike innocence.

835
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,639
He's willing to come out with you,

836
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,880
which means he really trusts you.

837
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,440
We will be family in future.

838
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:04,920
Thank you.

839
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:06,880
Thank me for what?

840
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,159
I know that

841
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,039
my second brother's funeral is being
held in the Prime Minister's mansion.

842
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,440
As a bastard daughter,

843
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,239
I can't go there.

844
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:18,679
Your father said

845
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:19,599
he doesn't want Dabao

846
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:20,639
to stay in the mansion, either.

847
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,119
He said since your bother is gone,

848
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,400
no need to make the living ones suffer.

849
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:26,679
Stop.

850
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:28,559
You really need a good beat!

851
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,880
But he's my second brother after all.

852
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,719
Where's Ruoruo?

853
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:49,920
Where is she?

854
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,360
She's probably idling around.

855
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:52,000
Let her be.

856
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,440
Have some fruit.

857
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:20,920
Your Highness.

858
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,320
The three-day punishment is over.

859
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,639
Read these days' information

860
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,719
to me.

861
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:30,480
Yes.

862
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,159
Recently,

863
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,679
there have been hot debates
in the imperial court.

864
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:39,480
We've achieved a complete victory
in the war against Beiqi.

865
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,559
Now, many officials
from different ministries

866
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,039
want to submit a joint memorial

867
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,719
to advocate capturing Beiqi at one blow.

868
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:49,960
The Second Prince is
contacting the Ministry of War.

869
00:46:53,239 --> 00:46:55,000
Fan Xian and Princess Wan'er

870
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,679
left the capital city.

871
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,039
Where did they go?

872
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:00,679
They left for an outing

873
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,760
from the South Gate.

874
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,519
The South Gate?

875
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,079
Yesterday, the Empress Dowager...

876
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:12,760
The Prime Minister visited

877
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,519
Princess Wan'er last night.

878
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,679
How do we get the information?

879
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,880
A little eunuch
from Imperial Clothes Division

880
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:20,039
and a guard from the imperial residence

881
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:20,920
are cousins.

882
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,159
Last night, when visiting his cousin,

883
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:24,719
the eunuch saw the Prime Minister

884
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,159
entering the residence
in casual clothes.

885
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,079
He reported the information
when he came back.

886
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,639
So Lin Ruofu secretly visited

887
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,519
Lin Wan'er late at night

888
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,599
without telling anyone.

889
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:35,599
Don't you find it weird?

890
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,760
What's wrong?

891
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,679
Will Lin Wan'er

892
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,880
tell Fan Xian about it?

893
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,760
Now the Prime Minister
roots for Fan Xian.

894
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,519
Why should she hide it from him?

895
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:52,800
Get the carriage ready!

896
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,199
Your Highness, where are we going?

897
00:47:58,039 --> 00:47:58,880
Let's go for an outing.

898
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,440
I've got it.

899
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,239
Let me see!

900
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:07,280
It's so heavy.

901
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,280
Let me help you.

902
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:13,719
What have you got?

903
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:23,920
Don't tell anyone

904
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,119
about my visit,

905
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:28,079
especially Fan Xian.

906
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:31,119
When you go outing tomorrow,

907
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,760
do one thing for me.

908
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,119
When you're out,

909
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:38,320
find an excuse to go deep into the woods

910
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,760
with Fan Xian only.

911
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:42,960
Remember that

912
00:48:43,639 --> 00:48:46,760
no matter what happens...

913
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,639
What's wrong? Are you OK?

914
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,559
I'm fine.

915
00:48:58,719 --> 00:48:59,559
How do you feel recently?

916
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,639
Do you feel anything wrong?

917
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:02,920
No.

918
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:04,960
Nothing wrong.

919
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:17,320
Got it!

920
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:18,920
Put it down! Put it down! Put it down!

921
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:32,440
The Assistant Minister
of the Ministry of Rites

922
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,159
has come to offer
his condolences in person.

923
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,719
Won't you see him?

924
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,639
If I meet him, we will talk politely.

925
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:41,599
He will say restrain your grief,
and I will say thank you.

926
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:44,639
It's so boring.

927
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:47,039
But you should be

928
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,599
at the mourning hall.

929
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:50,960
Will my son come back to life

930
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:53,800
if I'm there?

931
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:01,159
Have you sent out the men?

932
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,280
They're all martial arts masters.
They're waiting outside the capital city.

933
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,000
But Fan Xian and Wan'er

934
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,320
have taken out many attendants.

935
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:11,320
It won't be easy for them to attack.

936
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,320
He will leave the crowd.

937
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:17,840
What on earth are you going to do?

938
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,800
By then, Fan Xian

939
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:22,360
will be attacked.

940
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:24,320
You should act as if you know nothing.

941
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,639
Don't give yourself away.

942
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:27,880
Don't you support Fan Xian

943
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,920
all along?

944
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:29,880
Haven't you entrusted Fan Xian

945
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,800
with the future of

946
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,920
the Lin family?

947
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,480
I still don't know who killed Gong'er.

948
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,320
I can trust the Lin family

949
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,719
to an outsider.

950
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,800
But I must

951
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,360
remove all my doubts.

952
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:50,800
Were you pretending to

953
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,920
be supportive all these days?

954
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:53,920
Not really.

955
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,400
If Fan Xian can pass this test,

956
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,920
I really want to make him

957
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,239
the backbone of the Lin family.

958
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,840
The day the Second
Young Master was killed,

959
00:51:05,239 --> 00:51:07,280
Fan Xian really didn't
leave the capital city.

960
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,440
I have a suspicion.

961
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,239
What if there's
a hidden martial arts master

962
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:19,480
by Fan Xian's side,

963
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,320
a master who could

964
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,519
match the Four Great Masters?

965
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,519
Fan Xian was inside the capital city,

966
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,000
but that martial arts master
killed Gong'er instead.

967
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,159
According to Si Lili,

968
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:33,159
she didn't tell Fan Xian

969
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:33,960
the secret of the Second Young Master.

970
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,960
Her words don't matter.

971
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,440
As long as evidences show that

972
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,840
there's a peerless martial arts master

973
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,840
around Fan Xian,

974
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:43,360
I can confirm that

975
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:46,119
he's the one who killed Gong'er.

976
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,320
This assassination

977
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,679
is the final test.

978
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:55,840
Dabao and Wan'er are also there.

979
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:57,519
What if they get hurt...

980
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,960
Because they are there,

981
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,960
no one would believe that

982
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:04,960
I'm the one who planned it.

983
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:09,599
I hope there wouldn't be

984
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,000
such a martial arts master.

985
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:20,920
I've got it! I've got it!

986
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,800
I told you.

987
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,119
I don't lie.

988
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,400
You got it, right?

989
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:31,239
Now we've got two.

990
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,480
It's your turn now.

991
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:35,239
Watch me!

992
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,480
What's up?

993
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,320
I want to...

994
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,480
You want what?

995
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,960
I want to go somewhere quiet.

996
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,679
Why?

997
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:54,599
Wan'er.

998
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,400
Here, it's for you!

999
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,079
Where have you been?

1000
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,760
The flower field over there.

1001
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,800
Brother, stop sitting here as a fool.

1002
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:06,360
Come with me to pick some flowers.

1003
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,760
You can make Wan'er a garland yourself.

1004
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:08,840
OK.

1005
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:10,840
Wan'er, wait for a moment.

1006
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,159
Brother, I found the Taiping Residence.

1007
00:53:18,519 --> 00:53:20,039
Walk along the river to the east,
and you'll see it.

1008
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:20,880
OK.

1009
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:22,719
I'll go and see.

1010
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:23,599
Stay here to cover me.

1011
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,400
Brother, I'll go with you.

1012
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,159
Hurry up!

1013
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:36,960
Don't let them find out.

1014
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:01,559
Listen!

1015
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,760
When Fan Xian comes
into the woods alone,

1016
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:04,880
we should spare no efforts
in striking him down.

1017
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:05,880
Watch out!

1018
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,480
Don't hurt our lady.

1019
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:08,039
Do you understand?

1020
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:08,679
Yes.

1021
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:13,079
How's it going?

1022
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:13,880
They are over there.

1023
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,519
Have you seen Fan Xian?

1024
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:16,039
I only saw our lady.
Fan Xian was not there.

1025
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:16,519
What?

1026
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:18,559
You didn't see Fan Xian.

1027
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:19,840
Right.

1028
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,559
I sneaked over

1029
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,679
and saw our lady
and the First Young Master.

1030
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:25,480
But Fan Xian was not there.

1031
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,559
What's happening?

1032
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,440
Don't be nervous.

1033
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,400
We'll wait till he shows up.

1034
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:35,440
Go and check again.

1035
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:36,440
Yes.

1036
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:45,480
It's right ahead.

1037
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,079
My mom used to live

1038
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:48,800
in the Taiping Residence.

1039
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,039
I can't let others know

1040
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:50,840
I've been here.

1041
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,440
So I came up with the idea
of going for an outing.

1042
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:53,800
I know.

1043
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:55,239
Your secret is safe with me.

1044
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:56,639
Uncle Wuzhu will be here in a moment.

1045
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,599
You haven't met yet.

1046
00:54:58,199 --> 00:54:59,960
Is he easy to get along?

1047
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:00,840
He seldom talks.

1048
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:03,639
Are you here to mourn her?

1049
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:05,079
No, we're here for a key.

1050
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:08,360
A key?

1051
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,159
It's right ahead.

1052
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,480
Brother, here it is.

1053
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,599
My mom used to live here.

1054
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,559
There's no weed on the walls.

1055
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,119
It is well cleaned.

1056
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:33,239
Perhaps someone lives here.

1057
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:34,199
No.

1058
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,440
If someone lives here,

1059
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:37,039
there should be smoke rising from

1060
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:38,199
the chimney right now.

1061
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,239
Maybe he eats early.

1062
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:47,920
It's so quiet around.

1063
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,199
Not even a chirp from birds.

1064
00:55:56,039 --> 00:55:57,519
Brother, look.

1065
00:55:57,719 --> 00:55:58,719
The flowers here are really beautiful.

1066
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,599
Let's fetch some for my sister-in-law.

1067
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,320
After all, we told her

1068
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,360
we're here to pick flowers.

1069
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,719
Let's hurry back.

1070
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,760
Don't keep them waiting.

1071
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:07,360
Here you are.

1072
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:36,880
Come back!

1073
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:44,519
Your Highness!

1074
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,119
Cousin.

1075
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,440
Where's Fan Xian?

1076
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:49,039
He went to pick flowers.

1077
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,119
Do you want to see him?

1078
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,480
All rise. No need to make a fuss.

1079
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,239
Let's go for a walk.

1080
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,199
When Fan Xian gets back,
ask him to wait for me.

1081
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:05,599
OK.

1082
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:19,159
What time is it?

1083
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,199
It's time.

1084
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
What if they fail?

1085
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:31,000
They were kept

1086
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,079
outside the capital city before.

1087
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,000
Even if they fail,

1088
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,519
they won't get us in trouble.

1089
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,880
Moreover,

1090
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,920
they've never seen Fan Xian before.

1091
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:41,679
They won't give themselves away.

1092
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,159
Master, you've helped me a lot.

1093
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,440
What if there's no martial arts master

1094
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,320
by Fan Xian's side?

1095
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,480
Then I'm afraid

1096
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,519
I will never know who killed Gong'er.

1097
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,559
Boss!

1098
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,519
What's up?

1099
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:11,639
He left.

1100
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:12,360
Who left?

1101
00:58:12,679 --> 00:58:14,719
Our lady and a young man

1102
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,039
left alone.

1103
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:18,679
Let's go!

1104
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,079
Cousin, where are your guards?

1105
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:33,760
My carriage is stopped far away.

1106
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,719
You're too incautious.

1107
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,599
We can't talk with them around.

1108
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,079
Cousin, what do you want to talk about?

1109
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:48,320
What on earth did your father

1110
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,159
tell you last night?

1111
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:53,280
Let me guess.

1112
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:57,119
Your father is still suspicious of

1113
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,599
Fan Xian.

1114
00:58:58,920 --> 00:58:59,559
Right?

1115
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:03,719
It's an easy guess.

1116
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:06,440
Your father acts cautiously
all his life,

1117
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,880
but he trusts Fan Xian

1118
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,159
too easily.

1119
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:14,440
It must be hard for you.

1120
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:25,400
Brother, I can't see the archer.

1121
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,400
Stay where you are.

1122
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:27,079
Brother!

1123
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,920
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

1124
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:32,440
Brother!

1125
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:42,119
Who shot the arrows?

1126
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,400
The arrow is to keep people

1127
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,199
away from the Taiping Residence.

1128
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:05,920
Uncle Wuzhu.

1129
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,320
Not bad.

1130
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:12,559
Actually, it's fine
for Ruoruo to see you.

1131
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,480
Rest assured.

1132
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,039
She'll wake up in a while.

1133
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:18,679
I know who killed Lin Gong.

1134
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,800
Are you going to name
my second cousin again?

1135
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,079
Who is he?

1136
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,000
It's not Fan Xian.

1137
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:30,920
You don't have to worry.

1138
01:00:31,639 --> 01:00:32,519
Then who on earth is he?

1139
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:34,159
Just tell your father.

1140
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,320
The murderer is a Great Master.

1141
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:38,920
Then what?

1142
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,199
Tell him everything,

1143
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:41,639
and he will understand naturally.

1144
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:44,239
Why can't you tell me?

1145
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,960
It's a serious matter.

1146
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,960
Fan Xian, you'll die today.

1147
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,199
What do you call me?

1148
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:02,559
He's not Fan Xian.

1149
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:03,199
No need to lie.

1150
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:06,079
Fan Xian owes us a huge debt of blood.

1151
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,519
We can recognize him

1152
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:08,719
even if he's turned into ashes.

1153
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,840
We're not.

1154
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,039
Young lady, no need to worry.

1155
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,159
We only want to kill Fan Xian.

1156
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:15,760
We don't know you.

1157
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,800
We certainly won't hurt you.

1158
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:18,719
What's this all about?

1159
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:20,960
Does your father plan all of this?

1160
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:23,360
You...

1161
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,800
Shut up!

1162
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:27,199
Let me tell you.

1163
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:28,760
What between us is personal.

1164
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:30,519
It has nothing to do
with the Prime Minister.

1165
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,840
If you really don't know her,

1166
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,840
how do you know her father
is the Prime Minister?

1167
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:38,599
Guards!

1168
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:40,239
Take him to somewhere quiet.

1169
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,199
Take his life.

1170
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:42,920
Wait! Wait!

1171
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:43,920
Wait!

1172
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,840
Wait! Wait!

1173
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,239
He's the Crown Prince.

1174
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,159
