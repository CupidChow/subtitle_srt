=Episode 12=

16
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,439
I've seen the shots.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
It must be a martial arts master
of the Ninth Dan.

18
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:47,959
What to do now?

19
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:48,840
I will hold him.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,120
You should sneak in
from another direction

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,760
to find the key.

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,920
I've never been here.

23
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,000
Can we switch?

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,400
I'll be the diversion,
and you can look for the key inside.

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,840
A Ninth Dan archer is rare in the world.

26
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,079
You're no match for him.

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,159
This place is so big.

28
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,040
Where should I start?

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,760
Right opposite the square tower
in the lake.

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,640
Get into the bedroom.

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,480
Check the bookshelf
and space below the bed.

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,520
You remembered!

33
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,759
I remember something
after seeing the high walls.

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,599
How will you hold him?

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,719
Uncle...

36
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,159
Unbelievable!

37
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,439
Boss, why not cover your face?

38
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,479
No need. He has seen my face just now.

39
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,280
It's been a while. No one has shown up.

40
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,039
Should we let him go?

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,879
Are we going to see the Prime Minister?

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,360
Shut up! Back off!

43
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:00,240
Go!

44
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:00,879
Go!

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,840
Listen.

46
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,759
He knows the Prime Minister
is behind this.

47
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,199
We can't let him go.

48
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,240
Then what can we do?

49
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,560
How could I know?

50
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:22,919
Nothing happens.

51
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,199
What is he up to?

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,240
A Ninth Dan archer.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,399
Your shot was pretty good.

54
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,560
How heavy is your bow?

55
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:39,879
Go ahead.

56
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,240
No need to get out.

57
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,639
I'll sit right here.

58
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,040
Shoot me if you dare.

59
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,480
I'm here.

60
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:46,759
She'll be fine.

61
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,959
Watch out!

62
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,279
If you dare not,

63
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,079
I'll go inside

64
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:50,800
after eating this piece.

65
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:02,319
Go back!

66
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,959
I've got you.

67
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,560
No one?

68
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,279
Let's go back.

69
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,840
You woke up when the tree fell down.

70
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,440
Why don't you talk?

71
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,559
I thought

72
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,559
you may not want to be seen.

73
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,879
Fan Xian trusts you.

74
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,000
Who's that archer?

75
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,679
Has my brother

76
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,600
entered the yard?

77
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,879
Will he be in danger?

78
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:47,799
Tell me!

79
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,320
Your Majesty, why are you here?

80
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,559
You should be the one
to answer that question.

81
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,519
I... I...

82
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,759
I was on a date with Wan'er

83
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,200
outside the capital city.

84
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,519
Then I just idled around

85
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,399
and walked here.

86
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,360
I found this yard

87
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,799
and felt thirsty.

88
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,279
So I came in to get some water.

89
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,000
Really? Go on.

90
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
I was looking for water,

91
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:34,919
and then I found Your Majesty.

92
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,799
Do you know who once lived in this yard?

93
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:41,720
I've no idea.

94
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,480
It was an old friend of mine.

95
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
When I was free,

96
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,759
I would often visit here
and take a walk.

97
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,399
What kind of a person was she?

98
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:15,080
Fan Xian,

99
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,039
you've never knelt down

100
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,559
before me, right?

101
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,840
I can kneel down now if you ask.

102
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:23,919
Your Majesty,

103
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,799
a highly-skilled archer

104
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,360
made an attack by the river just now.

105
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,559
I'm afraid he was trying
to lure the guards away.

106
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,600
So I take the liberty to see
whether Your Majesty is OK.

107
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:33,799
I'm fine.

108
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,519
If Your Majesty is fine,

109
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,759
then I'm relieved.

110
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,039
One more thing.

111
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,240
Your Majesty, do you
need anything to eat?

112
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,200
I've finished my meal.

113
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:20,240
This is Yan Xiaoyi,

114
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,919
Yan Xiaoyi.

115
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:23,799
a martial arts master
above the Ninth Dan.

116
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,120
He's only one step away
from the Great Master.

117
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,279
I almost forgot that

118
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,879
martial arts master above the Ninth Dan

119
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,639
can distinguish two people by breaths

120
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,879
through the wall.

121
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,600
Put down your arrow.

122
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,159
I'm not under threat.

123
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,200
This is Fan Xian, Chief Musician of
the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

124
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:47,919
When he leaves later,

125
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,559
let him pass.

126
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:51,759
Yes.

127
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:53,279
Moreover,

128
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,799
pass on my verbal instruction
to the Imperial Guards.

129
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,480
When I leave for the capital city,

130
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,080
send a battalion

131
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,360
to guard this place.

132
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,240
From now on,

133
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,080
no one shall

134
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,200
get near this residence.

135
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,480
Yes.

136
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,360
You're lucky that you're still alive.

137
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,159
You should know that martial
arts master above the Ninth Dan

138
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,399
can hear another man's breath

139
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,759
through the wall.

140
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,440
They can figure out my position

141
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,639
by my voice,

142
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,320
and then they'll shoot you.

143
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,279
Distinguishing location
by breaths through the wall,

144
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,200
it doesn't make sense.

145
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:40,080
They're beyond common sense.

146
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,360
Aren't you thirsty?

147
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,679
Your Majesty,

148
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,960
meeting you is like having a
good rain after a long drought.

149
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:48,879
I'm no longer thirsty.

150
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:51,720
You've also heard that

151
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,960
this residence will be heavily guarded

152
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,240
in future.

153
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,960
Don't break into other's residence

154
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,799
ever again.

155
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,519
Yes.

156
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,240
Are you free tomorrow?

157
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,480
Probably.

158
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,320
Come to the imperial palace.

159
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,759
Wan'er has grown up
in the imperial palace.

160
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,480
The Empress Dowager
and my consorts all like her.

161
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,080
You should meet them.

162
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,080
I see.

163
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,679
Fine. You can leave.

164
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:55,720
Director Yan?

165
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,639
I heard that you killed Cheng Jushu.

166
00:14:57,879 --> 00:14:58,600
That's right.

167
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,000
How could you kill an Eighth Dan
martial arts master?

168
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:01,720
I'm just lucky.

169
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,440
Who's that archer outside the yard?

170
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,519
What archer? I've no idea.

171
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,399
You'd better answer
my question honestly.

172
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,240
His Majesty just told you

173
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,559
to let me pass.

174
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,879
Director Yan, are you going to
defy the imperial order?

175
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,120
I'll remember you.

176
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,960
See you.

177
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:53,799
Brother!

178
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,559
What happened?

179
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,919
The archer is so good!

180
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,720
He broke off the tree with arrows.

181
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:03,720
Where's Uncle Wuzhu?

182
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,320
He's gone.

183
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,480
Never mind. That's his style.

184
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:11,840
Have you found the key?

185
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:12,759
No.

186
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,360
I met His Majesty instead.

187
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,000
His Majesty?

188
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,600
His Majesty is inside?

189
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,240
He seems to know my mom well.

190
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,279
Have you asked him about her?

191
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,399
He wouldn't tell me.

192
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,120
Let's go. Wan'er should be worried.

193
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,879
The Crown Prince was taken?!

194
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,639
It's fine. My father planned it.

195
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,679
Your father wants
to take the Crown Prince?!

196
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:42,840
They've taken the wrong person.

197
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,360
Actually, you're the one
he wants to test.

198
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,120
He wants to know

199
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,720
whether you have a Great Master

200
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,919
by your side or not.

201
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,519
He's still suspicious of me.

202
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,440
My third cousin said

203
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,480
you are not the murderer.

204
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:03,080
You actually hid that

205
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,039
from my brother the whole way!

206
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,079
I'll apologize to you later.

207
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,680
You'd better take Dabao back

208
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,359
at once.

209
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,400
My third cousin said that

210
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,519
by telling my father
the following words,

211
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,559
he'll know the murderer

212
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:17,440
naturally.

213
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,599
What did the Crown Prince say?

214
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,720
No!

215
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,119
My eyes! My eyes!

216
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,039
What's wrong with your eyes?

217
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,279
I fooled you.

218
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,480
Little one! Little one!

219
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,240
Fan Xian.

220
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,119
Why do you follow me?

221
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:37,640
I trust you.

222
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,599
I believe Wan'er trusts you, too.

223
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,279
As to what happened today,
she must have her difficulties.

224
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,839
Don't hate her

225
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,079
for that.

226
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,480
Does my love for Wan'er

227
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,720
seem so frangible?

228
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,680
Don't worry. I know that.

229
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:01,799
Little one! Little one!

230
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,039
-Little one! -Dabao!

231
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:03,880
Little one!

232
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:04,680
Dabao!

233
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,319
Xianxian, get down and play with us.

234
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,960
Dabao, let me take you home.

235
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:09,960
Get down and play with us.

236
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,680
It's about time.

237
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,559
Let me take you home.

238
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,799
We can come out for dinner another day.

239
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:19,880
Sister,

240
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,759
will you also escort me home?

241
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:24,240
That's OK.

242
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,960
I can escort you home with Fan Xian.

243
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,799
Good! Good!

244
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,200
Then let's go home! Let's go!

245
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:48,920
Ruoruo,

246
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,599
do me a favor.

247
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:51,880
What do I need to do?

248
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,720
The guys we sent to test Fan Xian

249
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,400
are back.

250
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,279
Prime Minister,
you don't have to show up.

251
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:22,720
Let me meet him instead.

252
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:27,000
Thank you, Master.
Please figure out the truth.

253
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,319
Master.

254
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:50,240
How's it going?

255
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:51,880
We captured Fan Xian

256
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,519
and detained him in the capital city.

257
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,519
Master, please go and see him.

258
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,920
I asked you to find out

259
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,839
whether he has a martial arts master
by his side or not.

260
00:19:57,319 --> 00:19:58,920
Why did you take him
into the capital city?

261
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,599
We didn't see the martial arts master,

262
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:01,559
but he figured out that

263
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,720
we take orders from the Prime Minister.

264
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,200
He requested to
see the Prime Minister all the way.

265
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,240
Did you admit your identity?

266
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:05,920
No! No!

267
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,640
Of course I didn't.

268
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,759
We just detained him

269
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,480
to wait for your order.

270
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:09,839
Isn't that the same
as admitting your identity?

271
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,400
I can't meet him in person.

272
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,880
Release Fan Xian immediately.

273
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,359
After all, he's an official.

274
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,519
If it turns into a big mess,

275
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,839
we won't be able to justify ourselves.

276
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,400
Good! Good! Good!

277
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,920
Master Yuan, good day.

278
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,640
Dabao, good day.

279
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,839
-Let's go. -Good day, Master Yuan.

280
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,000
Let's go.

281
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,319
This is the study.

282
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:28,880
Master,

283
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,039
should I release Fan Xian

284
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:30,759
now?

285
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:31,920
Release whom?

286
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:32,799
Fan Xian of course.

287
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,519
Then who's that?

288
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,680
I've never met him. Who's that?

289
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:42,160
Who on earth did you capture?

290
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,519
Dad, Xianxian and Wan'er

291
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,440
were both there.

292
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,519
Then they just

293
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,480
sat there and talked.

294
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,119
Later,

295
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,880
a little one came.

296
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:50,839
The little one and I,

297
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:51,759
we caught fish

298
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,279
by the pond.

299
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,680
Then we played stone skimming.

300
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,519
Right! We even had a competition.

301
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,519
Dad, I won!

302
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,960
Later,

303
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,920
we also poked worm holes.

304
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:01,599
Then...

305
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:02,960
I washed my hands, Dad.

306
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,799
-Look! -Good! Good! Good!

307
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,200
-I washed them clean. -Good! Good! Good!

308
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,640
Come on. Drink some water first.

309
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,440
Thank you, Dad.

310
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,119
Dad,

311
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,079
there are a lot of people in white

312
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,079
in the front yard.

313
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,599
Many of them are crying.

314
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,480
They're having a funeral.

315
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,759
A funeral?

316
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:27,920
I've never seen one.

317
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,759
Then go and see it yourself.

318
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:34,079
In the main hall of the front yard lies

319
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:35,039
a big wooden box.

320
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,480
Go and kowtow to it.

321
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,240
No.

322
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,920
It's the rule. Everyone should do it.

323
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:45,799
Xianxian,

324
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,039
will you go with me?

325
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:53,559
Then you can talk with my dad here.

326
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,160
I'll come back to you in a while.

327
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:01,920
Take a seat.

328
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:07,640
Why do you send Dabao back

329
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,400
so early?

330
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,680
Wan'er told me everything.

331
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:20,960
Really?

332
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,640
I understand.

333
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,240
You have to figure out
who murdered your son.

334
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,319
Drink some tea.

335
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,200
The Crown Prince came to see me.

336
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,119
He asked me to tell you
the following words.

337
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,160
He said that after hearing the words,

338
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,880
you'll know the murderer naturally.

339
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,559
What did he say?

340
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,319
The murderer is a Great Master.

341
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:04,440
If the murderer is close
to the level of Great Master,

342
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,920
then he could be anyone
above the Ninth Dan.

343
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,079
But now, the murderer

344
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,480
is limited to the Four Great Masters.

345
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,319
Can't there be a fifth one?

346
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,200
Impossible!

347
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,039
I've had it investigated that

348
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,559
when it happened,

349
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,799
Ye Liuyun, Ku He and Si Gujian

350
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,839
were not around the capital city.

351
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,839
I guessed right.

352
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,039
The Great Master inside the
imperial palace is the murderer.

353
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,319
Under whose order?

354
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,480
His Majesty, Her Majesty,
the Empress Dowager,

355
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,160
the Princess Royal, the Second Prince,
or the Crown Prince.

356
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,400
It could be anyone.

357
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,559
Since the Crown Prince
gave us the information,

358
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,000
it might not be him.

359
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,680
Isn't the Princess Royal

360
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,640
the birth mother of Wan'er?

361
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,200
That woman

362
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,400
is crazy.

363
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,400
Since the imperial palace is involved,

364
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,160
why did the Crown Prince tell us?

365
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:21,920
Prime Minister.

366
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,000
To figure it out,

367
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,599
we might as well ask him about it.

368
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,680
Our men

369
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,799
captured him accidentally.

370
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I heard that from Wan'er.

371
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,759
Haven't you released him yet?

372
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,680
He requested to see me.

373
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,440
And you also.

374
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:57,480
See me?

375
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,960
Master Yuan,

376
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,039
which sin have we committed

377
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,039
by abducting the Crown Prince?

378
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,240
Guard outside.

379
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,359
You won't be blamed.

380
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,759
Your Highness, I...

381
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,000
No need to adhere to the formalities
rigidly. And no need to explain.

382
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:20,880
I've known it all.

383
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:24,440
Prime Minister,

384
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,920
have you received my elegiac couplet

385
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:27,400
for the Second Young Master?

386
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,799
How can you be so sure that

387
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:33,640
the murderer is a Great Master?

388
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,960
The Investigator's Office produced

389
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,160
two files to record
the death cause of your son.

390
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,839
The one sent to the imperial palace

391
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,960
tells the real truth.

392
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,039
Why do you

393
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
tell me?

394
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,480
Isolated and helpless
as I am in the imperial court,

395
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,359
I want to form an alliance with you.

396
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:59,640
Your Highness, you're dignified and
respected all over the country

397
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,119
with numerous talents
under your command.

398
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:06,720
Why do you want me as an ally?

399
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,720
I know what I really have.

400
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,839
I have many followers,

401
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,000
but none of them holds an
important place in the Six Ministries.

402
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,279
His Majesty and the Empress Dowager

403
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:18,759
don't favor me.

404
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,799
Now Chengze instead

405
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,160
is gaining more respect and support.

406
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,200
Who knows when

407
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,039
I'll have to hand my position

408
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,039
as the Crown Prince over to him.

409
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,640
What can I do for you?

410
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,720
You are the head of the officials.

411
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,279
Only by joining hands together

412
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:40,680
can we stand a chance.

413
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,559
Why are you still hesitating?

414
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,039
Your son's death is definitely ordered

415
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,359
by someone in the imperial palace.

416
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,079
Only by joining hands with me

417
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,519
can you figure out the truth,

418
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,319
find the real murderer,

419
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,359
and avenge your son's death.

420
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,359
What if His Majesty is the one

421
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:07,559
who ordered his death?

422
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,319
I just said

423
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,119
you could avenge your son's death.

424
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,200
No word should be left
concerning our alliance.

425
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:31,279
Of course.

426
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,440
It's OK as long as we
reach consensus in heart.

427
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,599
Why do you

428
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,400
ask Fan Xian over specially?

429
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,759
Prime Minister, he's the one

430
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:45,960
we should fully support in future.

431
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,599
Your Highness, you mean...

432
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,000
As to our war against Beiqi,

433
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:52,759
we've already captured one prefecture.

434
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,519
The two sides called a truce in the
frontline the day before yesterday.

435
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,880
The Beiqi mission

436
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,640
are on their way to the capital city.

437
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,039
Why am I related?

438
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:00,400
This war is started

439
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,880
by your investigation on Si Lili.

440
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,160
That is to say,

441
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,720
you've owned the top prize.

442
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,079
We may have disputes,

443
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,000
but we've never born

444
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
a deep grudge against each other.

445
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,160
You're talented, and I cherish talents.

446
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,119
Why not join me?

447
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,799
The Neiku will be handed over
to you eventually,

448
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,640
and I can let you have it.

449
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:24,720
From today on,

450
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,599
the Prime Minister and I

451
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,279
will both be your support.

452
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,720
We'll promise you a brilliant future.

453
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,720
Think it over.

454
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,599
We are still young.

455
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:44,759
When I ascend the throne,

456
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,759
we might make a much-told story
of the emperor and his subject

457
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,759
fighting together
from the start to the end.

458
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,440
Be quiet outside!

459
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,240
They have no rules!

460
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,759
What on earth is happening outside?!

461
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,640
Your men are here to rescue you.

462
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,480
Impossible!

463
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,920
What happened?

464
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:33,240
Your Highness, please stay inside.

465
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,119
The guards outside
were slaughtered brutally.

466
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,240
They must be killed
by martial arts masters.

467
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,720
What do I need to do?

468
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,359
Go out and see what's going on.

469
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,160
Dangerous?

470
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,799
I'm the only one here
who can practice martial arts.

471
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,440
Or shall we let His Highness go out?

472
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:54,599
Xie Bi'an?

473
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,200
I heard that you are endowed
with civil and martial virtues.

474
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,960
Maybe we should compete
with other swords.

475
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,599
Don't blame him.

476
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:11,880
Xie Bi'an is born with a poker face.

477
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,839
He never said anything nice to me.

478
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:15,960
but unexpectedly,

479
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,759
Carry it for me.

480
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,119
Neither do I.

481
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,960
Don't listen to that one inside.

482
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,000
He's always a persuasive talker.

483
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,279
I didn't hear anything.

484
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,200
Let's go inside.

485
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:40,880
It's slippery. Slow down.

486
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,559
Sorry for coming late.

487
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,599
Your Highness, please forgive me!

488
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,359
Why are you here?

489
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,680
I was burning with anxiety

490
00:32:58,759 --> 00:32:59,839
after hearing that Your Highness
was abducted,

491
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
so I took Xie Bi'an with me
to rescue you.

492
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,839
But don't worry, Your Highness.

493
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,079
The bandits outside

494
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,559
were all killed by Xie Bi'an.

495
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,319
Prime Minister, are you also here
to rescue His Highness?

496
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,160
I just passed by.

497
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,359
Do you know the bandits outside?

498
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,400
I've never met them.

499
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,720
That's good.

500
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,079
I was worried that

501
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,240
reckless as Xie Bi'an is,

502
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,880
he might hurt our men.

503
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,319
Your Highness, you're so kind.

504
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,920
How admirable!

505
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,240
I'm so flattered.

506
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,000
Now that the Crown Prince is safe,

507
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,759
I'll leave first.

508
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,359
Your sword is nice.

509
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,319
How much is it?

510
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,079
Let's go.

511
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:05,599
OK.

512
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:08,280
Nice sword.

513
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,199
You're really watching me closely
all the time!

514
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,440
Your Highness, you're the Crown Prince

515
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,920
and my brother as well.

516
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,599
How can I not try my best

517
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,400
to protect your safety?

518
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,119
What a nice brother!

519
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm so touched!

520
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,320
It's my duty.

521
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,079
But Your Highness, do feel relieved.

522
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:38,760
I've been keeping an eye on

523
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:39,920
the capital city

524
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,119
on your behalf.

525
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:43,199
Any sign of disturbance

526
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,719
won't escape my eyes.

527
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,800
Then I'm relieved.

528
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,239
May I escort Your Highness

529
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:52,760
back to the Eastern Palace?

530
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:55,039
That's most welcome.

531
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,199
Why is the Second Prince coming so fast?

532
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,400
They are

533
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,039
really competing fiercely.

534
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,079
Uncle, will you really ally
with the Crown Prince?

535
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
I was just saying.

536
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
It's better not to offend
either of them.

537
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,280
Now the imperial court is in chaos.

538
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,039
We can take this chance

539
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,599
and get you a higher rank.

540
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,920
This time, I really mean it.

541
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,119
No more suspicions.

542
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,519
I also wonder

543
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,320
how much time I've left.

544
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,360
But Uncle,

545
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,079
you look healthy.

546
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,159
I won't die for the moment.

547
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,840
I mean how long can I

548
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,960
keep my position?

549
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,679
Actually, being an official
is like being a man.

550
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:57,119
It's like standing
on the top of a mountain.

551
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:00,000
The further you move forward,
the more cautious you should be.

552
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,920
Otherwise, you'll be doomed eternally.

553
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,400
Can I retreat on my own?

554
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,480
You can't once you go up.

555
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:14,840
Prime Minister.

556
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,480
Don't bury them.

557
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,000
We can't afford to take any risk.

558
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,480
Help their families settle down well.

559
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,559
Don't blame me for being merciless.

560
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,199
If I'm softhearted,
I might endanger myself.

561
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,760
Well, enough for today.

562
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,599
You've been through a lot today.

563
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,599
Go back early.

564
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,360
Uncle...

565
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,440
There it comes!

566
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,880
You're upset.

567
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,599
So many things happened today.

568
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:38,719
The powerful arrow of Yan Xiaoyi.

569
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:40,320
The brutality of Xie Bi'an.

570
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,400
Running into His Majesty
in the Taiping Residence.

571
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,519
Removing Lin Ruofu's suspicion

572
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,440
of me completely.

573
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,400
Moreover,

574
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,400
the Second Prince and the Crown Prince

575
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,239
That's tit for tat.

576
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,000
Which one upsets you?

577
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,960
The Crown Prince is trying
to draw me over to his side.

578
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,079
What's wrong?

579
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,840
We used to believe that

580
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,119
Lin Gong planned
the Niulan Street assassination

581
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,719
at the command of the Crown Prince.

582
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,400
But now

583
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,559
he actually said he had never

584
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:09,559
born a deep grudge against me.

585
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,440
Maybe he believes
you don't know the truth.

586
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:13,679
The news that Lin Gong
tried to assassinate me

587
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:14,880
has spread all over the capital city.

588
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,719
If the Crown Prince is really behind it,

589
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,360
he won't lay down his guard against me

590
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,159
so easily.

591
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,800
Maybe he doesn't mean it.

592
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,159
He asked to see me specially.

593
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,960
Judged from his look,

594
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,440
he really wants
to draw me over to his side.

595
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,639
So what?

596
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,639
So I've been wondering

597
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,960
what if

598
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,119
the Crown Prince

599
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:37,400
didn't give the order.

600
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,119
Then who would it be?

601
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,239
I also want to know.

602
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:49,440
If you can't figure it out now,

603
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,360
just think about it some other day.

604
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:58,119
Sometimes,

605
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,599
I do envy your character.

606
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,159
It doesn't suit you.

607
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,960
Indeed!

608
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:04,400
Have you found the key?

609
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:05,360
No.

610
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,719
Then it must be kept
in the imperial palace.

611
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,679
Most of your mom's things

612
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:11,679
are kept by that old lady.

613
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,199
Which old lady?

614
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:18,000
The Empress Dowager.

615
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:22,800
Once we confirm its location,

616
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,280
the rest is easy.

617
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,719
The only problem

618
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,760
is that Great Master Hong Sixiang
in the imperial palace.

619
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,039
Is he a guard beside His Majesty?

620
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:32,480
He guards right
beside the Empress Dowager.

621
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,639
Nothing is worse

622
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:38,760
than that.

623
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:00,760
The mosquito bites

624
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,079
are really itchy.

625
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,199
Exactly.

626
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,000
Look, there's no mosquito

627
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,440
around the Empress Dowager.

628
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,880
Eunuch Hong is there.

629
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,119
How dare the mosquitoes go there?

630
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,000
By then, we'll adopt our strategy today.

631
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,800
What strategy?

632
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
I will hold the Great Master,

633
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,639
and you shall sneak inside
to get the key.

634
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,039
Uncle...

635
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:24,119
Besides the Great Master,

636
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:25,559
Yan Xiaoyi, the Director
of Imperial Guards,

637
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,920
also guards the imperial palace

638
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:27,800
all the year round.

639
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:39,320
Just go and find the key.

640
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:41,679
You really trust me so much?

641
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,519
In this world, I can trust no one

642
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:44,960
but you.

643
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,239
Uncle...

644
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:57,480
have you ever felt lonely?

645
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,719
No.

646
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,880
Even after my mom

647
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:02,079
passed away?

648
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,079
No.

649
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,239
When you get old,

650
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,559
I'll be there for you.

651
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:14,960
I probably won't get old.

652
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,760
Then when I get old,

653
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,000
you should be there for me.

654
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,000
Only if you still feel like that

655
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:23,440
by then.

656
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:25,000
OK.

657
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,159
Speaking of my life,

658
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,320
you're the first man I saw

659
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,679
since I could remember.

660
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,199
Perhaps,

661
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,559
you'll also be the last man I see

662
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,039
It's also you.

663
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:40,360
Maybe you're still young

664
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,199
even by then.

665
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,880
Shouldn't we discuss about

666
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,719
finding the key in the imperial palace?

667
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,360
Right.

668
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:54,920
Go on.

669
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,000
The problem is

670
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,719
do you know
where the Empress Dowager lives.

671
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:06,800
I don't know you.

672
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:07,960
Well then.

673
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:09,519
You should find a chance
to go to the imperial palace

674
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,920
to figure out the route.

675
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,199
What a coincidence!

676
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,760
I'm going to
the imperial palace tomorrow.

677
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:16,519
How's it going?

678
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,599
Good. Remember to figure out the route.

679
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,199
Isn't there anything in the world

680
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,079
that can surprise you?

681
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:23,079
No.

682
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,079
Well, good for you.

683
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,840
No words can express

684
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,800
my admiration for you.

685
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,400
Uncle.

686
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:32,840
Do you find the climate especially dry

687
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,239
in the capital city?

688
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:35,639
Luckily, I'm ingenious.

689
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,159
I made a humidifier myself.

690
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,599
It has a mechanical structure
and is driven by hydraulic power.

691
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,199
Someone's here.

692
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:39,960
Who?

693
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,480
Why are you here?

694
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,039
Ruoruo left the door open for me.

695
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:06,920
What's this?

696
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:11,360
The climate in the capital city

697
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,079
is drier than that of Danzhou,

698
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:14,320
so I made a humidifier myself.

699
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:16,239
Humidifier?

700
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,079
Do you have anything for me?

701
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,400
The starry sky is so beautiful tonight.

702
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:30,760
Would you like to join me

703
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,519
in watching the stars?

704
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:48,360
As a child, I lived
in the imperial palace.

705
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,400
My father and mother couldn't visit me.

706
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:54,280
Every night,

707
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,280
I was alone

708
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,119
in a really big room.

709
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,239
From then on,

710
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,679
I was particularly fond
of watching the starry sky.

711
00:44:05,719 --> 00:44:06,960
Because I had nothing else to watch

712
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:09,599
except for the starry sky.

713
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:31,719
And my disease...

714
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:35,119
the tuberculosis

715
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,280
just couldn't be cured.

716
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,159
I think

717
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,199
I could die anytime.

718
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,280
In the day,

719
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,599
I talked to others with a smile.

720
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,960
But actually, I was so scared.

721
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,159
I'm here.

722
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,199
I won't let you die.

723
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,239
I dared not be close to others,

724
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:03,360
for fear that

725
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:07,480
if I died of disease suddenly,

726
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,519
they might be heartbroken.

727
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,519
But the fact is

728
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:16,400
nobody wanted to be close to me.

729
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,880
After all, I'm just a bastard.

730
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,000
So am I.

731
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:24,760
You're different.

732
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,840
You've experienced a lot,

733
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:30,519
but I was locked up
in the imperial palace.

734
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:33,719
I once heard that

735
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:35,760
It's not easy

736
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,679
walking on a road.

737
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:41,119
You keep meeting different people

738
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,679
and parting with them.

739
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,199
I'm so envious of that.

740
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,039
I've walked the way

741
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,119
all by myself.

742
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:54,960
Never have I met

743
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,239
anyone else.

744
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,960
I could only walk by myself

745
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,760
step by step.

746
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,119
I thought

747
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,480
I would walk alone to death.

748
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,239
But unexpectedly,

749
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,679
Your appearance

750
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,360
Fan Xian, it feels so good

751
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:29,280
So wonderful!

752
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,960
I will always be here for you.

753
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,119
But I'm so scared.

754
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,920
I'm scared that one day you'll leave,

755
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,239
and then I'll be all alone again.

756
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:47,719
You won't be alone any more.

757
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:57,119
I'm sorry!

758
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,599
I lied to you about the outing today.

759
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,199
I didn't tell you that

760
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:06,199
my father wanted to test you.

761
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,199
I don't know how can I
express my regrets

762
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:12,960
or how can I make it up to you.

763
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:14,039
So,

764
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,559
I could only sneak out

765
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:18,400
and watch the starry night

766
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:21,719
with you.

767
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,840
Look!

768
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,960
Isn't the starry sky

769
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:29,239
especially beautiful tonight?

770
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:36,760
Yes, indeed!

771
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:42,760
In my heart,

772
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:45,280
it's the most beautiful

773
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,199
and precious thing.

774
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:49,639
Besides this,

775
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,719
I don't know what else I can give you.

776
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,920
You've given me the entire starry sky.

777
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:09,400
I want nothing

778
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,880
but this.

779
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,039
I won't lie to you anymore.

780
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:22,800
Me neither.

781
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:25,760
From today on,

782
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,320
no more lies.

783
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,679
Look!

784
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,440
It's not as beautiful as you.

785
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:53,800
We are among the boundless crowd

786
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
as stars among the night sky.

787
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:01,920
Don't let her

788
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,559
I've been thinking about the story of

789
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,559
one hundred branches
of cherry blossoms you told me.

790
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,159
I feel sorry

791
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:10,159
for their love.

792
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:12,760
Now

793
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:15,440
I finally understand

794
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,559
why you told me

795
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,440
the story.

796
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,320
Because among the boundless crowd,

797
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,480
we are

798
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:23,559
so lucky

799
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:24,639
to meet each other.

800
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,639
You don't want us to miss each other.

801
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,159
Now we are

802
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,760
miss each other for sure.

803
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:07,719
We've received an imperial decree to
summon you into the imperial palace.

804
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,480
Summon who?

805
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,960
This time,

806
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,320
you'll mainly visit the imperial harem.

807
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,559
That's you.

808
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,760
Go with him this time.

809
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:23,599
Fine.

810
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,039
Can Ruoruo come with us?

811
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:28,760
Your sister has never

812
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,079
liked such occasions.

813
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:32,320
I'd love to.

814
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:39,039
That'll be enough.

815
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,719
Me, too.

816
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:49,920
No, I won't go.

817
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:51,440
I don't like such occasions.

818
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:57,679
When we go inside the imperial palace,

819
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,199
help me remember

820
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:59,199
the routes between different palaces.

821
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,280
Pay attention to the details.

822
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,280
OK.

823
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,960
I might have to break
into the imperial palace.

824
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:05,000
Then I'll try my best
to remember the details.

825
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:07,159
Aren't you scared?

826
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:09,280
Brother, whatever you want to do,
I'll help you.

827
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:18,920
Why are you following us?

828
00:52:21,559 --> 00:52:22,440
When you're in the imperial palace,

829
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,599
will you request a consort
to write something for me?

830
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,519
Write what?

831
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,840
Danbo Bookstore

832
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,960
is about to open.

833
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:29,920
With the name written
by the imperial family,

834
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:32,440
we'll be the Imperial Danbo Bookstore.

835
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:33,559
By then,

836
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:35,159
there must be a lot of customers.

837
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:36,719
The word Imperial doesn't go with Danbo.
(Danbo means indifferent to fame and fortune in Chinese.)

838
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,920
Then we can change the name.

839
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:38,920
We open the bookstore

840
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,199
to make money.

841
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:41,519
In my opinion,

842
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:42,840
we should call it Dali Bookstore.
(Dali means big profits in Chinese.)

843
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:45,599
Go to

844
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,239
No!

845
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,199
Do remember that.

846
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:54,559
Don't forget.

847
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,159
Brother!

848
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,000
Haven't seen you for a long time.

849
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,519
Madam, you're gorgeous.

850
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,519
Eunuch, I'm so flattered.

851
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:13,760
I wonder

852
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,400
who want to see Xian'er today?

853
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,239
Those who watched the princess grow up

854
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:19,880
all want to see Mr. Fan.

855
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,800
The Empress Dowager

856
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:23,239
also wants to see him.

857
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,760
But she'll see him after lunch.

858
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:27,840
Who should we visit first?

859
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,400
Madam, since you're here,

860
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:32,280
you certainly should
visit Consort Yi first.

861
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,920
What about the empress?

862
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:35,800
Her Majesty doesn't feel well today.

863
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,159
We'd better not disturb her.

864
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,639
This way, please.

865
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,000
I know you've been
to the Imperial Study,

866
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,920
but this is the real imperial harem.

867
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,400
Don't look around.

868
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,440
You might be accused of

869
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,360
being disrespectful and discourteous.

870
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,000
Madam, you know Consort Yi?

871
00:53:57,639 --> 00:53:59,119
She's my cousin.

872
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,760
The imperial family
has been gracious to my family.

873
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,719
Then why do you marry my dad?

874
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:04,519
For what?

875
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:05,800
Whatever makes me happy!

876
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:07,800
I see. For love.

877
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:10,400
Don't be too arrogant
when you see Her Highness later.

878
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,199
I see. I should save your face.

879
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,800
Consort Yi is the birth mother
of the Third Prince.

880
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:16,800
Don't be disrespectful.

881
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:18,719
Isn't the Crown Prince the third eldest
among the princes?

882
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:19,960
According to the tradition
of our dynasty,

883
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,559
the Crown Prince won't be included

884
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:22,840
when ranking other princes.

885
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,800
Though Consort Yi's son is still a kid,

886
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,079
he's the Third Prince.

887
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,320
That means

888
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,760
the Crown Prince doesn't deserve to

889
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:34,599
have any family or brother.

890
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:36,119
How dare you say that?

891
00:54:38,199 --> 00:54:39,159
Madam, how long has it been

892
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:40,119
since you last saw Consort Yi?

893
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,119
It's been four years.

894
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:42,800
It's so long!

895
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:44,760
After she married
into the imperial family,

896
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,320
we seldom see each other.

897
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,119
Is Consort Yi cold by nature?

898
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,719
Big and profound as the Liu family,

899
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,039
if we visit Consort Yi frequently,

900
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:54,239
we might be suspected of collusion.

901
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:56,039
In this sense,

902
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,840
the palace walls actually
become her cage.

903
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,119
Indeed.

904
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:15,239
How hard-hearted are you

905
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,199
to leave me here

906
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:17,280
to rot by myself.

907
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,079
I actually have no one to talk to.

908
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,159
After all, the Liu family
is related to Your Highness by blood.

909
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,719
We should avoid suspicion.

910
00:55:23,079 --> 00:55:24,599
You belong to the Fan family now.

911
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:25,960
Why worry about this?

912
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,679
Aren't I here today?

913
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,920
Weren't it for Fan Xian's marriage

914
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,159
with Wan'er,

915
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,960
I wonder when could we

916
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:35,480
actually meet.

917
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,400
You must be Fan Xian.

918
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,440
Nephew Fan Xian
pays respects to Auntie Liu.

919
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:49,679
Mr. Fan, you should call Your Highness.

920
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,000
You must be respectful.

921
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,880
He's really a good lad.

922
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,679
Fan Xian and others

923
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,159
have arrived in Consort Yi's palace.

924
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,400
Is Liu Ruyu with him?

925
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:05,239
Yes.

926
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:09,199
Haven't seen her for years,

927
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,760
Consort Yi must be happy.

928
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,119
I heard that Fan Xian
called Her Highness

929
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:15,599
Auntie Liu directly
regardless of formalities.

930
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,920
Consort Yi smiled happily.

931
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,119
It's not detected

932
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,760
till now.

933
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,039
After seeing so many formalities,

934
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:25,960
one would long
for family affection instead.

935
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,199
Fan Xian is really smart

936
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:29,960
by calling her that.

937
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,280
Who will he visit next?

938
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,559
I've asked.

939
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:36,679
He will visit Imperial Consort Shu

940
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,639
and Lady Ning successively.

941
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:38,920
After the lunch,

942
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,519
the Empress Dowager will see him.

943
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,400
Send someone to follow him.

944
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,280
Tell me what he says.

945
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:48,920
Imperial Consort Shu and Lady Ning

946
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,840
are still waiting.

947
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:50,920
After the lunch,

948
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:53,440
the Empress Dowager also
wants to see Mr. Fan.

949
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,320
Auntie Liu,

950
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,440
perhaps I should go over first.

951
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:00,800
We are relatives.

952
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,920
I'll visit you often in future.

953
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,440
Go ahead.

954
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:05,719
You should stay

955
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,760
and talk with me.

956
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:08,440
Well...

957
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:10,400
Fan Xian is the one they want to see.

958
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:11,280
Never mind!

959
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,599
Madam, stay with Auntie Liu.

960
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:14,599
I'll be fine.

961
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:16,440
Ruoruo, stay here, too.

962
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,480
Drink some tea and eat some snacks.

963
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:21,280
I'll go with my brother.

964
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:23,760
Just be careful.

965
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,320
When you visit other consorts,

966
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,199
don't be so frivolous.

967
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:28,920
He's not frivolous.

968
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:31,679
I find him sincere instead.

969
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,719
You're fooled by him.

970
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:38,480
Imperial Consort Shu is
the birth mother of the Second Prince.

971
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,519
The Second Prince is funny.

972
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,360
I wonder what his mother would be like.

973
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,480
Among all the consorts,

974
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,119
Imperial Consort Shu
is the most rigorous,

975
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,599
but I worry about her the least.

976
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:48,239
Rest assured.

977
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,519
She won't be a problem for you.

978
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:51,199
Why?

979
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:53,159
Because you're talented.

980
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,199
My Lady, where's Mr. Fan?

981
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:02,360
He's over there.

982
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,280
Now I understand why

983
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,199
she's called Imperial Consort Shu.
('Shu' is a homophone for 'book' in Chinese)

984
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:07,880
What?

985
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:09,039
Nothing.

986
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:10,719
Mr. Fan,

987
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,760
take a seat, please.

988
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,840
Imperial Consort Shu will be here soon.

989
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,199
Your Highness!

990
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:24,760
Fan Xian is here.

991
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,400
Take a seat.

992
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,679
Put this book on the second layer of

993
00:58:48,679 --> 00:58:51,159
the second bookshelf on the left.

994
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:02,079
Your poem is good.

995
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,079
A thousand miles from home,
I'm grieved at autumn's plight;

996
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,960
Your Highness, I'm so flattered.

997
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,159
Have you opened a bookstore?

998
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:10,880
Yes.

999
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:12,199
Do you have any unique copies?

1000
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,079
We only have novels.

1001
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:15,079
No ancient books actually.

1002
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,199
I heard that you wrote the Red Mansions.

1003
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:20,199
Actually it was written

1004
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,440
by Mr. Cao.

1005
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,119
I read it by chance,

1006
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:23,960
and copied it.

1007
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:25,199
Who is he?

1008
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:28,400
I've been collecting essays
of ancient times.

1009
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,480
How come I never heard of him?

1010
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:34,920
Anyway, the book is really good.

1011
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,519
Your Highness, I'm so flattered.

1012
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,519
What have you been reading recently?

1013
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:45,079
You publish the book. I will
take care of the network of shops.

1014
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:45,880
And then we split the profit 40/60.

1015
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:47,559
You get 60 and I get 40.
What do you think?

1016
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:48,960
The account books.

1017
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:50,559
Business.

1018
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:54,639
It's vulgar after all.

1019
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,440
Your Highness, you're absolutely right.

1020
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,320
Wan'er grew up in the imperial palace.

1021
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,320
We all treat her as our daughter.

1022
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,400
So I have to see you.

1023
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:08,199
Chengze also speaks highly of you.

1024
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,239
Who's Chengze?

1025
01:00:15,159 --> 01:00:16,320
Oh, it's the Second Prince.

1026
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,599
My son is arrogant.

1027
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
He seldom

1028
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,039
praises others.

1029
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,920
His Highness and I kind of hit it off

1030
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,760
are like old friends from the start.

1031
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,880
You're probably fooled by him.

1032
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
He's shrewd and deep.

1033
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:34,280
He never hits it off
with others at first meeting.

1034
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,079
I will say no more about him.

1035
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:43,760
You'll see

1036
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:46,320
after knowing him for a long time.

1037
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:49,440
There's one thing

1038
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,480
you probably don't know.

1039
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:52,639
I...

1040
01:00:54,519 --> 01:00:55,599
love reading.

1041
01:00:59,159 --> 01:00:59,840
I know! I know!

1042
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:01,480
I already know that.

1043
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,239
You're a younger member of the family.

1044
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:04,719
I should give you presents

1045
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,920
for your visit.

1046
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:09,119
I'm never fond of vulgar things.

1047
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,079
So I'll give you some ancient books
and unique copies.

1048
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,760
But I don't know what you like.

1049
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,599
Actually, I...

1050
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:15,719
Yet, even if you tell me what you want,

1051
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,800
I might be unwilling
to give them to you.

1052
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:20,199
Just let me pick some books

1053
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,519
for you.

1054
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:26,639
That's fine.

1055
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,079
It won't be convenient for you
to hold the books.

1056
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,239
I'll have them sent
to Consort Yi's palace.

1057
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:33,960
Take them when you leave. OK?

1058
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,440
Your Highness, you're so considerate.

1059
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:53,320
