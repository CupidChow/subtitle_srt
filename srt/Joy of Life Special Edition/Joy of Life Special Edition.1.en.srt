=Episode 1=

16
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,400
Fan Shen contracted some kind
of strange illness.

17
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,599
Myasthenia gravis.

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,120
In the still of the night,

19
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,960
he faced the end alone.

20
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,919
The most turbulent in his heart

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,400
were the fear of death

22
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,680
and the longing for life.

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,080
When he opened his eyes again,

24
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,960
A new world

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,800
gives him

26
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,000
a second chance.

27
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,599
The story starts from here.

28
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:02,560
There's a young man in the modern times
who suffers from myasthenia gravis.

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,360
When he wakes up,

30
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,360
he finds that he becomes a baby in a bamboo basket

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,360
but he still keeps all memories

32
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,960
about the modern society.

33
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,000
Now he is surrounded and
attacked by killers in ancient costumes.

34
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,879
When he is still in doubt,

35
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,080
a fresh new world is welcoming him.

36
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:49,879
Where is Your Lady?

37
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,159
It's too late

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,840
when I rushed back.

39
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,159
Is it her kid?

40
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:06,080
Yes.

41
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,000
Is he still alive?

42
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,840
Yes, he is.

43
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,719
Let me take a look.

44
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,600
Where do you want to take him?

45
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,160
A safe place.

46
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,120
Now that I am back,

47
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,759
the capital city is the safest place for him.

48
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,680
When My Lady was killed,

49
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,360
why did you and your black knights

50
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,199
not stay in the capital city?

51
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,920
I did it as what I was told.

52
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,680
You mean there is a hidden force

53
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,000
behind the killing?

54
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,000
Everyone in the city,

55
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:17,839
I

56
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,040
never trust them.

57
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:22,199
So, you just take him away like this?

58
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,439
What can you teach him?

59
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,519
Stop!

60
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,839
There is a place suitable for him.

61
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,279
Where is it?

62
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:35,439
Danzhou.

63
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,720
You know that place.

64
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,480
The Madam lives there.

65
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,839
I know what's in your mind.

66
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,600
You don't know?

67
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,759
Stop it!

68
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,680
Stop it!

69
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,959
My Lady.

70
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,360
You're back finally!

71
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,720
Both of them are servant girls in my yard.

72
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,120
Did you beat them?

73
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,600
Young Master,

74
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,560
you like running around,

75
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,759
it's fine.

76
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,759
But you shouldn't

77
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,879
take My Lady with you.

78
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,000
If anything bad happens,

79
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,079
you will

80
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,319
never afford to bear the responsibility.

81
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:10,519
Do you think so?

82
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,600
I ask whether you beat them or not.

83
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:16,879
They don't know

84
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,839
where you have gone.

85
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,480
They really don't know that.

86
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,839
So they should be punished.

87
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,680
Am I right?

88
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,680
Well, they are my maids,

89
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,000
should they be under my charge?

90
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,199
Madam asks me to be the butler,

91
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,399
then I think

92
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,680
I still have the right

93
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,199
to teach them.

94
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:43,920
You don't know?

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,720
- You don't know. - Stop it.

96
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,199
Stop it!

97
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:56,600
Stop it!

98
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,240
You... What are you...

99
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:03,600
Come over here.

100
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,240
Closer.

101
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,480
Put your head straight.

102
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,559
Do you have any problems with that?

103
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,080
Serve the meal.

104
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,279
Serve the meal.

105
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,080
Who did it?

106
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:00,559
Madam.

107
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,759
It's the Young Master.

108
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:05,840
You beat him?

109
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,080
I did it.

110
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,320
Butler Zhou beat the servant girls

111
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,279
in brother's yard first!

112
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:12,879
Alright.

113
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,159
Butler Zhou.

114
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:26,519
Madam.

115
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,440
Change those servant girls

116
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,279
in his yard.

117
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,639
Yes.

118
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,120
I am going to find some sensible girls

119
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,440
for Young Master now.

120
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,600
No need, grandma.

121
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:38,559
I like it quiet in my yard.

122
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,519
From today on,

123
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,799
I don't need any servants any more.

124
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,879
Then remove all of them.

125
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,320
Okay, I'll do it right now.

126
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,919
The carriage is at the gate.

127
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,720
After the meal,

128
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,919
Ruoruo will set out and go back to the capital city.

129
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,600
How about my brother?

130
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,960
He will stay in Danzhou.

131
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,960
Go ahead.

132
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,960
Young Master Fan Xian,

133
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,440
please don't be too sad.

134
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,039
Lady Ruoruo is born from a noble family,

135
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,440
she will go back to the capital city sooner or later.

136
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,799
Your name is not even in the family pedigree.
You are nobody in the family.

137
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,519
Lady Ruoruo is very different from you.

138
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,600
Well.

139
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,399
I have removed all the servant girls

140
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:06,559
in your yard.

141
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,639
In such a big yard,

142
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,639
when you are alone at night,

143
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,200
you should be careful

144
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,480
in case you see a ghost.

145
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,200
Did you lose your fore tooth?

146
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,279
Back tooth.

147
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
Then why do they leak air when you are speaking?

148
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,639
Leak air?

149
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,320
Just like

150
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,600
farting.

151
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,799
Are you Fan Xian?

152
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,240
There you are!

153
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,320
Who am I?

154
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
You are my dad!

155
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,039
I

156
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,039
I am not your dad.

157
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,240
You are my dad for sure!

158
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,000
She prepared it for you.

159
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,159
What is it?

160
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:43,720
Bamboo leaf tea.

161
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,559
Who prepared it for me?

162
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,200
My mom.

163
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,399
Bullshit!

164
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:05,960
Your mom died on the day when you were born.

165
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,679
She did not.

166
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,799
The where is she?

167
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,679
She is over there.

168
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:32,200
Dead.

169
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,159
The shop is closed.

170
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,080
You should come tomorrow
if you want to buy something.

171
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,039
Somebody wants to kill me.

172
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,919
You should take care of me, shouldn't you?

173
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,679
Do you want me to report to the government?

174
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,759
Uncle Wuzhu.

175
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,960
Uncle Wuzhu. Open the door.

176
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,039
I killed a man.

177
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,320
He is not dead.

178
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,159
He is going to wake up.

179
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:22,960
His name is Fei Jie.

180
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,720
He is the Director of the Third Division

181
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,159
of the Investigator's Office in the capital city.

182
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:27,720
He is one of us.

183
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,080
Well, when I was knocking him,

184
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,120
why didn't you tell me?

185
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,000
You didn't ask me.

186
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,639
Well, what to do now?

187
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,639
I have knocked him for three times.

188
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,240
Will he remember it and bear the grudges?

189
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:40,519
He is one of us?

190
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,919
Why does he have such a wretched appearance?

191
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,279
You wake up?

192
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,480
What happened to me just now?

193
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,639
You fell asleep while sitting up.

194
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,559
Actually you were knocked out by someone.

195
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,000
Is that you?

196
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,639
No, it's not.

197
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,320
Then, who did it if it was not you?!

198
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,279
He knocked you out.

199
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,440
Wuzhu.

200
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,679
Wuzhu.

201
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,559
It's been a long time since we
parted in the capital city last time.

202
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,320
You look the same as ever.

203
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,679
I have been always missing you.

204
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,200
Why are you here?

205
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,840
His Excellency Fan and the Head

206
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,080
asked me to be Fan Xian's master.

207
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,960
My father asked you to be here?

208
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,679
His Excellency Fan has no time to come here.

209
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,080
But he is always missing you.

210
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,039
It's my fault and

211
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,240
I shouldn't sneak around.

212
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,480
No wonder you knocked me out.

213
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,600
It's not me.

214
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,360
He knocked you out.

215
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,080
Not one.

216
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:29,879
But three times.

217
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:36,600
Madam.

218
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,720
This is a letter

219
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,240
from His Excellency Fan.

220
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,919
What happened to your head?

221
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,080
What happened to

222
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,440
your head?

223
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:58,639
Has the criminal been arrested?

224
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,919
Sorry to annoy you.

225
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,440
He has been arrested.

226
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's good.

227
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,160
You told me that

228
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,119
my son asked you to be here

229
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,039
from far away to

230
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,920
teach Fan Xian?

231
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,039
That's right.

232
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,400
What will you

233
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,400
teach him?

234
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,759
Actually I know something

235
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,759
about civil and military skills.

236
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,079
Could you please tell me

237
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:32,160
what I could teach him?

238
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,319
You may do what you think is suitable.

239
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,640
What he could learn

240
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,119
depends on himself.

241
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:50,599
Where is the kitchen?

242
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,160
It's not the meal time.

243
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,079
Well, I... I am hungry.

244
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,599
Tell me where the kitchen is.

245
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,400
I want something to eat.

246
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,799
There is no food.

247
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:00,640
You just tell me

248
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,680
where the kitchen is.

249
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:03,839
It's over there.

250
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:05,599
Mr. Fei.

251
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,119
May I talk to you for a minute?

252
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:08,839
Okay.

253
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:18,160
Mr. Fei.

254
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,880
What will you teach him?

255
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,799
Please give me some advices.

256
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,440
You must have heard

257
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:29,960
what the Madam has said

258
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:30,680
Yes.

259
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,480
What you should teach and shouldn't,

260
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,559
you must figure it out in your mind.

261
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,640
How about teaching him to read

262
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,839
but nothing else?

263
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,000
That's too mean.

264
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,720
Then I can teach him to practice medicine.

265
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,039
Practice medicine?

266
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,720
If he is driven out of the family,

267
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,799
he could be a doctor to

268
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,440
raise money and feed himself.

269
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,599
It's up to you.

270
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,279
Your father has married another woman

271
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:01,759
in the capital city.

272
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,559
And they have a son now.

273
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,240
What are you doing?

274
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,039
I know it.

275
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,880
He even doesn't salute when seeing me.

276
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,759
You thought I can't see it,

277
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,480
and then you can fool me?

278
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,279
I'm telling you. No way.

279
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,960
How about

280
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,200
killing him?

281
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,000
I will make it natural.

282
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,599
That guy is hateful,

283
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:27,880
but we can't go so far as to kill him.

284
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:29,799
Right.

285
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,079
Let me know if you change your mind.

286
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,519
I'm telling you.

287
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,359
After having the porridge,

288
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,920
I will go back to the bedroom
and have a good rest.

289
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,079
You really knocked hard on my head.

290
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,599
When I wake up,

291
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,079
I will teach you.

292
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,759
What will you teach me?

293
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:52,039
Medicine.

294
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,079
Medicine.

295
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,119
Just pick one.

296
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:08,880
Dig it out.

297
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:16,839
Alright.

298
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:18,240
Open it.

299
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,039
Alright.

300
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,359
Why don't you ask me the reason?

301
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:24,720
For what?

302
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:27,319
Why do I ask you to open the coffin?

303
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,000
I should know human's body first.

304
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,480
And then get a dead body to dissect.

305
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,759
This is the first step for my study.

306
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:33,000
That's normal.

307
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:36,240
Open it.

308
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
It's still fresh.

309
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:46,839
Cut it open.

310
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Check out the cause of death.

311
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,319
Cut it.

312
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,079
Are you afraid?

313
00:20:57,759 --> 00:20:58,559
There are too many bacteria here.

314
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,400
I should get protected.

315
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,680
What is bacteria?

316
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,200
I mean it's dirty.

317
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,720
I'd better put on a pair of gloves at least.

318
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,880
When you cut a body open,

319
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,759
you should use your hands to get every detail.

320
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,559
It's not convenient to dissect a body

321
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,720
when you wear a pair of gloves.

322
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,640
It's not what you wear in winter.

323
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,079
The gloves for operation are very thin.

324
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:24,680
They are close fitting, do you know that?

325
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,759
About the gloves you just mentioned,

326
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:28,079
I have never heard about it before.

327
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
After the dissection,

328
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,960
you can wash your hands.

329
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,079
Uncle Wuzhu is awesome.

330
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,400
He even could compete with the Four Great Masters.

331
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,000
If it were not for Wuzhu's low profile,

332
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,359
he would be famous

333
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,000
and become the fifth great master

334
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,200
in the world.

335
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,440
What's the relationship between
my mom and Uncle Wuzhu?

336
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:03,279
He was your mother's servant.

337
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,799
Well, my mom must be more awesome!

338
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,359
Your mother actually was unparalleled in the world.

339
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,319
How did she die that year?

340
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:12,720
I can't tell you.

341
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,359
Just tell me a little.

342
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
You talk too much.

343
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,880
You can't bear it, can you?

344
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:31,000
You...

345
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,480
There is something that you can't bear?

346
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,440
Teacher,

347
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,480
I am still a kid.

348
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,880
Uncle.

349
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
I have dissected the body for a whole night.

350
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,720
And you just cook this for me?

351
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:52,880
Right.

352
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,240
Will you put some ingredients into it?

353
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:56,920
No.

354
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,400
Did my mom teach you how to cook it?

355
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,200
What do you want to say?

356
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,720
What kind of person my mom is?

357
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,240
Her name is Ye Qingmei.

358
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,400
What else?

359
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:22,839
The others...

360
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,359
I've forgotten all of them.

361
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,279
You gave me

362
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,640
this secret skills about vitality Qi.

363
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:34,440
Do you remember it?

364
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,480
It's your mother who gave it to you.

365
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:39,920
I have practiced it

366
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,279
and I got some problems.

367
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,759
I can't control it. It's really overbearing.

368
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:45,000
Uncle.

369
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,839
Does it have a name?

370
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:48,720
Yes.

371
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:49,960
What is it?

372
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,640
“Overbearing Vitality Qi”.

373
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:53,680
It seems like

374
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,279
you name it just now?

375
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,240
If I can't control it well,

376
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,279
I'm afraid it will do harm to my body.

377
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,119
Uncle.

378
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,200
How can I practice it?

379
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,480
You don't know?

380
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,839
I haven't practiced it.

381
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,039
But my teacher told me you are super awesome.

382
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,720
Not bad.

383
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,920
Did my mother die of anger because of you?

384
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,440
I've forgotten all of them.

385
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,000
Well, about my problem,

386
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,400
what on earth should I do?

387
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,240
Finish the radish

388
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,480
and follow me.

389
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,160
To where?

390
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,680
Use the Qi

391
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,640
and fill it to your feet.

392
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,200
The speed will be faster.

393
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,160
I haven't practiced Kungfu

394
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,000
and don't know how to use the Qi.

395
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,920
So I find out a way

396
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,599
to practice your skills.

397
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,720
What is it?

398
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:29,799
I will beat you.

399
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:31,799
And then?

400
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,799
You dodge.

401
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,839
And this is your way?

402
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,839
try to dodge.

403
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,000
Once again.

404
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,319
It's okay.

405
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,880
Kids like sleeping.

406
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,200
Think about it. What poison is it?

407
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,079
When were you poisoned?

408
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:52,400
And how?

409
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,599
When I was picking up the chopsticks,

410
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
you poisoned me.

411
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,440
It tastes astringent,

412
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:05,880
so you mixed it in the edible wild herbs.

413
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,079
You can choose one

414
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,880
as I teach you.

415
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:29,559
No.

416
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:40,920
What about...

417
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,319
Take it if you make your decision.

418
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,480
... this one?

419
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,880
You will know after taking it.

420
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,440
What's wrong?

421
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,599
Teacher, what happened to me?

422
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,759
Your choice is wrong.

423
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,799
But the smell in the other bottles

424
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:19,839
is not right.

425
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,799
I told you to choose one bottle,

426
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,279
but I didn't say

427
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,640
the cure was among them.

428
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,680
Teacher, you are too...

429
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,359
You went too far.

430
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,279
Why didn't you say you went too far

431
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,400
when you knocked me out?

432
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:33,359
If you have any problems with that,

433
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,839
you can poison me.

434
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,200
If you can make it,

435
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:37,640
then we can finish the apprenticeship.

436
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,680
It's my turn to teach him today.

437
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,119
Let me teach him today.

438
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,440
Uncle.

439
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,880
I think I can't make it forever.

440
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
You just need time.

441
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:38,920
My teacher said

442
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,279
you were on the same level
with the Four Great Masters.

443
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:42,240
Kind of.

444
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,119
Have you fought with them?

445
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,000
Not all of them.

446
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,000
Who won?

447
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,559
I made it even.

448
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,480
They are the most powerful four men in the world.

449
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,160
You have never learned Kungfu,

450
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:53,480
how can you make it even with them?

451
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,880
If only you are fast

452
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:56,839
and strong enough.

453
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
How powerful should you be to
match with those great masters?

454
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,559
Uncle Wuzhu.

455
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:15,039
Uncle, in the front is a cliff.

456
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:16,440
If you could be so powerful as me,

457
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:17,480
and strong enough.

458
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:28,680
Uncle.

459
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,640
Is he a real human?

460
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
Teacher, please have a seat.

461
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:51,480
This is the poisoned tea I just made.

462
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,400
Please have a taste.

463
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,440
Tharm-cutting flower again?

464
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,200
But I didn't put it in the tea.

465
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,519
How did you make it?

466
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,720
The inner part is toxic

467
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,880
but the skin is not.

468
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,920
Just think about it.

469
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,079
Gotcha!

470
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,519
What poison is it?

471
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:51,160
It's not the poison but time.

472
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:52,319
These days,

473
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,519
you had a lot of good tonics.

474
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,480
Teacher, you are not poisoned.

475
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,400
You just had too many tonics and

476
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,640
you have too prosperous qi and blood.

477
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,519
You are so smart.

478
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,160
Now my apprenticeship is finished?

479
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,319
I can finish the apprenticeship
if I poison you successfully?

480
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,319
Right.

481
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,640
I made it!

482
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:36,759
All good things come to an end. I should go now.

483
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,799
Stop here.

484
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:42,079
These years,

485
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,119
the only person who I can completely trust

486
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,240
is Uncle Wuzhu.

487
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,920
He totally deserves it.

488
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,480
But now I have another people who I can trust.

489
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,279
Don't forget you have such a naughty student

490
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,680
like me in Danzhou.

491
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:07,240
Here you are.

492
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,200
It's the token of Director-General
of the investigator's office.

493
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,319
The Head asked me to give it to you.

494
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,599
Did he know me?

495
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,039
He knows your mother.

496
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:24,400
And I have something for you.

497
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,039
It's made of lamb intestine.

498
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:41,599
You can put it on

499
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:42,640
when you dissect bodies or test the poisons.

500
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:43,799
Okay.

501
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,279
I like it.

502
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,759
If I met you earlier,

503
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,519
I may choose another way.

504
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,599
Excuse me?

505
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,799
I will take care of you when you are old
and give proper burial after your death.

506
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,960
He left and it turns out to be a good thing.

507
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,079
He will stay in Danzhou.

508
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:32,920
he will attract people's attention

509
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,199
from the capital city.

510
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,280
Am I in danger?

511
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,239
If the red-armor

512
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,400
knights

513
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,760
appear in the street here,

514
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,840
the real danger

515
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,880
will come.

516
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,119
Who are the red-armor knights?

517
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,840
Young Master Fan Xian, what are you doing?

518
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,519
I am waiting for the red-armor knights.

519
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,119
Who are the red-armor knights?

520
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,320
You don't understand.

521
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:10,760
Young Master Fan Xian,

522
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,199
Are you still waiting for the red-armor knights?

523
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,639
These people are here to escort me to the capital city?

524
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,679
Who asked them here?

525
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,159
Your father, of course.

526
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,639
I have refused him.

527
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:29,840
The capital city is not a good place.

528
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,639
Your mother died there.

529
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,559
You can live longer

530
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,159
if you stay here.

531
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:40,159
But they are kneeling out of the door.

532
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:42,480
Leave them alone.

533
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,199
If they kneel there till they die,

534
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:47,480
just bury them.

535
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:20,679
Uncle,

536
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,559
should I go to the capital city?

537
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,079
I remember your mom doing business

538
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,039
in the capital city back then.

539
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:28,840
What else?

540
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,519
I can't remember.

541
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,119
So you mean

542
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,199
I should go.

543
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:42,760
To go or not to go, it's up to you.

544
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,079
My mom was killed in the capital city.

545
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,320
Are those killers still alive?

546
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,679
I have no idea.

547
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,679
I want to go to the capital city.

548
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,880
What if it's dangerous?

549
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:03,280
Whatever you like.

550
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,599
What are you looking at?

551
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,159
I've been wondering recently.

552
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,280
Will your face remain young

553
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,599
when I am in my seventies or eighties.

554
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:39,800
Grandma!

555
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,480
Madam!

556
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:45,400
Those soldiers

557
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,000
won't eat anything.

558
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,039
I'm afraid if treated indifferently,
they won't remain loyal.

559
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,079
Madam, I...

560
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:51,719
Eat!

561
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,719
I like this.

562
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,679
Today's dish is so fresh! Where does it come from?

563
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:11,519
He's asking you!

564
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,920
Ha's nephew delivered it early in the morning.

565
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,320
Isn't Ha the one who usually delivers the vegetables?

566
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:18,599
How come his nephew came here today?

567
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,159
Ha's sick, so his nephew took his place.

568
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,199
Is there anything wrong?

569
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,280
Has Ha's nephew been here before?

570
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,559
It must be his first time.

571
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,119
Anything wrong?

572
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,000
Nothing.

573
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,159
Grandma!

574
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,159
I've finished eating. I'll leave now.

575
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,360
Madam, forgive me for being outspoken.

576
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:48,519
A dish of bamboo shoots counts for nothing.

577
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,880
But he was acting

578
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,719
so arrogantly.

579
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,280
I'm just speaking out my mind.

580
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,320
Young Master!

581
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:12,480
Have you eaten the bamboo shoots?

582
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:13,119
Yes.

583
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:14,639
I...

584
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:16,360
Young Master, you...

585
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:25,559
Young Master, we don't know why.

586
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,559
Everyone suddenly

587
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:27,440
started vomiting and having watery stools.

588
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:28,119
Come with me.

589
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,280
Take this.

590
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,719
Make them drink some milk.

591
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,000
They'll be fine after vomiting.

592
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:46,119
Here! Here! Here!

593
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,079
Where are the men in red?

594
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:51,840
They asked about Ha's residence.

595
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:52,800
Then they left.

596
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,480
Here! Here! Here! There! There!

597
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,440
Here! Here! Here!

598
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,599
Do make them drink more milk.

599
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,559
Everyone drinks some.

600
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,679
Here! Here! Here!

601
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:16,960
Wait!

602
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:18,800
What are you doing?

603
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,280
Kill the one who poisoned the dish.

604
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,039
Ha has delivered vegetables for us for many years.

605
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,400
He must have been held hostage.

606
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,559
If you rush in,

607
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,400
he will be killed.

608
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,400
Step aside!

609
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:28,960
I'm Fan Xian.

610
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:30,039
Step aside!

611
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,119
What if it's a trick to lure you away?

612
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,159
Leave it to me.

613
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:36,800
Lend me a knife.

614
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:47,679
Ha!

615
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:05,320
You are the one who poisoned the bamboo shoots.

616
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,079
Holy crap! Doraemon!

617
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:25,280
You lose!

618
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,320
You've put poison on your dagger.

619
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,079
Before you die, I have a question for you.

620
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,920
Why didn't you

621
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,960
let the soldiers in just now?

622
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,719
Risking your life

623
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,679
for a guy delivering vegetables,

624
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:47,119
it's not worth it.

625
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,199
What a coincidence!

626
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:55,679
My knife is also coated with poison.

627
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,719
Why are you fine with it?

628
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,199
To tell you the truth,

629
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,599
I've been poisoned since my childhood.

630
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:04,840
For me, ordinary poison

631
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,920
won't work.

632
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,599
You're the one who poisoned the dish.

633
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,840
Why didn't you use something highly toxic?

634
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:14,840
I only need to kill you.

635
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:16,679
Why do you have to kill me?

636
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,960
I received a secret order

637
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,760
from the Investigator's Office to kill the traitor.

638
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:23,000
You're from the Investigator's Office.

639
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,000
If you kill me,

640
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,760
another assassin will come.

641
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
If the Investigator's Office wants to kill someone,

642
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:29,960
he won't be able to...

643
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,239
Token for Director-General of the Investigator's Office.

644
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,199
Where did you get it?

645
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,719
Fei Jie from the Third Division of the Investigator's Office

646
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,679
is my teacher.

647
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,000
You don't believe me?

648
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,639
My mom died early.

649
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,559
I own no place in the Fan mansion.

650
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:49,800
I've lived in Danzhou since I was a child,

651
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:51,440
but my dad never visited me.

652
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,679
My point is

653
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:53,800
how come a bastard son like me

654
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,360
has the quality

655
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:56,400
to become a traitor?

656
00:45:57,199 --> 00:45:58,039
Only because I'm handsome?

657
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,880
You're a bastard?

658
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,639
So think about it.

659
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,039
I'm afraid there's something wrong with

660
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:04,760
the secret order from the Investigator's Office.

661
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,800
We can really talk about it.

662
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:06,679
What do you think?

663
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:07,559
Moreover,

664
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:09,199
I also have a question for you.

665
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,920
The Fan mansion is managed according to strict rules.

666
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,159
How could you fool everyone

667
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,800
by pretending to be Ha's nephew

668
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,679
in you first appearance?

669
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,159
Who covered for you?

670
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:32,960
You're the one who cooperated with the assassin

671
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,880
to mix the poison in the dish. to mix the poison in the dish.

672
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,400
But it seems that

673
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:36,719
grandma has already figured it out.

674
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:39,840
Madam!

675
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,360
Everything I did

676
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,679
is for the Fan family.

677
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:43,920
Take your time.

678
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,079
Tell me everything.

679
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:48,199
Xian'er,

680
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:50,800
kneel down and listen.

681
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,599
I was sent by Madam Liu Ruyu

682
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:58,679
to keep an eye on Fan Xian.

683
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,159
Once he arrives in the capital city,

684
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:03,719
he is sure to scramble for family properties.

685
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:06,280
Rather than let him ruin the family,

686
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,599
it's better to make sure

687
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:08,519
he never arrives in the capital city.

688
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:09,559
Moreover,

689
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,079
the Investigator's Office wanted to kill him this time.

690
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:13,440
I was just

691
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,440
giving them a hand.

692
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:20,280
That's right.

693
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,559
To protect the Fan family,

694
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:27,320
we can't be softhearted.

695
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,519
Xian'er,

696
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,320
you must keep that in mind.

697
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:49,480
You've grown up.

698
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:52,559
You must learn to be merciless.

699
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,159
I see.

700
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,039
Guards!

701
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,119
Madam!

702
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,760
Break his legs!

703
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,360
Throw him onto a fish boat!

704
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:10,599
He doesn't have to land the rest of his life.

705
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:11,559
Yes.

706
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:17,360
No! No! No!

707
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:22,280
No! No! No!

708
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,119
Madam!

709
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,079
You've never liked Fan Xian
the whole time, haven't you?

710
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,840
He had received a letter from Liu Ruyu,

711
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,199
asking him to cooperate with others

712
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,000
to kill you.

713
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:43,119
What do you think?

714
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,840
Madam Liu Ruyu

715
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,039
sends me gifts on every festival.

716
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:51,360
She's very kind to me.

717
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,480
I do remember that.

718
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,559
Right.

719
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,679
A letter alone can't prove her guilty.

720
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,880
I'll ask your father

721
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,559
to investigate it further.

722
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:04,719
There must be an outcome.

723
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:06,039
Grandma!

724
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,119
What if

725
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,840
I investigate it myself?

726
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,800
You want to go to the capital city?

727
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:17,119
Haven't we agreed that

728
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,440
you stay in Danzhou?

729
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,559
I'll persuade your father.

730
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:22,960
Grandma!

731
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,719
Look what a big man I've grown into.

732
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:27,719
I have to witness the big world.

733
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,079
The first assassin has come,

734
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,159
and a second one will follow.

735
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,239
I've hidden for so long,

736
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,119
but they still won't let me go.

737
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:44,840
I might as well face them directly.

738
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:57,800
Have you made up your mind?

739
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,119
I'll come back after solving everything.

740
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:06,960
What if Liu Ruyu is behind the assassin?

741
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:14,639
Then I'll tell her that

742
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,079
I'm not interested in the family properties.

743
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,320
I just taught you

744
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,079
You must learn to be merciless.

745
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:26,760
I'm not interested in the family properties.

746
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,400
I'm smart and flexible.

747
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:33,920
Just be cautious!

748
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,119
Tomorrow.

749
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,400
Well,

750
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,079
I won't see you off tomorrow.

751
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,440
I'm too old

752
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,639
to stand separation.

753
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:05,760
Go back and get prepared.

754
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:23,920
Boss, I'd like to buy a pair of scissors.

755
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,280
Here is the money.

756
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,320
I'll take the scissors.

757
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:47,960
He stole a lot of things.

758
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:49,719
I know.

759
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,679
Because it doesn't matter

760
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:54,360
whether the shop makes a profit or not.

761
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,239
You're here to protect me.

762
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:58,760
Yes.

763
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:09,760
Uncle,

764
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:12,519
I'm leaving for the capital city.

765
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:16,199
OK.

766
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:23,000
I didn't tell you about the assassination this time.

767
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,639
Do you know why I keep it from you?

768
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:28,880
I don't.

769
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:30,760
Because I want to show you

770
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,320
I can live well

771
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,800
in this world

772
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,960
without your help.

773
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:38,400
I've already grown up.

774
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:39,159
OK.

775
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:46,239
Ever since I could remember,

776
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,440
you've been guarding me.

777
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:50,199
As long as you're around,

778
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:51,480
I fear nothing.

779
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:56,920
But that is not right.

780
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:00,960
What is not right?

781
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,920
Liu from the kitchen likes fishing.

782
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,079
Ma who guards the door loves watching girls.

783
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:10,119
Everyone has a hobby.

784
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,480
And you?

785
00:53:14,679 --> 00:53:15,360
What do you like?

786
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:17,280
Nothing.

787
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,679
Then do you have someone you like?

788
00:53:22,239 --> 00:53:24,199
Something you want to do?
Your own plan for life?

789
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,000
Sometimes, I just feel that

790
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:33,679
you are living for me.

791
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:36,519
That's not fair to you.

792
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,039
You don't need me anymore?

793
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:54,519
I will always need you.

794
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:56,960
But Uncle,

795
00:53:58,519 --> 00:53:59,400
to me,

796
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,039
you're more than a guardian angel.

797
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,000
You're also the most important family member

798
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,960
I've left in the world.

799
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:08,760
I hope you can find something

800
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,679
you want to do.

801
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:13,880
Do you understand what I'm talking about?

802
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:20,679
Not really.

803
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:24,039
Uncle,

804
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:27,360
I'm leaving for the capital city tomorrow.

805
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:30,920
I will find those who want to kill me,

806
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,280
and I will explore my mom's stories.

807
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:35,880
I will live my life better

808
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,840
than anyone else in the world,

809
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,840
because that's what I want all along.

810
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:41,800
That's terrific.

811
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,760
I hope you can find something

812
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,719
you want to do.

813
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,360
Live for yourself.

814
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,440
Find something I want to do.

815
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,840
Live for yourself.

816
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,519
Find something I want to do.

817
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:35,119
Live for yourself.

818
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:47,920
Uncle Wuzhu,

819
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,559
can you show up

820
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:49,599
normally?

821
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:50,960
I remember.

822
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,400
Remember what?

823
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:56,920
Miss once said the same words

824
00:55:57,239 --> 00:55:58,599
as you did this afternoon.

825
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:00,039
She wanted me

826
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:01,159
to find something I like.

827
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,119
Then have you found it?

828
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,199
I want to open it.

829
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,079
It was left by miss back then.

830
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,800
It's from my mother?

831
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:24,880
What's in it?

832
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:25,880
I don't.

833
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,920
You never opened it?

834
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,800
She never told me to open it.

835
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:30,840
What now?

836
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:31,880
I've thought for a long time.

837
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:34,039
In this world,

838
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,559
what I want to do most

839
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,000
is to open this box.

840
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:38,639
I want to see

841
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:39,719
what on earth did Miss leave.

842
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:43,199
You must have been through a lot.

843
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:45,800
I've forgotten.

844
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,119
Come on!

845
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:49,960
Let's open it.

846
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,119
I don't have the key.

847
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:53,599
Wait a minute.

848
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:04,239
Wait a minute. I'll go fetch another knife.

849
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:20,840
It's way too tough.

850
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,000
What's it made of?

851
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:25,119
I don't.

852
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,239
How come it's so tough?

853
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:30,199
Where did my mom get it?

854
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:31,920
I've forgotten.

855
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,679
Where is the key?

856
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:35,159
In the capital city.

857
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,599
So, I will also go to the capital city.

858
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:39,840
Let's leave together tomorrow.

859
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,679
I'll leave first. Let's meet in the capital city.

860
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,039
What about this box?

861
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,079
You keep it.

862
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,079
What's it really made of?

863
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:29,519
Young Master!

864
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,400
The water is being heated.
It's gonna take a while before eating.

865
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:32,639
That's fine. Go ahead and do your business.

866
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:33,840
I'm just walking around for a stretch.

867
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:34,559
Yes.

868
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,280
Young Master!

869
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:41,199
Young Master!

870
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:48,079
Young Master!

871
00:58:58,599 --> 00:58:59,239
Teng...

872
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,440
Young Master, what's wrong?

873
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:01,039
Nothing.

874
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:09,559
why are you here?

875
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:12,360
I also need to return to the capital city.

876
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:13,800
Didn't you ask me to spread the word that

877
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,679
you're dead?

878
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,239
Yes.

879
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:19,000
Officially, I was killed by you.

880
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,280
I can't show my face in public.

881
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,280
So I follow you cavalry

882
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:24,679
to avoid examination.

883
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:27,599
My guards know you?

884
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,400
No, they don't.

885
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:30,039
But they know what silver is.

886
00:59:30,599 --> 00:59:31,519
Why do you go to the capital city?

887
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:33,000
It's none of your business.

888
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:34,880
Fine with me.

889
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,760
I go to the capital city this time

890
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:39,920
to find out who really wants to kill me.

891
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,840
It's Liu Ruyu, isn't it?

892
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,760
The second wife of your father?

893
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,719
I want to know how she

894
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:45,679
misled the Investigator's Office.

895
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,599
I don't know that.

896
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:49,360
You can help me find out.

897
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,480
When arriving in the capital city,
we can cooperate with each other.

898
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:53,719
Your death is the best cover.

899
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:55,440
Why should I help you?

900
00:59:56,679 --> 00:59:58,679
Don't you want to know who tricked you?

901
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:00,199
No, I don't.

902
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,639
Now, you're asking me for a favor.

903
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,480
Well then,

904
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,400
I'll consider it when I reach the capital city.

905
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:07,440
Come back!

906
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,519
Do you think

907
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:10,360
you are serious enough?

908
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:12,599
You have to prepare for your marriage
when you arrive in the capital city.

909
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,039
You won't have time for the investigation.

910
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,360
What marriage?

911
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,920
Aren't you going to the capital city for getting married?

912
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:18,960
No one told you that?

913
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:21,800
No one did.

914
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:24,519
How did you know?

915
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:27,280
After receiving the secret order of killing you,

916
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:28,719
I have to know your information.

917
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:29,320
Just a quick glance.

918
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,760
Then whom am I going to marry?

919
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:31,239
I don't.

920
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,039
I was ordered to kill you,

921
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:33,920
not your whole family.

922
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:34,920
Why should I learn so much about you?

923
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,360
This

924
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:43,880
is my gift for your marriage.

925
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,920
Wish you a long and harmonious union,
and may you have a baby soon.

926
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:47,920
I'm going to make a fire.

927
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:09,960
What are you doing?

928
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,639
The trade caravan coming toward us
belongs to the Investigator's Office.

929
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,079
Luckily, I have sharp eyes.

930
01:01:38,679 --> 01:01:39,880
Most men in that trade caravan

931
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,719
are from the Fourth Division.

932
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,039
Moreover,

933
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,079
powerful as your teacher,

934
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:46,000
he actually travels along to keep up the formation.

935
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,760
I'm afraid something serious is happening.

936
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,360
Stop!

937
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,400
