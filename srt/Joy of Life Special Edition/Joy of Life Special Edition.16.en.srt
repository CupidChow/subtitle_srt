If you go behind the Forbidden Door

17
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
and find the truth,

18
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,280
you're destined to go back

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,519
to where I escaped

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,599
and face the most horrible things

21
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,920
underground.

22
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,959
If you stay away from that door,

23
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,959
all these dangers

24
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,519
will have nothing to do with you.

25
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,200
You can enjoy a peaceful,

26
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,000
happy life.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,080
The way you live your life is up to you.

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,520
That's all my suggestions.

29
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,960
One more thing,

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,439
there is no vitality Qi.

31
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:21,879
The so-called vitality Qi

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,759
is actually something

33
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,000
left from the last era.

34
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,319
By the way,

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,400
be nice to Wuzhu.

36
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,000
Did you hear it?

37
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:45,840
Yes.

38
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:47,360
The secrets hidden
at the bottom of the pond

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,400
at Taiping Residence.

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,159
Do you want to find it out?

41
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,240
I've no idea.

42
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,319
She said it's dangerous.

43
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,000
My mind told me not to go,

44
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,639
but I'm curious.

45
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,879
What do you think?

46
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,039
Up to you.

47
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,599
She asked me to be nice to you.

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,800
I don't understand.

49
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,759
You're a martial arts master.

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,439
You don't need me
to take care of you, right?

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,639
She said,

52
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,199
vitality Qi doesn't exist.

53
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,800
It doesn't now that she said so.

54
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,280
What is it?

55
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:33,879
The thing I've been practicing.

56
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,000
I've no idea.

57
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,879
She said she'd give me an answer,

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,159
but I ended up

59
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,120
becoming more confused.

60
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,280
It's just a trap.

61
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,280
Uncle...

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,599
I think

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,360
I'd better

64
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,039
forget about it.

65
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,599
Now that I came here,

66
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,479
I should live well here

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,039
and take good care of people around me.

68
00:03:59,439 --> 00:03:59,919
No problem.

69
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:01,960
But the premise is that

70
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:04,120
nobody found you sneaking into
the imperial harem.

71
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,039
Don't worry. I did it without trace.

72
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,240
Nobody could find it's me.

73
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,080
Who?

74
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,400
Your Excellency!

75
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Bad news. It's found out.

76
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,399
Come in.

77
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,680
What's found out?

78
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,040
He knew almost everything.

79
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,800
About what?

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,560
Who?

81
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,639
What's the matter? Make it clear.

82
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,519
I...

83
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,680
was seeing
that locksmith out of the capital city.

84
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,560
Head and Master Shadow

85
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,639
saw me and blocked my way.

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,920
They asked me

87
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,839
if it's you

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,040
that sneaked into the imperial harem

89
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,560
last night.

90
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,079
Wang Qinian, did you tell the truth?

91
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm not stupid.

92
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,639
Of course I didn't.

93
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,439
And then?

94
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,040
Then

95
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,519
Master Shadow

96
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,920
gave this key to me.

97
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,680
This key.

98
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,759
Is there anything special

99
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,160
about it?

100
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,199
Nah. There is nothing special

101
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,240
about the key.

102
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,879
It's just the key to the house

103
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:03,759
of that locksmith.

104
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,639
The locksmith

105
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,480
that made the fake key last night?

106
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,160
Exactly.

107
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,160
Why did Shadow have the key

108
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,240
to his house?

109
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,160
The locksmith works for Head.

110
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,519
I really have no idea about that.

111
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,800
The locksmith has achieved fame

112
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,720
in the capital city for years.

113
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,120
And I've known him for a long time.

114
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,480
He's never mentioned

115
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,879
he knew Head.

116
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,720
Your Excellency,

117
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,800
you can imagine

118
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,759
how many people in the capital city

119
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,920
spy for Head.

120
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,759
This is not a key.

121
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,439
There's no such key

122
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,839
or such lock in the world.

123
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,319
The locksmith didn't know

124
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,199
I sneaked into the imperial palace.

125
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,000
Your Excellency, they're not fools.

126
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,480
You weren't at home last night

127
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,680
and someone broke into
the imperial palace.

128
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,079
You also went to the locksmith

129
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,680
in nocturnal costume.

130
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,439
All this proves

131
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,439
it's you.

132
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,079
What did Chen Pingping say?

133
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,480
He asked me to pass on a message to you.

134
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,959
Nobody else would know

135
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,639
what he did last night.

136
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,519
He can do whatever he wants.

137
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:03,279
I'll patch up his lies.

138
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,879
Tell Fan Xian

139
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,519
he can trust me.

140
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,680
It's a serious matter,

141
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,920
but he just let it go.

142
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,199
I think Head

143
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,399
is trustworthy.

144
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,360
As for what I'll do next,

145
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,040
I want to do it myself.

146
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,879
I'll ask him for help if necessary.

147
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,040
Next?

148
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,600
What do you want to do?

149
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,120
I went to Guangxin Palace last night,

150
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:30,920
so I didn't have time
to put the fake key back.

151
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,480
Then,

152
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,399
What to do?

153
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,600
To put it back as soon as possible.

154
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,879
I can't let others know

155
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,279
about my real intention.

156
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,000
Now that assassinators broke
in last night,

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,800
the imperial palace
will be heavily guarded today.

158
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:43,279
How could you go in again?

159
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,199
I'll turn to someone
who can do it anytime.

160
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,680
Who is it?

161
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,279
Even if he can,

162
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,120
why should he do you a favor?

163
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,240
Go to the imperial palace?

164
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,040
It's not hard.

165
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,399
I was brought up there.

166
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,720
It's like my home.

167
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,360
You have to find a way

168
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,519
to get into
the Empress Dowager's palace.

169
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,319
No problem.

170
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,040
Her Majesty is nice to me.

171
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,360
I should go to see her.

172
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,560
You have to take me there too.

173
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,959
Okay.

174
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,240
We're engaged.

175
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,600
We should go there together

176
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,439
to see her.

177
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,120
That's not what I meant.

178
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:26,879
I mean

179
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,360
you take me there

180
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,879
without letting others know it's me.

181
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,439
Do you mean

182
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,399
you can't go to the imperial palace

183
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,680
in the name of Fan Xian?

184
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,399
In whose name will you do that?

185
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,079
A eunuch accompanying you.

186
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:41,639
Disguised as a eunuch.

187
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,279
A fake. I won't be a real one.

188
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:47,879
You don't need to explain it.

189
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,560
Is it okay?

190
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,600
Yeah. Sure.

191
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,639
More guards than usual.

192
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,120
Your Highness,

193
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,560
a thief broke in last night.

194
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,839
Everyone is talking about that.

195
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,240
Is it caught?

196
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,240
No.

197
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,120
It's said that guy

198
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,079
was here to see

199
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,480
the maidservant of the Princess Royal.

200
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,240
The one like a cold fish?

201
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,240
Exactly.

202
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,639
She's not young.

203
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,639
Yeah.

204
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,800
She finally came across
an infatuated man.

205
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,600
A maidservant and an infatuated man.

206
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:26,959
It...

207
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,720
It's ridiculous.

208
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:29,199
Who knows?

209
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,720
Your Majesty,
let me pay my respect to you.

210
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,039
Rise.

211
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,159
You're in poor health.
You don't need to kneel.

212
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,039
Your Majesty,

213
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,759
through careful treatment,

214
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
I've nearly recovered.

215
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,679
Even so, I don't want you to kneel down.

216
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,120
Come on! Come on!

217
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,159
Why do you come here today?

218
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,759
I haven't seen you for a long time.

219
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,960
I miss you.

220
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,960
You've taken several servants with you.

221
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,759
I know you have a sweet tooth,

222
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,759
so I've taken

223
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,840
some cakes and cookies

224
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,039
made by myself

225
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,879
to you.

226
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,799
I've heard fleas appeared
in the imperial palace recently,

227
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,559
so I've also taken some fumigants

228
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,279
to get rid of them.

229
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,080
Your love and devotion

230
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,639
are beyond price.

231
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,039
Good! Good! Good!

232
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,679
Accept all these.

233
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,559
Where is Eunuch Hong?

234
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,480
A thief broke in last night,

235
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,240
so I asked him to give a hand

236
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,039
to His Majesty.

237
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,840
Today is a lovely day.

238
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,480
How about

239
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,279
going to the back garden
to enjoy flowers?

240
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,120
Let them stay here

241
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,440
and get rid of pests.

242
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,639
Good idea.

243
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,600
Let's go.

244
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,759
Okay.

245
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,879
Okay. Let's go.

246
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:00,759
I don't feel myself today

247
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,679
I'll stay a little longer with you
in the garden.

248
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,960
Slow down.

249
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,399
Getting fresh air

250
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,879
is good for your health.

251
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:11,840
Okay.

252
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,080
Eating more meat
and opening windows to let fresh air in

253
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,519
are also good for your health.

254
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:17,919
Am I right?

255
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,200
Yeah.

256
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,440
It's a beautiful sunny day.

257
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,720
Let's have a walk.

258
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,600
Okay.

259
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,039
Your Highness, I've told him about it.

260
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,240
The Beiqi mission is going to set off.

261
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,080
Your Highness, are you still
thinking about the assassinators?

262
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,039
Why on earth

263
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:47,960
did they come here?

264
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,120
Didn't they aim to assassinate you?

265
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,679
I always think
something is going wrong with it.

266
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,039
Are you sure they came from Dongyi Town?

267
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,759
Eunuch Hong fought

268
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,399
one of them

269
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,559
and recognized the mental cultivation
methods of Si Gujian.

270
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,080
Really?

271
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,200
Eunuch Hong chased him for a long time

272
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,639
and fought him several times.

273
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,200
He couldn't have got it wrong.

274
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,039
Fought him several times?

275
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:09,919
Yes.

276
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,399
Chased him out of the imperial palace?

277
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,240
That's right.

278
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
When?

279
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,080
Eunuch Hong mentioned

280
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,360
he came across that assassinator
at 11:00 p.m. or so.

281
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,559
Then he realized it was a trick
to lure the tiger form the mountain?

282
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,360
Exactly.

283
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,480
When did you find the assassinator

284
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,360
out of the imperial palace?

285
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,960
Night watchmen had sounded gongs
to make the hours at that time.

286
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,240
It was past 1:00 a.m.

287
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,600
When Eunuch Hong was lured away
at 11:00 p.m.,

288
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,039
the second assassinator
must've broken in.

289
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,039
If he aimed to kill me,

290
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,679
why didn't he come here

291
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:42,120
until 1:00 a.m.?

292
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,519
Where did he go

293
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,240
during the past two hours?

294
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,519
He just passed by my palace.

295
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,559
He aimed to do something else.

296
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,799
What does he want to do?

297
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,519
Xiaoyi,

298
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:03,879
ask everyone

299
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,480
in the imperial palace

300
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,080
to check if anything was stolen

301
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,879
or something went wrong.

302
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,120
Got it.

303
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,200
Hold on.

304
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,279
They may not listen to me.

305
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,159
Go to Her Majesty

306
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,440
and explain everything to her

307
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,320
so that she can give an order.

308
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,360
I got it.

309
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,200
Is it Dongyi Town or not?

310
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,320
I'm going to

311
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,919
find out the truth soon.

312
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,600
Interesting. I'm looking forward to it.

313
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,159
Director Yan.

314
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:18,799
Her Majesty is having a walk
in the garden.

315
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,080
You can go there for her.

316
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:22,799
Someone is inside?

317
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,279
We're trying to get rid of pests
through fumigation.

318
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,120
I mean the inner room.

319
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,399
Is anyone there?

320
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,480
No.

321
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:39,159
Director Yan.

322
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,200
Director Yan.

323
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,200
It's Her Majesty's palace.
Don't forget the rules.

324
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,559
What's Li Yunrui investigating?

325
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,480
Her Highness worries the assassinators

326
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:09,759
might have other intentions.

327
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,639
Then

328
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,399
make everyone in the imperial palace

329
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,000
check their own place carefully.

330
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,639
Got it.

331
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:26,799
Let's go back.

332
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,039
I have to check too.

333
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,440
Got it.

334
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,120
Slow down.

335
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,879
All of you, wait here.

336
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,120
You too.

337
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,200
I don't know what to do to thank you.

338
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:08,879
Write me a poem.

339
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,679
Fine!

340
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,559
I need to think about it.

341
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,000
You wrote so many poems last night
even though you were drunk.

342
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:18,480
Why do you need to think about it today?

343
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,519
It's a different case.

344
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,240
Those poems

345
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,159
came to my mind

346
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:23,279
themselves.

347
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
I want to create one

348
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,679
for you.

349
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,200
They came to your mind themselves?

350
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:32,720
They just came like that.

351
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,759
I don't know where they're from.

352
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,480
Are you really an immortal

353
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,879
that's demoted to the mortal world?

354
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,919
And those poems

355
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,360
were created by you
when you were in heaven?

356
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,480
Where did you hear of that?

357
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:43,480
Don't you know that?

358
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,679
Overnight,

359
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,919
it spread everywhere.

360
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,399
Are you also reading this book?

361
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:57,960
Are you too?

362
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,399
Good book.

363
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,120
Good book.

364
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,480
"On war-torn land streams flow
and mountains stand.

365
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,240
In vernal town grass
and weeds are overgrown.

366
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,519
Grieved over the years,
flowers make us shed tears."

367
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,720
Look at this line.

368
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,160
"It's wrong to set goblets idle,
in the glory of the moon."

369
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,240
Wonderful!

370
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,599
how many people need to die

371
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,759
proves himself to be the poetic genius.

372
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:13,799
It's...

373
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,160
With this collection of poems printed,

374
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,720
I'm afraid nobody would dare to
write poems again.

375
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,519
Absolutely.

376
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,920
Having the poetic genius

377
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,559
is a blessing for Nanqing.

378
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,680
To be honest,

379
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,240
I once worked with

380
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,880
His Excellency Fan.

381
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,440
At that time, I already thought

382
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,839
he's eminent

383
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,480
above all others.

384
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
What is it?

385
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,920
What is it?

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,599
No idea.

387
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,000
Who did it?

388
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,119
Show it to me.

389
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,759
There are more on the ground.
Pick it up.

390
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,319
There are words on it.

391
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,240
Bro, look.

392
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,240
There are so many.

393
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,519
Who threw it?

394
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:10,799
Let's pick one up.

395
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,400
Let's have a look.

396
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,640
It's confusing.

397
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,319
Who wrote it?

398
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,200
No idea. Forget about it.

399
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,640
It's just a piece of paper.

400
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,119
Pretend you didn't see it.

401
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,519
Something serious is going to happen.

402
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:41,519
You. Stop it.

403
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,240
Go on reading.

404
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,319
...ignores social order and law
and has ferocious ambition.

405
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,400
What's worse,

406
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,119
knowing some honest patriots
are lurking in Beiqi,

407
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,519
Li Yunrui is so fatuous and evil-minded

408
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,680
that she forgets about national interest

409
00:18:56,759 --> 00:18:59,839
and betrays loyal patriots to the enemy.

410
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,839
Your Highness.

411
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,920
there are even harsher words.

412
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,200
Where did you get it?

413
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,680
It was scattered in every corner
of the capital city.

414
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,079
Almost everyone read it.

415
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,279
A lot of them

416
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,279
kind of believe it.

417
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,000
Who scattered them?

418
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,759
We have no clues.

419
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,039
It's interesting.

420
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,000
They want to get me into trouble

421
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,799
by spreading gossip.

422
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,480
Others' opinions are not important.

423
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,039
The key lies in

424
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,160
how His Majesty thinks about it.

425
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,920
The criticism is incisive.

426
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,200
Who wrote it?

427
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,319
How many people have read it?

428
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:55,119
I'm afraid everyone has.

429
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,160
Now.

430
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,319
it's widely discussed among people.

431
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,480
They're talking about

432
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,640
the Princess Royal's love affair
with Zhuang Mohan.

433
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,759
Nonsense!

434
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:08,359
Your Majesty,

435
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,200
is it true that the Princess Royal

436
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,519
betrayed Yan Bingyun?

437
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,640
Why do you ask me?

438
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,839
Isn't it
the Investigator's Office's duty?

439
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,039
Shall we find the truth out?

440
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,759
It has provoked much discussion.

441
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,440
It's better to put an end to it.

442
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,880
Your Majesty,
do you need an end to it or

443
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:36,559
the truth?

444
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,240
How dare you?

445
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,519
I can punish you
for your great disrespect.

446
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,000
I'll accept the punishment.

447
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:50,839
I don't mind if you want to die.

448
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,640
Leave us.

449
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:05,200
The Princess Royal colluded with Beiqi?

450
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,640
She betrayed Bingyun?

451
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:11,440
Where did you get it?

452
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,279
It can be found everywhere
on the streets.

453
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,640
Who distributed it?

454
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,440
Heaven knows.

455
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:18,960
Let me make it clear.

456
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,400
If my son was arrested
because of exposing his identity,

457
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,599
I have nothing to say.

458
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,759
But if it's because

459
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,880
someone in Nanqing played a trick,

460
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:28,559
I won't leave it at that.

461
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,440
Let's update each other

462
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:40,720
on anything new.

463
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,839
We're making a big deal out of it.

464
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,519
I'd like to see
how Li Yunrui would end up.

465
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,400
Uncle, I'm lucky to have you.

466
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,279
Nobody else could have

467
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:01,799
scattered them all over the city

468
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:02,799
without letting others know.

469
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:04,880
Is it of help?

470
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,559
Uncle, gossip is a fearful thing.

471
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,839
Besides, this is true.

472
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,319
Li Yunrui can't
afford to be investigated.

473
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:12,880
Do you know

474
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,559
what the divine temple looks like?

475
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:15,279
No.

476
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,480
Do you want to know?

477
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:17,559
No.

478
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:19,759
I won't bother to ask you any questions.

479
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:22,279
What's best about it is that

480
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:25,200
nobody could find out
it's me behind this.

481
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,279
So, I can stay out of it

482
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,640
and watch the show.

483
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,240
It's me, Chen Pingping.

484
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,680
Why are you here?

485
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,240
To see you.

486
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,920
Is Wuzhu not here?

487
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,200
What's the matter?

488
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:20,319
This tree...

489
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,319
I've read it.

490
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,359
It's hard to imagine

491
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,279
the Princess Royal

492
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,480
has a love affair

493
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,440
with such an old man.

494
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,079
It's you that did it.

495
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,319
You have no evidence.

496
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:31,359
Please don't say that.

497
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:32,720
The evidence is
what you're holding in your hand.

498
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,039
They're scattered everywhere
in the capital city.

499
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,440
I had a few copies taken back.

500
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:46,440
Check it out.

501
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,759
The paper is made from blue sandalwood.

502
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,480
Due to different abilities
to absorb water,

503
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,680
such paper can be classified into

504
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,000
raw paper, ripe paper

505
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,160
and half-ripe paper.

506
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,680
Head,

507
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,279
this is half-ripe paper.

508
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,799
A lot of the bark of blue sandalwood
has been used, so it's also called "Jingpi".

509
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,799
It has two layers in thickness.

510
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,440
Paper curtains with double silk lines
are used to form the grain pattern.

511
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,720
In addition to straws,

512
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:45,680
mulberry and hemp
are also used as auxiliary material.

513
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,279
It's produced in Hexi Circuit.

514
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,400
Such paper is not of high quality,

515
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:50,839
so it's seldom used in the capital city.

516
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:51,839
Head,

517
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,519
are there a large number of copies?

518
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,720
They can be found everywhere
in the capital city.

519
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,240
Only one place

520
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,000
has such a large amount of stock.

521
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,759
In the whole capital,

522
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,440
only Danbo Bookstore

523
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,640
has purchased such paper.

524
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,079
You're the one behind this.

525
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,720
Are you short of money

526
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,839
so that you purchased
such poor quality products?

527
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,519
Fan Sizhe is responsible for this.

528
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,720
He'd save every penny he can.

529
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,519
besides Chen Pingping,

530
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:33,119
I've paid least attention to

531
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:33,799
the Eighth Division.

532
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,839
I didn't expect Shangshan Hu

533
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,960
The Investigator's Office
was set up by your mother.

534
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,079
Don't look down upon it.

535
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,640
Did many people know about it?

536
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,359
Nobody did. I got it fixed.

537
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,680
Is it true or false?

538
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:56,920
The love affair part is false,

539
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,400
but the betrayal part is true.

540
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,160
How did you know

541
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,119
I heard it with my own ears.

542
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,400
You heard it when you sneaked
into the imperial harem that night.

543
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,799
Do you want to
deal with the Princess Royal?

544
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:11,880
She wants to kill me.

545
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,839
I can't sit still
waiting for my death, right?

546
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,319
Only spreading gossip is not enough.

547
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,799
You have to provide evidence.

548
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,720
I planned to take the second step.

549
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,519
I think

550
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,759
there is someone who's of use.

551
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,720
Guo Youzhi,
Minister of the Board of Rites.

552
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,720
How did you know

553
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,200
I've heard what happened
at the banquet that night.

554
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,880
I'll be here today.

555
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,160
I'll watch you hit rock bottom
and ruin your name

556
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,279
with my own eyes.

557
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,559
My son is so rude.

558
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,000
Your Excellency Fan, please forgive him.

559
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,400
Who are you?

560
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,640
This is Guo Youzhi,

561
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,920
Minister of the Board of Rites.

562
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,599
By making up such an absurd story,
he lied to Your Majesty.

563
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,720
Your Majesty, I beg you to punish him!

564
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,200
According to Guo Baokun,

565
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,400
he knew that

566
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,839
Zhuang Mohan made a false charge.

567
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,680
If the Princess Royal

568
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,920
wants to contact Zhuang Mohan,

569
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:05,720
there must be an official
who acts as an intermediary.

570
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,200
Guo Baokun is not qualified,

571
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,480
so it must be his father,

572
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,759
Guo Youzhi.

573
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,279
It turns out you also thought of it.

574
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,279
I've paid much attention to your thing.

575
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,839
But it's just a guess.

576
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,000
I've got an idea

577
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,319
to prove Zhuang Mohan

578
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,880
has collided with Guo Youzhi.

579
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,039
You can take advantage of
Zhuang Mohan's disappearance

580
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,799
upon his first arrival
in the capital city.

581
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:26,880
How could you know?

582
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,480
Judging from the current situation,

583
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:31,640
Zhuang Mohan?

584
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,079
did meet the Princess Royal.

585
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,880
Someone must have done something

586
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,119
to deceive the public.

587
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,759
That's why he was taken away
from his residence.

588
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,880
We can try to find out

589
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,079
who Zhuang Mohan met that day.

590
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,119
I've done that.

591
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,039
Guo Youzhi was one of them.

592
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,079
You must also have guessed

593
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:48,480
what I'd say next.

594
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,160
Let me think about it.

595
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,680
I'll think about it.

596
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,599
These are still not enough.

597
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,839
We need witnesses.

598
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,960
Did you get one?

599
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,039
We caught his carter
who confessed everything.

600
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,240
He said he took Zhuang Mohan away

601
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,400
secretly that night

602
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,279
and someone picked him up

603
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:08,799
at the imperial harem.

604
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,599
What should be done has been done.

605
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,559
What do you want to do next?

606
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:17,680
That's what I want to ask you.

607
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:23,359
I want to drive Li Yunrui

608
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,880
out of the capital city.

609
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,640
Look at it yourself.

610
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,799
Guo Youzhi is indeed
one of my followers.

611
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,039
It's also true

612
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,039
I met Zhuang Mohan.

613
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,279
Did you confess your crime?

614
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,720
Zhuang Mohan is a literary giant.

615
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:07,400
I had some questions about
the ancient prose I was reading,

616
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,799
so I invited him to my place

617
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,720
to consult him.

618
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,279
As for betraying Yan Bingyun,

619
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,799
it's sheer nonsense.

620
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,440
Reading ancient prose?

621
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,240
I'm sure you can find out the truth.

622
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:24,920
Do you have any question?

623
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,519
Let's forget about

624
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:29,799
the ancient prose for a while.

625
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,440
The imperial harem
should not meddle in politics,

626
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,519
but Her Highness won over
Guo Youzhi in private,

627
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,400
which proves
she ganged up for selfish interests.

628
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,000
Are you convinced?

629
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,480
Now that Head said so,

630
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:44,960
of course I'm convinced.

631
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,759
What should we do?

632
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,200
As a court official,

633
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,559
Guo Youzhi ganged up
with the imperial harem.

634
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,720
He should be turned over to
the Ministry of Penalty according to law.

635
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,240
Won't you even
try to protect your follower?

636
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,799
The law is the law.

637
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,359
Guo Youzhi brought it on himself.

638
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,960
You've proved yourself
to be one of the royal family.

639
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,079
Quick. Quick!

640
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:25,640
Dad,

641
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,680
Master.

642
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,839
Dad! Dad!

643
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,240
Let me go over.

644
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:30,880
My dad serves as Board of Rites.

645
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,839
He's an official of standard class,
second rank.

646
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,160
The Ministry of Penalty
has no right to arrest him.

647
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,759
Dad! Dad!

648
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,640
Master.

649
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,319
How dare you!

650
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,200
I'll go to His Majesty and complain.

651
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:37,839
Step aside.

652
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,799
Master.

653
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:40,319
Dad,

654
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:41,200
Master.

655
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,680
Dad! Dad!

656
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,480
Loosen your grip. Go away.

657
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,359
Dad! Dad! Dad!

658
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,400
Dad. Loosen your grip.

659
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,839
-Let me say something to him.
-Let go of me.

660
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,039
I won't make things difficult for you.

661
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,839
Dad! Dad!

662
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,880
Let go of me!

663
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:58,559
Dad! Dad!

664
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,640
Dad,

665
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,880
I have to save you.

666
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,480
Alright. It's of no use.

667
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,880
Can't you see it?

668
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:08,799
Besides guys
from the Ministry of Penalty,

669
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,920
some imperial guards are also here.

670
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,240
You still don't understand?

671
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,400
They did it by His Majesty's order.

672
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,279
How could it be like this?

673
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,119
I shouldn't have let you

674
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,799
go to the Hall of Prayer
for Good Harvest that day.

675
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,960
I should have been more careful.

676
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:31,079
I shouldn't have told you
about that thing.

677
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,880
At the Hall of Prayer
for Good Harvest...

678
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,240
You shouldn't have said
those words to Fan Xian.

679
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,319
It wouldn't matter
if he really lost his reputation,

680
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:46,319
but now he's acclaimed
as the poetic genius.

681
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:48,440
I know,

682
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,319
it would happen sooner or later.

683
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,559
Dad. It's my fault.

684
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,480
I don't blame you. It's my fault.

685
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,079
Kun'er, from now on,

686
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,119
you have to make a clean break with me.

687
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,119
Remember.

688
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,759
Try your best to send in memorials

689
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,680
to attack me and abuse me.

690
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,400
Say that I have wild ambition

691
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,720
and you can't bear it anymore.

692
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,640
Got it?

693
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,039
No.

694
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,079
Only in this way

695
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,880
will you not get caught in trouble.

696
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,960
No! No!

697
00:32:26,359 --> 00:32:27,240
I often criticize you,

698
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,680
but from the bottom of my heart,

699
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:32,960
I hope to see you

700
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,839
rise in the official world
and get married.

701
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,720
I want to protect you all the way,

702
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,599
but I can't do it anymore.

703
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,720
Listen.

704
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,559
I may not survive.

705
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,000
You have to be resolute

706
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,440
to keep yourself safe.

707
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:53,880
Got it?

708
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:02,119
Dad,

709
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,960
Dad,

710
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:04,799
I'm not your dad!

711
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:06,200
From today on,

712
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,119
I don't have a son

713
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,119
like you.

714
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,559
You're not my son anymore!

715
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,400
Guo Youzhi has been put into prison.

716
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,160
What shall we do with you?

717
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,079
Your Majesty, I will

718
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,279
hand over Neiku to you.
(Neiku means Imperial Treasury)

719
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:38,400
That's what you should do!

720
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,039
As for other punishments,

721
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,799
you have the final say.

722
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,559
Your Majesty.

723
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,160
As for betraying...

724
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,319
As I explained,

725
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,519
I met Zhuang Mohan

726
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,200
just to talk about literature.

727
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:01,000
It's ridiculous to say
I betrayed Nanqing.

728
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,279
Who can give witness?

729
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:06,400
Who can give witness to

730
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,640
my collusion with Beiqi

731
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:08,800
and betrayal of Yan Bingyun?

732
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,159
There is someone else

733
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,639
Yan Bingyun's lurking in Beiqi.

734
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,840
Shortly after you met Zhuang Mohan,

735
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,360
Yan Bingyun was arrested by Beiqi.

736
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,000
If it hadn't been you,

737
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:21,920
how could it have been leaked?

738
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,679
There is someone else

739
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,039
who knew about it.

740
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,679
Who is it?

741
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,480
Fan Xian,

742
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,199
Yan Bingyun had left

743
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,599
when Fan Xian came to the capital city.

744
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:35,960
How could he know that?

745
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,119
As far as I know,

746
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,440
Fan Xian met Yan Bingyun

747
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,400
on his way here.

748
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,239
It's also possible

749
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,639
that he spilled the beans.

750
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,159
Is that true?

751
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,840
I'll find it out.

752
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,119
But even so,

753
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,800
it's impossible for Fan Xian
to collude with Beiqi.

754
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,480
Why is it possible for me to do that?

755
00:34:59,039 --> 00:34:59,559
Investigate!

756
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,280
Get to the bottom of it.

757
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,400
Got it.

758
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,559
Head Chen, you've been working hard

759
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,039
for the nation with great merits.

760
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,440
Let me see you out.

761
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

762
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:54,119
I've heard Fan Xian and you

763
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,280
are like old friends from the start.

764
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,800
Your Highness,

765
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,239
it's the same case for you and Fan Xian.

766
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,960
If Fan Xian is suspicious,

767
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,920
you'll handle it impartially, right?

768
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,039
Of course.

769
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:09,840
That's good.

770
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,320
Alright. Let's say goodbye here.

771
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,239
Head, take care.

772
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,199
Your Highness, take care.

773
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,440
Head, do you think

774
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,159
you've lifted a rock

775
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,880
only to drop it on your own toes?

776
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,599
My toes are numb.

777
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:43,320
Got me involved?

778
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,039
Yeah.

779
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,760
Li Yunrui said

780
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,239
you met Yan Bingyun

781
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:48,719
on your way to the capital city.

782
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:50,440
Fan Xian,

783
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,039
If Yan Bingyun

784
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,199
We didn't see each other,

785
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,280
but we did meet.

786
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:58,440
In this case,

787
00:36:58,559 --> 00:36:59,760
it'll be alright.

788
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:00,760
It doesn't matter
as long as you didn't know

789
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,119
he was going to Beiqi.

790
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,880
A member of the Fourth Division

791
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,039
actually tried to kill his superior.

792
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:11,880
Yan Ruohai

793
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,639
must take the responsibility.

794
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:16,000
Teng Zijing is under the command of

795
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,559
his son Yan Bingyun.

796
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:18,920
The Head was so angry that

797
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,280
he dismissed him from his post,

798
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,800
asking him to

799
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,119
disguise himself
with his men as trade caravan

800
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,719
to take over
the intelligence network in Beiqi.

801
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,760
It's most confidential.

802
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,320
Master Fei
shouldn't have told you about it.

803
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,440
He's got you into trouble.

804
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,880
You knew that

805
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,760
he was going to Beiqi

806
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,239
and he's arrested,

807
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,519
so you're suspicious.

808
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,719
It's no big deal.

809
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,199
No big deal?

810
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:40,519
Being suspicious is a big deal.

811
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,280
Such being the case,

812
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,599
we can't declare Li Yunrui guilty.

813
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,199
We might have to give up

814
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,159
when it's nearly done.

815
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
What did Chen Pingping say?

816
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:48,599
He said

817
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,000
he needs to see you.

818
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:51,280
I'm afraid

819
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,199
there will be nothing he can do.

820
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:02,920
There it comes!

821
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,480
Wang Qinian told me about that.

822
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,960
Li Yunrui planned to use me

823
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,079
as an excuse.

824
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,079
This time,

825
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:11,960
I was behind the scenes

826
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,519
and thought I wouldn't be noticed,

827
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,400
but unexpectedly,

828
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,920
I got involved anyway.

829
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,079
Freshly brewed tea.

830
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,880
I understand the current situation.

831
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,360
I heard

832
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,960
Li Yunrui and Zhuang Mohan
talk about that,

833
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,719
but I don't have any hard evidence.

834
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,039
Now I'm also a suspect.

835
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,440
I'm afraid it's impossible

836
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:35,280
to drive her away this time.

837
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:37,559
But thank you, anyway.

838
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:38,920
It's only partially successful.

839
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,360
Let's try to do it next time.

840
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,480
The Princess Royal lost.

841
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,239
I see, so I...

842
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,320
What did you just say?

843
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:56,880
Do you know?

844
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,880
Even if you have hard evidence

845
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,760
and His Majesty knows

846
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,599
she colluded with Beiqi

847
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,920
and betrayed Yan Bingyun,

848
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,960
she wouldn't be driven out of
the capital city.

849
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:08,880
No.

850
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,000
It's a betrayal of Nanqing.

851
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,679
She's the Princess Royal anyway.

852
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,199
They're not of the same blood, but she's
also a member of the royal family.

853
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:19,440
His Majesty would just scold her
no matter what a big mistake she made.

854
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,440
So, all my efforts

855
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:25,880
are in vain?

856
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,119
I promised

857
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,519
to help you drive her out of
the capital city.

858
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,199
I'll never

859
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,960
break my promise.

860
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,639
Today, it was my aim

861
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,840
to let her say those words

862
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:44,400
in the presence of His Majesty.

863
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,599
As far as I know,

864
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:47,840
Fan Xian met Yan Bingyun

865
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,239
on his way here.

866
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:50,920
It's also possible

867
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:52,280
that he spilled the beans.

868
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,400
As she said that,

869
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:56,920
she made a big mistake.

870
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,559
She has lost

871
00:39:59,239 --> 00:39:59,960
the battle.

872
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,920
She'll be driven out of
the capital city.

873
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,800
She won't be punished
because of her betrayal of Nanqing,

874
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,440
but she will because of those words.

875
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,639
Is there anything special about that?

876
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,840
She did something
His Majesty can't bear.

877
00:40:18,679 --> 00:40:21,519
Is it about me?

878
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,440
You met Yan Bingyun

879
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,960
on your way to the capital city,

880
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,519
which is top confidential.

881
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:29,880
In the Investigator's Office,

882
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,320
know about it.

883
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,079
How did she know?

884
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,239
There is only one possibility.

885
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,880
There is a hidden traitor
in the Investigator's Office.

886
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,480
You know, the Investigator's Office

887
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,280
is directly under His Majesty.

888
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,199
Getting involved in our business

889
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,960
means a challenge to imperial power.

890
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:50,280
So,

891
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,639
His Majesty couldn't bear it.

892
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,039
What should we do?

893
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,639
Find him out and get rid of him.

894
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,400
This guy must be influential
and powerful.

895
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,960
Here I am. Who wants to see me?

896
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,039
Here I am! Who wants to see me?

897
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:16,960
Come out!

898
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,960
The leaflets were scattered everywhere,

899
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,639
but you haven't found out

900
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,559
who did it.

901
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,559
I'm ashamed to say the First Division

902
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,039
is responsible for supervising
everything in the capital city.

903
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,239
Mobilize everyone you can

904
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,199
to find it out!

905
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,119
Yes, sir.

906
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,639
You can leave.

907
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:12,800
What's up?

908
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,280
Shadow came to me just now.

909
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
We almost fought.

910
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,920
Why?

911
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,199
Chen Pingping was attacked

912
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:24,159
the other day.

913
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:25,639
He's suspicious of me.

914
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,400
Is it you, Your Excellency?

915
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,679
Yan Ruohai, how dare you?

916
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,840
If you want to put me to death,

917
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,599
just report me.

918
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,360
Why do you want to kill the Head?

919
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,920
I don't want to see him

920
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,360
destroy the Investigator's Office.

921
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:03,280
Will you accept Fan Xian

922
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,239
as the Head of
the Investigator's Office?

923
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,119
Why didn't Shadow fight with you?

924
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,039
He's not sure.

925
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,559
He tried to sound me out.

926
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:16,119
I pretended to know nothing about it
and he let it go.

927
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:17,960
Why are you telling me about it?

928
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:20,159
I want to borrow a few guys from you.

929
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,760
You have your own subordinates.

930
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,079
I don't trust them.

931
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:24,920
What do you want?

932
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,559
To pick someone up out of town.

933
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:27,840
Who?

934
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,880
You just need to lend me

935
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,199
a few trustworthy guys.

936
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,679
Who are you going to pick up?

937
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,280
It's about Li Yunrui

938
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:40,039
betraying my son.

939
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,800
It's just a rumor,

940
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,679
Your Excellency.

941
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,719
Zhuang Mohan and his mission

942
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,280
have gone back to Beiqi

943
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,239
the other day.

944
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,239
Get to the point.

945
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,239
My men

946
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:08,920
caught someone from the mission

947
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,719
and are taking him back to
the capital city secretly.

948
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:11,920
I'm going to pick him up.

949
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,760
Did they catch him on the way?

950
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:17,920
What do you want?

951
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,400
That guy can prove

952
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,719
Zhuang Mohan's relationship
with Li Yunrui.

953
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,760
Li Yunrui betrayed my son.

954
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:27,920
I won't leave it at that.

955
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,800
Everyone here

956
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,440
tell the Head about it?

957
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,320
Such being the case,

958
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:49,440
how could I trust him?

959
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:52,960
I'll look into it myself.

960
00:44:58,599 --> 00:44:59,039
Zhu Ge?

961
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,119
the Fourth Division is not based
in the capital city.

962
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,880
Nowadays, you're the only one

963
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,519
I can trust.

964
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:08,519
You can choose to help me or report me.

965
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,920
It's up to you.

966
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,719
You can have three men at most.

967
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,360
That'll be enough.

968
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:55,320
Hold on.

969
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,119
You're off the case.

970
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:26,719
You're free to go.

971
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:32,719
Go to the village ahead

972
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,400
and get an ox cart

973
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:35,400
to take him back.

974
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,719
Zhu Ge?

975
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,719
We've been colleagues for years.

976
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:16,920
I didn't expect

977
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,119
we'd end up like this.

978
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,800
You can't kill me.

979
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:21,239
Otherwise, I'm afraid it might be hard

980
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,400
have you ever considered

981
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:24,239
It might be a trap

982
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:25,599
set by Chen Pingping

983
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,440
to let you show your true colors.

984
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:29,199
I really have,

985
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,199
so I've sent

986
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:31,199
all my spies

987
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:32,239
to keep an eye on

988
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,119
all relevant parties
in the capital city.

989
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:35,639
I can tell you.

990
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,000
Up to now,

991
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,559
of the Investigator's Office
in the capital city

992
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,920
haven't been mobilized up to now.

993
00:47:41,719 --> 00:47:42,559
How about Shadow?

994
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,880
He still stays

995
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,280
outside the Head's room.

996
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,079
He's not moved a step from there.

997
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,559
Do you think your men can tail him?

998
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,400
No. They can't tail or stop him.

999
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,679
But

1000
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:58,159
a message will be sent to me

1001
00:47:58,159 --> 00:47:59,719
once Shadow gets out of
the Investigator's Office.

1002
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:01,840
It'll be too late

1003
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,280
even if he rushes here now.

1004
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:05,800
Nobody has ever seen

1005
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:07,360
the Shadow's face.

1006
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:09,280
Haven't you thought

1007
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:10,199
he had swapped

1008
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:12,239
someone else over today?

1009
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:13,400
Before I got out of town,

1010
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,280
I talked to him on purpose

1011
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,320
and confirmed he's Shadow himself.

1012
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,360
You've been thoughtful.

1013
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,880
So, it couldn't be a trap

1014
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,400
set by the Head.

1015
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,400
You're just buying time

1016
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,880
and waiting for helpers.

1017
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:29,360
My helpers may not be
inside the capital city.

1018
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,679
Do you mean black knights?

1019
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,119
Black knights

1020
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:33,320
have been hiding out of the city.

1021
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:34,760
But what if I tell you

1022
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,119
I also know

1023
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:38,280
about the mobilization of them?

1024
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,000
You've even got a spy
among black knights?

1025
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,119
You've been on guard
against Chen Pingping?

1026
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,159
Nobody

1027
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:48,360
could save you today.

1028
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,199
Do you have anything
to say before you die?

1029
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:51,360
Now that you're not

1030
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,440
You're closest to him.

1031
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,039
Why do you want to kill me?

1032
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:56,960
I caught that guy

1033
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,559
just to find out the truth

1034
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,400
about Li Yunrui's betrayal.

1035
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:01,760
It has nothing to do with you.

1036
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:02,679
Why do you...

1037
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,039
You're protecting Li Yunrui.

1038
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,239
You're her follower.

1039
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:21,320
Have you ever seen Yan Ruohai?

1040
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,880
Yes, several times.

1041
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,280
I have little contact with him,

1042
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:28,559
but I think

1043
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:30,599
besides Chen Pingping,

1044
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,119
among the eight directors,

1045
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,119
he and Zhu Ge

1046
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,880
are the best two.

1047
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:37,599
What a pity!

1048
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:39,760
Such a capable person

1049
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:42,400
will die tonight.

1050
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,239
I should've gone there.

1051
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:44,960
No need.

1052
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,559
Zhu Ge did it
after making full preparations.

1053
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,679
He won't fail.

1054
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,880
From tomorrow on,

1055
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:54,079
the Investigator's Office
will also work for me.

1056
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,440
What do you think of the line

1057
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
written by Fan Xian in his poem?

1058
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,440
The jade and crystal mansions are so high!
(It's too high and too cold for me.)

1059
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:08,960
Coldness doesn't bother me.

1060
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:11,679
I just want to climb up and have a look.

1061
00:50:16,039 --> 00:50:16,960
From tomorrow on,

1062
00:50:17,559 --> 00:50:18,960
you'll be in charge of

1063
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,079
both the Investigator's Office
and Neiku.

1064
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,679
You'll be the most powerful woman

1065
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:24,000
in Nanqing.

1066
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:28,880
I've heard a star will fall from the sky

1067
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,360
when a talented person dies.

1068
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,840
I can't wait
to see the night screen hang down.

1069
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:36,960
I'm looking forward to that.

1070
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:48,320
Kill him.

1071
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,559
I'd be really dead

1072
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:52,679
if you still refuse to show up.

1073
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,559
Your Excellency,

1074
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,159
you're unreasonable.

1075
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:08,440
You said all master-hands

1076
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,320
of the Investigator's Office

1077
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,239
are kept under watch.

1078
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:11,159
How about me?

1079
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,719
Nobody kept me under watch.

1080
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:14,000
Don't you take me seriously?

1081
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:15,840
Zhu Ge looks down upon you.

1082
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,000
You should've known that.

1083
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,920
It doesn't make a difference

1084
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:23,199
even if the two of you are here.

1085
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,320
Do you really think
it's just the two of us?

1086
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:26,960
Kill Yan Ruohai!

1087
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:01,519
Black knights?

1088
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:03,800
Impossible.

1089
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,679
You're really cautious.

1090
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,679
Up to now,

1091
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:09,880
I still can't confirm who's the spy

1092
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,199
among black knights.

1093
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:16,599
Do you still remember

1094
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:22,159
who was caught the last time
they were mobilized

1095
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,000
before I came back?

1096
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,239
Take care!

1097
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:37,480
Allow me to leave.

1098
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:42,639
I...

1099
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,679
They helped me catch Si Lili.

1100
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,679
Not only Si Lili.

1101
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:51,800
All black knights
who left that day are here.

1102
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:54,159
We proclaimed that

1103
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,519
they've gone to the northern border.

1104
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,360
Actually,

1105
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,760
they've been lurking

1106
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,760
around the capital city

1107
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,360
and waiting for you.

1108
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:03,159
Have you started

1109
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,800
to set a trap for me

1110
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,960
since then?

1111
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,239
No. Even earlier.

1112
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:09,800
Before Fan Xian
came to the capital city,

1113
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,719
we'd started to get prepared.

1114
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:12,320
Think about it.

1115
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,480
When did I

1116
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,440
begin to show

1117
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,920
my grudge against the Head?

1118
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:20,039
Last night,

1119
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:21,440
in the residence of the Assistant
Minister of Ministry of Penalty,

1120
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,079
someone from our Investigator's Office

1121
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:24,159
was also there.

1122
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:26,320
Yan Ruohai,

1123
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:28,679
we don't have a say in this.

1124
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:29,920
Everything I did

1125
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,239
is for Nanqing.

1126
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,639
So does the Head.

1127
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:33,800
He's old.

1128
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,280
Don't make me arrest you myself!

1129
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:39,760
You've played the long game.

1130
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:42,719
That's how we managed to let you believe

1131
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,760
my grudge against Head.

1132
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:46,360
By carrying out those assassinations,

1133
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:47,960
you just rooted out

1134
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,880
the Head's enemies.

1135
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,920
We had scruples.

1136
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:51,719
You couldn't have been taken in

1137
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:53,199
if we hadn't played the long game.

1138
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:55,039
why did you

1139
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,320
start to set a trap for me so early?

1140
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:58,239
Because of the assassination in Danzhou.

1141
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,679
I received a secret order from the
Investigator's Office to kill the traitor.

1142
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:05,840
Do you work for
the Investigator's Office?

1143
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:08,880
The assassination happened

1144
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,639
because the wrong order was given.

1145
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,440
My son had to take responsibility

1146
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:14,639
Pay special attention to
such a few people

1147
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,440
The forged order

1148
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:18,239
must have something
to do with the imperial harem.

1149
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,079
But you have to understand

1150
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:24,320
someone in the Investigator's Office
must've served as a helper.

1151
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,360
Why do you think it's me?

1152
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:29,280
We've set traps for all directors.

1153
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:30,719
Through screening,

1154
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,039
we believe

1155
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:34,679
you're the most likely suspect.

1156
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,800
So, this guy

1157
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:41,920
is not from the mission of Beiqi, right?

1158
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,159
He's a condemned prisoner
from the neighboring county.

1159
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:45,800
He committed murder and arson,

1160
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:47,039
so he deserved it.

1161
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:50,000
Let me ask you again.

1162
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,480
Why do you work for Li Yunrui?

1163
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:53,880
What did she promise to give you?

1164
00:54:58,719 --> 00:54:59,800
If the Investigator's Office

1165
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,039
is a huge beast,

1166
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,800
then the leash used to control it

1167
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,280
must be in the hands
of the royal family.

1168
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:10,679
Why is it the Princess Royal?

1169
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,199
You can choose

1170
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,039
Your Highness,

1171
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,320
Disturbances will arise
if an emperor's son is in power.

1172
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,400
It's a different case
for the Princess Royal.

1173
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:22,360
She's a member of the royal family,
but not the emperor's next of kin.

1174
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,239
And she's a woman.

1175
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:24,480
She may die anytime

1176
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,880
if His Majesty wants.

1177
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:28,119
That's why a prolonged political stability
will be achieved

1178
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:30,320
if she takes over
the Investigator's Office.

1179
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,159
Head,

1180
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:33,360
You really did it
for the sake of Nanqing.

1181
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:34,719
Of course.

1182
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,679
It sounds nicer than it is.

1183
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,800
You know nothing about it.

1184
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,000
It's all for Nanqing.

1185
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,159
why did she betray our secret agents

1186
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:41,280
to Beiqi?

1187
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:44,480
I really don't understand.

1188
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,320
I knew nothing about that.

1189
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,639
Head Chen even bought over
a Ninth Dan swordsman.

1190
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:54,559
she'd do that.

1191
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:57,559
In this case,
why do you still work for her?

1192
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,119
As I said,

1193
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:00,840
I hope the Investigator's Office

1194
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,679
is in the control of the royal family

1195
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:03,719
to make sure

1196
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:05,519
social and political stability
in Nanqing.

1197
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:07,280
As for Li Yunrui's moral quality

1198
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,199
and whether she's kind or evil,

1199
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:09,559
it doesn't matter.

1200
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,239
There would be room for negotiation

1201
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:12,599
if it were for power or for wealth.

1202
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,199
Now that we have different ideas
about righteousness,

1203
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:18,159
we've reached the point of no return.

1204
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:19,559
Of course.

1205
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,280
Turn him over to His Majesty.

1206
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,880
No way!

1207
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,280
But if I die today,

1208
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,599
nobody could prove Li Yunrui
once got involved

1209
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:32,119
in the affairs of
the Investigator's Office.

1210
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,360
Is Hong Sixiang
not in the imperial palace?

1211
00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:43,519
No.

1212
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,960
As soon as I found Hong Sixiang getting
out of the palace in secret,

1213
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,400
I'm here to tell you about it.

1214
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,920
Where could the old eunuch go?

1215
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:56,599
Oh no.

1216
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,079
Chen Pingping is good at setting a trap.

1217
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:08,039
Such a serious matter

1218
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,079
needs someone as a witness.

1219
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,159
If you don't want His Majesty

1220
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:13,639
to know about it,

1221
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,159
you can kill me

1222
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,320
before you commit suicide.

1223
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,440
Eunuch Hong, you must be kidding.

1224
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:23,199
Your Excellency, let's go back.

1225
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,800
Your Excellency,
are you going to run away

1226
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,400
or kill me

1227
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,039
or commit suicide?

1228
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:35,800
It's up to you.

1229
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:39,599
Let's just see if you can do it.

1230
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:52,960
Head,

1231
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,400
Did you hear

1232
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:02,400
what Zhu Ge said?

1233
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,039
Yeah.

1234
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,320
In this case,

1235
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,599
it doesn't matter if he's dead.

1236
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,000
Head Chen, what do you want to say?

1237
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,079
He's at the end of his rope.

1238
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:23,800
What he wants is just to save face.

1239
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,159
Eunuch Hong,

1240
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:30,679
we couldn't bear to be insulted

1241
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:35,239
if it were us, right?

1242
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,119
Give it back to him.

1243
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,239
Thank you, Head.

1244
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:15,880
Head Chen

1245
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:17,480
I'm going back to the imperial palace.

1246
00:59:18,679 --> 00:59:19,679
I'll report

1247
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,599
what I heard here to His Majesty.

1248
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,400
Thank you, Eunuch Hong.

1249
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:59,719
That faraway place.

1250
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,599
We'll see each other again someday.

1251
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:15,000
Let's go back.

1252
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,519
I didn't plan to make him die.

1253
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:26,800
If you choose a path in life

1254
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,199
and walk along it till the end

1255
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,000
without giving in,

1256
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,679
you can count yourself lucky.

1257
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,320
Your Highness, Hong Sixiang
getting out of the imperial palace

1258
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:01,199
may not have anything to do with
Zhu Ge's issue.

1259
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,760
What Director Yan said makes sense.

1260
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,519
Your Highness, please don't worry.

1261
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,480
Did you see that?

1262
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:11,960
See what?

1263
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,800
A shooting star fell
and disappeared in a flash.

1264
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:19,519
