00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:43,043
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,200
Look!

4
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,280
It can move.

5
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,519
If cut open, it'll bleed.

6
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,799
I'm growing up recently,

7
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,159
so I eat a lot every day.

8
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,159
Vegetables are good for health,

9
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,560
but I still love to eat meat.

10
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,000
Eating too much meat,

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,719
my nose will bleed,

12
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,599
and my nails will grow fast,

13
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,079
so I often have to cut them every day.

14
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:08,759
What nonsense are you talking about?

15
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,400
I'm telling you that I am a man.

16
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,039
Not a chess piece.

17
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,520
Not a chip.

18
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,039
I am a living man.

19
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,639
Why would I

20
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,719
use my life

21
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,759
to trade for a firm?

22
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,039
Xian'er, you have to understand.

23
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,080
If you control Neiku,

24
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,879
you're in control of

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,800
uncounted wealth.

26
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,719
Were you with my mom

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,960
for her money?

28
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,919
How dare you!

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,840
I can't marry her.

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,599
I want to live

31
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,280
for myself.

32
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,159
Fan Xian! Fan Xian!

33
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,360
Fan Xian.

34
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,319
Are you asleep?

35
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,360
It's Fan Sizhe.

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,120
I need to talk to you.

37
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,639
I'm coming in.

38
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,120
Sleeping already?

39
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,639
Wake up!

40
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,520
Don't sleep!

41
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:05,800
I have something to tell you.

42
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,439
How come you sleep like a log?

43
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,080
Fan Xian! Wake up!

44
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,840
Fan Xian.

45
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,759
haven't you slept in Danzhou?

46
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,319
Are you awake?

47
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,160
I have something to tell you.

48
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,040
Well, today,

49
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,279
I almost beat you.

50
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,399
It's my fault.

51
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,000
After all, we are relatives,

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,480
right?

53
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,519
How about this?

54
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,360
I'll book a table in a restaurant

55
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,040
at noon tomorrow.

56
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,480
Take it as my apology for you.

57
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,319
Is that OK?

58
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,319
Well, I'll take that as a “Yes”.

59
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,920
At noon tomorrow. Don't forget!

60
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:00,759
I'm leaving.

61
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,160
I'll leave this on your desk.

62
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,560
Fan Xian.

63
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,319
Who is he?

64
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:56,720
What's this?

65
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,279
He's the guard who escorted me to the capital city.

66
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,759
Why are you here?

67
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,199
There's one more thing.

68
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,560
Dad

69
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,879
is old-fashioned and inflexible.

70
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,720
But no matter what,

71
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,560
he's still your dad.

72
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:14,720
Do you understand?

73
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,480
I don't need you to tell me that.

74
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,600
Fine! Fine! Fine!

75
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,120
Don't tell him about

76
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,800
our lunch tomorrow.

77
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,680
I see.

78
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,160
I'll leave you to your business.

79
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,360
Where were you just now?

80
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,439
Anywhere you can't see.

81
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,199
Aren't you gone?

82
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,519
Listen.

83
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,600
He has fallen into my trap.

84
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:05,519
Tomorrow morning,

85
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,800
find some guys to go out with me.

86
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,439
I will beat up

87
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,839
the bumpkin from Danzhou.

88
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,000
He is a Young Master of the family after all.

89
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,079
He is a Young Master.

90
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm not, right?

91
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,720
Fuck off!

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,399
Yes.

93
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,240
All your files back then

94
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,399
were transferred by the Investigator's Office.

95
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:26,839
The only thing left

96
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,480
is this arrest warrant.

97
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,240
According to it,

98
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,720
the crime you committed back then

99
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,959
was assassinating court officials.

100
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,800
This is weird.

101
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,920
Why would the Investigator's Office

102
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,120
hire a criminal

103
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,600
like you?

104
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,120
And why do you turn to me?

105
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,720
To pick up your former career?

106
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,199
Do you have the token for
Director-General of the Investigator's Office?

107
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes, I have.

108
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,600
You will go to the Investigator's Office.

109
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,439
Maybe!

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
What are you doing?

111
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,160
The Investigator's Office has special records

112
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,800
of all cases.

113
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
If you can bring me

114
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,879
my file which doesn't have much importance,

115
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,800
I'd give my life

116
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,399
to you.

117
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,759
I don't want to do that.

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,680
I will never

119
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,519
kneel in front of you

120
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,399
if I have another choice.

121
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,279
I understand.

122
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,480
that file is nothing confidential.

123
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,559
Since you're the Director-General,

124
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,039
it's a piece of cake for you to take it out

125
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,840
without any trouble.

126
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,960
I'm saying it once again.

127
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,840
I don't want to do that.

128
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,759
I will help you

129
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,799
with one extra condition.

130
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,000
You must tell me

131
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,080
what's on the file,

132
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,480
You must tell me

133
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
assassinate the officials

134
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,480
from the imperial court,

135
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:25,879
You must tell me

136
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,960
do you give up everything?

137
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,559
I was...

138
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,879
These people are...

139
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,000
The story was a cliche!

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,759
This common couple poured water on the street

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,159
and stained the royalty's dresses.

142
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:46,879
As a consequence, they got beaten up.

143
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,440
Thank you for saving my life.

144
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,759
Thank you!

145
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,519
Thank you for saving my life.

146
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,720
The master of those people

147
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,279
is called Guo Baokun.

148
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,240
And his father is Guo Youzhi,

149
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,240
the current Minister

150
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,519
of the Board of Rites.

151
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:13,960
He has paramount power.

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,519
What happened next?

153
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:17,000
One day later,

154
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,120
I was on the wanted list of the Ministry of Penalty.

155
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,840
It's nothing but a fight.

156
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,200
Why put you on the list?

157
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
The charge was assassinating important officials.

158
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:31,279
How did they declare you guilty without evidence?

159
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:32,600
There were witnesses.

160
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:34,679
The Guos?

161
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
It was that couple.

162
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,240
I was just convicted like that

163
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:49,000
with extermination of all my family members.

164
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,159
Your family got involved as well?

165
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,080
My wife just got pregnant at the time.

166
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,360
Who saved you?

167
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:58,679
The Investigator's Office.

168
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,559
They transferred me away from the jail

169
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,480
and took away all the files

170
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,879
with just one condition.

171
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,240
They wanted me

172
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,279
to serve them in the Investigator's Office.

173
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:10,399
If I agree,

174
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,679
they would save my family.

175
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,840
They must be attracted by your capabilities.

176
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,080
What if I don't know any Kung Fu?

177
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,320
Will there be vegetation

178
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,559
all over my cemetery?

179
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,120
You hate them.

180
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:24,639
Whom?

181
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,159
I mean that couple

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,120
After I came under the Investigator's Office,

183
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,879
I talked to them in private.

184
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,879
Please give me some money.

185
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,759
Please help me with some food.

186
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,879
It's very tiring, isn't it?

187
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,279
You're sweating.

188
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,200
Miss, please give me some food.

189
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,039
Miss!

190
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,320
What a miserable boy!

191
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,360
Please give me some food! Sir!

192
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,120
Please give me some money! Sir!

193
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,799
Give some to him.

194
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,039
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

195
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:52,440
Not at all.

196
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:54,360
Let's go!

197
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,360
Thank you! Thank you!

198
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,480
Life is not easy for anyone.

199
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:00,200
Yeah!

200
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,000
Please give me some money. Sir!

201
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,600
Please help me with some food.

202
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,559
Please have mercy! Sir!

203
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,480
Please!

204
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,720
Please give me some money! Sir!

205
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,799
Please help me with some food.

206
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:18,720
Have mercy on me please!

207
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,200
Miss, please give me some food.

208
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,799
Have mercy on me please!

209
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,360
Anyone please help me?

210
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,279
Thank you! Thank you! Sir!

211
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,120
Thank you!

212
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:27,840
Thank you!

213
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:31,200
They are merely common people.

214
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,799
What can they do when they are summoned by

215
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,919
the Minister's Residence as witnesses?

216
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,320
Ever since then,

217
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,279
I understand that there is no black and white in this world

218
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,519
but just rich and poor.

219
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,240
I realized

220
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,399
I had to take my wife and children away

221
00:12:58,759 --> 00:12:59,440
from the capital city

222
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,639
and spent the rest of the life

223
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,799
in obscurity.

224
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,080
So you used me for a fake death

225
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,000
to run away from the Investigator's Office?

226
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,279
I went home once.

227
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,519
It's all empty now.

228
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,879
My family are all missing.

229
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,200
I am a dead man

230
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,000
in name.

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,039
I can't investigate it.

232
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
You're the only man

233
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,919
that I can trust.

234
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,559
There must be record

235
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,039
about my family's whereabouts.

236
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:29,559
You have my life

237
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,360
if you can help me find them.

238
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,080
I don't need your life,

239
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,679
but I'll help you.

240
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,000
My Lady, it's time to take the medicine.

241
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:34,720
Wan'er, Wan'er,

242
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,480
I'm treating you with drumsticks today.

243
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:38,879
My Lady! My Lady!

244
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,080
Watch out for the wind!

245
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:42,480
Miss!

246
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:52,559
Lady Ye,

247
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,639
what new idea

248
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,440
do you have today?

249
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,360
I went out of town yesterday
to watch sword shows on the street

250
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,440
and learned that a chef

251
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,919
can make dishes out of grains, vegetables, and beans

252
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:02,360
with the taste of various meats

253
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:03,759
which is not only tasty

254
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:04,840
but also vivid.

255
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,320
So I brought him here

256
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,240
to satisfy your craving for food.

257
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,879
You're so considerate.

258
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,279
Of course!

259
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:13,519
If you have a craving for any food

260
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
in future,

261
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,320
I'll bring him to you.

262
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,759
I have no luck to enjoy them

263
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,960
despite how honored I am.

264
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,720
Are you alright?

265
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,399
You are spitting blood again.

266
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,840
Did you catch a cold yesterday

267
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,559
when visiting the Qing Temple?

268
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:38,600
I'm fine!

269
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,120
Totally fine.

270
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,200
Do you think

271
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,679
some day

272
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,600
I would get used to

273
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,360
spitting blood.

274
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,679
No way!

275
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,600
I'll find a famous reclused doctor for you

276
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,840
some day when I go out of town.

277
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,600
You'll be cured.

278
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,440
In view of the current situation,

279
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,080
I won't be happy

280
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,600
even if I'm cured.

281
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,639
You're still concerned about the bestowed marriage?

282
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:17,919
I know the situation

283
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,200
about my body.

284
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,120
I could die any time.

285
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,200
Why would I die with the marriage contract?

286
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,679
That's bullshit!

287
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,240
You don't have to blame yourself

288
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,120
for a bastard.

289
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,159
He is a bastard.

290
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,720
So am I.

291
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,919
What's the difference?

292
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,279
You are the awe-inspiring princess

293
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,799
which is evidently different from him.

294
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,519
I grew up in sheer coverup

295
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,879
for my whole life.

296
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:53,399
The so-called identity as a princess is all fake.

297
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,159
I have only one requirement

298
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,080
to the person that I'm going to marry.

299
00:17:00,039 --> 00:17:00,799
What's the requirement?

300
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,440
It must be a person that I love.

301
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,960
That's a good point, Wan'er.

302
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,599
Yes. Love is the thing.

303
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,079
I'm gonna fine a man

304
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,960
that I love too.

305
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,319
We're so indulged

306
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,759
in empty talk.

307
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:24,680
That's nothing difficult.

308
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,319
Wait! Where are you going?

309
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,200
Fan Xian is the determinant.

310
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,279
I'm gonna find him

311
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,119
and make it clear to him.

312
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,119
He has to understand

313
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:34,839
how bad he is

314
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,119
and plead the emperor to cancel the marriage contract.

315
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,039
Miss!

316
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
where are you going?

317
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,519
You can't catch a cold again.

318
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,920
We're going to ask for the
cancellation of the marriage contract.

319
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,400
Miss!

320
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:50,599
Take some!

321
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,119
No! No! No!

322
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,319
By the way, I've got one more thing to do.

323
00:17:56,519 --> 00:17:57,880
Ask him to pull over!

324
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:58,839
I need to get off.

325
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,440
What's so urgent?

326
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,599
Stop!

327
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:08,920
Ask the guy from Danzhou

328
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,440
to come off!

329
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,880
Come off!

330
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,799
I'm going off to take a look!

331
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,640
It's OK.

332
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,599
Don't worry. Sit tight!

333
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,759
Do you hear me! Come off right now!

334
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,480
Brother!

335
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,519
It's all fine now.

336
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,920
OK. Get off and take a look.

337
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,640
He wanted a fight and got beaten up.

338
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,480
Young Master!

339
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:48,920
Young Master, please help me!

340
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,680
Don't come to me! Go away!

341
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,119
I don't even know you.

342
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,559
Young Master!

343
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,119
Shut up!

344
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,960
Do you know them?

345
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,039
No, do you?

346
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,680
Me neither!

347
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,720
Neither of us know him.

348
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,720
Young Master!

349
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,960
Shut up! I'm not your master!

350
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
I don't even know who you are.

351
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,720
Why the heck do you take me as your master?

352
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,039
The tie between me and my brother
is tighter than anything else.

353
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,480
Don't you try to

354
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,519
alienate us.

355
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,480
Your Majesty,

356
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:33,240
Fan Xian and the legitimate son of Earl Sinan were together.

357
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,359
They should have gone to the Yishi House.

358
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,000
And

359
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,920
the men of the Crown Prince

360
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,559
are keeping an eye on the whereabouts of Fan Xian.

361
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:47,720
Apart from that,

362
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,279
the hangers of the second prince the hangers of the second prince

363
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,039
are hunting him secretly.

364
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,759
Fan Xian has no title.

365
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,519
Shall we protect him?

366
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,079
After all, he is taking over Neiku.

367
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,680
and a talent nominated by you.

368
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,440
How many fish are there in this pond?

369
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,640
Eh...

370
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,039
It's hard to tell with naked eyes.

371
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,319
You can't tell as the water is too deep, right?

372
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,079
How about now?

373
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:23,960
The bait in your hands

374
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
is Fan Xian.

375
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,400
This pool of water is the capital city.

376
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,079
And the fish...

377
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,119
They are the common people.

378
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,160
Thanks for coming, gentlemen!

379
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,039
Find a place for the carriage first.

380
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,039
We will wait for you upstairs.

381
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,640
Sure!

382
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
This Yishi House

383
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,640
is a famous house in the capital city.

384
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,400
It's very special.

385
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,759
Since Sizhe will treat us,

386
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,680
then this is it!

387
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:00,640
Sister,

388
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:03,759
isn't this a bit too expensive

389
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,799
for me?

390
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,039
You wanted to be the host yourself.

391
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,119
No one forced you.

392
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,759
Brother, let's get inside.

393
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,759
Let's go and check out what to eat.

394
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:12,640
Any books?

395
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:13,920
What?

396
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,039
Any books?

397
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,160
Forbidden books!

398
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:17,759
This sounds so familiar.

399
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,720
Do you also sell discs?

400
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,720
What do you mean?

401
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:21,680
I'm only selling books.

402
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,279
Do you need any?

403
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:25,000
I need to take a look first.

404
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:29,799
Red Mansions!

405
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,000
It really is!

406
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,079
This book

407
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,839
is a real masterpiece.

408
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
It just got leaked on the streets.

409
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,759
Eight taels of silver for a scroll. No bargaining.

410
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:37,640
How much again?

411
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,359
Eight taels of silver each scroll.

412
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:41,960
Do you want it?

413
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,240
What if I want a lot?

414
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:46,279
You don't seem to carry many with you.

415
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:49,880
If you really want,

416
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,039
follow me to the rear alley.

417
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Wait for me upstairs.

418
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:54,519
Are you serious?

419
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,039
Please take the lead!

420
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,039
Brother!

421
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,079
Sister, look at him.

422
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,119
How disgraceful!

423
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,799
You can't understand it!

424
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,160
That book is written by brother!

425
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,079
By him?

426
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,319
How far is it?

427
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,240
Close!

428
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,000
You must bargain by yourself when it comes.

429
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,079
Not with you?

430
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,400
You bargain directly with the boss

431
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,720
since you buy a lot.

432
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,559
The books belong to the boss.

433
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:24,559
Right there.

434
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:27,839
Remember! If the imperial officials come,

435
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:28,640
you must leave without hesitation.

436
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,559
So many people

437
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,599
take books from him?

438
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,680
Yeah! You gotta bargain on your own.

439
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:34,519
I need to get back to the street.

440
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,960
Do you need the book or not?

441
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,839
Thank you!

442
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,839
Can you give me one for free?

443
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:45,880
Just one!

444
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,880
Remember to run if you see the imperial officials.

445
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,240
Go! Go!

446
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,839
But don't run to me!

447
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,480
Are all these books yours?

448
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,599
How many do you want?

449
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,839
Mr. Fan!

450
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:09,960
Wang Qinian!

451
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,400
First books, then maps!

452
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,960
You are monopolizing

453
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,000
the literature industry.

454
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,160
What is literature industry?

455
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,039
Shall we talk about the map first?

456
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,240
Mr. Fan, how about...

457
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,640
I'm willing to pay ten times as much

458
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,359
for the map.

459
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,640
That's delightful!

460
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,839
I always have the courage

461
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:28,000
to take the blame for what I did

462
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,079
and behave myself neatly.

463
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:32,880
Please look back.

464
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,160
What's there to look?

465
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,960
Run so fast!

466
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,640
I don't know when the Young Master

467
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:56,920
will come back either.

468
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,000
OK.

469
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:04,799
My Lady, I checked.

470
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,640
Fan Xian is not home.

471
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:11,559
Where did he go?

472
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,240
It seems he went to the house.

473
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,240
What a merrymaker!

474
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,160
Are you alright?

475
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,359
It shall be fine

476
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,720
to put forward the cancellation of marriage contract

477
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,839
in front of Mrs. Liu in the residence.

478
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,200
His Majesty finalized my marriage

479
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,839
without my consent.

480
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,440
I'm not happy with it.

481
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,839
Don't do to others what you don't want yourself.

482
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,640
Even if I want it to be cancelled,

483
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,799
I should look him in the eyes

484
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,079
and tell him.

485
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:53,759
I surely will help you.

486
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,160
I'm so weak physically

487
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,319
and yet so stubborn.

488
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,279
Thank you for helping me.

489
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:06,640
How stupid you are!

490
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,000
Guess who is the book trafficker?

491
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:16,880
Who is it?

492
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,680
Wang Qinian!

493
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:18,880
Where is he?

494
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,519
He ran away in a flash!

495
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,079
This book is widely spread

496
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:23,880
among the girls of each household.

497
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,559
We don't know how it got leaked.

498
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,079
Brother, it's all my fault.

499
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:28,799
I'm fine!

500
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,279
Books are meant to be read by people.

501
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,519
What are you looking at?

502
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,079
So many book dealers!

503
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,640
Take a look!

504
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,319
It's the same!

505
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:42,960
Please take a look!

506
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:43,519
Sure!

507
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,319
This is the most popular book

508
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,119
on the street now.

509
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,279
Do you need one?

510
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,440
Why do so many people

511
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,200
carry babies?

512
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,119
Wang Qinian is remarkable.

513
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,240
He is the friend of women.

514
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:53,960
Fan Xian,

515
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,079
did you really write this book?

516
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,640
No!

517
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,880
It is the Red Mansions of Cao Xueqin.

518
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,559
Brother, don't hold it back.

519
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,079
There is no such person in the world.

520
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,519
It is really not me.

521
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,240
This book is a masterpiece.

522
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,319
How can I steal the honor of it

523
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,000
by claiming to be the writer?

524
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,119
What I did is only

525
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,400
to write it from memory.

526
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,240
In a word,

527
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,519
are you the only one

528
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,319
who knows the story thereafter?

529
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,000
Why do you ask?

530
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,079
Fan Xian, we can take over

531
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,720
the book trafficking business.

532
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,440
Fan Sizhe,

533
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,119
stop messing around!

534
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,480
No, sister!

535
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,640
I observed very carefully just now.

536
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,559
A lot of people buy this book.

537
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,720
Eight taels of silver for one scroll.

538
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,599
Look at this book!

539
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,000
It has mediocre quality.

540
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,279
The cost is no more than three qian and two fen

541
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:36,720
for platemaking and printing,

542
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,759
excluding manpower.

543
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,200
So we can make a profit of

544
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,400
seven taels six qian and eight fen

545
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,880
with the sales of each book.

546
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,119
About eight to nine books were sold

547
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,160
in such a short while.

548
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,200
If we spread the network,

549
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,880
hundreds of them can be sold in a day.

550
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,480
With the sales

551
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,519
of a hundred books,

552
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,319
we can make

553
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,519
768 taels of silver.

554
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,480
If we hold a good control of time

555
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:52,839
and publish one scroll for every 15 days,

556
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:53,400
that will be

557
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,000
11,520 taels of silver.

558
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,319
If we take out the cost for manpower and network

559
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,359
which should be enough for three fen,

560
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,119
we can still make

561
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:59,039
8,064 taels of silver

562
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,519
as pure profit.

563
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,039
If you publish 12 scrolls,

564
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,559
that will be

565
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,960
96,768 taels of silver.

566
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,440
This is just a rough estimation.

567
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,000
It's so lucrative, Fan Xian!

568
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,559
What do you call him?

569
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:10,160
Brother! My most beloved brother!

570
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,519
As long as you give me this business,

571
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:12,319
I can call you uncle

572
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,000
if you want me to,

573
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,279
let alone brother.

574
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,200
What do you think?

575
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:16,839
Let's do this together.

576
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,079
You publish the book. I will take care of the network of shops.

577
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:18,839
And then we split the profit 40/60.

578
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:19,920
You get 60 and I get 40.

579
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,240
You can get

580
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:22,680
4,838.4 taels of silver

581
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,160
for every 15 days.

582
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:24,960
What do you think?

583
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:27,200
How did you get all these numbers?

584
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:30,920
Do I even need to calculate?

585
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:32,960
It's so simple.

586
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,680
Get out of the way!

587
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:36,279
Get out of the way, all of you!

588
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:37,279
Stop selling!

589
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,400
Get out of the way!

590
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,480
Who allows you to sell this? Go away!

591
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,839
This is forbidden now. Get out of the way!

592
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,000
What's going on here?

593
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:45,039
Who allows you to sell it?

594
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,400
Go away!

595
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:55,000
Sir, they are all gone now!

596
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,519
This guy is Guo Baokun,

597
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:10,880
He is the son of the Minister of the Board of Rites

598
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,000
What is he doing?

599
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,519
It was he who persecuted your family?

600
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:15,480
Yes!

601
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,000
Don't you want to beat him up?

602
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:18,559
I've got only one life now.

603
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,319
I can't run the risk.

604
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,440
Folks,

605
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,759
I am Guo Baokun!

606
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,200
My father is the Minister of the Board of Rites.

607
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,640
I am too humble to be blessed

608
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,519
with the position of an editor in the palace.

609
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,839
I attended school ever since I was young.

610
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,799
I know rites.

611
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,680
As you are all intellectuals,

612
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,599
you should read the sages and men of virtues.

613
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,880
It's such a shame to read filthy book

614
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,200
like this.

615
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,279
In my opinion,

616
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,039
this book should be banned from today onwards.

617
00:28:57,799 --> 00:28:58,640
That's bullshit!

618
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,160
Guo Baokun, you're talking non-sense.

619
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,039
Who is talking to me like this?

620
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,240
Your grandpa!

621
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,559
Who is Guo Baokun close to?

622
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,200
He used to be the reading partner for Eastern Palace.

623
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,720
We can take him as on the Crown Prince's side.

624
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,279
It's the Crown Prince again!

625
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,480
He's involved again!

626
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,240
He has been looking towards me

627
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,160
while he was talking just now.

628
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,599
He knows that I am here.

629
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:21,480
Now that he is against you,

630
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,799
why would he become so agitated?

631
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:24,440
That's right!

632
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,359
Fan Sizhe and Guo Baokun are enemies?

633
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,759
I haven't heard of that before.

634
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:30,000
Hey! Stop messing around!

635
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,400
This book is so popular.

636
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,839
It means

637
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:39,720
it's a good book.

638
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,519
You want to ban a good book.

639
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:43,000
What's your title?

640
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,400
Editor in the palace.

641
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,680
That's a small enough title

642
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,440
to even step into the imperial office.

643
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,319
I know who the heck you are.

644
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,200
What a dumbass!

645
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,880
You are the dumbass!

646
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,240
Your dad is the Minister of dumbasses!

647
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,039
-Mr. Guo, please calm down! -How dare you!

648
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,599
I've heard you are outstanding in terms of eloquence

649
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,039
and family knowledge.

650
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,559
I didn't believe it at the start.

651
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,359
Now I see you

652
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,920
defend the honor for scholars

653
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,279
in the world.

654
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,079
It's so admirable!

655
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,000
He Zongwei is well-known as a scholar

656
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,160
in the capital city.

657
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,519
It looks like he has found a wise master.

658
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,000
I've known you well

659
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:23,759
by your reputation as a talent.

660
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,240
I feel flattered

661
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,640
and regretful to it.

662
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,440
That's all bullshit.

663
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,720
like this.

664
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,759
This guy is the son of Earl Sinan.

665
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,400
Earl Sinan is in charge of the Ministry of the Revenue

666
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,079
which has all the silvers.

667
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,720
So definitely his son will be superficial.

668
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,160
How dare you insult my dad!

669
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:42,680
I...

670
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:45,519
It's fine.

671
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,880
Guo Baokun won't recognize me.

672
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,279
But his subordinates may recognize you.

673
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:48,920
Don't reveal yourself.

674
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,599
What do we do then

675
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,039
other than watching him bullied?

676
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,640
Let me go!

677
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,319
After all, I'm your dad's colleague in the palace.

678
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,160
Kowtow to me for forgiveness,

679
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,799
and I'll forgive you this time

680
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:01,680
for the sake of your dad.

681
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,519
I won't apologize to a pig!

682
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,920
Throw this dumbass harder!

683
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,720
So here comes the bastard

684
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,359
that Earl Sinan raised in Danzhou.

685
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,519
Hi, Lady Ruoruo!

686
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,039
What a talent you are!

687
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,200
But it's such a pity

688
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,079
that you have these rubbish

689
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,240
as brothers.

690
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:48,880
I'm afraid you made a mistake.

691
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,960
I'm just a passer-by.

692
00:31:51,319 --> 00:31:51,880
What?

693
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,039
Do you feel ashamed?

694
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:55,920
Fan Xian,

695
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,079
How come you're afraid

696
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:57,880
to admit your own identity?

697
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,240
I really don't expect you

698
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,359
to admire me so much!

699
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:02,640
That's bullshit!

700
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,119
Of course no!

701
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:05,799
I just came here from the capital city yesterday.

702
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,920
Today is my first day out.

703
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,440
I barely recognize all my family

704
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,119
before you recognize me with one blink of an eye.

705
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,440
You even memorize my name so clearly.

706
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:13,480
Is it because you admire me for long?

707
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,200
You...

708
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
You may keep silent if you can't think of any words to say.

709
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,599
It looks embarrassing to me.

710
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,839
Let's get back to where we were.

711
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,319
If I hadn't come down to help,

712
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,480
one of his arms would have been broken by now.

713
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,920
Yeah, so what?

714
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,920
What are you waiting for?

715
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,960
Come on!

716
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,279
He is nothing but a bastard.

717
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,200
Nothing to be afraid!

718
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,680
You wanted to break his arm.

719
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,519
I'd break your nose in return.

720
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:41,839
That's a fair treatment.

721
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,839
Countryside rubbish!

722
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,839
Arrogant and overweening.

723
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,079
Why do you look at me?

724
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,200
Just do it!

725
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,279
You have me at your back.

726
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,680
Overbearing Vitality Qi.

727
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:13,960
Well done!

728
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,079
What do you want to do?

729
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,119
Beat him up!

730
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,319
Did you just say

731
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,039
this is filthy book?

732
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,119
Yes, I did. So what?

733
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,079
Have you read it?

734
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,160
I don't even have enough time to read books from the sages.

735
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,720
How can I have time to read this stuff?

736
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:42,880
How about you?

737
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,920
I was too afraid it will stain my eyes.

738
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,000
An insult

739
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,440
based on nothing.

740
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,079
The writer of this book is obscure.

741
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,279
What good word could he produce?

742
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,160
Do you read his book

743
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:54,960
or his fame?

744
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,359
If a writer is not famous,

745
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,519
can't he produce any good works?

746
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,119
Without learning, one cannot increase his knowledge.

747
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:00,119
Without indomitable will, one cannot finish his studies.

748
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,279
You're too short-sighted

749
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,279
to claim yourselves scholars

750
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,359
or literary figures.

751
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:06,519
You don't even have the cultivation

752
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,359
to treat others' works with respect.

753
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,920
Shame on you!

754
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,679
Damn you!

755
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,400
No countryside men like you

756
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,639
can comment on scholars

757
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,599
like us.

758
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,840
Put your tongue straight

759
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,440
before talking.

760
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,960
If all scholars in this world

761
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,800
are like you,

762
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,320
I'll feel ashamed to be one of it.

763
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,360
Well said!

764
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,519
Mr. Fan's words are classic.

765
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,400
Your Highness!

766
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,159
Your Highness!

767
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,159
Without learning, one cannot increase his knowledge.

768
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,880
Without indomitable will, one cannot finish his studies.

769
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,199
I thought about these two sentences.

770
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,679
There is a lot of meaning behind it.

771
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,480
It's one glimpse

772
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,400
of Mr. Fan's knowledge.

773
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:44,880
Your Highness!

774
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,039
don't get cheated

775
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:47,119
by this guy.

776
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,400
You two have always been famous

777
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,360
as talents.

778
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:51,159
Coincidentally,

779
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,840
there will be a poetry gathering at my residence.

780
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,639
You should come for the sake of making friends

781
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,599
through literature and cultivating yourselves through poems.

782
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,840
You can compete through poem on the poetry gathering

783
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,119
so that all the intellectuals in the world can see

784
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
who is the actual scholar.

785
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,280
What do you think?

786
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,519
I'll come for sure!

787
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,280
So will I.

788
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:12,320
Who are you?

789
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:17,039
This is Li Hongcheng,

790
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,199
Prince Jing's son.

791
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,239
Who is Prince Jing?

792
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,199
Don't say it out loud.

793
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,599
Prince Jing is the biological brother

794
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:23,519
of His Majesty.

795
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:24,920
Royal bloodline!

796
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,480
Scholarship is the origin of mankind.

797
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,960
Bloodline is not worth mentioning.

798
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,440
You've got a good attitude.

799
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:40,119
By the way,

800
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,280
will there be any girls on the poetry gathering?

801
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,960
There will be a lot of female scholars indeed.

802
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,880
Good job!

803
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,639
You pick up girl scholars

804
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,519
with sobriety.

805
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,599
What does "pick up" mean?

806
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:52,079
Then it's a deal.

807
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,159
See you tomorrow at the poetry gathering.

808
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,159
Sure! Will wait you for it.

809
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,239
Li Hongcheng, Prince Jing's son,

810
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,360
has a reputation among the masses.

811
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,639
He likes literature and poetry gathering.

812
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:12,159
Scholars from different schools join it.

813
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:14,119
Disciples of the prince and Prince Jing's son

814
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,039
showed up one after another.

815
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,639
He is there to wait for me.

816
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:21,000
Don't think too much.

817
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,400
He is Prince Jing's son.

818
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,920
Why would he wait for you?

819
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,280
Besides,

820
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,079
who could predict that

821
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:29,440
you're going to Yishi House today?

822
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,719
It's very easy to find the destination

823
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:31,920
by following the carriage.

824
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,920
So he sent someone

825
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,199
to wait for you at the gate of our home

826
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:37,559
just to meet you

827
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:38,920
and invite you to the poetry gathering?

828
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,320
Is it even possible? Don't think too much.

829
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,360
More or less.

830
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,199
So what about Guo Baokun?

831
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:47,199
Guo Baokun was sent by the Crown Prince.

832
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,719
So you mean the prince wants to meet you

833
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,519
and Prince Jing's son wants to meet you too.

834
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:52,960
I didn't notice

835
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
you're such a hot potato.

836
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,079
You have to ask them about this.

837
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,559
Stop woolgathering!

838
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,360
What are you doing?

839
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,760
Why did you dash downstairs

840
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,519
just now?

841
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,679
Didn't you notice

842
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,719
he insulted your book?

843
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,400
Why would you care about it while I didn't?

844
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,679
We are going to sell the book together

845
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,840
but he tried to ban it.

846
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,239
Cutting off my road to wealth

847
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,480
is no worse than killing my parents.

848
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,679
Who promised to work with you?

849
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:19,800
Don't you think about it?

850
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,800
It's lucrative!

851
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,440
You're really quick at calculating.

852
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,360
Just so so.

853
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,920
That doesn't matter.

854
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,719
Think about it carefully.

855
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,079
Shall we work together?

856
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,400
Why do you want to sell books?

857
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,559
To make money,

858
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:35,360
of course.

859
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,639
Why do you want to make money?

860
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,559
What do you mean?

861
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,280
Do you plan to buy something expensive

862
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,119
with the money you make

863
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,960
or to go to the casino or the brothel?

864
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,039
I haven't thought about those.

865
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:47,239
I just enjoy making money.

866
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:52,119
Don't look at me like that.

867
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,960
Do you agree?

868
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,960
You must do me a favor.

869
00:37:59,079 --> 00:37:59,760
What is it?

870
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,639
No one is here. You could get off.

871
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,760
What do you mean?

872
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,760
Take the carriage back to the residence directly

873
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,280
and don't let anyone know

874
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,920
I have left.

875
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,039
Where are you going?

876
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,719
Stop asking, or I'll not let you sell my book.

877
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,039
It's pointless to threaten me.

878
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,639
My sister is here.

879
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,440
She is most afraid to lie.

880
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:32,400
She can't help you for sure.

881
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,000
Am I right, sister?

882
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:34,719
Just go, brother!

883
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,280
Don't worry. I'll watch over him

884
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:37,480
and stop him from leaking.

885
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,239
Eh...

886
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,440
Don't leak!

887
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:47,679
The way you treat me

888
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,239
is totally different from the way

889
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,159
you treat him.

890
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,760
Turn left at the entrance of the alley

891
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,760
and go east all the way to Tianhe street.

892
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,119
You'll find the Investigator's Office.

893
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,039
The files of your family whereabouts

894
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,079
is D No. 534,

895
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:01,559
right?

896
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,199
For sure,

897
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,280
Wait for my good news.

898
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:03,800
Thanks!

899
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,639
Think about where to open

900
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:12,920
the book shop.

901
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:13,719
We'll discuss it when I come back.

902
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:15,800
So you agree with it?

903
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,880
Don't let anyone see you.

904
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:22,079
Hooray!

905
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,960
Hawthorn on sticks!

906
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,639
Hawthorn on sticks!

907
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,159
Hawthorn on sticks!

908
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:37,920
Sure, sir!

909
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,679
Hawthorn on sticks!

910
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,960
Hawthorn on sticks!

911
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,119
Gotta pick the store for printing.

912
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:48,119
And the paper as well.

913
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,599
All the illegal books

914
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
out there

915
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,719
must be collected,

916
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:52,800
or they will have a bad impact on my sales.

917
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:53,960
All these must be taken into consideration

918
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,000
and get prepared.

919
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,519
Did we reach already?

920
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,039
We are stuck.

921
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,360
Let's retreat and make way for them.

922
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,159
Sure!

923
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,920
Miss Fan, hold on a second!

924
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,280
It's the carriage from the Fan mansion.

925
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,400
I just saw Fan Ruoruo.

926
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
The servant of the Fan mansion just said

927
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,920
they left together.

928
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
So Fan Xian must be

929
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,239
on that carriage.

930
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,800
I'll get off to talk with him.

931
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:30,280
You're coughing more seriously today.

932
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,039
You can't afford to catch a cold.

933
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,880
I'll ask him over.

934
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,159
Lady Ye,

935
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,800
long time no see.

936
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:45,880
How are you recently?

937
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,920
I heard that your brother in Danzhou

938
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,960
has arrived in the capital city recently.

939
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,679
I wonder if he's on that carriage right now.

940
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,280
Lady Ye,

941
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,639
why do you want to see my elder brother?

942
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,000
Young Mater Fan, Princess Lin would like

943
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,079
to see you.

944
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,800
Is he insane?

945
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,559
Quiet! Quiet!

946
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,079
Let's go! Let's go!

947
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,519
Ye Ling'er, don't be silly!

948
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,840
Distinguished as Princess Lin,

949
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,800
how can she meet my elder brother in private?

950
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,039
Who's being silly? I'm...

951
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,679
Lady Ruoruo,

952
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,840
I want to talk with Mr. Fan.

953
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,480
Just a few words.

954
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,239
It won't take long.

955
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,559
Just put the curtain down.

956
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,559
You can't catch a cold.

957
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,280
To tell you the truth.

958
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,920
My brother caught a cold recently.

959
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,960
And he's not recovered yet.

960
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,280
Why don't we go back early today

961
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,639
and talk another day?

962
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,480
Mr. Fan, I beg your pardon.

963
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,920
You're sick.

964
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,599
I shouldn't interrupt you.

965
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,159
But I must talk to you face to face

966
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,440
to set things straight.

967
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,079
Only a few words. Please get off and talk with me.

968
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,280
Mr. Fan!

969
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,000
Sister asked me to keep quiet.

970
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:44,679
But if I do so,

971
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:45,480
they'll find out that Fan Xian is not here.

972
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:47,480
What if Fan Xian gets angry

973
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,280
and stops me from selling the books?

974
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,760
I can't lose

975
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,800
my money!

976
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,840
Your Highness?

977
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,280
Sorry to interrupt.

978
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,119
Whatever you want to say,

979
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,320
let's talk next time.

980
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:11,559
Just a few words. It won't take long.

981
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,199
It's not convenient now.

982
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,360
Not convenient?

983
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:20,119
I met a singing girl

984
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,400
when drinking

985
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,960
a moment ago.

986
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,079
Now

987
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,400
she's on my carriage.

988
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,440
Princess, how about coming to my mansion

989
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:31,079
for a detailed discussion later?

990
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,800
Fan Xian!

991
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:35,360
How dare you!

992
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,360
I'm gonna kick your ass!

993
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:40,119
Ye Ling'er!

994
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,440
Sorry for the interruption.

995
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:03,800
Let's go!

996
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,639
Excuse me!

997
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,440
Excuse me!

998
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:53,199
Excuse me!

999
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,719
I'm Director-General of the Investigator's Office,

1000
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,880
and the student of Master Fei as well.

1001
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:04,159
Will anyone talk to me?

1002
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:10,760
The texture is correct.

1003
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:13,360
The stamp is correct.

1004
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:16,559
The pattern matches. It's real.

1005
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:19,880
Director-General, nice to meet you.

1006
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:21,440
Your Excellency!

1007
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,519
Master Fei is not in the capital now.

1008
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,400
I know.

1009
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,119
I'm here for a file.

1010
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,079
D No. 534.

1011
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,840
Your Excellency, please come with me.

1012
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:37,760
Who is it?

1013
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,679
Wang Qinian!

1014
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:40,599
Mr. Fan!

1015
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,320
You can leave. We'd like to talk in private.

1016
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,400
Mr. Wang, all these files

1017
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,800
are managed by you!

1018
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,880
You're really something!

1019
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:57,559
I'm just a clerk. It's no big deal.

1020
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,719
Busy as you are,

1021
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,599
how do you squeeze time to draw maps and sell books?

1022
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:06,480
Mr. Fan!

1023
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:09,079
how can you enter

1024
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:10,079
the Investigation's Office?

1025
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:15,119
I've got a Director-General token here.

1026
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:16,119
Check it for me.

1027
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:17,360
I don't know whether it's true or not.

1028
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,119
Your Excellency!

1029
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:26,719
What are you doing?

1030
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,280
I know that

1031
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,960
I'm morally defected.

1032
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,920
Not only have I failed the masses,

1033
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,000
but I've failed Your Majesty.

1034
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:41,400
But I accumulate wealth in private

1035
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,039
only because terrible things

1036
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,440
have happened to our family.

1037
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,199
I'm really helpless.

1038
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,360
Just get up.

1039
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,440
I didn't ask you to kneel down.

1040
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:53,920
Your Excellency!

1041
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,159
My wife

1042
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,800
died early,

1043
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,199
only to leave a daughter

1044
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,000
in my care.

1045
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,760
My daughter

1046
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,119
also got an incurable disease.

1047
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:09,280
Countless expensive medicines

1048
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,760
were used,

1049
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,920
but nothing worked.

1050
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,840
Just a few days ago,

1051
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,119
My daughter

1052
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,480
also left me.

1053
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:22,639
Your Excellency!

1054
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,760
I've spent every penny

1055
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,280
to treat my wife and daughter.

1056
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,119
Now

1057
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:32,639
I sell maps and books,

1058
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:36,280
only to save money

1059
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:40,480
to bury my daughter.

1060
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,159
I see.

1061
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:44,920
Just get up.

1062
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,039
I'm so frightened.

1063
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:52,280
I feel so ashamed.

1064
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:56,320
Get up! Get up!

1065
00:47:58,199 --> 00:47:58,599
Come on!

1066
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:06,079
Well, Wang.

1067
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:07,519
I ran into you wife

1068
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:08,320
on the street a moment ago.

1069
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,559
She asked you to buy vegetables only

1070
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:10,440
when you go back.

1071
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:11,599
She said your daughter

1072
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:12,760
doesn't feel well after eating too much meat recently.

1073
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,719
She can only eat vegetables for a few days.

1074
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:15,480
She also mentioned that
your daughter caught a cold last night.

1075
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:17,159
She asked you to buy
some medicine on your way home.

1076
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,559
My sincere feelings must have moved the God,

1077
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,679
so my wife and daughter

1078
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:29,159
are brought back to life!

1079
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,000
What else do you want to say?

1080
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,760
Your Excellency, look!

1081
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:54,440
The sugar-coated haws

1082
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:56,079
are so red and beautifully shaped.

1083
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,239
They're definitely yummy.

1084
00:48:57,679 --> 00:48:59,039
Only such sugar-coated haws

1085
00:48:59,199 --> 00:48:59,800
can match a charming young man

1086
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,400
like you.

1087
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,159
Just take it!

1088
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:03,360
Thank you, Your Excellency!

1089
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,039
Is it really worth it?

1090
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,320
For only two taels of silver,

1091
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,920
you actually cursed your wife and daughter to death.

1092
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:13,360
They are in good health.

1093
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,239
A few bad words won't hurt them.

1094
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,920
You're so greedy.

1095
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,079
Aren't you afraid it might ruin your reputation?

1096
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,000
Your Excellency!

1097
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:20,480
Reputation means nothing

1098
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,039
to me.

1099
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,119
Money, to me,

1100
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:25,840
is more important than my life.

1101
00:49:26,679 --> 00:49:29,159
This is what I believe

1102
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,599
all along.

1103
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,119
You might actually

1104
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:34,199
get along with my younger brother.

1105
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:34,880
How about this?

1106
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:37,679
You don't have to give me back the two taels of silver.

1107
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:40,119
You are so generous.

1108
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,119
But you must

1109
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:42,800
stop selling books.

1110
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,440
Because I'm going to sell books.

1111
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:45,599
What do you say?

1112
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,239
I'll do it.

1113
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:54,599
OK. Let's get down to business.

1114
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,039
I'm here this time

1115
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:57,320
for two things.

1116
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,440
One is that

1117
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,360
I want to see

1118
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,679
File D No. 534.

1119
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:02,159
Your Excellency!

1120
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,440
This file is about

1121
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:07,320
Teng Zijing of the Fourth Division.

1122
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,840
You're actually good at your work.

1123
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:10,679
But

1124
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:13,800
Teng Zijing is dead.

1125
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,400
I know.

1126
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:15,719
I killed him.

1127
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:19,679
Can I have the file now?

1128
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,320
Your Excellency!

1129
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:25,519
There are many files

1130
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:26,800
in the D section.

1131
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,639
It takes time

1132
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,239
to find it.

1133
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:29,920
How about this?

1134
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,800
I'll find it first.

1135
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,840
Then tomorrow,

1136
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:35,039
I'll deliver it to your mansion in person.

1137
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:35,719
Is it OK?

1138
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,199
Fine.

1139
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:40,199
There's one more thing.

1140
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,000
My teacher told me something.

1141
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:43,840
When you arrive in the capital city,

1142
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,519
do visit the Investigator's Office.

1143
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:47,679
There's a stele there.

1144
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:49,599
Have a look at it.

1145
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:51,199
What stele?

1146
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,320
Don't you always want to know

1147
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,760
things about your mother.

1148
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,239
After seeing that stele,

1149
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,199
you'll get to know her.

1150
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,719
Where's the stele

1151
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,800
he has mentioned?

1152
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:07,039
There's only one stele here.

1153
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,360
It's outside the front door.

1154
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,559
Outside?

1155
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,360
According to the Head,

1156
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:14,800
the stele inscriptions show the original intention of

1157
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,760
establishing the Investigator's Office.

1158
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:17,519
OK. I'll check that out.

1159
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:18,519
You can go back.

1160
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,280
I hope that laws of Nanqing

1161
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,199
are made for the common people.

1162
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,519
The noble shall not be tolerated,

1163
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,039
and the poor shall not be suppressed.

1164
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,480
No people shall be wronged,

1165
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:46,880
and no sin shall be imposed.

1166
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,559
Practice the law is like wielding a sword.

1167
00:51:51,719 --> 00:51:52,880
wipe out demons and monsters

1168
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,599
without asking the God for help.

1169
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,000
I hope that the people of Nanqing

1170
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,960
seek truth,

1171
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,280
know etiquette and remain kind.

1172
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:09,280
Never measure success by wealth.

1173
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,519
Never yield to power and influence.

1174
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,679
Pity the weak and detest injustice.

1175
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:18,440
Hold strong beliefs in difficult times.

1176
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,639
Introspect often when no one's watching.

1177
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,039
I hope there's no suppression

1178
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,079
and constraint in the world.

1179
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,119
Anyone born to the world

1180
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:42,360
has the right to live,

1181
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,719
feel free

1182
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,559
and be happy.

1183
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,239
I hope that one day,

1184
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:09,800
all man are born equal

1185
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,159
with no distinction of nobleness and lowliness.

1186
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:14,880
Guarding life

1187
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,440
and pursuing light,

1188
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:18,639
that's what I want.

1189
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,840
However difficult it might be,

1190
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,480
I'll move forward fearlessly.

1191
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:24,920
Men are born equal.

1192
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,639
Everyone is his own master.

1193
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:03,199
Your Majesty, we just got the information

1194
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,280
that Fan Xian went to the Investigator's Office secretly.

1195
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,960
He asked for a file

1196
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,079
and inquired about

1197
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:09,840
the real killer of the Danzhou assassination.

1198
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,400
He asked for file D No. 534.

1199
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,840
I had it copied and delivered.

1200
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:16,400
It's the file of Teng Zijing.

1201
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:18,119
He's a member of the Investigator's Office.

1202
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,079
He assassinated Fan Xian in Danzhou,

1203
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,159
but was killed by Fan Xian instead.

1204
00:54:22,519 --> 00:54:24,360
It's weird.

1205
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:25,840
He's dead.

1206
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:28,159
Why did Fan Xian ask for the file?

1207
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,000
He's still alive.

1208
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:32,679
But the Investigator's Office reported

1209
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,280
he was killed in Danzhou.

1210
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,239
He came back to the capital city with Fan Xian.

1211
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,199
Your Majesty, you've already known it.

1212
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,320
In that sense,

1213
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:45,719
Fan Xian has lied to Your Majesty.

1214
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,239
Most of the people

1215
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,519
have lied to me.

1216
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:51,880
Your Majesty, does that mean

1217
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:53,920
you want to carry out a thorough investigation?

1218
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,440
As long as one can get his work done,

1219
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:00,000
it's OK for him to tell some lies.

1220
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:01,760
Your Majesty,

1221
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,840
you are too merciful!

1222
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,719
Will Fan Xian attend the poetry gathering tomorrow?

1223
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:09,519
Yes, he will.

1224
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,679
What about the Eastern Palace?

1225
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,280
He's been spreading the word about

1226
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,360
how Fan Xian beat the guard
of the Guo family right on the street.

1227
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,400
Good for him.

1228
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:24,719
Your Highness!

1229
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,159
Fan Xian only beat a guard.

1230
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,199
Even if the word do spread,

1231
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:31,599
he won't be declared guilty.

1232
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,480
To him,

1233
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,880
it's no big deal.

1234
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,159
He won't be declared guilty,

1235
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:39,440
but his morality will be questioned.

1236
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:40,840
Even if the whole city

1237
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,159
knows about his misconduct,

1238
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,960
there will only be gossips.

1239
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,519
Fan Xian just came to the capital city.

1240
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:49,599
He has no connection or reputation.

1241
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,880
But Wan'er,

1242
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,400
though not announced publicly,

1243
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,239
is the Prime Minister's daughter after all.

1244
00:55:54,679 --> 00:55:56,360
If she is married to a notorious trash

1245
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,639
with no talent and morality,

1246
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,480
how embarrassed

1247
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,519
will the Prime Minister be!

1248
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:03,400
Destroy him completely.

1249
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,280
Your Highness, it's so brilliant!

1250
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,320
It's my aunt's idea.

1251
00:56:12,199 --> 00:56:13,159
But to me,

1252
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,920
it's a little bit rushed.

1253
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,559
So you're not completely for it.

1254
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,679
No need to feel struggled.

1255
00:56:23,239 --> 00:56:24,480
She wants to do me good.

1256
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:25,920
Then,

1257
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:28,519
let's see how the Prime Minister will deal with it.

1258
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,760
In your opinion,

1259
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,719
what will the Prime Minister do about the marriage?

1260
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,840
He'll ask Your Majesty to take back your order.

1261
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:44,960
Besides that,

1262
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,679
he has no other option.

1263
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:51,440
Your Majesty, the Prime Minister asks to see you.

1264
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,360
Let him in!

1265
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,840
Let the Prime Minister in!

1266
00:56:57,079 --> 00:56:58,599
Let the Prime Minister in!

1267
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:00,199
Let the Prime Minister in!

1268
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,039
Your Majesty, sorry to interrupt you.

1269
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,320
Prime Minister, please rise!

1270
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:23,000
You've done a good job.

1271
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,519
I dare not slack off
when it comes to the national affairs.

1272
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:26,840
OK.

1273
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:33,920
Do you have any other memorial?

1274
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,280
No, I don't.

1275
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,199
Then find a sedan

1276
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:39,599
to send the Prime Minister home.

1277
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,159
Yes, he will.

1278
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:41,159
Wait!

1279
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,039
Old and weak as I am,

1280
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,679
I feel tired after walking a few steps.

1281
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:49,280
May I ask for a cup of tea?

1282
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,360
Take a seat.

1283
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:54,599
Get him some tea.

1284
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1285
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:57,480
Get him some tea.

1286
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,679
Eunuch Hou.

1287
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,760
Don't you see the fire is about to go out?

1288
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:15,440
Yes, he will.

1289
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:35,400
I just

1290
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,360
got a secret report,

1291
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,760
saying that Fan Xian

1292
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,239
caused trouble again

1293
00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:42,239
in front of Yishi House.

1294
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,840
He beat the guard of the Guo family.

1295
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:46,079
Which Guo family?

1296
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:47,440
Guo Youzhi's family.

1297
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,920
I see.

1298
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:55,440
Government officials and the common people

1299
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,800
all think Fan Xian

1300
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,199
as rude and immoral.

1301
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:03,519
Prime Minister, what do you think?

1302
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,280
Well.

1303
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,800
I'm afraid it's wrong.

1304
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:17,880
Why?

1305
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:19,960
He's an ardent young man.

1306
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,639
He might cause some trouble,

1307
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,760
but it's no big deal.

1308
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,199
I firmly believe that given time,

1309
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,239
Fan Xian is sure to display his talent

1310
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,920
and make a name in the capital city.

1311
00:59:34,119 --> 00:59:35,880
You really think so?

1312
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,159
Your Majesty, I trust you.

1313
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:41,320
You are the one

1314
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:42,960
who approved their marriage.

1315
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:52,880
Insightful as you are,

1316
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:55,760
how can misjudge a man?

1317
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I heard that Fan Xian will
attend the poetry gathering

1318
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:03,800
held in King Jing's mansion.

1319
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,599
I firmly believe Your Majesty's judgment.

1320
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:11,840
Fan Xian is sure to
make his name in the capital city

1321
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,480
with his literary accomplishments.

1322
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,920
I'm actually looking forward to it

1323
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,599
after hearing your words.

1324
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,119
Stay seated! Don't get up!

1325
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,360
Prime Minister.

1326
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:25,840
Your Majesty, I've finished my tea.

1327
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,480
And I've had enough rest.

1328
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:31,760
Then feel free to leave.

1329
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:33,639
I'll see myself out

1330
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,599
if there's nothing else.

1331
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,559
Escort the Prime Minister out.

1332
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:45,039
Such a cunning fox!

1333
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,559
Your Majesty, the Prime Minister has decided to

1334
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,039
support Fan Xian, right?

1335
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:52,480
What he just meant

1336
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,599
is that

1337
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,000
Fan Xian is picked by Your Majesty.

1338
01:00:56,679 --> 01:00:58,719
If he's really morally deficient,

1339
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,079
then Your Majesty have picked the wrong man.

1340
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,599
If the marriage needs to be cancelled,

1341
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,360
then you have to bring it up.

1342
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:10,519
He's pushing me!

1343
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:19,440
I've made inquiries.

1344
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:21,159
Fan Xian was never taught

1345
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,639
by renowned masters in Danzhou.

1346
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,000
Nor did he write any poems.

1347
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,559
So the poetry gathering tomorrow

1348
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,199
is a perfect chance to suppress him.

1349
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,159
How can he

1350
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,000
write anything

1351
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,400
marvelous overnight?

1352
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,199
Once we win the poetry gathering tomorrow,

1353
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,559
we'll spread the word that

1354
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:36,800
he's rude and dumb

1355
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,719
with no morality or talent.

1356
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,239
Self-dignified as the Prime Minister is,

1357
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:40,960
he certainly won't marry Wan'er

1358
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:42,280
to such a joke like him.
