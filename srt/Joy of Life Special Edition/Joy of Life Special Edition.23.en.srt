=Episode 23=

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,480
At that time,

17
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,040
the late emperor focused on

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,519
immortality.

19
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,359
He spent lots of time and money on it

20
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,079
and finally got some clues

21
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,359
Go ahead.

22
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,840
the divine temple is in the north.

23
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,640
The late emperor sent a group of
over 1,000 people

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,519
to the north

25
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,879
for the divine temple.

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,319
It was me

27
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,319
and Ku He that led the group.

28
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,639
Ku He?

29
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,479
Even a Great Master was sent there.

30
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:14,879
At that time,

31
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,960
Ku He wasn't a Great Master yet.

32
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,520
The late emperor let him do it

33
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,879
because he's keen on the harmony
between nature and mankind,

34
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,240
and yearned to go to the divine temple.

35
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,439
Besides,

36
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:26,879
he's a member of the royal family,
anyway.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,360
So, he could serve as a supervisor.

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,280
Is Ku He a member of the royal family?

39
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,240
Speaking of that,

40
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,240
the late emperor is his elder brother.

41
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,080
No wonder the current little emperor

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:41,800
and the Empress Dowager

43
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,199
trust him so much.

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
In this case,

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,479
Ku He is also qualified for the throne.

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,120
Well, Ku He

47
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,840
is hypocritical,

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,080
but he's indifferent to politics.

49
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,599
He's not interested

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,199
in the throne.

51
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,400
Please go ahead.

52
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,879
Did you keep going north

53
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:02,840
and then find the divine temple?

54
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,000
It wasn't that easy.

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,960
We kept going north

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,159
and went by Beilao Pass,

57
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
arriving somewhere no one has ever been.

58
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,439
The wild north snowed all year round.

59
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,240
What we saw every day and night

60
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,599
was snow-covered landscape.

61
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,759
Gradually,

62
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,759
some people went blind

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,000
and some suffered from serious diseases.

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,159
Fewer and fewer people were left.

65
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,960
Accidents frequently happened
on the dangerous snow land.

66
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,919
More and more of us fell behind,

67
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,080
ran away or just died.

68
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,479
Only a few hundred people left.

69
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,879
Still later,

70
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:53,680
we lost supplies

71
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,319
and provisions.

72
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,479
Even horses were eaten.

73
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,879
At that time, we couldn't turn back.

74
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,879
We knew

75
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,039
it was impossible to go back.

76
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,840
Do you know

77
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,159
what it feels like to be truly hungry?

78
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,000
No animals.

79
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:12,879
No plants.

80
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,719
Everywhere was covered with snow.

81
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,600
You'd go crazy because of hunger.

82
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,000
Something was aroused deep in your heart

83
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,680
and it swallowed all your humanity,

84
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,120
etiquette and morality

85
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,800
little by little.

86
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,480
Then,

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,000
you became a beast.

88
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,240
Finally, only Ku He and I

89
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,160
survived.

90
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,519
Actually, our stories

91
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,480
almost had a different ending.

92
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,319
Killing each other.

93
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,199
But at that time,

94
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,040
we found Heaven was angry.

95
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,759
Maybe the divine temple was enraged

96
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,560
after knowing that we common people

97
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
tried to find it.

98
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,959
Maybe

99
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,319
it was a punishment

100
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:36,680
for what we had done.

101
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,720
The farther north we went,
the longer the night was.

102
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,040
Then one day,

103
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,959
endless darkness

104
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,279
arrived.

105
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,680
It's called polar night.

106
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,959
Why?

107
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,920
Who named it?

108
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,040
I'm just saying.

109
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,120
Go on.

110
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,800
What happened
when the polar night appeared?

111
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,360
Ku He prayed to Heaven,

112
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,600
so did I.

113
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,480
Just when we thought

114
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,920
we were dying,

115
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,759
the day

116
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,519
finally broke.

117
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:37,360
It was hope

118
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,720
that Heaven gave us.

119
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,120
It made us hang in there

120
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,839
and survive.

121
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:44,800
Then,

122
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,399
we found the divine temple.

123
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,120
It wasn't there at the beginning,

124
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,040
but it appeared suddenly.

125
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,040
I still don't understand

126
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,319
how it appeared.

127
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,439
Nor did I know

128
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,560
what on earth the divine temple is.

129
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:11,839
You found the divine temple.

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What did you see after you went in?

131
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,199
Went in?

132
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
We failed to go in.

133
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:17,199
There was a gate,

134
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,279
she would never

135
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,199
it's untouchable.

136
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,480
What do you mean by "untouchable"?

137
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,759
Do you mean
the gate drew back automatically?

138
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,959
Not exactly.

139
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,879
Let me put it this way.

140
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,360
It's like

141
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,040
the gate was there,

142
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,519
but it moved to another place

143
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,639
automatically

144
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,039
when I reached out my hand.

145
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,960
No matter how hard I forged ahead,

146
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,080
it always kept a short distance from me.

147
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,480
Only a very short distance,

148
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,639
but it's like a whole world.

149
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,759
I could never touch it.

150
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,759
Ku He said

151
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,720
it was because I was not sincere enough.

152
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,840
Then he prayed sincerely

153
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,840
before he reached out his hand.

154
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,480
Did it work?

155
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,320
He couldn't touch it either?

156
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,720
That's right,

157
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,159
but it was a different case

158
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,440
for him.

159
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,039
A hologram?

160
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,840
What?

161
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,960
A kind of optical and shadow illusion.

162
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,360
It looks real,

163
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,200
but it doesn't exist.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,519
No.

165
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,200
It was not an illusion.

166
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:39,960
It was not an illusion.

167
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,679
How could it be like this?

168
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,320
We tried a lot of ways,

169
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,799
but we just couldn't touch the gate.

170
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,440
When I tried, it was untouchable.

171
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,000
When he tried,
the divine temple disappeared.

172
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,240
How about climbing walls?

173
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,240
It was the same case.

174
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,799
The walls were untouchable too.

175
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,399
Ku He said

176
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,519
it was our destiny.

177
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,600
And then? Did you go back?

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,120
What's the point of keeping it a secret?

179
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,600
Then the gate opened.

180
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,919
Wasn't it untouchable?

181
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,480
Yes, it was.

182
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,000
How did you push it open?

183
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,759
It was opened from the inside.

184
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,440
Someone opened it from the inside?

185
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,440
That's why I said

186
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,039
my secret is about a place

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,120
and a person.

188
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,919
The place is the divine temple.

189
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,879
And the person

190
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,840
is the fairy from the temple.

191
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,240
A woman.

192
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,799
Later, she came to the human world.

193
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,279
Her name is

194
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,279
Ye Qingmei.

195
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,360
I wonder if you've heard of it.

196
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:00,960
I...

197
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,120
Her name is Ye Qingmei.

198
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,399
Ye Qingmei?

199
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,600
It means "looking down upon all men".

200
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,080
She was bound to no rules of the world.

201
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,759
She could always

202
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,120
make unexpected moves.

203
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,720
Do you know who once lived in this yard?

204
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,279
I've no idea.

205
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,440
It was an old friend of mine.

206
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,720
At that time, she just stood there.

207
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,840
I asked her

208
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,600
what flowers she wanted to plant

209
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,120
when the Investigator's Office
was just set up.

210
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,600
I'd find them

211
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,559
no matter how precious they are

212
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,519
as long as she told me.

213
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:42,080
Your mother actually was

214
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,240
unparalleled in the world.

215
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,879
What's so magical about my mom?

216
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,120
She's the guider

217
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,840
and the betrayer.

218
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,480
She's like Nuwa who repaired the heaven.

219
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,840
She's the cause of
every phenomenon on earth.

220
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,360
She's the end of finality.

221
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,759
Hi, my son.

222
00:11:58,879 --> 00:11:59,720
You didn't misread it.

223
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,480
This letter is for you.

224
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,720
Of course I've heard of it.

225
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,919
What's more,

226
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,360
she's my mom.

227
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,519
That was the first time I met her.

228
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,559
What's on your mind?

229
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:12,799
Nothing.

230
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,679
I'm quite shocked.

231
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
Because I think

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,440
Chen Pingping is overenthusiastic

233
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,440
about the divine temple

234
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,320
and Ye Qingmei.

235
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,200
Now that you know the secret,

236
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,840
Chen Pingping wouldn't kill you

237
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,039
and you may even take control of him.

238
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,320
It's also why

239
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,360
Ku He wants to kill you.

240
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,360
After being imprisoned for years,

241
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,960
I was finally set free.

242
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,559
He thinks that I may stage a comeback

243
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,759
by use of the secret.

244
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,519
It's about the divine temple anyway.

245
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,080
All beliefs in the world

246
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,559
are about the holy place.

247
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,000
Will you do that?

248
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,759
Who knows?

249
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:58,399
How about Ye Qingmei?

250
00:13:58,799 --> 00:13:59,559
Where did she go?

251
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,600
I heard she traveled around the world,

252
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,720
with

253
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,639
a blind servant.

254
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,799
She went to Dongyi Town

255
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,440
and met Si Gujian.

256
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,000
Then she went to Nanqing

257
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,480
and met Ye Liuyun.

258
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,440
She met three of the Four Great Masters.

259
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,120
During the ten years,

260
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
she stayed in Nanqing,

261
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,360
establishing firms

262
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,679
and making lots of amazing stuff.

263
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,240
She even

264
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,399
became the richest person in the world.

265
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,840
Everyone was shocked,

266
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,720
but I was not surprised at all.

267
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,559
She came from the divine temple.

268
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,639
It's normal no matter how unbelievable

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,960
things were.

270
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,720
Yeah.

271
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,960
She was just a legend.

272
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,639
But I didn't expect

273
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,519
such a fairy

274
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,000
would fall in love with a mortal

275
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,399
and finally marry into
the royal family of Nanqing.

276
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:06,960
Nanqing is astonishingly lucky.

277
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,799
It's a pity that Beiqi has no luck.

278
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,440
What did you just say?

279
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,200
Do you mean…

280
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:17,639
What's up?

281
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Do you mean Ye Qingmei

282
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,240
married into
the royal family of Nanqing?

283
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,399
Yeah.

284
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,399
Did you get it wrong?

285
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,919
Few guys

286
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
know about it in the world.

287
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:30,960
But I was

288
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,120
Head of Embroidered Uniform Guards.

289
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,279
They couldn't hide it from me.

290
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,320
Who did she marry?

291
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,600
He was a prince at that time.

292
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,879
Now,

293
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,759
he's the emperor of Nanqing.

294
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,879
Did she marry Emperor Qing?

295
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,840
That's right.

296
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,879
They didn't hold a wedding ceremony,

297
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,080
but they were actually a couple.

298
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:58,879
Ye Qingmei

299
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,399
was also pregnant

300
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,399
with his baby.

301
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:03,480
That's the last thing

302
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,919
I knew about her.

303
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,120
After that,

304
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,240
Chen Pingping traveled
thousands of miles

305
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,279
to catch me and take me to Nanqing.

306
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,720
After being imprisoned
in the Investigator's Office,

307
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,440
I knew nothing more about her.

308
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,679
I heard she died.

309
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,039
Her kid's father

310
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,960
is Emperor Qing?

311
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,840
That's right.

312
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,279
I think he's at your age.

313
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,000
I'd been imprisoned for so long,

314
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,639
so I don't know too much
about the royal family of Nanqing.

315
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,159
I'm not sure

316
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,320
which prince is that kid

317
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,200
or if there is something special
about him.

318
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,600
The capital city is not a good place.

319
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,639
The late emperor died there.

320
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,559
Your mom died there.

321
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,600
You can live longer

322
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,159
if you stay in Danzhou.

323
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,559
My mom was killed in the capital city.

324
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:06,759
Are those killers still alive?

325
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,960
I have no idea.

326
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,519
We've received an imperial decree to
summon you into the imperial palace.

327
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,839
I see.

328
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,160
This is the truth hidden

329
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,920
by Chen Pingping and Fan Jian.

330
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,880
This is why they kept me away from

331
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,519
the capital city for so many years.

332
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,319
I don't belong to the Fan family.

333
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm the son of Emperor Qing.

334
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,160
I'm a prince.

335
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,839
His blood is running

336
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,920
in my veins.

337
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,079
I'm a bit tired and need a rest.

338
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,559
Finish it by yourselves.

339
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,720
You don't have to kneel down

340
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,759
if you don't feel like it.

341
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,400
This is different from the palace.

342
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:55,680
We're
in the monarch-subject relationship

343
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,160
in palace,

344
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,880
What's the difference?

345
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:01,920
Come back alive.

346
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,559
Knowing so many things

347
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,960
all at once

348
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,839
and knowing your true identity
all of a sudden,

349
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,799
it can be hard to accept.

350
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,799
It's fine

351
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,640
as long as you know

352
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,400
you're a descendent of the Xiao family.

353
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,880
I feel so relaxed

354
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
after telling the secret

355
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,799
kept for so long.

356
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,680
But next, the burden

357
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,000
is on you.

358
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:43,559
You'd better stop talking.

359
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,039
I'm dying.

360
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,359
What's the difference?

361
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,000
It's so dim in the cave.

362
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,759
Having been locked up for so many years,

363
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,400
I don't like it here.

364
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,960
The scenery

365
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,440
is so good here.

366
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,559
Don't let Ku He know

367
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,720
I told you everything.

368
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,960
I see.

369
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,519
Otherwise, he'll kill me instead.

370
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,440
you should visit Zhuang Mohan
when you're free.

371
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,400
Inform him of my death.

372
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,240
I will.

373
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:52,559
What else can I do for you?

374
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,920
After I die, let me sit here.

375
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,079
Don't bury me.

376
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,200
I don't want

377
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,680
to be buried under the ground
ever again.

378
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,480
OK.

379
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,319
No need to avenge my death.

380
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,960
Don't provoke Chen Pingping.

381
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,960
Bury everything deep in your heart,

382
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,480
and live a happy life.

383
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,039
I know.

384
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,720
Tell me.

385
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,559
Will I see them after I die?

386
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,920
See whom?

387
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,480
Ye Qingmei,

388
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:36,200
and your son?

389
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,720
Yes.

390
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:56,519
You will see them.

391
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,119
So it's for the divine temple.

392
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,640
The secret of Xiao En

393
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,920
is the divine temple.

394
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,240
Wuzhu lost his memory.

395
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:05,759
The only hope

396
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:08,119
to find the divine temple is Xiao En.

397
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,319
He remained silent for years of torture.

398
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,480
Will he really tell Fan Xian?

399
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:14,759
He will as long as he believes that

400
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,400
Fan Xian is his grandson.

401
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,400
That's why for so many years,

402
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,200
you didn't allow me to bring Fan Xian

403
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,119
to the capital city.

404
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,359
Firstly, I wanted to keep Fan Xian safe.

405
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:26,960
Secondly,

406
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:28,759
I was waiting for the perfect chance.

407
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,799
To have Xiao En leave
the Investigator's Office

408
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:32,960
and meet Fan Xian,

409
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,759
everything should make sense.

410
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,319
No trace of manipulation shall be found.

411
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:39,720
Right.

412
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,079
The timing
before the two countries started a war

413
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,319
was the best chance.

414
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,920
When the war ended, win or lose,

415
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,839
Shangshan Hu and Zhuang Mohan

416
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,640
would request to get Xiao En back.

417
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,559
So Fan Xian came to the capital city.

418
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,960
No wonder you left the capital city

419
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,079
on purpose.

420
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:09,680
I thought

421
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,240
I finally found the chance

422
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,599
to bring him to the capital city.

423
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:14,640
Actually,

424
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,200
it was arranged by you.

425
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
His Majesty picked the timing.

426
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,279
Was the Danzhou assassination

427
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,759
also planned by His Majesty?

428
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,559
Li Yunrui started the assassination.

429
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,279
I just made use of the opportunity.

430
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,400
What if Fan Xian was assassinated?

431
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:37,559
Have you ever thought about it?

432
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:40,079
The Sixth Division
is in charge of assassination.

433
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,559
Why was the task given to

434
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:43,880
Teng Zijing of the Fourth Division?

435
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:52,920
That's because one month before that,

436
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,240
I had sent away all the officials of

437
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,960
the Investigator's Office

438
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,720
around Danzhou,

439
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,480
and Teng Zijing of the Fourth Division
was the only one left.

440
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,319
Only he

441
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,920
could fulfill the task.

442
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,799
Was he also

443
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:08,519
picked by you in advance?

444
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,279
The officials from the Sixth Division

445
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:13,480
are hard-heartened.

446
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,640
They would definitely kill Fan Xian
if they took the secret order.

447
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:18,519
Whatever Fan Xian might say,

448
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,519
they wouldn't explain.

449
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,240
In the Investigator's Office,

450
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,680
only a few are chivalrous

451
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,119
and dare to defy the authority.

452
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:36,839
So Teng Zijing

453
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,519
was one of them.

454
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:45,759
Teng Zijing

455
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,400
was picked by His Majesty.

456
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,240
I thought you've

457
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:13,880
forgotten me.

458
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,559
What are you reading?

459
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,720
Stories of Beiqi.

460
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,240
Now that I'm here,

461
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,240
I'd better have further understanding

462
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,400
on the customs here.

463
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:29,720
You're different than before.

464
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,440
What can I do for you?

465
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,200
I do have something for you.

466
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,680
But before that,

467
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
I want to ask you a question.

468
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,400
Do you remember Teng Zijing?

469
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,279
Your guard killed

470
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,000
on the Niulan Street?

471
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,920
He had a problem with you.

472
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,680
You were splashed with dirty water
on the street,

473
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,200
and your guards hit him.

474
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,119
That's right.

475
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,240
Later, you asked Ministry of Penalty

476
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,920
to arrest Teng Zijing for assassination.

477
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,000
My butler

478
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,680
did that.

479
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,440
I only heard about it.

480
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,640
So you didn't give the order.

481
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,119
Of course I didn't.

482
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,440
How could I trouble myself

483
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,319
for a civilian?

484
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:21,119
His entire family was executed for this.

485
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,839
What a heavy sentence!

486
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,079
Neither did you add fuel to the fire
behind the back?

487
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Of course not.

488
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,160
I forgot about it the other day.

489
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:30,720
Fine.

490
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,160
After that,

491
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,000
Teng Zijing was saved
by the Investigator's Office

492
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,960
and sent away from the capital city.

493
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,200
Did you send people

494
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,039
to harass his wife and son?

495
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:41,240
What do you mean?

496
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,319
I am the son of
Minister of Board of Rites,

497
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,119
the Imperial Compiler
and the follower of the Crown Prince.

498
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,759
I have a bright future ahead.

499
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,359
Why should I do that?

500
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,319
I...

501
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,559
By doing that,

502
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:54,799
I would ruin my name, wouldn't I?

503
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,359
It was not you.

504
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:04,839
Of course not.

505
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,839
Trivial as it was,

506
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,759
I forgot it after my guards hit him.

507
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:11,599
How would I go so far
as to destroy his entire family?

508
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,000
Do you think our family

509
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,079
has no rules?

510
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,960
What a coincidence!

511
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,440
I arrived in the capital city

512
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,200
right at that time.

513
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,599
What?

514
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,519
It was all calculated

515
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,559
only for me

516
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:28,559
to meet Xiao En.

517
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,960
Xiao En?

518
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:33,240
Haven't we

519
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,559
given him back to Beiqi?

520
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:37,559
I believe you didn't lie.

521
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,279
Neither did Teng Zijing.

522
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,039
So all this was set up

523
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,359
by the Investigator's Office.

524
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,240
What do you mean?

525
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,680
What's the relation

526
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,440
between Xiao En and Teng Zijing?

527
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:02,640
Even if Li Yunrui didn't give

528
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,079
the fake order of assassination,

529
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,039
the Investigator's Office
would make sure that

530
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,240
Fan Xian made trouble in Danzhou.

531
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,440
Everybody is

532
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,920
on your chessboard.

533
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,519
We're chess pieces in your game.

534
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,519
It's not my game.

535
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:30,720
His Majesty is the real chess player.

536
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,279
Even if it's for the divine temple,

537
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,079
is it worth risking

538
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,079
Fan Xian's life?

539
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,519
You know how many secrets

540
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,839
our lady had back then.

541
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:46,960
Those secrets,

542
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,359
those creative ideas

543
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,160
were all from the divine temple.

544
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,920
It holds resources

545
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,519
and wondrous items

546
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:56,680
transcending the era.

547
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,599
As long as we have the divine temple,

548
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,000
Nanqing.

549
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,440
will override any other country

550
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,599
and become the center of the world.

551
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,319
It's all for Nanqing.

552
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,599
any risk is worth taking.

553
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,400
Right.

554
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,720
It's all for Nanqing.

555
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,119
But for Nanqing,

556
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,359
even my son has become a chess piece.

557
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,599
I have nothing to say.

558
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,920
What an old man!

559
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:08,160
But

560
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I can understand that

561
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,440
he cares for Fan Xian deeply.

562
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,599
I woke up this morning

563
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,599
because of a bad dream.

564
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
I didn't remember what it was about.

565
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,440
I just woke up with a start.

566
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,680
Your Majesty.

567
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,119
He said

568
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,839
Fan Xian is a chess piece,

569
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,559
but more importantly, he's my son.

570
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:33,160
Right.

571
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:35,680
Whatever Your Majesty did

572
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,039
is for Nanqing.

573
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:37,920
It's worth it.

574
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,400
Fan Jian might not think so.

575
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:42,839
He really

576
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,839
treats Fan Xian as a son.

577
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:45,839
He has complaints.

578
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:47,599
He'll think it through.

579
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Don't you also

580
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,960
treat Fan Xian as a son?

581
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:53,720
Yes.

582
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,079
But when I ordered you
to withdraw the black knights

583
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,480
to drive him to the last ditch,

584
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,960
you didn't hesitate at all.

585
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,519
I know who I am.

586
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:06,599
Who are you?

587
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,720
Chen Pingping.

588
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,759
An old dog beside Your Majesty.

589
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,240
Disabled as I am,

590
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,039
I still lead the Investigator's Office

591
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,000
because of Your Majesty's trust.

592
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,319
I do treat him as a son,

593
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,400
but I'm only loyal

594
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,880
to Your Majesty.

595
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,279
Your Majesty,
as long as you give the order,

596
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,160
let alone my son,

597
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,559
I can give away my life

598
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,119
and I can also give it

599
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,240
with a smile.

600
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,200
I heard you.

601
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,359
In the whole country
among millions of my subjects,

602
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,920
you're the most loyal

603
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,359
to me.

604
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:49,519
I know.

605
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,839
I see.

606
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:54,759
It's late.

607
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,839
I'm going back.

608
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:17,759
Your Majesty.

609
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,400
Gong Dian.

610
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,440
Chen Pingping is in the courtyard now.

611
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:28,519
Follow him.

612
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,839
Find out who he meets

613
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,759
and what they talk.

614
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,839
Monitor

615
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,480
Head Chen?

616
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:38,279
In Nanqing,

617
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:38,839
I

618
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,279
trust you the most.

619
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,839
Your Majesty, I would never fail you.

620
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:46,839
Let's go back.

621
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,799
Fan Jian,

622
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,640
it's not a good thing
to have too many questions.

623
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,279
One thing you should know.

624
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,319
He's still surnamed Fan.

625
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,160
I'm still his father.

626
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:19,960
What do you want to ask?

627
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:24,559
Your Excellency,

628
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,920
you're finally back.

629
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,279
How's it going? Are you OK?

630
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,279
Has Yan Bingyun made a move?

631
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:30,880
No.

632
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,799
He just stays in the room quietly.

633
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,319
Are you still reading the account book?

634
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,319
Is Shen Zhong dead?

635
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:56,559
No.

636
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,319
I lied to you.

637
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,079
The target of this operation

638
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,359
was not Shen Zhong,

639
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,440
but Shangshan Hu.

640
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,359
Why did you lie to me?

641
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,680
I wanted to know
whether you would make a move

642
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:11,640
when Shen Zhong took the bait.

643
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,960
You think
I might collude with the enemy.

644
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,200
Just as you're suspicious of me,

645
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,759
I also wanted to know

646
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,920
after being tortured by
Embroidered Uniform Guards for so long,

647
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,160
have you yielded

648
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,799
and become Shen Zhong's spy?

649
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:29,680
Good!

650
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,640
Aren't you angry?

651
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,480
Only by being skeptical

652
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:33,920
can you be a worthy Director-General

653
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,400
of the Investigator's Office.

654
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,480
I'm satisfied that

655
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:38,839
you're skeptical of everything.

656
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:40,880
What we're going to do next is

657
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,519
to get the secret behind

658
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,519
the account book out of Shen Zhong

659
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,359
and find out

660
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,200
who actually benefit
from the dirty money.

661
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,519
I can help you with that,

662
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,960
but you have to return me the favor.

663
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,880
What can I do for you?

664
00:33:58,599 --> 00:33:59,319
I've no idea yet.

665
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,559
We might start from one little thing.

666
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,440
What?

667
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,160
Do you understand Chen Pingping?

668
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,000
Don't you want to ask me something?

669
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,199
Why don't you speak?

670
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,320
If obtaining the divine temple

671
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,079
is for the benefits of Nanqing,

672
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,519
which is more important

673
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:22,519
to you and His Majesty,

674
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,320
Nanqing or Fan Xian?

675
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,440
You can't compare apples and oranges.

676
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,840
If you have to choose between the two,

677
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,880
will you choose Nanqing

678
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,079
or Fan Xian?

679
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,480
Why do we have to choose?

680
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,199
Fan Jian, you should know that

681
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,599
my biggest wish is

682
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,000
to obtain the resources and know
the secrets of the divine temple

683
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,039
so as to make Nanqing
a long-lasting dynasty.

684
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:52,639
So,

685
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,320
you'll choose Nanqing.

686
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,639
Why can't we have both?

687
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,920
I just feel that

688
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,239
one day,

689
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,039
we'll have to make such a choice.

690
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:13,320
I can tell you.

691
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,639
I will choose Fan Xian.
I will choose my son.

692
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,360
One last thing.

693
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,920
In your story just now,

694
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,760
you've been avoiding one thing.

695
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:28,039
Does Xiao En's grandson

696
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:30,880
really exist?

697
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,239
Really?

698
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:35,480
You didn't kill him?

699
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,079
No.

700
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,360
On this matter,

701
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,960
I didn't lie to Xiao En.

702
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,039
I did turn his grandson

703
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,639
into a Nanqing citizen.

704
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,760
I cultivated him into a warrior

705
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,599
who hates Beiqi to the core.

706
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,679
Is he in the Investigator's Office?

707
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,960
Good for you, Chen Pingping.

708
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,760
What's the point of asking me that?

709
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:18,119
In the Investigator's Office,

710
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,920
how many people are my age?

711
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,320
Why do you ask?

712
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,159
Don't worry.

713
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:23,639
It won't do harm to Nanqing.

714
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,159
There're a lot.

715
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,199
I can't tell the number.

716
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:31,559
For example, we are of the same age.

717
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,639
The Investigator's Office always

718
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:34,719
cultivates trusted subordinates
when they are little,

719
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,639
so I really can't

720
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,519
tell the number.

721
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:38,400
What did you just say?

722
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,519
You are also the same age as me?

723
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,679
Right. What's wrong?

724
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,039
Have you ever seen your birth mother?

725
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,000
What kind of a question is that?

726
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,239
Just pretend I'm curious.

727
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,519
My mother passed away
when giving birth to me.

728
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,519
I wasn't lucky enough to see her.

729
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,599
Have you spent much time
with your father?

730
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,800
My father is strict with me.

731
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,280
He entrusted me to others

732
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,199
when I was a child.

733
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,400
Though we seldom meet,

734
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:06,960
it's for my own good.

735
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,119
Is there anything wrong?

736
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,880
So everything is exactly

737
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
as he expected.

738
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,639
Teng Zijing was your man.

739
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,280
If he tried to assassinate me,

740
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,400
you would take the blame in the end.

741
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,559
Why do you bring that up?

742
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,639
So,

743
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,400
you were destined

744
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,840
to lurk in Shangjing.

745
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Why was it destined?

746
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,159
Who could predict in advance that

747
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,559
Teng Zijing would take the fake order?

748
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,840
Who could predict in advance?

749
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,159
So he knew in advance that

750
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,039
Xiao En would be used to exchange you.

751
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,559
Even if Xiao En survived

752
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:58,880
in Beiqi by luck,

753
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,360
you would go back to Nanqing.

754
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:04,800
No matter how you struggle,

755
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:08,280
you'll never go beyond his control.

756
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:12,519
Fan Xian,

757
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,760
what on earth do you want to say?

758
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,199
Xiao En said

759
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
Chen Pingping is

760
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,280
a manipulative villain.

761
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,800
Indeed,

762
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,480
everything is under his control.

763
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:29,480
It's true that Head asked me

764
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,639
to stay and serve you.

765
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,400
It's also you that sent secret messages

766
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,440
to black knights, right?

767
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:35,880
Who are you?

768
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,119
Why does Chen Pingping

769
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,239
send the black knights for you?

770
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,039
Stay away from the Investigator's Office

771
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,280
in future.

772
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,039
Don't believe Chen Pingping.

773
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,440
What kind of person is he?

774
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:48,280
He's well known for being resourceful,

775
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,000
capricious and ruthless.

776
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,760
I find it safer inside.

777
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,960
Find more allies.

778
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,280
Don't rely solely on

779
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:00,039
Chen Pingping.

780
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,280
He...

781
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,400
Tactics...

782
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,280
I'll assist you secretly

783
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,280
to turn you into the No.1 minister

784
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,280
of Nanqing.

785
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,239
No one will be able to jeopardize

786
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,719
your safety by then.

787
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,480
Humanity...

788
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,039
You should wear more.

789
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:18,559
Don't catch a cold.

790
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,039
You have her eyes.

791
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,639
Who is she?

792
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,960
Ye Qingmei.

793
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,519
Your mother.

794
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,760
But I'll have to

795
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,639
return it to you after all.

796
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:30,119
The time may have passed,

797
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,599
but my original intension
remains the same.

798
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,360
Tell me

799
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,360
if anything bothers you.

800
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,320
Tell me also

801
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:38,440
if anyone makes it hard for you.

802
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,800
I'll help you out.

803
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,880
I'll take care of the rest
about Lin Gong's issue.

804
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:45,079
I think you're a good person.

805
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:45,880
I...

806
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,480
A good person?

807
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:50,679
Emotion...

808
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,519
These are all chess pieces in his game.

809
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,360
Fan Xian,

810
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,280
so disrespectful to the Head?

811
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,480
Chen Pingping,

812
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:31,320
all my life,

813
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:34,159
it's the first time

814
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:37,320
I fear someone so much.

815
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:48,239
Your Majesty,

816
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,599
when you were out these days,

817
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,639
everyone inside the imperial palace

818
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,840
was at a loss without the mainstay.

819
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:58,760
Your Majesty, Director Gong is here.

820
00:40:59,400 --> 00:40:59,840
Let him in.

821
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:04,880
Your Majesty.

822
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,400
Leave us.

823
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,320
How's it going?

824
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,280
Your Majesty,

825
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,599
Head Chen

826
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,280
ran into Minister Fan

827
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,559
when leaving

828
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:16,920
the Taiping Residence.

829
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,320
What did Head Chen say?

830
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:22,159
Head Chen told Minister Fan that

831
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:23,960
he wants to make Nanqing

832
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:25,239
a long-lasting dynasty.

833
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
A long-lasting dynasty?

834
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,199
A long-lasting dynasty?

835
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,079
Head, you look

836
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:41,079
so exhausted.

837
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,599
I had a heart-to-heart talk.

838
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:44,800
A heart-to-heart talk?

839
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:50,239
Well,

840
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,119
I'm fine. Just leave.

841
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:16,039
Stop.

842
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,400
Yes.

843
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,239
Did Head Chen

844
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:27,440
really say that?

845
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,480
I've remembered every word he said.

846
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,239
I dare not tell a lie.

847
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,840
Head Chen's loyalty to Your Majesty

848
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,360
is second to none.

849
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,840
Second to none?

850
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:46,639
Turn around.

851
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,360
I've succeeded in
making the Armor Piercing Arrow.

852
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:01,920
What else do you want to say?

853
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,280
Long live Nanqing.

854
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,000
Open your eyes.

855
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,480
Why don't you hide?

856
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,039
Your Majesty,

857
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,440
you didn't order me to hide.

858
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:41,320
To build a long-lasing Nanqing,

859
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
I can't do it on my own.

860
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,079
I still have to count on
loyal ministers as you.

861
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:50,719
Rise.

862
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:52,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

863
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:26,679
Fan Xian went back

864
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:27,519
to the mission alone.

865
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:28,920
We didn't see Xiao En.

866
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,440
Xiao En is dead.

867
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:33,920
Are you sure?

868
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,280
His heart arteries were broken.

869
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,159
Even if my master was there,

870
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,360
he wouldn't be able to save Xiao En.

871
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,519
Was there anything unusual
in He Daoren's fight?

872
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,679
Nothing unusual.

873
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,480
I'm too suspicious after all.

874
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,239
Come here.

875
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:52,559
Take a seat.

876
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:06,840
Zhu Ge, Director of the First Division
of the Investigator's Office

877
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:07,920
followed Li Yunrui

878
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:08,840
and betrayed the Investigator's Office.

879
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,599
He's dead already.

880
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,599
I've heard.

881
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,599
Now that post

882
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:13,599
remains vacant.

883
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:15,119
Do you want to take the post?

884
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:16,079
Not me.

885
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:17,760
It's you.

886
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,320
I'm not qualified.

887
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,239
After finding out the truth of
the smuggling,

888
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:22,119
you should be qualified.

889
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:23,480
Will you help me

890
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:24,719
I'll try everything I can

891
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:25,400
to get you the post.

892
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,280
Are you buying me over?

893
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:29,679
I told you I need your help.

894
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,719
Do you want to form a clique
for private gain?

895
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:33,000
I want to form a clique,
but only for public benefits.

896
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,760
The Investigator's Office

897
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,840
is controlled by Chen Pingping

898
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,599
all the time.

899
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:37,480
It's not a good thing.

900
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,079
Mr. Yan,

901
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:41,480
can't you do anything

902
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,519
for Nanqing?

903
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:44,800
Cooperate with me for check and balance.

904
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,119
That's the way
to serve our country worthily.

905
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:48,519
Are you mad?

906
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,360
I've never been so clear.

907
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,599
Do you think I will work with you?

908
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,840
Indeed. I have to wait
for the right moment.

909
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,280
You're so ambitious.

910
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:08,440
After going back to the capital city,

911
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,719
after returning to the capital city.

912
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:18,880
Your Excellency,

913
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:20,239
there's a woman at the door

914
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:21,239
wanting to see Mr. Yan.

915
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:22,840
I told her

916
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,239
Mr. Yan is injured

917
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,920
and it's inconvenient for him
to meet visitors.

918
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:26,000
But she's really stubborn.

919
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,360
I've tried to persuade her
for a long time,

920
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,039
but she just wouldn't leave.

921
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,840
Now she's waiting in the yard.

922
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,480
Does he say his name?

923
00:46:33,159 --> 00:46:34,199
She just said she's an old friend of

924
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:34,880
Mr. Yan,

925
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,400
but she refused to tell who she is.

926
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:39,920
Gao, thank you. Go and have a rest.

927
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:41,360
Yes.

928
00:46:58,199 --> 00:46:59,840
My Lady,
His Excellency Shen is in front.

929
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,559
Brother!

930
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,519
You went to see him again!

931
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:28,800
You shouldn't have!

932
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:36,079
Our parents passed away early.

933
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,599
They left you in my care,

934
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:41,840
so that I can take good care of you

935
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,480
and protect you.

936
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,320
I don't want to stop you

937
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,920
from seeking the man you love,

938
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:51,440
but Yan Bingyun

939
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:54,719
can only hurt you.

940
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:55,159
Brother,

941
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,400
that would be my last time to see him.

942
00:47:58,159 --> 00:47:59,760
I have broken off with him.

943
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,559
I'll find him.

944
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:10,639
Don't!

945
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:12,320
You still can't forget him!

946
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:15,760
Brother,

947
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,239
just give me a few more days.

948
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,079
I will forget him

949
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,880
bit by bit.

950
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:37,840
Go home first.

951
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:39,920
What are you going to do?

952
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,400
Don't worry.

953
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,679
I have something to say.

954
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:45,440
I won't go for Yan Bingyun.

955
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:46,920
Really?

956
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,440
Brother!

957
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,719
Do feel relieved.

958
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:57,400
I won't see him anymore.

959
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:06,119
Fan Xian!

960
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:08,079
Fan Xian!

961
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:10,639
Your Excellency Shen, you're here.

962
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,280
What's up?

963
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:20,840
Your Excellency,

964
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,039
what about talking inside?

965
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,480
Don't target at my younger sister.

966
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:26,320
Your Excellency Shen, you're kidding me.

967
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:27,400
Your younger sister is actually

968
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,639
targeting at Mr. Yan.

969
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:29,920
From today on,

970
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:31,119
I'll lock her up in her room

971
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:32,639
till you leave Shangjing.

972
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:35,360
You can lock her up,
but you can't lock up her heart.

973
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:37,079
Do remember my words.

974
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,480
If Yan Bingyun dares seduce her again,

975
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:41,519
I'll kill him myself

976
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:42,639
even if I have to lose my rank.

977
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,039
How about this?

978
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,000
Your Excellency Shen,
I ask you a question.

979
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,519
If you tell me the answer,

980
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,400
I'll help you kill Yan Bingyun.

981
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,480
I'm not in the mood to joke with you.

982
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:53,519
Your Excellency Shen, take it easy.

983
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:54,599
I'm not joking.

984
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,000
I've checked the account book of

985
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,679
our Neiku branch in Shangjing Town.

986
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,639
For so many years,

987
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,119
someone from Nanqing has been

988
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,039
pocketing vast sums of money.

989
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,280
Your Excellency Shen, do you know that?

990
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,199
What if I know?

991
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:08,920
Good.

992
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,360
Tell me the name
and give me the evidence,

993
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:12,760
I guarantee

994
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,000
your younger sister and Yan Bingyun

995
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,639
won't see each other again.

996
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,719
Aren't you born wise?

997
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:21,800
If you want to know
the name of the smuggler,

998
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:23,639
why not make a guess?

999
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,920
Your Excellency Shen,
so you don't want to tell me.

1000
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:30,519
What can you do

1001
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:32,239
if I don't tell you?

1002
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:33,679
Then I have to do something.

1003
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,400
I'll wait and see.

1004
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,639
I'm afraid by then,

1005
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:37,639
there's no way back for everyone.

1006
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,719
That's most welcome.

1007
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,159
Your Excellency Fan, I'll leave first.

1008
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,360
I'll wait for your moves.

1009
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:47,360
I will try my best

1010
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,760
not to disappoint you.

1011
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,400
Find some reliable guards

1012
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:03,239
to guard my mansion.

1013
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:04,519
Don't let her

1014
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:05,960
get out these days.

1015
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:07,159
I see.

1016
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,239
Your Excellency,

1017
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:11,760
from our man watching the mission.

1018
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:13,599
Fan Xian went out right after you left.

1019
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:14,840
Where did he go?

1020
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:16,079
Go shopping.

1021
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,840
Shopping for what?

1022
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:24,760
This one is really exquisite.

1023
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:26,559
Sir, you're right.

1024
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:29,519
The color looks joyful.

1025
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,199
Boss,

1026
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:34,000
do you sell coffins?

1027
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,679
Yes, coffins are in the backyard.

1028
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,039
Sir, you can go and pick.

1029
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:37,800
No hurry.

1030
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,880
I'll have a look at these.

1031
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,079
Excuse me,

1032
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:44,119
did any of your relatives
or friends pass away?

1033
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:44,920
No.

1034
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:47,480
Then why do you buy coffins?

1035
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,599
As gifts.

1036
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:51,760
If I buy many coffins,

1037
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,880
will you deliver them for me?

1038
00:52:00,199 --> 00:52:01,840
Grand General, something weird happens.

1039
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,199
A man sends many coffins

1040
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,679
and funeral stuff here

1041
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:06,880
and piles them outside.

1042
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,559
He says he is here to send gifts.

1043
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:11,480
The gatekeeper finds him crazy

1044
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:12,280
and wants to kick him away,

1045
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,760
but he insists on seeing you.

1046
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:14,960
Does he say his name?

1047
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,000
He says he's called

1048
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,039
Fan Xian.

1049
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,599
Fan Xian?

1050
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:22,440
Fan Xian has sent coffins

1051
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,280
to the door of Shangshan Hu's residence?

1052
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,280
Exactly.

1053
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,679
He got Shangshan Hu's guards killed,

1054
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:28,800
and now he's acting provocatively.

1055
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:31,239
Where's Fan Xian?

1056
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:32,119
Has he left?

1057
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:34,400
No, he wants to see Shangshan Hu.

1058
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,559
He's seeking death.

1059
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,360
Grand General, on hearing that

1060
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,320
your guards were all killed,

1061
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,559
I feel so sorry.

1062
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,599
I bought coffins

1063
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,960
to see them off.

1064
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,280
I hope
that you can take care of yourself

1065
00:52:53,559 --> 00:52:54,400
and restrain your grief.

1066
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:56,440
Leave us.

1067
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,800
It's good you're here.

1068
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:09,880
I guess so.

1069
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:11,639
Save the coffins.

1070
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:13,840
Your head would make

1071
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,440
a perfect gift
to see Tan Wu and others off.

1072
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:17,360
Grand General,

1073
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,360
Shen Zhong is the one
who got them killed.

1074
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,079
No hurry. I'll take you down one by one.

1075
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:31,119
I'm not here to fight.

1076
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,400
Just let me kill you.

1077
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:38,199
Wait! I have something to say.

1078
00:53:38,199 --> 00:53:39,119
Tell me in my dreams after you die.

1079
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,639
Don't you want to know

1080
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:41,440
where Xiao En is?

1081
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:45,920
You prepared Xiao En's

1082
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,719
substitute in advance.

1083
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,639
You asked him to change clothes

1084
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:48,599
and hide among the dead.

1085
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:50,239
I discovered that by chance

1086
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:52,639
and followed him all along.

1087
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:54,239
Don't you want to know

1088
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:55,239
what happened later?

1089
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:57,840
Where is my adoptive father?

1090
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,000
Is he dead?

1091
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,000
Shen Zhong killed him.

1092
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:05,239
What?

1093
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:08,639
Shen Zhong was prepared in advance.

1094
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,239
He ordered He Daoren and Langtao

1095
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:11,079
to stop and kill Xiao En secretly.

1096
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:12,400
Langtao broke off Master Xiao's

1097
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,360
heart arteries and veins.

1098
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,280
It was Shen Zhong who planned

1099
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,599
the whole thing!

1100
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,679
I'll have Langtao

1101
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,079
and He Daoren guarding in the dark.

1102
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,119
If someone really tries to

1103
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:27,239
replace Xiao En secretly,

1104
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,280
only with two Ninth Dan masters
joining hands

1105
00:54:29,559 --> 00:54:31,679
can we really eliminate a hidden danger.

1106
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,199
I accompanied Master Xiao

1107
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:38,840
when he was dying.

1108
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:42,280
He left some words for you.

1109
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,079
Go ahead.

1110
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,920
Master Xiao asked me to tell you.

1111
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:52,079
After I die, let me sit here.

1112
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:54,079
Don't bury me.

1113
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,239
I don't want

1114
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,800
to be buried under the ground
ever again.

1115
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:02,639
No need to avenge my death.

1116
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,280
Don't provoke Chen Pingping.

1117
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,199
Bury everything deep in your heart,

1118
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,679
and live a happy life.

1119
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:14,800
Don't avenge his death!

1120
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:17,599
Don't provoke Shen Zhong!

1121
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:21,320
Bury everything

1122
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,199
deep in your heart,

1123
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:24,880
and live a happy life.

1124
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:28,559
Father!

1125
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,360
By killing my father,

1126
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:41,760
he's become my mortal enemy.

1127
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:43,199
How can I let go of him easily?

1128
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:44,440
But how can you do that?

1129
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,039
Grand General,

1130
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,000
I've thought it for you.

1131
00:55:49,719 --> 00:55:51,719
Shen Zhong is a high-rank official
with enormous power,

1132
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:52,960
while you're trapped

1133
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:55,719
in Shangjing

1134
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:56,920
with no guards around.

1135
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,280
You stand no chance

1136
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,039
to kill him.

1137
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,039
I can fight his guards
and kill him on the street.

1138
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:01,639
Then Grand General,

1139
00:56:01,639 --> 00:56:02,840
you'll be sentenced to death for sure.

1140
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,599
I'm not afraid to die.

1141
00:56:03,719 --> 00:56:04,800
Master Xiao's last wish

1142
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,280
is for you to live a happy life.

1143
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,920
You might not be afraid to die,

1144
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,400
but who will mourn Master Xiao

1145
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:15,119
if you die?

1146
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,639
Now in the entire Shangjing Town,

1147
00:56:32,599 --> 00:56:34,239
I'm the only one who can help you

1148
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:37,920
kill Shen Zhong.

1149
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:56,719
Shangshan Hu didn't kill Fan Xian

1150
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:58,119
but left his residence
with Fan Xian instead.

1151
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,840
It's true! Indeed!

1152
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,519
Where did they go?

1153
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,320
According to the direction,

1154
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:05,719
it must be the imperial palace.

1155
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,679
The imperial palace?

1156
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,039
I thought you come to visit His Majesty.

1157
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:37,639
How come you're here?

1158
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,519
Your Majesty,

1159
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,719
after visiting you last time,

1160
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:43,880
I find you graceful and poised,

1161
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,960
kind and respected.

1162
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,400
Having lost my mom when I was little,

1163
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:48,360
I can't help admiring you.

1164
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:49,800
I keep thinking about

1165
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,039
visiting you again.

1166
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,679
Today, I finally fulfilled my wish.

1167
00:57:58,519 --> 00:57:59,400
I'm sorry!

1168
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:03,639
Just be careful.

1169
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,639
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1170
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,039
Is that all?

1171
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,440
Your Majesty,

1172
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,239
I've been racking my brains

1173
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,320
these days,

1174
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,159
trying to figure out

1175
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,440
what gift I shall prepare

1176
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,679
for your birthday.

1177
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,480
It's just for fun.

1178
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,880
No need to bring me a gift.

1179
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:24,599
I won't forgive myself

1180
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,840
if I bring no gift.

1181
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,199
Neither will I forgive myself

1182
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:29,760
if my gift is similar to other's.

1183
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:30,880
I have to find a gift

1184
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,199
unmatched in the world.

1185
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,599
So you've found it?

1186
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:35,159
Yes.

1187
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,599
Your Majesty, I feel so happy

1188
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:38,960
to find the gift.

1189
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,119
I can hardly wait till your birthday,

1190
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,079
so I bring the gift to you today.

1191
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:45,559
Such being the case,

1192
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:46,719
just show me.

1193
00:58:47,719 --> 00:58:48,159
Yes.

1194
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,159
Grand General,

1195
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:53,920
Grand General,

1196
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:55,519
Her Majesty asks you to come in.

1197
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:06,000
I can help you.

1198
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:07,920
But Grand General,

1199
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:09,440
to avenge your father's death,

1200
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,559
you have to put aside your dignity.

1201
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,639
You have no choice other than that.

1202
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:24,559
Minister Shangshan Hu
pays respect to Your Majesty.

1203
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,239
What's this about?

1204
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,679
Your Majesty,

1205
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,559
he is the gift

1206
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,239
I prepare for your birthday.

1207
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:39,920
What?

1208
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,079
Fan Xian gave Shangshan Hu
to Her Majesty

1209
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,039
as her birthday gift?

1210
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:45,480
Your Excellency,

1211
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,320
I also thought I heard it wrong.

1212
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:49,119
But after confirming many times,
it's really the case.

1213
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,440
Then what?

1214
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:51,719
Then Fan Xian said he wanted to

1215
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:53,320
speak with Her Majesty alone.

1216
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:54,440
So Her Majesty

1217
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,199
asked everyone else to leave.

1218
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:56,199
Our agent

1219
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,159
dared not to stay of course.

1220
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:58,519
So we don't know

1221
00:59:58,679 --> 00:59:59,559
what they would say later.

1222
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,079
Reporting to Her Majesty alone,

1223
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:07,599
but he's the minister of
the enemy country!

1224
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,119
The Saintess is also inside the Hall.

1225
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,320
There should be no danger.

1226
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:15,800
It's such a weird move.

1227
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:20,039
Giving Shangshan Hu away
as the birthday gift,

1228
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:22,000
what kind of a trick is that?

1229
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:24,960
Your Excellency Shen,
so you don't want to tell me.

1230
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,360
What can you do

1231
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,079
if I don't tell you?

1232
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,480
Then I have to do something.

1233
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,199
I'll wait and see.

1234
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:33,519
I'll wait for your moves.

1235
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:37,760
No,

1236
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,079
I have to stop him!

1237
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:43,920
Get the horse ready.
I'm going to the imperial palace.

1238
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:44,519
Yes.

1239
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:55,000
As the Grand General,

1240
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,400
you don't have to kowtow
when meeting me.

1241
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,119
Rise.

1242
01:01:05,159 --> 01:01:06,519
What's going on?

1243
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,480
I didn't lie to Your Majesty.

1244
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,360
The Grand General

1245
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,119
is my gift for you.

1246
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,639
Nonsense!

1247
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,119
It took me some time

1248
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:17,400
to persuade the Grand General

1249
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:18,880
to follow Your Majesty.

1250
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,960
I pledge allegiance
to Your Majesty today.

1251
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,239
From now on,

1252
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,039
I will be at your disposal.

1253
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:28,599
Grand General, you're

1254
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:29,639
an important general of our country.

1255
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,079
Why do you pledge allegiance again?

1256
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:34,199
Before now,

1257
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,920
he was not so loyal

1258
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,480
to Your Majesty and His Majesty.

1259
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,440
With a wise emperor
and virtuous ministers,

1260
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:42,760
Beiqi is prosperous.

1261
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:45,360
How can the Grand General
not be loyal to His Majesty?

1262
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:46,440
Your Majesty,

1263
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:48,599
there're only a few people in the Hall.

1264
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,559
Let's be honest.

1265
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,920
How honest?

1266
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,079
If His Majesty really trusts
the Grand General,

1267
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,159
why would His Majesty

1268
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:02,280
transfer him away from the border troops
and trap him in Shangjing?

1269
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:06,719
Moreover, Your Majesty,

1270
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,199
you work your heart out for Beiqi,

1271
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:10,679
but His Majesty

1272
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,960
is not convinced.

1273
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:15,559
You do everything
for the benefits of Beiqi,

1274
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:17,400
but His Majesty
is actually suspicious of you.

1275
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:18,639
By seeing that,

1276
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,159
I also feel emotional.

1277
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:22,199
How dare you!

1278
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:24,920
You try to pit me against His Majesty
with your silver tongue.

1279
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:27,320
Do you really think
I dare not to kill you?

1280
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,079
Your Majesty, no hurry.

1281
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,760
If you want to kill me,
just wait till I finish my words.

1282
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:35,039
After analyzing the current situation

1283
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:35,920
with the Grand General openly,

1284
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,119
he finally realized his errors

1285
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,159
and decided
to return to the correct path.

1286
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:40,480
Your Majesty, it seems that

1287
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,039
the border troops
are under your control.

1288
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,239
You persuaded the Grand General
to serve me?

1289
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,119
Exactly.

1290
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,960
And Shangshan Hu just listened to you?

1291
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,519
He didn't listen to me.

1292
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,719
He was pushed by the general trend.

1293
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,039
Which trend?

1294
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,000
Your Majesty,

1295
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:01,199
tricked by Shen Zhong,

1296
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:02,719
Shangshan Hu lost

1297
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:04,320
all his guards.

1298
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,480
After that,

1299
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,119
he was alone and helpless
in Shangjing Town.

1300
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,960
If he doesn't find a patron now,

1301
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,800
should he really wait to die?

1302
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,480
I remember that

1303
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,719
told by the late emperor.

1304
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:25,800
I'd be glad to hear it.

1305
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:27,760
Defeated and driven into a corner,

1306
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:30,320
a Grand General pledged allegiance
to his opponent.

1307
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:31,679
What then?

1308
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:32,639
Then?

1309
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,119
Then he took the opportunity

1310
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,320
to escape, staged a comeback

1311
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,280
and rebuilt his army.

1312
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:43,760
Fan Xian,

1313
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,440
Yes.

1314
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,800
It's easy to bend a man's knees,

1315
