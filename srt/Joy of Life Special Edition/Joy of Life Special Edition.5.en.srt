00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:43,011
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:54,760
Why are you here?

4
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,040
I'm here for a walk
after a party with girls.

5
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,879
Why did he kill your wife and son?

6
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,200
It was just something trivial.

7
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,480
He didn't need to do that.

8
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,840
Some guys are cruel by nature.

9
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,159
They're beasts in human clothing.

10
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:06,959
They're unreasonable.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,760
The file says

12
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
he ordered his men to burst into
your house and kill your family.

13
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,280
It's something an arrogant man would do.

14
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,280
He's not that kind of person.

15
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
You don't understand his true nature.

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,599
He asked the magistrate to punish you

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,680
according to the law.

18
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:16,879
Do you think he'd ignore the law

19
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,039
when it came to your family?

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,280
What on earth do you want to say?

21
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,520
We have to take our time.

22
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,199
Guo Baokun

23
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,240
is not that kind of person.

24
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,439
Don't you want to find out the truth?

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,759
Are we already there?

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,479
Where the hell is it?

27
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,479
Who is it?

28
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,599
Who is it?

29
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,599
Do you know who I am?

30
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,759
We're familiar with each other.

31
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:43,800
Of course I do.

32
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,360
You are... Fan Xian?

33
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,159
Exactly.

34
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,479
What do you want to do?

35
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,360
I have a question for you.

36
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,439
How dare you

37
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,159
do this to me?

38
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,840
You bastard.

39
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,159
Hit me to death if you dare!

40
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:56,599
Okay. I'll do as you say.

41
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,919
I won't leave it at that.

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,080
I'll report it to His Majesty.

43
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,159
Do you know why I recited

44
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,520
that poem in the daytime?

45
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,199
"A thousand miles from home,
I'm grieved at autumn's plight."

46
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,400
"I'll now and then for years,
alone I'm on this height."

47
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,840
I'm telling you.

48
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,279
I want you to be grieved.

49
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,720
I'll hit you hard

50
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,279
so that you get sick

51
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,920
and become a joke.

52
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Stop it!

53
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,759
Stop it!

54
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,480
Please stop it.

55
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,560
What's your question?

56
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,879
Why did you kill

57
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,839
Teng Zijing's wife and son?

58
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:35,680
Who is it?

59
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,279
Don't play the fool.

60
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,399
I really have no idea.

61
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,600
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

62
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:43,040
I remember.

63
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,160
What do you remember?

64
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,000
I remember Teng Zijing,

65
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,160
but his family
has nothing to do with me.

66
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,319
You killed them.

67
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,600
How dare you say that?

68
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,240
I didn't!

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,040
-I don't know them. -Fine.

70
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
You won't tell the truth?

71
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,199
I'll hit you to death.

72
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,040
I didn't do it

73
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,560
even if you killed me.

74
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,319
I really didn't kill them.

75
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,399
I don't think he's lying.

76
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:23,319
But the file says so.

77
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,240
It couldn't be wrong.

78
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,759
It also says

79
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,720
you're dead.

80
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,519
Do you mean

81
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,439
the file maybe false?

82
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:35,199
I don't know. We need to find it out.

83
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,199
You can kill him

84
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,920
after finding the truth out.

85
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:40,920
If it's really him,

86
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,040
I won't stop you.

87
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,360
What should we do now?

88
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,480
Do you know where Wang Qinian lives?

89
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,120
Let me ask Wang Qinian about it

90
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,879
when we see him.

91
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,639
If something really goes wrong

92
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,519
with the file,

93
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,000
he must know something about it.

94
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,399
Wang Qinian is good at lightness skill.

95
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,120
It's not easy to catch him.

96
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,600
We can do it

97
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,720
if he's unprepared.

98
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,800
Do what?

99
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,279
Wang Qinian!

100
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,199
Wang Qinian!

101
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,360
Your Excellency,
your hearing is excellent.

102
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,720
I've followed you all the way indeed.

103
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,000
You're alive!

104
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,079
Was my family

105
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,079
killed by Guo Baokun?

106
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,879
Your wife and son are safe.

107
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,959
They live outside the city.

108
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,879
I'll take you to them
if you don't believe.

109
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,120
How about the file?

110
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,839
I was afraid he'd kill them

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,639
after killing you,

112
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,399
so...

113
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,480
So you changed

114
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,759
the file?

115
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,160
The file was just there.

116
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,519
I took it to you the next day

117
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,720
just to make a false one.

118
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,360
Where are they?

119
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,120
Right here.

120
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,120
Don't you want to go inside?

121
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,240
Who is it? It's too late.

122
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
If you have something,
please come here tomorrow morning.

123
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,360
It's me.

124
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,120
He'll stay here tonight, right?

125
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,200
Wang Qinian!

126
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,000
Your Excellency, here I am.

127
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,639
You come and go like a shadow.

128
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,440
Why did you tail after me?

129
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,919
I just want to see

130
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,159
what you're going to do next.

131
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,919
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,720
I'm narrow-minded.

133
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,919
I got you wrong.

134
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,840
Please forgive me.

135
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,360
You have a good relationship
with Teng Zijing?

136
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,559
Actually, just an acquaintance.

137
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,559
So, why did you protect his family?

138
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,679
Teng Zijing once worked
for the Investigator's Office.

139
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,919
I knew something about his background.

140
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,600
I think

141
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,039
what he did

142
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,720
is a little admirable.

143
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:38,480
When I heard of his death,

144
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,960
I thought

145
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:41,480
I should look after

146
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,039
his wife and son.

147
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,200
How did they

148
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,919
move here?

149
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,039
I was afraid

150
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,799
someone else wants to kill them,

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,480
so I bought the house.

152
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:58,960
What if

153
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,039
I really wanted to kill them?

154
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,279
What would you do?

155
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,080
You must be kidding.

156
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,080
I don't dare to do anything.

157
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,159
Your lightness skill is amazing!

158
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,799
I'm nobody.

159
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,960
I'm always at your service.

160
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,519
You're not
Teng Zijing's relative or friend,

161
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,559
but you even deceived me

162
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,440
to protect his family.

163
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,440
Wang Qinian.

164
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,519
It's my fault.
I'm sorry for my negligence of duty.

165
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,960
You're warm-hearted.

166
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,080
It's perceptive of you to notice that.

167
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,320
I had duck blood soup

168
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,200
with vermicelli for dinner.

169
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,159
It makes me feel warm.

170
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:47,919
Stop playing the fool.

171
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,320
Your Excellency. Give me a kick.

172
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,320
I hope you've vented your spleen.

173
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,000
You're just a clerk.

174
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,279
It proves the Investigator's Office
is full of able persons.

175
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,279
No.

176
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,039
You're the one who's beautiful in mind

177
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:04,240
and clever in appearance.

178
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,240
What are you talking about?

179
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,000
It doesn't make sense.

180
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:06,840
Sorry.

181
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,279
I'm poor in expression.

182
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,320
Don't tell anyone

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,679
about Teng Zijing's issue.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
Teng Zijing?

185
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,159
Wasn't he killed

186
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,519
by you?

187
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,519
Your Excellency, did you forget it?

188
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,759
What is it?

189
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,320
The house

190
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,559
cost me 123 taels of silver.

191
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:29,440
This is the title deed.

192
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,600
Your Excellency,

193
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,080
we were destined to meet,

194
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,639
right?

195
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,480
Can you round the price up

196
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,720
to 130 taels?

197
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
That's too much.

198
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:39,559
How about 125?

199
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,399
You have to

200
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,360
round it up, anyway.

201
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,159
I save them.

202
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:43,320
It's worth it, right?

203
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:44,879
I don't have money with me.

204
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,919
Come to my mansion later.

205
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,720
No way!

206
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,919
I won't give you the title deed

207
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,159
unless you pay me.

208
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,200
When I pulled out your hair clasp,

209
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,799
I put a hair on your shoulder

210
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,120
after tying a knot.

211
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Your pose remains unchanged,

212
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,279
but the hair is gone.

213
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,799
You woke up.

214
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,279
You can keep your breath under control,

215
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,559
but you can't control your heartbeat.

216
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,039
Your pulse is fast. You're nervous.

217
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,240
You even know how to feel the pulse.

218
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,039
It's nothing.

219
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,679
I can be considered a doctor, anyway.

220
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,600
But the hair thing is false.

221
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,080
You took the bait easily.

222
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:23,600
You should've been more careful.

223
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,360
You're versatile!

224
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,879
It usually takes some time

225
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,360
for a person to come around

226
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:33,960
after being drugged by me,

227
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,399
unless they've been taking such drugs

228
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,200
so that drug resistance happens.

229
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,720
Drug resistance?

230
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,519
I've never

231
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,000
heard of this phrase.

232
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:50,759
Who on earth are you?

233
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,679
Where did you go at midnight?

234
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,759
How about like this?

235
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,440
I won't ask you about your background.

236
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:05,759
I won't tell anyone

237
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,960
you once went out.

238
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:10,080
All I remember is

239
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,919
one night with you on my bed.

240
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,000
He wasn't on the boat last night.

241
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,799
I saw him leave,

242
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:55,120
but I don't know where he went.

243
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,799
He punched a guy.

244
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,759
What?

245
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,519
That's why

246
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:01,759
I rushed here.

247
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,080
Fan Xian punched Guo Baokun last night.

248
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,720
It's something serious.

249
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,759
So,

250
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,879
are you here for Fan Xian?

251
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,200
Yes.

252
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,759
Sorry for any inconvenience.

253
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,200
Someone accused him of doing violence.

254
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,559
He's not home.

255
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,919
Madam,

256
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,960
we're ordered by the Magistrate

257
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,960
to do it.

258
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,720
You should go look for him.

259
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,000
If it's okay,

260
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,360
we'd like to

261
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,039
search your mansion.

262
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:52,480
It's not okay.

263
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:52,960
Madam,

264
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,799
we're under orders.

265
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,600
Show them the door!

266
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,120
There are visitors in the early morning.

267
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,200
Fan Xian!

268
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,320
Catch him!

269
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,480
Go away!

270
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:17,399
I am here!

271
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,360
Get lost.

272
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,519
I am here.

273
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,759
I won't let them hurt you.

274
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,519
What an awe-inspiring general!

275
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,639
It's nothing. Don't mention it.

276
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,559
Let me wipe them out!

277
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,879
-Get lost! -Mr. Fan.

278
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,360
Go!

279
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,320
Second Young Master.

280
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
All of you, get lost!

281
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:42,840
Second Young Master.

282
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:43,679
Cut the crap.

283
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,960
Quick. Go away.

284
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,600
Go! Second Young Master.

285
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,840
Do you know where you are?

286
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,799
I'm pissed off at the sight of you.

287
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,600
It's the Fan Mansion. Got it?

288
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,840
We're under orders.

289
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,879
What? Under orders?

290
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,960
Do you know who I am?

291
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
I'm Fan Sizhe.

292
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,799
Stop it.

293
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,919
You want to fight back?

294
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,399
You go to catch Fan Xian!

295
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,360
Guards!

296
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,839
Let's see if we'll outnumber you.

297
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,440
Catch all of them!

298
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,559
Enough. Stop it.

299
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,279
I won't make things difficult for you.

300
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,279
Tell me why

301
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,440
you want to catch Fan Xian.

302
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,000
Madam,

303
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,880
he hit Guo Baokun

304
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,480
last night.

305
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,119
Impossible.

306
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,799
Fan Xian was at home last night.

307
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,960
He didn't go out.

308
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,039
But the Guo mansion

309
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,319
sent a written complaint this morning

310
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,640
which says clearly

311
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,400
it's Young Master Fan Xian.

312
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,240
Do you mean I was lying?

313
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,680
Madam,

314
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:45,319
no matter it's him or not,

315
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,559
we need to take him

316
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,480
to the prefecture

317
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,480
to make things clear.

318
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,039
Who sent the written complaint?

319
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,039
The butler of the Guo mansion.

320
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,680
You want to take away

321
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,000
a Young Master of the Fan family

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,599
just because of a butler's complaint?

323
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,039
Let me tell you something.

324
00:17:57,839 --> 00:17:58,680
Fan Xian will

325
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,200
go to the Prefecture of Capital City

326
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,559
only when the plaintiff

327
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,920
goes there.

328
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,640
By then, Fan Xian will

329
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,119
go to confront him.

330
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,880
You can leave.

331
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:09,599
Madam,

332
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,359
it's against the rules.

333
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,160
I'm following the rules
of the Fan family.

334
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,079
Go away!

335
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,200
Get lost.

336
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:18,599
Want to rebel?

337
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,440
Go away! Go away! Go away!

338
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,039
Quick.

339
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:22,599
Quick.

340
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,359
Go away.

341
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,519
I'll keep hitting if you stay here.

342
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,559
Tell me the truth. Did you hit him?

343
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,440
Yes.

344
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,640
I'll prepare

345
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:43,599
a large amount of money

346
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,039
to get it fixed.

347
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,240
It's no big deal.

348
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,160
He's seriously injured.

349
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,480
How seriously?

350
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:10,599
Your Excellency,

351
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,839
Young Master is seriously injured.

352
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:14,519
How can they ask him to
go to the prefecture?

353
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,160
It's ridiculous!

354
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,319
His Majesty trusts Fan Jian,

355
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,359
so I can't use force.

356
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,799
Kun'er has to show up

357
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,519
to push Fan Xian to
go to the prefecture.

358
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,200
I'll go. (Chinese pronunciation: Wo qu)

359
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,480
Kun'er, what did you say?

360
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,400
I'll go. (Chinese pronunciation: Wo qu)

361
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:38,680
Five seven, five seven.
(Chinese Pronunciation: Wu qi, wu qi)

362
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,160
My wife. (Chinese pronunciation: Wu qi)

363
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,440
He must want to

364
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,279
see his wife.

365
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,839
Come on.

366
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,039
I said, I'll go!

367
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,559
He's not married.

368
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,799
He doesn't have a wife.

369
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,000
I'll go. (Chinese pronunciation: Wo qu)

370
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:56,960
You want to go?

371
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,119
I'll go. (Chinese pronunciation: Wo qu)

372
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,880
You're seriously injured.

373
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,400
You'll suffer more pain

374
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:04,720
if we carry you there.

375
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,039
Are you sure?

376
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,920
You must hate Fan Xian very much.

377
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,759
Yes.

378
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,319
He's playing with fire.

379
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:23,720
Come.

380
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,799
It's not good for me

381
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,720
to get involved.

382
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,400
Get the best lawyer in the capital city.

383
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,559
It's not good for me

384
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,440
at that.

385
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,079
Your Excellency,

386
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,279
I worked as a lawyer

387
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,359
before I came to the capital city.

388
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,200
I've never lost a case

389
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,279
over the years.

390
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,559
Let me get it fixed for you.

391
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,079
I have only one requirement.

392
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,200
Let Fan Xian pay the price.

393
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,960
He's playing with fire.

394
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,079
He's playing with fire.

395
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,240
Is it so serious?

396
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,000
I lost control of myself.

397
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,039
You'll be in trouble.

398
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,160
His father will put you into prison

399
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,640
to save face.

400
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,960
And he himself works
for the Crown Prince,

401
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,319
who couldn't turn a blind eye to it.

402
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:16,559
You don't look like

403
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,720
an impulsive guy.

404
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,400
It's not been long since you came here.

405
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,960
How could you make such a big trouble?

406
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,400
He must have died

407
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,599
if I were impulsive.

408
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,359
You pack up

409
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,440
and go back to Danzhou.

410
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:28,200
He's not home.

411
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,839
if they can't find you.

412
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:31,599
Why do you help me?

413
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:37,599
My surname is Liu,

414
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,160
but I'm a member of the Fan family.

415
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
Now I believe it's not you

416
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,720
that plotted the assassination
in Danzhou.

417
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:45,720
Cut the crap.

418
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,000
Lose no time.

419
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:48,680
You have to leave now.

420
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,319
I've had some money prepared

421
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,319
in the backyard.

422
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:52,240
-You... -Madam.

423
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:53,720
I have to stay.

424
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,039
To go to the prefecture?

425
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:55,759
It's okay.

426
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,119
How can I let you do that?

427
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,000
You want to

428
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:03,039
make it bigger, don't you?

429
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,920
It pissed me off!

430
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,880
What are you doing?

431
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,240
Where is my broom?

432
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,039
Why do you need it?

433
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,319
Mom, those constables are here again.

434
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,039
They said Guo Baokun
has been carried to the prefecture.

435
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,519
They asked Fan Xian to confront him.

436
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,960
I'll drive them away.

437
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,640
Don't bother.

438
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:23,519
I'll go there.

439
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:42,839
Your Highness,

440
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,799
Guo Baokun has supported you

441
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,319
for a long time.

442
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,960
He is seriously injured this time.

443
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,480
You won't look on and do nothing, right?

444
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,559
Everything has to be done
according to law.

445
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:59,480
Whether I go or not makes no difference.

446
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,039
You're the Crown Prince.

447
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,400
It makes a big difference.

448
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,640
If Fan Xian is declared guilty,

449
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,480
maybe His Majesty

450
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,359
won't let Wan'er marry him.

451
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,440
Then

452
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,240
you can keep

453
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,880
using Neiku to your advantage.

454
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:15,559
If you don't show up,

455
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,720
you'll let your subordinates down.

456
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,519
Tell me your name.

457
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,079
Your Excellency,

458
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:24,759
I'm He Zongwei.

459
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,880
I'm the plaintiff attorney.

460
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:29,799
Fan Xian!

461
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,279
Fan Xian, do you know your sin?

462
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,480
Completely don't know.

463
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:37,400
Come. Show him

464
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,279
the written complaint.

465
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,720
Why does it say

466
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:50,319
I hit Mr. Guo Baokun?

467
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,400
Do you have any question?

468
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,000
Can you tell me

469
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,799
where Mr. Guo is?

470
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,640
Mr. Fan, please look here.

471
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,519
I was wondering

472
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,279
what it is.

473
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,039
Is it a human?

474
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,119
Your Excellency,

475
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,000
he injured Mr. Guo so severely

476
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,960
that he has to be wrapped like this,

477
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,440
but he's still making sarcastic remarks.

478
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,079
I just said it's a human.

479
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,000
Why do you think it's sarcasm?

480
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,680
Do you mean it's not a human?

481
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,160
He's violent and wicked.

482
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,480
Please give him a heavier punishment.

483
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,200
Hold on.

484
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,119
It says

485
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,359
all the servants fainted

486
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,759
after being drugged at that time.

487
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,839
And Guo Baokun was hit

488
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,720
while his head was covered in a bag.

489
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,160
Now that there were no witnesses,

490
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
why did you say it's me?

491
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,920
Because he heard your voice.

492
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,200
What did I say?

493
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,039
You told him who you are.

494
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
Why did I do that?

495
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,039
Villains are often swollen
with arrogance

496
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,160
when they do violence.

497
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,720
Now that I told him who I am,

498
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,559
why did I cover his head

499
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,400
in a bag?

500
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,319
Isn't it

501
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:58,440
inconsistent?

502
00:25:58,519 --> 00:25:59,400
Because you want to use this

503
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,000
as an excuse to clear your name.

504
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,799
If I guess right,

505
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,200
you'll say someone else
did it in your name.

506
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,079
Your Excellency,

507
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
he just said

508
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,440
it's someone else that did it.

509
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,240
You can make a decision.

510
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:14,000
Look.

511
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,720
Mr. Guo also agrees.

512
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,640
Now that nobody

513
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,039
saw the assailant...

514
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:19,519
Your Excellency,

515
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,880
the assailant recited

516
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,039
a poem when he hit Mr. Guo.

517
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,839
"A thousand miles from home,
I'm grieved at autumn's plight."

518
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,240
"I'll now and then for years,
alone I'm on this height."

519
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,960
Good lines of verse!

520
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,839
Your Excellency, Your Excellency,

521
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,119
a poetry gathering was held yesterday

522
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,079
in Prince Jing's mansion,

523
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:39,759
where Fan Xian wrote a poem.

524
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,480
The two lines of verse are part of it.

525
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:42,680
The assailant recited it

526
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,119
when he hit Mr. Guo.

527
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,240
It proves

528
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,480
Fan Xian is the assailant.

529
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:53,759
It makes sense.

530
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:56,559
Your Excellency,

531
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:58,920
do I look stupid?

532
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,920
I don't think so.
You're skilled in debate.

533
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
Then why did I

534
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,200
recite my poem

535
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:07,799
while hitting him?

536
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:08,759
Obviously,
someone wants to make me a scapegoat.

537
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:11,960
It was written yesterday.

538
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,119
Who else knew it?

539
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,279
There were lots of people
at the poetry gathering.

540
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,559
They all heard me recite it.

541
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,599
Fan Xian, can you tell me

542
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,480
where you were last night?

543
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,359
To be honest,

544
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,240
I went to a brothel

545
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:30,960
last night.

546
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,079
Can anyone give witness?

547
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,319
Both Li Hongcheng, Prince Jing's son,

548
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,359
and Si Lili from Joy Tsin House

549
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,119
can do that.

550
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,200
Your Excellency, please summon them.

551
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,319
Why did you get

552
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,440
Prince Jing's son involved?

553
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,880
The assailant is savage and cruel.

554
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,319
Mr. Guo Youzhi also takes it seriously.

555
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,599
Please do your utmost.

556
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,480
Did you hear that?

557
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,359
Take the witnesses here.

558
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,519
It's as sure as fate.

559
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,839
Mr. Fan and I stayed
at Joy Tsin House last night.

560
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,319
We had a good talk while drinking.

561
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,680
Your Highness,

562
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,839
can you tell me

563
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,960
if you were with Fan Xian at midnight?

564
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,200
At that time,

565
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:15,079
Mr. Fan and Miss Si

566
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,000
went to the room.

567
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,119
Thank you, Your Highness.

568
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,039
Miss Si Lili.

569
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,160
Here I am.

570
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,279
Was Fan Xian in your room last night?

571
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:30,839
Yes.

572
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,839
Did he leave at midnight?

573
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,039
Night hours are extremely precious.

574
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,319
Mr. Fan couldn't be considered a man

575
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,519
if he had left, right?

576
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:52,599
Miss Si,

577
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,920
you have to tell the truth.

578
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:56,920
Mr. Fan was in my room

579
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,119
last night.

580
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,440
I don't dare to hide the truth.

581
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,200
Now that they're here to give witness,

582
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,920
Mr. Fan

583
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,359
has spared himself from suspicion.

584
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,480
I think I can close...

585
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:12,960
Your Excellency,

586
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,319
What's the matter?

587
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,519
Here arrives the Crown Prince!

588
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:33,160
Mr. Guo, Fan Xian is dead meat.

589
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,160
What are you doing?

590
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,160
Slant it a little.

591
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,720
One in the front and the other behind.

592
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:00,759
Hurry up.

593
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,720
Hold it up.

594
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,880
Your servant kowtows upon
seeing Your Highness.

595
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,720
Your servant kowtows upon
seeing Your Highness.

596
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,079
We're a family.

597
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:33,839
Rise.

598
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:35,319
Thank you, Your Highness.

599
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,279
Mr. Mei.

600
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,279
Rise.

601
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,920
Thank you, Your Highness.

602
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:44,759
Why are you here?

603
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,480
To watch you try the case.

604
00:30:46,759 --> 00:30:47,599
It makes me terrified.

605
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:48,440
It...

606
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:50,799
Your Highness, please take a seat there.

607
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,440
Take a seat.

608
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:17,279
Take a seat.

609
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,400
I don't dare to.

610
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,400
Mei Zhili.

611
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,079
Here.

612
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,359
You're the Imperial Magistrate.

613
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,119
Don't forget it.

614
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,119
Yes, Your Highness.

615
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,880
All rise.

616
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,200
I mean them, not you.

617
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,880
Continue with your work. Don't mind me.

618
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:43,599
Yes, Your Highness.

619
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,240
Your Highness,

620
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,359
the trial is finished.

621
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,759
Finished?

622
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,279
Mr. Mei is going to close it.

623
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,880
I'm spared from suspicion.

624
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,680
There are witnesses.

625
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,119
Who are they?

626
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:07,720
Prince Jing's son and Si Lili.

627
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,400
Hongcheng is
a member of the royal family.

628
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:13,839
I believe what he said.

629
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,240
As for the woman,

630
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,279
who is she?

631
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,559
Your Highness,

632
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,960
she's a courtesan from Joy Tsin House.

633
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,839
Mei Zhili.

634
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,519
Here.

635
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:30,759
Here.

636
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,599
Who will lose face

637
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,200
when an Imperial Complier is hit?

638
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,880
It's the royal family!

639
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:39,880
Yes.

640
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,839
She's of humble origin.

641
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,279
How can you accept what she said

642
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:44,880
as evidence?

643
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,759
In my opinion,

644
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,160
it has to be investigated strictly.

645
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,160
What do you think?

646
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,400
Your Highness, you're right.

647
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,160
Absolutely.

648
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,000
Si Lili,

649
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:10,200
Your testimony is confusing.

650
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,160
Guards!

651
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:12,000
Here.

652
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:12,839
Get instruments of torture.

653
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,599
Master, why are you back so late?

654
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,119
Fan Xian is still
at the Prefecture of Capital City.

655
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,079
I knew.

656
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,440
Then why don't you go there?

657
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,559
Are you worried about him?

658
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,759
If he's declared guilty,

659
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,440
the Fan family will lose face.

660
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,960
He's at the Prefecture of Capital City.

661
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,240
As Assistant Minister of Revenue,

662
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,079
how can I go there?

663
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,839
So you'll turn a blind eye to it?

664
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,559
Of course not.

665
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,279
The situation is unclear.

666
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,519
We have to wait patiently.

667
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,160
It's worrying.

668
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,359
I just got news

669
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
that the Crown Prince has gone there.

670
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,440
Guo Baokun works for him.

671
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,519
He must be there to pressure Mei Zhili

672
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,680
to declare Fan Xian guilty.

673
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,599
I knew.

674
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,720
Don't panic.

675
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,639
Besides the Crown Prince,

676
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,400
someone else has also gone there.

677
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,800
But who can stand up to the Crown Prince

678
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,639
as an equal?

679
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,760
Is it...

680
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,320
Fan Xian
is closely connected with Neiku.

681
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,960
He's been in the teeth of storms

682
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,000
since he came to the capital city.

683
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,559
His fate

684
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,559
depends on what he can do.

685
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,400
What if the result is bad?

686
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,519
In this case,

687
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,400
I'll help him survive, anyway.

688
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,519
How?

689
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,679
You're just Assistant Minister
of Ministry of Revenue.

690
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,519
Do you mean
you have someone else behind you?

691
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,599
Actually, I've been curious

692
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,440
why Fan Xian was chosen

693
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,039
to take over Neiku.

694
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,719
What secrets are lurking

695
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,480
behind all this?

696
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,719
Well.

697
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,800
The less you know about it,
the better it'll be.

698
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,760
Let's wait for the result.

699
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,639
Get started!

700
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:16,079
Hold on.

701
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,519
Mr. Fan,

702
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,280
you don't have the right

703
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:21,320
to give orders at the prefecture, right?

704
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:24,559
She doesn't need to suffer

705
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,440
if you admit.

706
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,199
Okay.

707
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:35,199
Will you admit your guilt under torture?

708
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,599
Your servant kowtows upon
seeing Your Highness.

709
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:43,960
All rise.

710
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:44,920
The Crown Prince is here.

711
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,360
How can you kowtow to me?

712
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,519
Your servant kowtows upon
seeing Your Highness.

713
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,000
Chengze.

714
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,039
I've told you numerous times.

715
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:00,320
We're brothers.
You don't have to do that.

716
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,400
You're the Crown Prince.

717
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,880
I have to show my respect.

718
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:09,000
Why are you here?

719
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,440
To see how influential you're.

720
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,639
With you sitting here,

721
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,519
the Imperial Magistrate

722
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,760
has to do as you say.

723
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,480
It's admirable.

724
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,119
He's the decision maker.
I'm just an onlooker.

725
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:23,159
Really?

726
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,880
Yes.

727
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,880
You were going to close the case,

728
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,599
but why did you start to
use torture suddenly?

729
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,639
It...

730
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:32,719
Go ahead.

731
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:35,800
Your Highness,

732
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,639
it's my decision.

733
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,440
It has nothing to do with
the Crown Prince.

734
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:41,599
Mr. Mei, please do as you like.

735
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:43,639
I'm also an onlooker.

736
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:45,480
So...

737
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,320
Your Highness, sit down please.

738
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:10,320
Get instruments of torture.

739
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,280
Don't bother.

740
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,760
Why?

741
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,519
Mr. Fan, do you have anything to say?

742
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,119
Thank you for showing mercy to me.

743
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,119
I'm just a weak woman.

744
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,320
I'm afraid I can't repay your kindness.

745
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,800
If you plead guilty now,

746
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,719
it means I was lying.

747
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,519
I did it for my own sake.

748
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,960
Guards, catch her.

749
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,559
Get started!

750
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:45,039
Let me repeat it. Si Lili,

751
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,639
did Fan Xian leave the boat last night?

752
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,880
He slept with me.

753
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,079
He didn't leave.

754
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,119
You're still lying.

755
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,519
Harder!

756
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,159
Mr. Mei.

757
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,000
she's a witness,

758
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,079
but not a suspect.

759
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,159
She just needs to answer your questions.

760
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,920
Why do you keep torturing her?

761
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,800
You're right, Your Highness.

762
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,400
Enough. If it goes on like this,

763
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,800
people will say she admits
a confession by tortures.

764
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,119
In this case,

765
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,760
Guo Baokun

766
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,199
really got Fan Xian wrong.

767
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,119
Chengze, no hurry.

768
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,760
Don't jump to a conclusion.

769
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,199
Take him here.

770
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:06,559
Who is he?

771
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,079
Guo Baokun said that

772
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,559
the assailant kept asking him

773
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,599
about Teng Zijing's family.

774
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,320
As far as I know,

775
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,639
Teng Zijing worked
for the Investigator's Office.

776
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,320
He was killed
after the assassination in Danzhou,

777
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,079
according to Fan Xian.

778
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,199
So, I'm curious

779
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,079
who wants to find

780
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,519
his family

781
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:33,760
after his death.

782
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:36,440
It's more interesting
upon further investigation.

783
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:38,800
It turns out Teng Zijing's family

784
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,639
has moved to somewhere outside the city.

785
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,880
I sent guys to look for them

786
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,840
and this guy was found.

787
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,239
Chengze.

788
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,199
guess who he is.

789
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:52,239
He's Teng Zijing.

790
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,320
Teng Zijing?

791
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:58,599
Interesting, right?

792
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:05,000
In this case,

793
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:06,840
we've got to the bottom of it.

794
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,000
He's the assailant!

795
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,159
But Fan Xian reported that

796
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,280
Teng Zijing

797
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,400
was killed.

798
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,000
Maybe he was fooled

799
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,840
by this guy.

800
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,239
As far as I know,

801
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,159
this guy has been staying with Fan Xian

802
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,199
since he came to the capital city.

803
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:36,519
He also went to
the poetry gathering, right?

804
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,719
I did see him.

805
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:46,119
He's Fan Xian's bodyguard?

806
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:49,039
Yes.

807
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,440
It's more interesting.

808
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,639
The Investigator's Office
serves His Majesty.

809
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,119
Fan Xian

810
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,599
even reported fake news

811
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,599
and hired a former employee

812
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,719
of the Investigator's Office.

813
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,719
I won't talk about
the criminal law today,

814
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,119
but by doing that,

815
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
Fan Xian,

816
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:23,320
you've deceived His Majesty.

817
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:51,679
I threatened Fan Xian with a knife

818
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,119
so that he had to do that.

819
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,920
If it was true,

820
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,360
this guy has been staying with Fan Xian

821
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,159
or turn to help
after coming to the capital?

822
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,239
He didn't dare

823
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
to risk his life.

824
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,880
As far as I know,

825
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,360
Chengze, you also went to
the poetry gathering, right?

826
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:12,519
And you met Fan Xian in the backyard.

827
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,840
Is it true?

828
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:15,880
Yes.

829
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:18,360
Fan Xian, you met Chengze alone.

830
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,039
If you were under threat,

831
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:21,800
why didn't you turn to him?

832
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,280
So,

833
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,480
I'd be declared guilty

834
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,440
no matter
whether I hit Guo Baokun or not.

835
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,519
I'm tired.

836
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,320
Chengze, do you have
anything else to say?

837
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:34,760
Put him to torture!

838
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,480
I'd like to see

839
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,519
why Teng Zijing pretended to be killed

840
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,119
and what on earth

841
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:41,239
he aimed to do.

842
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,840
Guards. Put him to torture!

843
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:56,320
Hold on.

844
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:07,199
Your Highness.

845
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,519
Eunuch Hou?

846
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:11,679
I'm here
with His Majesty's oral instructions.

847
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:24,559
"It's the Investigator's Office that

848
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,000
asked Teng Zijing to
pretend to be killed.

849
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:28,960
I knew that,

850
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,519
so it's not an offense.

851
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:34,480
It's the Imperial Magistrate's duty to
try a case.

852
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,039
The members of the royal family
should go back

853
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,320
and mind your own business."

854
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,440
Your subject obeys.

855
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:51,559
Your Highness.

856
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,679
May I

857
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,119
take the liberty

858
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:58,960
to ask you a question?

859
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:00,639
Speak.

860
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:04,440
Do you know that

861
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:08,039
I was assassinated
in Danzhou not long ago?

862
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:29,039
Your Excellency.

863
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:30,039
Here I am.

864
00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:32,159
His Majesty ordered you to
meet him in the palace.

865
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,719
Now... now?

866
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,880
Well, are you not available?

867
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:41,840
No no no. I don't dare.

868
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,679
I will obey the order.

869
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,599
Then follow me.

870
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:48,119
As you wish.

871
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,360
Please wait, Eunuch Hou.

872
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,559
Do you have something to say?

873
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:56,920
What about us?

874
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:01,000
The judge has already left.

875
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,920
Now you should go back home

876
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,519
and mind your own business.

877
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:06,920
The capital city is not big,

878
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,039
we will meet some day.

879
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,360
Please rise.

880
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:26,960
I'll take you back.

881
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:30,719
Mr. Fan, you have a promising future,

882
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,880
I don't dare to destroy it.

883
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,519
Let's gather at the Joy Tsin House
the other day.

884
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,320
Who on earth are you?

885
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,559
Let's go out first.

886
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:19,079
Sir.

887
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,800
I can't help it.

888
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,719
The case

889
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,320
is closed.

890
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,199
Did the Investigator's Office
ask you to play dead?

891
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:33,519
Of course not.

892
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:34,760
Then why did His Majesty

893
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,599
give the order?

894
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:37,480
I have no idea.

895
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,519
Could it be
that His Majesty appreciates you

896
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:44,440
and wants to get you out of the trouble?

897
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:46,400
I have been here for just a few days

898
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:47,960
and I haven't even seen His Majesty.

899
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,199
What does he appreciate me for?

900
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,559
It's so weird.

901
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:53,800
Anyway,

902
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:55,159
you come back to life again

903
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,159
and can show up in public

904
00:46:57,159 --> 00:46:58,079
from today on.

905
00:46:58,679 --> 00:46:59,320
What's your plan?

906
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:00,840
Don't talk about me.

907
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:02,079
Go back home now
and let your families know you are safe.

908
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,199
If you have time,

909
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:04,400
welcome to my house.

910
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:05,159
Alright.

911
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,039
Ling'er, help me.

912
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,599
Don't worry.

913
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,800
I'll go to the Fan family

914
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,880
and force him to say sorry to you.

915
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:16,880
No.

916
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:18,199
If he doesn't do it,

917
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,719
I'll punch him till he changes his mind.

918
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:23,880
I mean...

919
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,159
I mean,

920
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:30,599
can you

921
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,079
go to

922
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,280
Guo Baokun's servant?

923
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,599
No problem. I'm going...

924
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,320
What?

925
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,440
Guo Baokun's servant?

926
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,559
I've heard he spit up blood

927
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:50,760
after being hit by Guo Baokun

928
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,719
at the poetry gathering.

929
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,159
Can you go there

930
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:54,800
and confirm he's all right?

931
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:55,880
OK?

932
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,159
How did you

933
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,880
know Guo Baokun's servant?

934
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,000
You don't have to know about that.

935
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:05,159
Just tell me

936
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,400
if you'll do it or not.

937
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,000
Your Majesty. Mei Zhili has arrived.

938
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,239
Bring him here.

939
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:03,039
Your Majesty.

940
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:03,679
Sit.

941
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:07,119
I don't dare. I am terrified.

942
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,840
Obedience is better than politeness.

943
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:10,119
Sit.

944
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:12,559
Well.

945
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,400
This is not the front hall.

946
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,039
I ask you to have a seat.
Then just sit down.

947
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:19,159
Gratitude, Your Majesty.

948
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,880
You like drinking mud honey?

949
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,159
Your Majesty, you are so kind to me.

950
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:30,320
I feel so grateful.

951
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,239
Today let's ignore who we are.

952
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,079
We are just friends.

953
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,559
Have a seat.

954
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,719
I still remember the time
when we first met,

955
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,840
especially when I was the crown price.

956
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,159
You also have greying temples.

957
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:06,559
One year ends and another begins.
Nobody could avoid it.

958
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,920
You have been working so hard.
Thank you.

959
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:12,159
Your Majesty, it's my job.

960
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,800
That year,
I was not in an important position.

961
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,280
If not Your Majesty trusted me,

962
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:19,920
I won't make it today.

963
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,679
Do you still remember it?

964
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,679
I remember it.

965
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,280
When Your Majesty ascended the throne,

966
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,039
people all said the Imperial Magistrate

967
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:33,639
took charge of all affairs
in the capital city.

968
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,119
And the position is always taken by
offsprings of the royal family.

969
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:40,079
If you didn't hold your own opinion
against the others

970
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,239
and ordered me to

971
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,519
take such an important position,

972
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,000
if I don't make painstaking efforts,

973
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,800
I will feel sorry for your trust.

974
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,440
These years,

975
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,079
I have been always driven by it to
do my job.

976
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,840
It keeps me on my toes.

977
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,440
Many memories arise
as if it were yesterday.

978
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:04,800
I always think about that

979
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,559
since we have such a connection,

980
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:10,679
we should have a good ending.

981
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,239
What a pity!

982
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,400
We always get the opposite of
what we want.

983
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,719
Your Majesty. I confess.

984
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,480
We're just chatting.

985
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,000
Why do you confess?

986
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,559
What do you confess for?

987
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:29,039
I...

988
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,519
I shouldn't interrogate Fan Xian.

989
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:33,519
You received the written complaint.

990
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:35,039
As the Imperial Magistrate,

991
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:36,480
you should do your job.

992
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,400
When the Crown Prince visited the court,

993
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,599
I disobeyed the criminal law
and got confused.

994
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,000
The Crown Prince visited the court.

995
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:49,960
You didn't know how to deal with it.
I understand.

996
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,719
When you took the position that year,

997
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,400
you wrote

998
00:51:56,519 --> 00:51:57,639
in your first memorial that

999
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:00,639
the most important thing to
be an official was

1000
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:01,920
loyalty.

1001
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:03,239
Your Majesty. Sit.

1002
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:06,159
I might be incompetent,

1003
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,400
but my loyalty to Your Majesty

1004
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,920
is so obvious that everyone could tell.

1005
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,880
Mei Zhili.

1006
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,079
I heard that you know

1007
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,840
how to predict fate through physiognomy.

1008
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:17,719
No. Come.

1009
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:18,480
Please rise.

1010
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:20,800
Have a look at me.

1011
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,480
I... Well.

1012
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:27,039
I...

1013
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,679
Tell me if my time is up or not.

1014
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:33,599
Your Majesty,
why do you say these words?

1015
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,960
If I die,

1016
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,880
you still have time to
choose the Crown Prince.

1017
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,320
No. Come.

1018
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:41,159
As a minister to three kings,

1019
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,000
you will get a good fame.

1020
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:45,360
Your Majesty.

1021
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,599
I've contributed
my sincere heart to you.

1022
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,239
It never happened.

1023
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:51,840
Sincere heart?

1024
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,159
When the Crown Prince wanted to
catch Teng Zijing,

1025
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,400
did you ask the Inspector

1026
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:58,679
to investigate his whereabouts?

1027
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,360
Did you order people to arrest him?

1028
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:02,800
If not,

1029
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:05,519
well, it's me
who was convinced by the rumors.

1030
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,920
I should say sorry to you.

1031
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,000
Your Majesty. Sit.

1032
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,840
I confess. I am guilty.

1033
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,760
If you punish me by the law,
I will never complain.

1034
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,119
You are a senior official,

1035
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,519
if I punish you by law,

1036
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,679
you may think I am cold-hearted.

1037
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:30,280
I understand.

1038
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:31,920
What do you understand?

1039
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,159
When I come back home today,

1040
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,599
I may probably fall into
a well by accident.

1041
00:53:38,159 --> 00:53:40,000
But my families

1042
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,119
know nothing about the case,

1043
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,239
I beg you to show some mercy.

1044
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,119
Alright.

1045
00:53:57,559 --> 00:53:59,679
You haven't drunk the mud honey.

1046
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:19,679
Your...

1047
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,199
Don't be terrified.

1048
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,840
I will have a cup of mud honey with you.

1049
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:53,920
Mei Zhili.

1050
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,719
For old time's sake,

1051
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:02,559
don't jump into a well
after you go back home.

1052
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,079
Write a memorial to apply for

1053
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,039
resigning from office
and returning to your hometown.

1054
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,719
Don't get up too early tomorrow morning.

1055
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,199
I promise you can return
to your hometown with honor

1056
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,199
and lead a peaceful life in the future.

1057
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,280
Thanks for your kindness, Your Majesty.

1058
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:23,559
It is now too late to repent.

1059
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:26,480
I wish you can keep healthy.

1060
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:36,199
Please take care of yourself.

1061
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,519
Ask the Investigator's Office

1062
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:15,159
to keep an eye on Mei Zhili,

1063
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:18,079
and kill him on his way to his hometown

1064
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,199
as a bandit.

1065
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:26,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

1066
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:34,719
Boss.

1067
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,719
Has Young Master Guo come here today?

1068
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,360
You don't know that?

1069
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,480
I heard that Young Master Guo

1070
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:41,519
was beaten last night

1071
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:42,960
and severely injured.

1072
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:44,800
Guo Baokun was beaten?

1073
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:47,519
What about his servant?

1074
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,480
Was he injured?

1075
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,679
Young Master Guo
only takes hatchet men with him

1076
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,199
when he goes out.

1077
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,679
He never takes a servant with him.

1078
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,480
Are you sure?

1079
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:55,320
Young Master Guo is

1080
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,400
one of our regulars here.

1081
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:57,800
I've never seen him

1082
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,639
take a servant with him.

1083
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:00,440
Did Wan'er make a mistake?

1084
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:02,760
I wonder Young Master Fan

1085
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,639
who beat him

1086
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,760
would admit his crime or not.

1087
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:05,559
What are you saying?

1088
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,159
Who did it?

1089
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,559
Boss. Boss.

1090
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:11,280
The case is closed.

1091
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:12,719
What crime has the Imperial Magistrate

1092
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:14,599
sentenced against Young Master Fan Xian?

1093
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,920
He is not guilty.

1094
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,599
Si Lili from the Joy Tsin House

1095
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:18,599
testified for him on the court.

1096
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,360
She said that Young Master Fan

1097
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,480
slept at the Joy Tsin House that night.

1098
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,760
So he couldn't

1099
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,639
beat Guo Baokun.

1100
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,880
Say that again!

1101
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:28,719
How dare you

1102
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:29,840
ask High Highness
about the assassination

1103
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,159
in front of so many people?

1104
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:35,480
I wanted to know it, then I asked.

1105
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,519
But he said nothing.

1106
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:38,360
As for the girl named Si Lili

1107
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,000
who has suffered
the cruel torture for you,

1108
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,280
everyone is gossiping about

1109
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:43,880
your personal relationship now.

1110
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,039
She suffered the cruel torture

1111
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:47,000
not for me.

1112
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,360
By virtue of the cruel torture,

1113
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,639
I won the reputation.

1114
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,920
From today on,

1115
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,920
I have settled down

1116
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,039
in the capital city.

1117
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:02,760
It's

1118
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,679
worth it.

1119
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,199
You wanted to punish Guo Baokun.

1120
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:13,119
Fine, it's okay.

1121
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,079
But you leaked your whereabouts

1122
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:16,960
and even asked the girl from
the Joy Tsin House

1123
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,079
to be your witness in advance.

1124
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,039
You've done all these things

1125
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,280
because you want to tell all people that

1126
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,239
you are lust for women and arrogant.

1127
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:26,519
You're right.

1128
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,519
Why?

1129
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:28,159
I want to break off the engagement.

1130
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:29,960
You don't want to marry Lin Wan'er?

1131
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,559
I've told you about the Lady Drumstick.

1132
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:32,519
If only you marry Lin Wan'er,

1133
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:33,719
you could take the Neiku back.

1134
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,039
It's not easy to meet a girl I like.

1135
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:36,119
Neiku is

1136
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:37,360
your mother's property.

1137
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,400
I think

1138
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,039
she would prefer to
see me living a happy life.

1139
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:47,199
Ling'er, you can't cheat me.

1140
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,559
It's absolutely true.

1141
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,719
Guo Baokun has no servant.

1142
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:55,800
How could it be like this?

1143
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,199
You are still in the mood of
caring about his servant.

1144
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,119
Do you know

1145
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,679
how people gossip Fan Xian now?

1146
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:04,440
Last time he hid a girl singer
in the carriage

1147
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,039
and this time
he was in a tangle with Si Lili

1148
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:07,360
from the Joy Tsin House.

1149
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,000
You are a princess;

1150
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,679
how can you marry
such a disgraceful man?

1151
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,199
Please rest assured.

1152
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,480
I will help you to
break off the engagement.

1153
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:26,360
It's getting late.

1154
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,719
You'd better go to bed now.

1155
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:29,159
I will see you tomorrow.

1156
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:45,800
If you are not the servant,

1157
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,599
who else are you?

1158
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:50,320
What are you saying?

1159
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,400
Haven't I made it clear enough?

1160
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:53,400
No. I've heard what you are saying

1161
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,760
but I can't understand.

1162
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,960
What do you mean by Lin Wan'er and I

1163
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:56,719
are still engaged!

1164
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,639
I mean

1165
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,599
you will marry her.

1166
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,119
Well. I have messed it up like that.

1167
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:01,920
Why didn't they
break off the engagement?

1168
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,039
It's said that the imperial harem
is not satisfied with you

1169
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:07,159
and even Her Majesty dislikes you.

1170
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:08,719
That's what I want.

1171
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:09,840
But why didn't they cancel
the engagement?

1172
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,880
His Majesty ordered that

1173
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,320
are still engaged!

1174
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,679
Well, I...

1175
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:15,880
Let me figure out the relations.

1176
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,119
The Princess Royal
is His Majesty's younger sister.

1177
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:20,679
Lin Wan'er
is the Princess Royal's daughter.

1178
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:21,960
That is to say,

1179
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:23,360
His Majesty is

1180
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:23,920
Lin Wan'er's uncle. You're right.

1181
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,400
As you wish.

1182
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:25,239
Father.

1183
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:26,360
There is nobody else here.

1184
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:27,639
Please tell me the truth.

1185
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,400
What? You give me fifty taels of silver

1186
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:29,480
Tell me whether

1187
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,559
His Majesty is out of mind or not.

1188
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:31,320
How dare you!

1189
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,239
I have a bad reputation now,

1190
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,320
why does he force

1191
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,280
his sister's daughter

1192
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,039
to marry me?

1193
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,960
His Majesty must have
his own intentions.

1194
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,440
Then what about My Lady Drumstick?

1195
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:44,440
Just forget her.

1196
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:06,119
Sister.

1197
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:08,000
You go out with me

1198
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:08,880
without asking where we are going?

1199
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,079
Why should I?

1200
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,039
We should know what we are going to do,
shouldn't we?

1201
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,280
Brother has his plan.

1202
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,760
If he plans to sell you,

1203
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,679
will you go with him?

1204
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:18,400
He must have his reasons if he does so.

1205
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,079
Fan Xian.

1206
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:21,639
What on earth

1207
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:22,960
have you done to my sister?

1208
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,079
My sister is

1209
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:25,519
the first talented girl
in the capital city.

1210
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:26,159
Why does she behave like a silly girl

1211
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:27,199
in front of you?

1212
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,079
I should have told you what to do.

1213
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,280
Ruoruo. You are a girl.

1214
01:01:32,199 --> 01:01:32,639
A little while later,

1215
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:34,639
when you see your sister-in-law,
just take her away.

1216
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,760
Sister-in-law?

1217
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:37,639
If I marry My Lady Drumstick,

1218
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:38,880
then they won't force me to
get married with Lin Wan'er.

1219
01:01:39,239 --> 01:01:40,360
Brother, where are we going?

1220
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,119
Prince Jing's mansion.

1221
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:42,760
It's lucky that I know

1222
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,800
she is a servant girl of Prince Jing.
