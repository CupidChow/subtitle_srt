=Episode 8=

16
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,599
That means

17
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,520
none of these six teams

18
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,639
has Si Lili in them.

19
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,039
The real Si Lili

20
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,080
has long lurked

21
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,240
outside of everyone's attention.

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,919
So I just don't get it.

23
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:24,680
It makes sense

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,520
if she escapes silently.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,199
Why did she do all that?

26
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,919
Because of the tension

27
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:30,719
between Nanqing and Beiqi at the moment.

28
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,919
War could break out any time soon.

29
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,759
What's the connection with that?

30
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,840
The security at the north
must be very strict now.

31
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,639
It's not the right time for her to go.

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,599
There would be an equally lot of passes

33
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,439
which are equally strict

34
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,280
if she escapes secretly.

35
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:43,680
After she did all that,

36
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,360
the security at the north

37
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,919
will check more strictly.

38
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,960
So she doesn't necessarily go north.

39
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,280
Doesn't she go back to Beiqi?

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,960
She does!

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,960
Wang Qinian,

42
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,759
is there any other way to Beiqi

43
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,120
without going north?

44
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,120
The way to Beiqi without going north?!

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,759
Isn't that...

46
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:18,919
There is indeed a way.

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,240
Go ahead.

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,199
Instead of going north,
go east directly.

49
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,840
Find the merchant ships
and return to Beiqi by sea.

50
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:26,879
Which port is the most possible?

51
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,000
Dongyi Town! Oh no!

52
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,599
We have very strict security
at Dongyi Town.

53
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,319
Besides, there are a lot of passes

54
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,960
on the way to Dongyi Town as well.

55
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,479
Other than that,

56
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,479
this would be the most possible place.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,520
Your Excellency,

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,879
do you find this place familiar?

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,240
With your drawing like this,

60
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,639
how should I find it familiar?
Just say it.

61
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:49,919
This is the place

62
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,840
Your Excellency grow up.

63
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,240
Danzhou harbor.

64
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:55,719
Yes, it is!

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,479
It's all within Nanqing

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,240
from the capital city to Danzhou harbor.

67
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,000
So it should be Danzhou harbor.

68
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,280
Check it out again!

69
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,120
From the north gate of the capital city

70
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,159
to Danzhou harbor,

71
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,280
which route is the most convenient?

72
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,560
What's up?

73
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,360
There is a lot of mountain ranges

74
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,120
and passes during the way

75
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,639
from the north gate to Danzhou harbor.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,199
That's not an easy route either.

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
There is a simpler way.

78
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:32,360
Go ahead.

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,439
To return to the capital

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,199
and depart from the east gate.

81
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,079
You don't need to go back.

82
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,639
Move the carriage
into the woods and burn it.

83
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,720
After that, leave to different directions
and don't leave any mark.

84
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:40,519
Yes!

85
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,399
According to
Your Excellency's reasoning,

86
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,399
Si Lili may be ahead of us

87
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,920
for a short distance.

88
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,879
Indeed! Judging from their reaction,

89
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,079
Zhu Ge should find out

90
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,439
Si Lili's whereabouts today.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,879
If she is patient enough,

92
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,000
she will wait
for the Investigator's Office

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,240
to focus its attention all on the north

94
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,480
before she returns back to go eastwards.

95
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,120
Your Excellency's wisdom
is indeed stunning.

96
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,480
I am totally shocked

97
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,399
by your extraordinary talent.

98
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,680
It gives me a constant sense of anxiety.

99
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,000
Excuse me,

100
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,279
feed my horse with premium forage

101
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,360
and give me a premium room.

102
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,560
Sure! This way please.

103
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,879
Gentlemen, do you need accommodation?

104
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:58,720
That's not necessary.

105
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:00,879
Yes!

106
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,839
Sure! Please come this way!

107
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,600
Your Excellency,
let's have a look inside.

108
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:06,199
Come here.

109
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,319
Sir, come this way!

110
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,920
Get us a good room!

111
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,360
OK.

112
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,680
Sir, that one is taken.

113
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,079
Come this way!

114
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,439
I'm sorry!

115
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,839
This room

116
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,040
faces the sun and it's spacious.

117
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,879
It's very cozy!

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,480
Your Excellency!

119
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,079
Do we really need the room?

120
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,879
Your Excellency, trust me!

121
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,240
After the long journey of hunting,

122
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,519
rest is more important than time.

123
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,160
Please!

124
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:21,959
Please!

125
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,519
Get us some hot water!

126
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,199
Sure! Please wait a moment!

127
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,480
Waiter!

128
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,519
Miss, what can I do for you?

129
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,200
There it comes!

130
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,600
Sir, here comes the food for you.

131
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,399
Close the door!

132
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,360
Enjoy!

133
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:11,639
Your Excellency,

134
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,799
if Si Lili

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,320
really goes eastward,

136
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,600
we'll surely catch up with her

137
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,360
in two to three days.

138
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,080
She should have a horse.

139
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,000
Your Excellency,

140
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,039
if there is no backup horse,

141
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,159
she won't travel that fast
with just one horse.

142
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,360
Just think about it.

143
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
The horse needs
to take rests once in a while

144
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,519
when it is running.

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,519
And it has to be fed

146
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,279
with premium forage from time to time,

147
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,240
otherwise it will die

148
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,039
of fatigue.

149
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,960
The road we take

150
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:44,679
is actually a short cut
between the hills

151
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,879
which is faster than the official road.

152
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,600
The shortest way is
the straight line between two points.

153
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,360
What did you say?

154
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,879
Nothing.

155
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,320
Your Excellency,

156
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:00,840
will you pay

157
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,120
for the room and food?

158
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:03,639
Certainly!

159
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,279
Then it's not that weary!

160
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,559
Let's finish it!

161
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,480
Wait!

162
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:12,960
After you, Your Excellency!

163
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,639
It's poisonous!

164
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,159
Is it...

165
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,519
It seems we don't need
to wait for two to three days.

166
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,320
It is made

167
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,639
by the kitchen.

168
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:33,679
Where did you fetch it
after taken from the kitchen?

169
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,480
I fetched it directly to your room.

170
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,200
Who touched it in between?

171
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:38,000
No.

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,440
Alright!

173
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,120
Then you're solely liable.

174
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,679
Follow me.

175
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,799
Look at him!

176
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,440
Look at him with your own eyes!

177
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,240
Don't you leave!

178
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,960
There is poison in the food
and someone died with it.

179
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,120
What do we do now?
I'll notify the imperial court!

180
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:57,919
Nah.

181
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,440
Eh...

182
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,720
How could it happen?

183
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,559
I'm afraid you're the murder

184
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,480
in this case.

185
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,240
No! No! No!

186
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,320
It's not me! It's not me!

187
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:04,240
Didn't you say

188
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,360
only the kitchen
and you touched the food?

189
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,279
Or this inn

190
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:06,840
is a sinister inn?

191
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,159
No! No!

192
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,799
A lady touched it!

193
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,159
Who is the lady?

194
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,600
She checked in this afternoon as well!

195
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,679
She insisted on

196
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,039
checking out
the quality of the food here

197
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,000
before she decided
whether to eat here or not.

198
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,799
So I brought your food box to her

199
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:21,720
to have a look.

200
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,159
I did nothing else.

201
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,919
Why did you pick ours in particular?

202
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,919
Because you live close!

203
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,919
Just the opposite side.

204
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,000
He is alive again!

205
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:54,200
Your Excellency,

206
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,039
there is no trace left at all.

207
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
I just asked the waiter.

208
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,480
The lady has gone.

209
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,080
Is she Si Lili?

210
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,039
Not sure!

211
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,639
It is she without doubt.

212
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,159
What's your source of judgement?

213
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:31,039
The smell of the Chenguang.

214
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:32,679
What is that?

215
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,759
A type of incense

216
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,559
that has been used
by the Joy Tsin House all the time.

217
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,399
Its smell is enduring

218
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,759
and doesn't fade easily. Have a try!

219
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,639
How do you know that?

220
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,679
tracking.

221
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,440
to make judgement
according to the fragrance.

222
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,519
That's the basic of hunting.

223
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,679
I mean how do you know

224
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,440
what type of incense
the Joy Tsin House uses.

225
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,600
Honestly,

226
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,080
I have also been

227
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,039
to the Joy Tsin House.

228
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,200
But only to enjoy the singing.

229
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Nothing else.

230
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,480
Are you able to hold it?

231
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,960
It's just too expensive there.

232
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,000
I can't afford it,

233
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,720
nor do I have the guts.

234
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,879
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

235
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:28,840
it must be held back

236
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,799
from my wife,

237
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,000
or my life will be...

238
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,039
Enough of that.

239
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:35,000
Since the incense smell is confirmed,

240
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,120
it should be Si Lili.

241
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,399
Let's hunt her down tonight.

242
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,960
Maybe, we'll get something.

243
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,120
Clean your face immediately.

244
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:43,600
We're doing it now.

245
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,639
That lady rode her own horse

246
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:50,720
towards the Pijia Hill.

247
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,559
There are two ways

248
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,720
to the Danzhou Harbor.

249
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
One is the Pijia Hill.

250
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,200
Second is the Chaomeng River.

251
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,960
How do you know where she went?

252
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,559
She inquired about the way.

253
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,360
I persuaded her
not to travel in the evening

254
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,559
as the Pijia Hill

255
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,480
is swarmed with robbers,

256
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,200
but she just didn't listen.

257
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:07,960
Thank you.

258
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,000
Let's go.

259
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,559
Sure!

260
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,759
Hold on.

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,320
Soybean, alfalfa, and eggs.

262
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:22,919
Your Excellency,

263
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,559
what her horse took

264
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,960
was premium forage.

265
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,559
It is all plains and hills

266
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,320
in the Pijia Hill region.

267
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,519
That's very convenient
for horses to travel.

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,799
If we are to catch up with her,

269
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,440
we'd better take horses as well.

270
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:09,360
What's up?

271
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,159
There is fresh horse waste there.

272
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,879
Well, Your Excellency,

273
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,559
this is the premium forage from the inn.

274
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,080
We're on the right track.

275
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,039
Si Lili should be ahead of us.

276
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,000
Wait a minute!

277
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:57,399
What's up, Your Excellency?

278
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,000
It makes me feel so awkward

279
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,360
when I saw you

280
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,759
eating it just now.

281
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:02,480
Your Excellency,

282
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,960
I didn't eat it.

283
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,200
Don't you think it's too smooth?

284
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
What is too smooth?

285
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,080
The finding of poison,
the finding of Si Lili,

286
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,440
and the tracing of her marks.

287
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,759
Everything happens
one after another so smoothly.

288
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,440
Isn't that good?

289
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,039
She detected us first,

290
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,679
Right?

291
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:17,320
Right!

292
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,840
So she poisoned us.

293
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,600
Why did she

294
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,480
poison us?

295
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,759
She...

296
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,519
Because we're chasing her!

297
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,120
Then why would she leave in advance

298
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,320
before we got poisoned?

299
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,519
It must be her cautiousness in action.

300
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,200
I poisoned Si Lili

301
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
the first time I saw her.

302
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,080
Is that your foible?

303
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
My point is

304
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,240
she knew I'm proficient at pharmacology.

305
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
But the poison that she applied

306
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,039
is too mediocre.

307
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:50,399
Maybe, His Majesty of your country

308
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,799
she doesn't have any better poison.

309
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,679
If I were she,

310
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,000
I might as well sneak off
than using poison.

311
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:58,960
I have another question.

312
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,759
she told her way of escaping

313
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,559
to the waiter.

314
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,320
Isn't that

315
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,080
a bit intentional?

316
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,359
Your Excellency mean

317
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,599
she did it deliberately
to create confusion?

318
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,160
Is it possible that

319
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,440
she went to the Pijia Hill

320
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,960
while diverting us
to the Chaomeng River?

321
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,839
No, Your Excellency!

322
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,720
I've checked all the forks

323
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,559
on the road.

324
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,880
There is no human trace

325
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,079
to the direction of the Chaomeng River.

326
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,359
And on our way here,

327
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,279
the horse footprints

328
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,839
have been evading
from the low-lying muddy grounds.

329
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,720
Evidently,

330
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,720
the horse is manipulated by someone.

331
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,720
I always have the feeling that

332
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
she is waiting for our catch-up.

333
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:35,720
Your Excellency,
you are thinking too much.

334
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:37,680
She is simply too panicked
to select her way

335
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,920
which gives her away.

336
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,240
Let's continue!

337
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,839
We'll see when we catch her.

338
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,640
Got it.

339
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,200
Si Lili.

340
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,200
There you are finally.

341
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,200
I've been looking forward
to this moment for a long time.

342
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
As a secret agent of Beiqi,

343
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:41,599
Yes.

344
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,359
Did you try to assassin me
at Niulan Street?

345
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,640
I like you so much.

346
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,039
Why would I kill you?

347
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:57,400
Let's take our time to discuss it
after we get back to the capital city.

348
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:58,960
Mr. Fan,

349
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,279
could you let me go?

350
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,079
No.

351
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,519
I was quite scared

352
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,039
to see you in the inn in town.

353
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,839
I was quite careful with my escape,

354
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,039
but you caught up with me any way.

355
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,039
Your technique of hunting

356
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,799
is really spectacular.

357
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,839
Thanks to Wang!

358
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,000
You're welcome, Your Excellency!

359
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,240
I've long heard that

360
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,200
Miss Lili is elegant and refined.

361
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,279
On seeing you today,

362
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,960
when seeing in person.

363
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,240
Do you know why I led you here

364
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,240
with the poison?

365
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,839
So it is really intentional.

366
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,960
Because I was worried

367
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,559
no matter how much I ran,

368
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:43,440
I wouldn't escape.

369
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,039
So you allow yourself

370
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,519
to be seized without any resistance?

371
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,480
If that's the case,

372
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,119
I should give up in the inn.

373
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:54,480
Why would I run for one extra night?

374
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,480
Robbers?

375
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,400
What robbers?

376
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,160
You're indeed smart!

377
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,559
The robbers that hold this place

378
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,079
are also Beiqi agents.

379
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:28,000
We had the appointment
to meet here from the start.

380
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,599
We found only you and Wang Qinian

381
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,319
in the inn.

382
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,759
So, we'd just make
full use of the chance

383
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:35,200
to set up an ambush.

384
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,319
Take care!

385
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
Allow me to leave.

386
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,160
Your Excellency!

387
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:05,759
This is it!

388
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:07,680
It is a bit longer!

389
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,880
Make do with it.

390
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,319
They are all above Sixth Dan.

391
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,039
It's better for us to find a chance

392
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,240
and submerge into the ground.

393
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:31,759
Your Excellency,

394
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,559
it's too early

395
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,160
to kneel down for mercy now!

396
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:35,880
It's shaking!

397
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:37,640
What is shaking?

398
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,160
The stones.

399
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,039
Your Excellency,
this is not the right time

400
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,640
to bend down and watch the stones.

401
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,200
Your Excellency!

402
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:40,680
Black knights?

403
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,960
The black knights showed up in the east?

404
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,519
We just got the message.

405
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,039
Isn't the Head back to his hometown?

406
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,759
How come he deployed the black knights?

407
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,720
Get it investigated.

408
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:02,559
Yes!

409
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:05,920
The First Division's role

410
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,599
is to manage the affairs
in the capital city.

411
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:09,160
You don't need to

412
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,799
care so much
about the affairs out of it.

413
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,400
Don't you want to know

414
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,680
why the black knights

415
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,480
were deployed suddenly?

416
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,000
The black knights
are a very strong force

417
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,799
governed by the Head directly.

418
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:21,519
We have no right

419
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,160
to investigate their whereabouts.

420
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:24,839
But the Head has gone back
to his hometown.

421
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:25,839
Why were the black knights

422
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:26,839
deployed all of a sudden?

423
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,599
It has nothing to do

424
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:31,240
with you or me.

425
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,640
Yan Ruohai,

426
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,200
do you know anything secret?

427
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,519
The strongest force

428
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,960
in the Investigator's Office

429
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,279
are the black knights

430
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:58,839
Black knights?

431
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,359
It's the strongest cavalry

432
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:04,200
approved by His Majesty

433
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,440
to protect the Head.

434
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,200
Isn't the Head back to his hometown?

435
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,839
How come the black knights are here?

436
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,039
The black knights' showing up

437
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,799
means the Head is not far either.

438
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,000
I can't wait to see

439
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,799
what kind of a person he is

440
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,039
who controls the terrible giant

441
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,720
and beast-like Investigator's Office

442
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,680
The Head hasn't come.

443
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:25,039
Master Shadow!

444
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,279
The Head knows all about
what happened in the capital city.

445
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,599
He has a message for you.

446
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,720
Me?

447
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,279
He wants you to act with a free hand.

448
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,000
Even if the sky falls down,

449
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,640
he will push it back.

450
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,519
The Head knows me?

451
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,680
That's all the words
he wants to deliver.

452
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,960
When will the Head
come back to the capital city?

453
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,759
He will be back

454
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,079
when you need him the most.

455
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,839
In spite that the Sixth Division
takes charge of assassination,

456
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,559
the most terrible assassin

457
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:51,559
publicly known to everyone

458
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,160
is Master Shadow.

459
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,759
He follows the Head all the year round.

460
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,359
But no one ever knows

461
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,039
what he looks like,

462
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:59,079
neither does anyone

463
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,519
know his name.

464
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,279
A sweeping force of cavalries

465
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,000
turns all the tricks

466
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
into a joke.

467
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,079
That's the strong in real sense.

468
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:11,519
Who are you?

469
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,799
Why does Chen Pingping

470
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,880
send the black knights for you?

471
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,319
You may not believe

472
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,920
it's the first time for me
to hear this name.

473
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,279
Chen Pingping is the name of the Head!

474
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:22,799
It's a taboo to address him
by his name directly.

475
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,880
Which Ping is it?

476
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,920
The one in Fuping (duckweeds).

477
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,319
Sounds a bit delicate.

478
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,880
Didn't you say we shouldn't
address him by his name?

479
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,440
No, don't do that!

480
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,519
Chen Pingping
from the Investigator's Office

481
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,359
is publicly known as King of Nights

482
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,799
and the source of all sins.

483
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,599
Let's discuss it on our way back.

484
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:41,559
Your Excellency.

485
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,039
We must be careful

486
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,920
on the way back.

487
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:49,640
What do you mean?

488
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,640
After all, you took part in

489
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,480
involves masters

490
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,599
from both Beiqi and Dongyi Town

491
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,160
I'm afraid

492
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,160
there is a big figure behind it.

493
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
and we'd better stay covert

494
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,640
on the way.

495
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:04,839
Don't let anyone know

496
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,920
we have captured her.

497
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,200
Are you worried that she'll be killed
half way to keep her mouth shut?

498
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Black knights sweeping through

499
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,599
is a scene

500
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,240
which can't be hidden.

501
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:17,599
I'm afraid we'll have to

502
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,799
act the other way around.

503
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,519
The other way around?

504
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,599
Fan Xian from Danzhou
travelled a long way

505
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,000
to capture Si Lili, the Beiqi agent,

506
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,720
and escort her back to the capital city.

507
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,240
It seems Si Lili

508
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,359
has committed something serious.

509
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:55,240
It's surprising that she is an agent.

510
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,720
Fan Xian's got a great formation.

511
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:07,720
Seizure of the Beiqi agent

512
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,880
is something that can be done
but cannot be disclosed.

513
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,720
Straightforward as he is,

514
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,680
he is also clever.

515
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,759
The more people know about it,

516
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,359
the safer their way of return will be.

517
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,279
Whoever tries to
do something bad to them

518
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,160
reveals the guilt from the heart.

519
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:21,000
It is so according to logical thinking.

520
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,119
Is there any other possibility?

521
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,599
This is no longer a concern

522
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,680
if one is crazy.

523
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,680
Auntie, what are you laughing at?

524
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,440
My future son-in-law

525
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,240
It's interesting.

526
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:48,920
Si Lili is a potato

527
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,960
too hot to hold now.

528
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,240
It's plausibly wise

529
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,759
to return on a large scale.

530
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,240
Shall we just kill him?

531
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,559
Kill him?

532
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,799
He will reach the capital city tomorrow

533
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,920
with his current speed.

534
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,480
If we send killers

535
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,039
to kill him outside of the capital city,

536
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,279
Wan'er doesn't need to marry him.

537
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,240
The power of Neiku doesn't
need to be handed over either.

538
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:14,279
What a perfect chance!

539
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,319
Si Lili is very suspicious

540
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:17,000
to be Beiqi agent.

541
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,839
If we take action now,

542
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,079
it's very likely that we'll be convicted
of killing to keep her mouth shut.

543
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,640
Isn't that more interesting?

544
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,240
Auntie,

545
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,599
this is really not
the right time to kill him.

546
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,799
Seriously?

547
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:30,720
If you do that,

548
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:33,480
I'll be in grave danger.

549
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,279
You see?

550
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:41,119
I'm just having a joke with him.

551
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,759
He takes it too seriously.

552
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:53,200
Wait!

553
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,640
Your Excellency!

554
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,559
This is the third bunch of people

555
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:00,640
in such a short while.

556
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,440
Let's take a guess

557
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,839
whose side they are from.

558
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:08,880
From the Capital Garrison.

559
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,319
They want to take her away as well?

560
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,240
Yeah!

561
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,319
I have turned them down

562
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,440
in the name
of the Investigator's Office.

563
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,400
The Capital Garrison,

564
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
the Prefecture of Capital City,

565
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,440
and the Ministry of Penalty

566
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:25,400
all want you.

567
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,559
You are after all

568
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:31,559
a live Beiqi agent.

569
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,720
Once they get

570
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,759
any new intelligence from you,

571
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,440
it will be a great achievement.

572
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:50,880
You know it very well that

573
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,240
no matter to which side I hand you over,

574
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:54,799
what awaits you ahead

575
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,359
is endless excruciation.

576
00:29:56,759 --> 00:29:57,599
Dying will be luxurious

577
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,039
by then.

578
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Your heartbeat is faster.
Are you nervous?

579
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,839
Who is the head of conspiracy
for the Niulan Street assassination?

580
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,200
Why does it have to have a head?

581
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:22,839
Why can't I be the person

582
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:23,960
to have planned it all?

583
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:25,599
You don't have the motive to kill me.

584
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,319
Is it the fairyland

585
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,319
I'm so deeply into you,

586
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,759
Mr. Fan?

587
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,440
You're a Beiqi agent

588
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,680
who's been lurking in the capital city
for so many years.

589
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:45,400
No one knows

590
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,599
how much efforts you've made

591
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,359
to become the courtesan
in the Joy Tsin House.

592
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,480
The people you're in touch with
are all high officials and celebrities.

593
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,960
It's the prime time

594
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,000
to collect intelligence.

595
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,880
Your exposure of identity now

596
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,160
will ruin all your previous efforts.

597
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:05,200
It'll make sense

598
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,759
if it's the Crown Prince, His Majesty,

599
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:08,680
or the Prime Minister
that you're trying to kill

600
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,079
after all these efforts.

601
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:13,720
It is otherwise

602
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,400
if your target is me.

603
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,839
What fantastic reasoning!

604
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:22,839
Is that a confirmation

605
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,119
that someone else is behind it?

606
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,640
Why don't you figure it out yourself

607
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:29,640
since you're so smart?

608
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,680
Who is it?

609
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,759
Why don't you just tell me

610
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,480
and I'll save your life?

611
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,720
As you said

612
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:49,640
just now,

613
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,960
every ministry wants to interrogate me.

614
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,200
How do you save me from that?

615
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,240
You'll hand me over anyway

616
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:59,720
after we arrive
at the capital city tomorrow.

617
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,480
It makes no difference

618
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,000
to say it or not to say it.

619
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,400
You're the prisoner
of the Investigator's Office.

620
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,160
I don't need to hand you over.

621
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,440
Should you be really important

622
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,559
in the Investigator's Office,

623
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,200
how come you chase me

624
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,920
without any retinues?

625
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,799
That's non-sense. I am his retinue.

626
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,440
Have some water please, Your Excellency!

627
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:33,039
Keeping it a secret,

628
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,400
I may still get rescued by that person.

629
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,559
If I really speak it out,

630
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:41,480
I'll end up on the chopping block.

631
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,920
Saving you now is too difficult.

632
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,559
I would kill you to keep
your mouth shut if I were that big figure.

633
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,720
As you said yourself,

634
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:49,319
what awaits me ahead

635
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,640
is endless excruciation.

636
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,160
Getting killed

637
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,720
is no less of an extrication.

638
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,319
How about

639
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,880
you telling me the name secretly

640
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,000
and then I set you free secretly?

641
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,119
Are you serious?

642
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,319
Right now,

643
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,319
the eyes of every ministry
are cast on me.

644
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,519
You dare to set me free now?

645
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:01,759
Your Excellency,

646
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,559
we'd better go back to watch over her.

647
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:05,079
No need.

648
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,440
I'm afraid this yard

649
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,799
should have been encircled

650
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:08,320
by all the scouts
from different ministries.

651
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:09,760
She can't escape.

652
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:23,440
If we had known that earlier,

653
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,639
we could have taken our time

654
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,880
for the return trip.

655
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,480
Black knights' showing up

656
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,519
means the Head

657
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:33,559
already knows about it.

658
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,519
If we don't return immediately,

659
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,559
it's very suspicious
that we're colluding with the enemies.

660
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,519
That's dangerous to the family.

661
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,039
You're right, Your Excellency.

662
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,599
But Master Shadow said

663
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,920
you can do whatever you think necessary

664
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,159
and the Head will help you

665
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,760
if anything goes wrong.

666
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,480
Chen Pingping and I
are neither families nor friends.

667
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:54,000
Why would he help me?

668
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,719
Your Excellency still don't trust him.

669
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:02,719
Human mind is changeable.

670
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,400
I can't trust him

671
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
before I meet him in person.

672
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,119
Your Excellency,

673
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,320
before handing over Si Lili,

674
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,079
you still have another option.

675
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,800
Do you mean to lynch?

676
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,039
Yeah!

677
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,079
Now Si Lili

678
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,320
is under your control.

679
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,800
If you lynch her,

680
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,400
she probably will tell the truth

681
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,440
after one night's of torture.

682
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,119
It's very easy

683
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:39,679
to torture a weak lady.

684
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,920
But if we have no bottom-line,

685
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,440
are we any different from animals?

686
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,920
You're right, Your Excellency.

687
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,639
So,

688
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,519
we'll have to wait

689
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,480
before making a decision?

690
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,159
after we get back to the capital city.

691
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:57,320
Wang Qinian,

692
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,519
If I chose to lynch

693
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,440
just now,

694
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,519
will you leave me?

695
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,519
If Your Excellency has no bottom-line,

696
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:08,480
then my monthly payment

697
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,679
of 150 taels of silvers

698
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:10,679
will not be guaranteed.

699
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:12,840
50 taels! 50 taels!

700
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,000
Your Excellency, do feel relieved.

701
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,800
As long as you keep paying me
50 taels of silver,

702
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,440
Wang Qinian,

703
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,280
and serve you.

704
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:37,079
They are all

705
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,199
so eager!

706
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,440
It is a big case after all.

707
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,320
If you don't have the support

708
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,400
from the Investigator's Office,

709
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,360
we may not be able to hold her.

710
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,960
Si Lili is the prisoner
of the Investigator's Office.

711
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,840
Your Excellencies,

712
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,760
please make way for us!

713
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:18,760
Mr. Fan,

714
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,960
we have no objection

715
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,719
if the Investigator's Office

716
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:23,159
really wants the prisoner.

717
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,119
Please show us the arrest warrant

718
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,280
of the Investigator's Office.

719
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,639
We'll make it up later on.

720
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,559
I'm afraid that's a breach of the rule.

721
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,199
Here comes the arrest warrant!

722
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,320
The Investigator's Office
is directly affiliated with His Majesty.

723
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,920
It has the right
to fetch anyone for interrogation

724
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,519
for all matters in
and out of the capital city.

725
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,199
Here is the arrest warrant!

726
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,239
If you don't have His Majesty's
sacred edict,

727
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,400
I'll take her away.

728
00:38:20,679 --> 00:38:21,159
Follow me!

729
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,079
Why are you still following me?

730
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,159
Your Excellency.

731
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:56,679
Si Lili's case

732
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,320
is connected with
the Niulan Street assassination.

733
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,440
Can I take charge of the trial?

734
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,360
Do you think I'll hand her over to you

735
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,039
now that I've come in person?

736
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,360
Your Excellency.

737
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:09,079
Agents and military organizations
are in the domain of the Fourth Division.

738
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,079
You're off the case.

739
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,159
She was captured by me.

740
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,239
You have all the credit to the capture.

741
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,440
The assassination
is after all related to me.

742
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,519
Then you surely need
to stay out to avoid suspicion.

743
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,559
Go back!

744
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,519
Mr. Fan, aren't you gonna save me?

745
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,840
Where are your actions?

746
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:44,719
Your Excellency!

747
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:47,239
Your Excellency!

748
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,559
Your Excellency!

749
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:58,719
She is gone!

750
00:39:58,719 --> 00:39:59,800
What's the point of keeping that?

751
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,760
Dismantle it and get it disposed!

752
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:20,360
Don't be mad, Your Excellency!

753
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:23,000
After all, Yan Bingyun, his son,

754
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:24,039
went to Beiqi

755
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,800
because of you.

756
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,880
Naturally, he's a bit apathetic to you

757
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,480
which makes sense.

758
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:30,239
Are you hungry?

759
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,400
What did you say?

760
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:33,320
We've been rushing for so many days.

761
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:35,159
Shall I treat you with a good meal?

762
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,400
No, that's not needed.

763
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:38,880
Well,

764
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,119
go home

765
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,840
and let my wife know
I'm back safe and sound.

766
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,880
And, I miss my daughter now.

767
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,079
Right.

768
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,599
Come to me after you're done!

769
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,119
As you're in my team,

770
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,639
we need to report
to the mansion together.

771
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:51,840
Got it.

772
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:55,440
So, you're alright?

773
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,920
Of course!

774
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:58,519
Remember to come to my mansion.

775
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,599
My Lady!

776
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,280
-My Lady! -What happened?

777
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:18,760
Well, he...

778
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,280
Calm down!

779
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,760
Isn't he the miracle-working doctor?

780
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,800
He is the miracle-working doctor
and also Fan Xian.

781
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,119
I need to talk to him.

782
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,920
Leave us and close the door!

783
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:29,480
Leave!

784
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:43,920
Why do you come in day time?

785
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,119
I just got back and I want to meet you.

786
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:50,000
It's said you captured Si Lili.

787
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,000
Are you hurt?

788
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,079
Safe and sound!

789
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,800
I can't get hurt

790
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,760
with my proficiency at martial art.

791
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,000
Where is she?

792
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,440
As soon as I went through the gate,

793
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:04,800
both the Ministry of Personnel and the Ministry
of Penalty came to take her over.

794
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,239
She was eventually taken away
by the Investigator's Office.

795
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:08,199
Alright! Let's not talk about these.

796
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:09,920
Is that edible?

797
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:10,880
I feel hungry now.

798
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:15,079
That's my leftover.

799
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:15,840
I don't mind!

800
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,159
You won't give up like this.

801
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,800
You can't let go of Teng Zijing's death.

802
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:37,960
Don't talk!

803
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:40,320
I just want to sit beside you quietly

804
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,679
like this for a while.

805
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,360
I always wondered

806
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,320
if I hadn't gone
to the Qing Temple that day,

807
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,079
I would not have met you

808
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:16,039
holding a drumstick.

809
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:20,880
Time flows like a river.
Lives are like fishes in it.

810
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:23,199
They meet in undercurrent
and rapid torrent.

811
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,719
We're destined to meet.

812
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:26,800
Even if we hadn't met on that day,

813
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:28,960
we'd meet elsewhere.

814
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,599
We're destined to meet?

815
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,079
Perhaps,

816
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:34,440
I feel so much settled

817
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,079
after hearing your words.

818
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,159
You can turn to Ye Ling'er!

819
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:49,400
Ye Ling'er? What do I turn to her for?

820
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:51,360
She's been to the Joy Tsin House.

821
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,440
Why would she go there?

822
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:54,400
When she knew

823
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,519
you are Fan Xian on that day,

824
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,159
she insisted in visiting
the Joy Tsin House

825
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,320
to check out if there is anything

826
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,320
between you and Si Lili.

827
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,480
After that,

828
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,239
the news became wide spread

829
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,519
that she fell into the water
and got saved.

830
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:03,639
She never came to meet me

831
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:04,760
ever since then.

832
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,440
I think

833
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:08,519
she could have seen something
on that day.

834
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:16,679
What a coincidence, Mr. Lin.

835
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,719
I'm diagnosing for her.

836
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,079
Second brother,

837
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:23,159
why are you mad?

838
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:24,039
You, a bastard from Danzhou!

839
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:25,039
How dare you step into my sister's room?

840
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,760
How do you know I'm Fan Xian?

841
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,079
I must kill you with my sword today.

842
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,760
Take out your sword then.

843
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,199
Brother, we didn't do anything shameful.

844
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,719
If anyone knows about this,

845
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:50,480
your reputation will be ruined.

846
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,119
But we have marriage contract.

847
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:54,480
You can't marry this guy.

848
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,800
Why do you hate Fan Xian

849
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,639
so much?

850
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,159
It is treacherous of him

851
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:07,360
to disguise himself
as a doctor to meet you.

852
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,840
If he really cares about you,

853
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:10,599
he should think

854
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:11,599
for your reputation.

855
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,559
How could he do something like this?

856
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,320
He's such a villain and not good at all.

857
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,280
He is not that type of person.

858
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:19,079
However...

859
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,079
his idea

860
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,280
differs from what people usually think.

861
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:22,320
You're too naive.

862
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,800
I'm a man as well.

863
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,159
You may be cheated by him, but I won't.

864
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,599
From today on,

865
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:29,360
I'll send the guards here.

866
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:33,440
If Fan Xian dares to come again,

867
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,440
I'll kill him without mercy.

868
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,119
How could I do that?

869
00:45:59,079 --> 00:45:59,880
Aren't you gonna ask me?

870
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,480
Ask you what?

871
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,639
Who wanted to kill Fan Xian.

872
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:03,679
I'm not the interrogator.

873
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:05,360
Who is it then?

874
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,320
Chen Pingping is not here.

875
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,000
Is it Zhu Ge from the First Division?

876
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,599
I'm waiting.

877
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,760
For what?

878
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,280
For the interrogator to come.

879
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,000
What can I do for you?

880
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,239
I heard that

881
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:53,159
you fell into the Liujing River
the other day.

882
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:54,840
Why do you ask that?

883
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:57,239
Wan'er told me

884
00:46:57,519 --> 00:46:58,559
you visited the Joy Tsin House

885
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,480
to investigate Si Lili.

886
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:00,840
Why did you fell into the river?

887
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:02,039
What did you witness

888
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:03,360
on the boat on that day?

889
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:05,679
I didn't see anything.

890
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,719
You're lying.

891
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:09,440
You know that guy!

892
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:10,199
I don't know you.

893
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:10,719
I don't know you.

894
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,920
That means you did see someone.

895
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,519
Stop asking!

896
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,960
You're daughter of the Chief Guard
of the capital city,

897
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:19,719
but you still dare not

898
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:20,320
say who it is.

899
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:21,679
It must be someone

900
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:23,079
with enormous power.

901
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,239
Fan Xian, stop investigating.

902
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:30,159
Who is he?

903
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,440
You're new to the capital city

904
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:40,719
and you don't know well
of the situation.

905
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:43,159
If you don't stop,

906
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,639
your followers, and your family

907
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,480
will be in danger.

908
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:56,199
It's not that I'm not willing
to tell you the truth.

909
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:58,719
Because I can't put

910
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,400
the whole Ye family at risk.

911
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,119
I understand.

912
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:22,880
Your Excellency.

913
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,280
You'd already promised me to

914
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:27,440
move these vats away last time.

915
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:28,840
You always don't come in
through the front door.

916
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,639
If I move them away,

917
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:30,679
how can I know you come in.

918
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:33,320
Why are you still carrying the case?

919
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:34,360
Didn't you go home?

920
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:35,800
I did.

921
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,559
I think I may use it

922
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,239
when I do something for you.

923
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:42,000
So I take it with me.

924
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,239
Put it down and sit.

925
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,440
Have more.

926
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,159
You prefer bank notes or silver cashes.

927
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,599
Bank notes. They're easy to hide.

928
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,239
The promised fifty taels of silver.

929
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:16,559
Your Excellency,

930
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,719
what about the ox, the land

931
00:49:19,159 --> 00:49:20,079
and ten pigs

932
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,159
that you've promised to give me?

933
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,239
I have asked people
to prepare them for you.

934
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,719
Your Excellency,
you're always trustworthy

935
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,400
and treat me as your child.

936
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,000
Wang Qinian,

937
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,719
it's a pity you don't do cross talk!

938
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,119
What is cross talk?

939
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,079
Linguistic art.

940
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:38,559
If it's what you wants me to do,

941
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,840
I can learn.

942
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,960
You don't need to learn it now.

943
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,599
If you're leisure,

944
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,559
have a chat with me.

945
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:46,599
About what?

946
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,639
Whatever.

947
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:48,719
Let it be.

948
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:51,199
Fine. You start it first, please.

949
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:53,880
How long have you been married?

950
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,159
Seven or eight years.

951
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,519
How old is your daughter?

952
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:58,920
Under the age of five.

953
00:49:59,119 --> 00:49:59,840
When can I see her?

954
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,440
My little daughter is naughty.

955
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:04,199
She will scratch anyone she sees.

956
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:06,159
It's good to be lively as a child.

957
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,480
You're right, Your Excellency.

958
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,639
Where is Si Lili imprisoned?

959
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,400
The dungeon
in the Investigator's Office.

960
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:15,199
Heavily fortified?

961
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:16,599
Heavily fortified.

962
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,800
You are good at drawing, right?

963
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,320
Yes.

964
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,719
About the entrance and exit to
the dungeon in the Investigator's Office

965
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:26,559
and the guard there,

966
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,159
draw a copy for me.

967
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,400
Your Excellency, these stuffs are…

968
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:39,320
Leave them alone.

969
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,960
Draw a copy of the entrance and exit

970
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,719
to the dungeon

971
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:44,280
and the guard conditions.

972
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:47,719
Your Excellency,

973
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:51,159
no one can survive from

974
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,400
invading into the dungeon of
the Investigator's Office down the ages.

975
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:54,119
Just draw it for me.

976
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,519
You have known I'm going
to take actions tonight?

977
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,639
Why are you waiting for me here?

978
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:37,679
The rope of the hook

979
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:41,360
is made of hairs and spider web.

980
00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:43,039
It can't be broken easily

981
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,360
and is excellent
for climbing over the wall.

982
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:47,360
I can climb walls
with my unique inner power.

983
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:48,480
I don't have to use it.

984
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,960
This is the dizzy incense

985
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:54,599
that is best for using in a small room.

986
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:55,760
I learned to poison from a child.

987
00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:57,679
I can make it myself.

988
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,239
The shoe sole is made of cotton

989
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,320
that is best for walking on

990
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,400
roofs and tiles at night.

991
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,440
You are here for selling goods?

992
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:09,400
Not selling. I will give them to you.

993
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:10,440
It's not like you.

994
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:14,159
Your Excellency.

995
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Invading into the dungeon, you will be
sentenced to death if you are caught.

996
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,480
I have a family.

997
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:23,039
Please forgive me
for not going with you.

998
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,079
It will be good

999
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,039
if these things can help.

1000
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,159
Pack them up.

1001
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,159
No no no.

1002
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,440
I have other things.

1003
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,320
If I am arrested,

1004
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:34,480
they can find you out

1005
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,239
because of these things.

1006
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,159
That makes sense.

1007
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:43,800
Thank you.

1008
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,519
Don't let anyone know you have seen me.

1009
00:52:58,039 --> 00:52:59,320
Now I probably know

1010
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:01,599
why you want to

1011
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:02,719
change the world.

1012
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:05,960
A life was taken away,

1013
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,320
but no one cares

1014
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,719
just because he was a guard,

1015
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,000
and he deserved the death.

1016
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,119
We meet again.

1017
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,360
Why are you here?

1018
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,199
It's urgent. No more nonsense.

1019
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,960
Tell me who on earth wants to kill me.

1020
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:33,880
You plan to gain my trust

1021
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:34,599
No problem.

1022
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:36,039
Tell me his name

1023
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:36,880
I will save you.

1024
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:39,440
If you don't believe me,

1025
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:43,320
Mr. Fan, why not turn your back
to have a look first.

1026
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,440
The Investigator's Office has already

1027
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,239
set ambushes everywhere.

1028
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,400
Fan Xian,

1029
00:54:50,679 --> 00:54:52,599
the moment you stepped
on the Tianhe Street,

1030
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,559
I had already got the report.

1031
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,960
So, that you let me in is

1032
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,920
to arrest me like catching a turtle
in the jar…

1033
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,280
Wait, allow me to change a word.

1034
00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:00,920
You want to arrest me like beating…

1035
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,119
If you want to know the truth,

1036
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,519
why don't you
interrogate Si Lili by yourself?

1037
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:10,239
You're the chief interrogator.

1038
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,440
I...

1039
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,000
It's the key to her cell.

1040
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:19,880
You'll take care of the case of Si Lili.

1041
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,920
No matter what decision you will make,

1042
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:24,199
I also don't know

1043
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,239
will support you to the end.

1044
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:31,639
Why did you force me to leave at noon?

1045
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,119
You hold no official position
and is powerless.

1046
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,079
Keeping me out of the affair in public

1047
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:38,000
is actually to protect me.

1048
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,760
What if I didn't come tonight?

1049
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:43,079
The Investigator's Office
has nothing to do with you from now on.

1050
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:53,280
Who on earth are you?

1051
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,280
Why does the Investigator's Office
value you so much?

1052
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,800
What you should worry about now

1053
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,679
is your own fate.

1054
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,000
I don't understand

1055
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,320
why you protect him to this extent.

1056
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:54,639
It's what the Head asks me to do.

1057
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,400
You have been communicating
with the Head

1058
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,480
through secret letters.

1059
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,840
That's why the black knights

1060
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,000
came so timely.

1061
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,599
When will the Head return
to the capital city?

1062
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:10,920
It'll be pretty soon.

1063
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:12,559
Why does the Head value

1064
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:13,679
Fan Xian so much?

1065
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,400
Why not ask him in person?

1066
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,559
Yan Ruohai,

1067
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,440
have you known some secrets?

1068
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,840
I only do what I have been told.

1069
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:27,400
Your Excellency,

1070
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,679
a invisible sentry sent messages back,

1071
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,360
saying someone is approaching secretly.

1072
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,400
There's really someone
who wants to kill her.

1073
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:41,119
what I've done clearly?

1074
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,639
Your fate will

1075
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,800
be decided by me.

1076
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:48,320
I know,

1077
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,119
Then tell me the whole story about

1078
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:50,800
the assassination

1079
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,320
Tell me?

1080
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,400
I'm from Beiqi and ordered to lurk.

1081
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:01,400
And I have the right to invoke fellows
in the capital city.

1082
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,880
I'm restricted to nothing

1083
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:05,800
except for the royal orders.

1084
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,360
So, you mean it's the Beiqi royal family

1085
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,760
that wants to kill me.

1086
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:18,920
Mr. Fan, although you are
endowed with civil and martial virtues,

1087
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,639
I'm afraid you don't have the status.

1088
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:23,559
So what?

1089
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:25,480
what's the truth?

1090
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,159
Someone found that

1091
00:58:31,159 --> 00:58:32,199
I am a secret agent.

1092
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,280
Have you disclosed some clues?

1093
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,360
Not exactly.

1094
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,239
Chen Jushu, who lurked
outside the capital city

1095
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,000
was also caught by him

1096
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:46,119
and sent to the capital city secretly.

1097
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:48,719
But the traces of Cheng Jushu

1098
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,719
were only available

1099
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:51,880
to big shots in Beiqi.

1100
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,480
Big shots of Beiqi were
involved in the case?

1101
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,599
Then who else could disclose

1102
00:58:58,639 --> 00:58:59,559
my identity?

1103
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,320
What happened later?

1104
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,599
Chen Jushu is obstinate and unruly,

1105
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:08,679
so, the guy came to the Joy Tsin House

1106
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:10,679
and forced me to hand out
the token of a secret agent.

1107
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:11,960
If I didn't obey what he said,

1108
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,119
he would disclose my identity.

1109
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,000
Would Cheng Jushu obey the order,

1110
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:16,960
if he saw the token?

1111
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:18,880
Exactly.

1112
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:21,199
I didn't know the one he wanted to kill

1113
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,360
was you the other day.

1114
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,239
Later I heard
the Niulan Street assassination,

1115
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,000
I got to know that I wouldn't make it,

1116
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:30,760
so I burned the boat
and left the capital city.

1117
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:32,519
Next?

1118
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,320
I got caught up by you.

1119
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,960
There is one point
that doesn't make sense.

1120
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:41,920
Now that that guy could

1121
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,519
catch Cheng Jushu, the Eighth Dan
Martial Arts Master of Beiqi alive,

1122
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:45,400
why did he make the unnecessary move?

1123
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:46,840
Why not come to kill me in person?

1124
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:49,360
I guess

1125
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,800
they don't want to use their followers

1126
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:53,199
to avoid releasing the clues.

1127
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:57,320
What matters the most is

1128
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,159
who wants to kill me.

1129
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:03,920
Let me leave the capital city,

1130
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,079
and I'll tell you who he is.

1131
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,400
I can't just let you go.

1132
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,320
The most I can do is keep you alive.

1133
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,679
I'd rather die than years
be held in captivity.

1134
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:21,880
Staying alive promises hope, right?

1135
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,960
I don't want to stay alive in this way.

1136
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:24,679
You won't tell me?

1137
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,320
I won't.

1138
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,679
Whatever moves you have,

1139
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:30,840
then use them.

1140
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:02,920
I won't torture you
with cruel penalties.

1141
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,920
You're soft-hearted?

1142
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:07,000
Besides,

1143
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,599
I will tell you

1144
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,480
what I'm going to do.

1145
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:13,639
Except putting me to torture,

1146
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:15,760
what else can you do?

1147
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,679
To be honest,

1148
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,039
I've no idea.

1149
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:31,280
how many floors the dungeon has.

1150
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:33,519
You can go ask first.

1151
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:36,679
I will ask someone to dig

1152
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,239
a small enough dark room

1153
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:41,760
under the deepest floor

1154
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:45,039
