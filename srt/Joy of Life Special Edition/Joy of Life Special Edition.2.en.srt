00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:40,123
=Joy of Life Special Edition=

2
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:43,043
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,200
Master Fei, we've checked.

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,120
The inn is safe.

5
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,799
Good. Then we'll rest here.

6
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,439
Yes.

7
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,120
I will walk around

8
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,000
to see if there's anything strange.

9
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,319
OK.

10
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,080
I know you'll follow me.

11
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,240
Where did you get this?

12
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,280
I took it from a fruit ranch nearby.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,560
Where are you going?

14
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,439
Beiqi.

15
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,360
Beiqi?

16
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,800
Don't they always want to go to war with us?

17
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
The war is coming.

18
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,000
The Investigator's Office established
an intelligence network

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,400
in Beiqi years ago.

20
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,319
The performance was bad. They need a head.

21
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:35,319
So they send you there?

22
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,120
Me? I'm only good at poisoning others.

23
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,240
I'm seeing someone off.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,199
The one sitting in the carriage?

25
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

26
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:45,879
It's Yan Ruohai's son,

27
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,560
Yan Bingyun.

28
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,360
Really a promising young man.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
How can you send such an excellent
young man to an enemy country?

30
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,560
It's all because of you.

31
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,319
Because of me?

32
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,919
That Teng Zijing you killed is a scout of the Fourth Division.

33
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,159
A member of the Fourth Division
actually tried to kill his superior.

34
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,080
Yan Ruohai must take the responsibility.

35
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:05,800
Teng Zijing

36
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,800
is under the command of his son Yan Bingyun.

37
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,520
The Head was so angry that
he dismissed him from his post,

38
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,439
asking him to disguise with his men as trade caravan

39
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,680
to take over the intelligence network in Beiqi.

40
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,000
It's pretty serious.

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm kind of seeing him off,
and kind of keeping up the formation.

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,879
I killed a member of our division. Am I in trouble?

43
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,719
Teng Zijing is not a regular member of the Investigator's Office.

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
He is relatively new to our office.

45
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,199
So it's no big deal.

46
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,560
But you were lucky this time.

47
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:34,800
What do you mean?

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,879
The Fourth Division is in charge of detection and patrol.

49
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,080
The Sixth Division is the division responsible for assassination.

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,759
Whoever wants to kill you didn't try hard enough.

51
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,599
The fake order wasn't given to the Sixth Division,

52
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,840
so the scout of the Fourth Division took action.

53
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,159
If someone from the Sixth Division took the order,

54
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,039
then you were in real trouble.

55
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,039
I didn't know there are so many stories behind.

56
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,479
Well, you should go back.

57
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,960
And listen,

58
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,879
next time you take pears,

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,840
do pick those big, fatty ones.

60
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,080
Those are much sweeter.

61
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,000
Fan Xian.

62
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,560
Yan Bingyun.

63
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,079
Do you stop me

64
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
to avenge Teng Zijing's death?

65
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,120
Teng Zijing didn't deserve to die.

66
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,959
I already killed him. What do you want?

67
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,519
Give me the token for Director-General.

68
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,680
So you want to take it by force?

69
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,279
Give it to me!

70
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,439
Come on!

71
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,639
Yan Bingyun.

72
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:57,560
You should remember the order you've taken.

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,240
You can't get off the carriage

74
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,199
before arriving in Beiqi.

75
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,279
Fan Xian is cruel and mischievous.

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,680
If he keeps the token,

77
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,199
the Investigator's Office
as well as Nanqing will be in danger.

78
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,800
If you get off this carriage,

79
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,920
our undercover operation in Beiqi will be ruined.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,120
By then,

81
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,279
you will be the one

82
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,519
who puts Nanqing in danger.

83
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,000
I won't get off the carriage.

84
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,959
You guys! Take his token for me.

85
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,920
Whoever moves will be killed immediately.

86
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,720
That's right.

87
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,439
Go back and rest.

88
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,959
We still have a long way to go tomorrow.

89
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,040
Fan Xian, we'll meet again.

90
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,279
He won't be back for a minute.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,639
Wait a moment!

92
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,720
Mr. Fan!

93
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
It's a long way from Danzhou to the capital city.

94
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,160
You must be tired.

95
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,680
Do I know you?

96
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,160
I've admired you for a long time.

97
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,839
It's a pity that I never got the chance to meet you.

98
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,120
Today we finally meet. I feel so honored.

99
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,240
Fine. Let's find a place to talk

100
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,040
some other day.

101
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,839
I'm not available today. I need to get back at once.

102
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:48,560
See you.

103
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,040
Wait a moment.

104
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,959
You want to check me?

105
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:57,920
Of course not.

106
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,000
I have something to show you.

107
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,199
This map

108
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,319
illustrates the scenic spots of the capital city in detail.

109
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,920
You are here for the first time.

110
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,199
It might be useful.

111
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,959
Thank you!

112
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,680
Two taels of silver will be enough.

113
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,160
Two taels?

114
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,079
This map

115
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,439
is made of fine paper

116
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,639
and drawn with fine brush and imperial ink.

117
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,600
I worked my heart out

118
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,639
to paint it myself

119
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,959
after carrying out repeated surveys and explorations.

120
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,040
Besides,

121
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,240
it's the last one left.

122
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,879
Only two taels of silver.

123
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,480
It won't even cover

124
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,000
the trips I've taken and the tea I've had.

125
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,319
Two taels of silver! Here you are!

126
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:02,920
Let's go!

127
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,279
It's more than two taels!

128
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,560
Everyone,

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,759
see you later.

130
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,319
Wang,

131
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,320
how many of your crappy maps have you sold?

132
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,679
Almost every young man from official families

133
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,080
who came a long way to the capital city has bought my map.

134
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,919
Aren't you afraid of being beaten up?

135
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,159
For those who are from big families, two taels of silver

136
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,320
are no big deal.

137
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,480
Moreover,

138
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,960
there're so many cunning foxes

139
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,000
in the capital city.

140
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,440
I'm also helping them grow up faster.

141
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,279
Thank you! Thank you!

142
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,799
Why not tear it up?

143
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,960
It's two taels of silver after all.

144
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,120
Walk along this road,

145
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:10,639
and you'll see the Fan mansion.

146
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,320
Let's part here.

147
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:14,159
Are you leaving?

148
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,200
I've told you. When I arrive in the capital city,

149
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,559
I've something personal to deal with.

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Thanks for taking me in.

151
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,360
We'll probably never see each other again.

152
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,639
Come to me if you need anything.

153
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,600
I might be able to help.

154
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,440
You are probably unable to protect yourself.

155
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:28,600
If Liu Ruyu really wants to kill you,

156
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:29,519
I'm afraid it won't be easy for you

157
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,480
to enter the Fan mansion.

158
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,120
Please don't die.

159
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,720
Even if you die, I won't avenge on your death.

160
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,960
Thanks for your blessings.

161
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,840
Let's see how you are gonna kill me.

162
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,240
The guards are needed elsewhere.

163
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,399
I'll escort you back home.

164
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,399
I was just told that

165
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,679
I can reach the Fan mansion by going straight.

166
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,200
Why do you make a turn?

167
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,000
A carriage turned over in front.
We have to make a detour.

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,360
Young Master, I need to answer the call of nature.

169
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,480
Please wait a moment.

170
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:09,960
What is this temple?

171
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,360
Get out!

172
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,320
Having overbearing vitality Qi

173
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,120
at such a young age,

174
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,120
who are you?

175
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,759
You don't know who I am?

176
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
I really don't care.

177
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,159
Someone important is praying in the divine temple.

178
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:43,080
No one shall enter.

179
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,679
So I'm not expected.

180
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,320
The man inside the divine temple said

181
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,080
all citizens of Nanqing can worship in the temple.

182
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,159
You can go inside.

183
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:13,600
But you can only enter the side palace hall,

184
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:14,919
not the main hall.

185
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,080
What if I don't go inside?

186
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,000
Then just leave. Cut the crap.

187
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,000
What does the temple worship?

188
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:41,240
Any temple for worshipping is a divine temple.

189
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,279
How could you not know that?

190
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,799
Divine temple?

191
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,600
When heaven was separated from earth,
giant monsters ran wild.

192
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,919
Master from the divine temple
came to earth with dignity and virtue,

193
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,759
teaching mankind characters and etiquette

194
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,080
and helping mankind cutting mountains and making seas,

195
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,840
thus laying foundation for the human race.

196
00:13:57,799 --> 00:13:59,320
Haven't you learned that from your parents?

197
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,840
Mythology.

198
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,080
You really don't know who I am?

199
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:15,759
Anyway, don't step into the main hall.

200
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,759
No ambushes.

201
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,960
Is it really a coincidence?

202
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,200
No statue of God as I expected.

203
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,679
Mythology.

204
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,720
For me, I never believe in God.

205
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,320
Yet, I don't know

206
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,759
how I came to the world.

207
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,399
If there really is a divine temple,

208
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,200
please do send down an envoy

209
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,080
to explain to me.

210
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,519
If you give me the answer,

211
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,679
I will do you the favor of

212
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,320
believing in you.

213
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,000
Food and accommodation all covered.
Just think about it.

214
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
I have a question for you.

215
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,519
Are you an assassin?

216
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,120
Not really.

217
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,279
Then, are you sent by the God?

218
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:47,759
Not really either.

219
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,960
I think you are.

220
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,200
Who... who are you?

221
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,359
Are you OK?

222
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm fine.

223
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,400
After vomiting several times, I just get used to it.

224
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,640
My Lady! My Lady!

225
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,079
Are you leaving?

226
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,319
Are you with that man of importance

227
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:54,000
in the main hall?

228
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:01,799
Hand, please.

229
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:28,519
I forgot to ask her name.

230
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:24,440
When did you get back?

231
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,920
Young Master, I've waited for a long time.

232
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,160
Follow that carriage!

233
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Where are you going?

234
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,160
That way.

235
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:40,599
Well.

236
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,599
Young Master, aren't we going back the mansion?

237
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:43,599
Who told you to go to the mansion?

238
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,440
Follow that carriage!

239
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,440
Make a turn.

240
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,759
Make a turn!

241
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:47,839
That way.

242
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,319
OK!

243
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,640
Your Majesty!

244
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,519
Who's that young man?

245
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,680
He must be the bastard son of
Assistant Minister of Ministry of Revenue

246
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,279
from Danzhou.

247
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,519
He's called Fan Xian, I think.

248
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:12,200
Tell me what you think.

249
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,160
That young man suddenly appeared today.

250
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:16,079
It was not an accident.

251
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:17,079
It was...

252
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,039
It was arranged by Your Majesty.

253
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:23,359
Why should I arrange that?

254
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,200
I dare not guess Your Majesty's intentions.

255
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:30,440
Speak!

256
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,559
Yes.

257
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,279
It's because Your Majesty wanted to see him.

258
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,359
Did Fan Xian kneel down

259
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,000
in the side palace hall?

260
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,680
I've paid attention.

261
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,279
Fan Xian didn't kneel down in the Qing Temple.

262
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,839
Refuse to kneel down before the God.

263
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:56,720
It tastes bad.

264
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,440
But don't forget to leave

265
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,119
two taels of silver.

266
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,440
Yes.

267
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:03,960
Gong Dian.

268
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,039
Yes, Your Majesty!

269
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,039
I heard that the Crown Prince gave you a painting,

270
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,680
and you like it very much.

271
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:18,440
I acknowledge my sin!

272
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,599
Let's go back to the Imperial Palace.

273
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,000
It's natural for man to have hobbies.

274
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,359
That's no sin.

275
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,960
I see.

276
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,599
Your Highness, I'm honored to see you.

277
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,720
Haven't I told you before? Haven't I told you before?

278
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:58,960
We both love calligraphy and painting,

279
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,160
Li Chengqian, the Crown Prince of Nanqing and we share similar tastes and interests.

280
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,519
We are friends.

281
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,559
No need to be too polite.

282
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,880
These calligraphy works and paintings

283
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,759
are the most precious ones

284
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,680
I've collected over the years.

285
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,039
The rest of my collection

286
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,839
have been burnt to ashes.

287
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:54,200
This is the famous painting from the former dynasty

288
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,200
bestowed to me by Your Highness.

289
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,200
I beg Your Highness take it back.

290
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,200
Gong Dian, you don't have to do this.

291
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,880
Today, His Majesty said that

292
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,079
it's natural for man to have hobbies.

293
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,559
Your Highness, from today on,

294
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,720
I have no hobbies.

295
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,319
Your Highness, you're the
Crown Prince of the Eastern Palace.

296
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:22,960
It's understandable that

297
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,079
you have to associate with civil and military officials.

298
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,960
But I'm in charge of the imperial palace

299
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,880
and I have to guard beside His Majesty.

300
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,079
If I develop a deep

301
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,359
personal relationship with you,

302
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:38,960
can His Majesty feel relieved?

303
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,119
Today, His Majesty

304
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,160
also said the following words.

305
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:47,839
The worship ritual went on smoothly today.

306
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,000
You've done well.

307
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,440
I didn't realize what he meant at that time.

308
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,240
Later after careful consideration, I felt so frightened.

309
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,880
His Majesty knew that

310
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,839
I was deeply associated with Your Highness.

311
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:04,799
Yet, he put me

312
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,279
in charge of safety

313
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,680
for this secret trip out.

314
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,559
It's not easy for you to give such sincere advice.

315
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:24,119
Others might not dare to

316
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,920
say those words.

317
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,599
I've committed a deadly sin.

318
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,400
As for this painting,

319
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,799
I'll take it back.

320
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:47,079
From now on,

321
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,640
we should carry out our own duties.

322
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,880
No need to meet in private.

323
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,680
Your Highness, thanks for your understanding.

324
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:58,960
I'll excuse myself.

325
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:30,839
Here we are, Young Master.

326
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,079
Careful! Careful! Careful!

327
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,960
The carriage will be returned to the back door.

328
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,200
Young Master, please enter the mansion by yourself.

329
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,079
Return? You're not from the Fan mansion?

330
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,519
I am Fan Xian.

331
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,160
I am Fan Xian.

332
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:21,799
Young Master.

333
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,079
This way, please.

334
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,319
The side door?

335
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:37,480
Stop!

336
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,559
Who's that?

337
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,599
That's the private adviser of the mansion
who's in charge of bookkeeping.

338
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,480
I can't hit you that far.

339
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:46,319
Stand here.

340
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,559
Keep running! Huh?

341
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,839
Hide! Huh?

342
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,079
Today, I'm gonna...

343
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,000
You're a bookkeeping guy,

344
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,079
but you runs faster than a rabbit.

345
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,640
Catch your breath before chasing him again.

346
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,039
Why do you hold a drumstick?

347
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,799
This is not a drumstick.

348
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,640
It's a girl.

349
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:12,799
Girl?

350
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:20,000
Do you understand?

351
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
Neither do I.

352
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:24,920
What's this?

353
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,599
I don't know.

354
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,359
I don't know.

355
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,240
Do you know who I am?

356
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,039
Probably.

357
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,599
All right.

358
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:31,680
Then open it for me.

359
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:33,720
Why not open it by yourself?

360
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,720
Has Fan Xian arrived at the inner yard?

361
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,680
Not yet, Madam.

362
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,599
What takes him so long?

363
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,119
Shall I go check out?

364
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,359
No hurry. Let him take time.

365
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:00,920
Liu Ruyu, Fan Xian's stepmother When he arrives at the inner yard,

366
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,839
let him wait inside the yard.

367
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,680
I'll see him after my nap.

368
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,039
Yes.

369
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,039
Come on! Try harder!

370
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,960
Come on! Try harder!

371
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:12,000
Almost open! Almost!

372
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:12,960
Try harder! Try!

373
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,079
Come on! Almost open!

374
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:20,799
Come on! Come on! Come on!

375
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:21,559
Open it for me!

376
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:23,000
I can't open it, either.

377
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,559
You know where this is?

378
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,440
It's the Fan mansion.

379
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:26,519
Everyone here

380
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:27,240
respects me.

381
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,119
Whatever I ask them to do,

382
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:28,880
they'll do it.

383
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,559
Now, I'm asking you

384
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:30,759
to open the box for me.

385
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:31,680
There's something wrong with your words.

386
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:32,400
What's wrong?

387
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:33,279
You just said that

388
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,359
everyone here respects you.

389
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:34,680
Right.

390
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,160
You also said that

391
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,200
they'll obey whatever you say.

392
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,759
That's right.

393
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:37,480
Then what if you ask them

394
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,440
to beat you to death?

395
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,160
If they do what you say,

396
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,880
they'll have to hurt you,

397
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,119
which means they don't respect you.

398
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,000
If they don't beat you,

399
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,960
then they are not at your command.

400
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,160
See? You're self-contradictory.

401
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,759
Only one of the two conditions can be satisfied.

402
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,039
Let's go.

403
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,119
That makes sense.

404
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,599
Is that my younger brother?

405
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,359
Yes.

406
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,200
Why did he chase the bookkeeping guy?

407
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,039
Madam Liu Ruyu is having an afternoon nap.

408
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,079
He probably took the chance to ask for money.

409
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,640
The bookkeeping guy runs so fast.

410
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,519
Having been chased for years,

411
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,119
he is quite a runner now.

412
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,839
That kid has quite a temper.

413
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,880
I dare not talk of him behind his back.

414
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,279
Young Master Fan Xian,

415
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,519
we've arrived at the inner yard.

416
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,000
Where's Liu Ruyu?

417
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,640
Where's Madam Liu Ruyu?

418
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,160
Madam Liu Ruyu is napping inside.

419
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,039
She asked you to wait.

420
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:25,799
I'll wait inside.

421
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,039
Young Master, that's not appropriate.

422
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,200
Wait in the yard?

423
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,640
Then I'll wait here.

424
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,880
This yard is quite tranquil.

425
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,200
He's outside?

426
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:47,279
Yes, Madam.

427
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,480
He's standing there.

428
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:51,599
Anxious or angry?

429
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:52,559
Neither.

430
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:54,160
He said

431
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,079
he also wanted to nap for a while.

432
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,720
Wait a minute!

433
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,640
Why does he hold a drumstick?

434
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:06,640
I don't know.

435
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,440
He's been holding it all the way
since he entered the mansion.

436
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,039
And he doesn't take a bite.

437
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,319
Will it be a custom of Danzhou?

438
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,079
Forget it!

439
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,759
Who gave him the chair?

440
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,759
He grabbed it himself.

441
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,559
This young man from Danzhou

442
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,720
might not be easy to handle.

443
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,839
Then let's see him.

444
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,839
You must be Xian'er.

445
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,519
You must be tired after such a long way.

446
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,720
I did take a nap just now.

447
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,599
I don't mean to snub you.

448
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,799
That's fine. That's fine.

449
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,440
If you don't wake me up,

450
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,680
I might still be sleeping.

451
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,759
Madam, have a seat.

452
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,440
The people in Danzhou are simple and honest.

453
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,559
Now look at you.

454
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,799
You're really raised well.

455
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:04,519
Though you lack certain grace,

456
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:07,839
you do seem naïve and natural.

457
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,440
Naïve and natural.

458
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,640
She suggests that I'm like a wild monkey!

459
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,119
Madam, you really flatter me.

460
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,559
Desolated as Danzhou is,

461
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,400
I've never met someone like you.

462
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,279
So elegant! So refined!

463
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:18,680
If I didn't know in advance,

464
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,799
I'm sure to mistake you as the principle wife of my father.

465
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:23,400
The little bastard is suggesting

466
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,759
I'm only a concubine.

467
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,640
Where's the man with a box?

468
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,799
Well.

469
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,440
I came out so hurriedly

470
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,440
that I forgot to take my reception gift

471
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,119
for you.

472
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:36,240
Wait a minute.

473
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,640
Where is he?

474
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:45,319
I've seen you. Stay where you are.

475
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,480
I'll beat you to death when I get over.

476
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,079
I've figured it out.

477
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,720
Why should I

478
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,960
beat myself to death?

479
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,079
How should I know?

480
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,400
Are you playing me?

481
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,440
What do you think?

482
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,440
Madam, Young Master didn't get the money,

483
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,960
so he's really irritable now.

484
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,519
I'm afraid he'll go violent.

485
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,160
I know.

486
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,319
Why else do I excuse myself?

487
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,960
If I'm there,

488
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,920
he will be restrained.

489
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,279
Young Master.

490
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,200
really beats up Fan Xian?

491
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,119
My son is legitimate.

492
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,079
Fan Xian is just a bastard.

493
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,960
They're radically different.

494
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,480
If Fan Xian is beaten up

495
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,200
the first day he enters our mansion,

496
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,440
he will be looked down upon ever since.

497
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,480
But Madam,

498
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,119
I heard that Fan Xian can practice martial arts.

499
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,000
What if

500
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,039
he beats Young Master up

501
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,200
instead?

502
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:43,640
Just let him.

503
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,160
Beating up the legitimate son upon arrival at our mansion,

504
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:48,680
and being ferocious and mischievous
without due respect for the hierarchy,

505
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,920
how can my husband keep him?

506
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Don't you think

507
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,400
you're a bit out of line?

508
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,599
I'm still standing.

509
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,000
How come you are seated?

510
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:02,599
Stand up!

511
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,200
Give me your hand!

512
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,200
Where's everyone?

513
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:13,000
How did you enter the inner yard?

514
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,000
Who the hell are you?

515
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,839
Fan Xian.

516
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,599
Fan Xian.

517
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:19,240
You're that bastard son

518
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,119
from Danzhou?

519
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:22,279
I actually thought you're somebody!

520
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,960
Considering your status,

521
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,079
how dare you trick me?

522
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,440
Give me your hand!

523
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:27,799
What's wrong with my status?

524
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,880
I'm your elder brother.

525
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,119
Elder brother is like father.

526
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:31,880
In that sense,

527
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
I'm your father.

528
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:35,119
I'm so pissed! I...

529
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:35,759
Stop!

530
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:53,359
Ruoruo!

531
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:56,440
Brother!

532
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,119
I told you I would come.

533
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:03,839
Kneel down!

534
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,840
I just met the bookkeeping guy.

535
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,360
You tried to bully him again!

536
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,519
He... he ran so fast.

537
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,719
How could I catch him?

538
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,239
Aren't you supposed to

539
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,519
be studying now?

540
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,800
I can pardon you for all these!

541
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,639
Really?

542
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:33,840
Kneel back!

543
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,480
Give it to me.

544
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,599
Sister, you just said you could pardon me!

545
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:47,320
Give it to me.

546
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,079
Now I punish you

547
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,519
for being rude to our elder brother.

548
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,880
-He's just a bastard! -Open your hand!

549
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,440
Sister, you actually beat me for a stranger!

550
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,000
Fan Sizhe!

551
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:09,000
The other hand!

552
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,119
Never call our elder brother by his name!

553
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,199
Nor can you show disrespect!

554
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,679
If it ever happens again, I'll punish you again!

555
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:24,800
Do you remember?

556
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:27,960
Get up!

557
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,039
Grown up as he is,

558
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,320
he turns to mom for help all the time.

559
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:47,719
Mom! Mom!

560
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:51,920
Brother, how's your trip?

561
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,000
Come over to my room.

562
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:56,599
Who came up with the name

563
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:57,239
Fan Sizhe?
(Same pronunciation with Versace in Chinese)

564
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,440
Father did! What's wrong?

565
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,079
Really nice!

566
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,400
I'm glad he beat you!

567
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:10,800
I was... Stop drinking!

568
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,840
I was beaten!

569
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,480
When your father come back,

570
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,679
tell him that

571
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,400
you were beaten.

572
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,679
It's useless to tell him.

573
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,119
Dad is the one who asks my elder sister to discipline me!

574
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,599
Ruoruo is the one who beat you?

575
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:25,400
Yes! Who dare beat me

576
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,639
but her?

577
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,440
Haven't I sent her away

578
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,199
from home?

579
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,800
How come she's back?

580
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,000
How can I know?

581
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,920
I don't care.

582
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,320
Anyway, my hand aches now.

583
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,199
What can I do to ease you pain?

584
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,400
It'll be fine

585
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,480
with money on it.

586
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:44,400
Look at you!

587
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:45,159
How can you beat that fox

588
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,079
from Danzhou?

589
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,920
I can beat him if I have money.

590
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:49,519
You!

591
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:11,320
The handwriting of Zhuang Mohan,

592
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,480
a famous writer from Beiqi.

593
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,840
You like his handwriting?

594
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,400
It's a gift from others.

595
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,360
The sword once used by Si Gujian,

596
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,719
a great master from Dongyi Town.

597
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
The sword of a great master?

598
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,119
Really?

599
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,320
I don't know. It's also a gift.

600
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,519
Lend me a box.

601
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,519
Take the wooden one in the middle.

602
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:41,079
Who gave you all these gifts?

603
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:44,119
Just young ladies from eminent families.

604
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:44,960
Why?

605
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Asking for updates.

606
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,079
What?

607
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,360
The letters you wrote to me

608
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,840
contain many chapters of

609
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,800
the Red Mansions.

610
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:54,719
The young ladies

611
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,079
who visited me occasionally saw it

612
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,119
and found it marvelous.

613
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,519
Words spread so fast.

614
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,519
Now all the unmarried young ladies

615
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,840
in the capital city

616
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,039
are fans of your book.

617
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,880
They give me gifts every day

618
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:06,039
Asking for updates.

619
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,159
Where did you learn

620
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,639
the word "update"?

621
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:11,599
From your letters.

622
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,760
I just borrowed it.

623
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,320
They don't know

624
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,199
who wrote the book, right?

625
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,320
Do be relieved.

626
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,280
They've no idea that you wrote it.

627
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,719
I've told you so many times.

628
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,320
I really didn't write it!

629
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,679
It was written by a Mr. Cao.

630
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,679
Brother, no need to hide from me.

631
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,159
I've written to grandma.

632
00:38:31,639 --> 00:38:32,400
She said

633
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,800
there's no Mr. Cao

634
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,880
in Danzhou.

635
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,119
I know.

636
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,159
you're afraid that popularity

637
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:39,039
might cause jealousy.

638
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:40,599
Rest assured!

639
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:42,400
Your secret is safe with me!

640
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
No one will know

641
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,519
you're the greatest literary giant

642
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,280
in the world.

643
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,480
I'd better drink some tea.

644
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,239
Mom!

645
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,000
When can I leave?

646
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,800
Fan Ruoruo alone

647
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,119
is already hard to deal with.

648
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,719
It appears that Fan Xian is also cunning.

649
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,119
Can't you focus here?

650
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,960
There's nothing to be focused on!

651
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,199
He's just

652
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,280
a bastard son from Danzhou.

653
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,480
If he behaves improperly,

654
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:11,840
a good beating will do him good.

655
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,480
We can't beat him at home.

656
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,440
Well,

657
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,079
I'll ask him out for lunch tomorrow.

658
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,840
Then I'll beat him up on the street.

659
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:20,880
How do you like that?

660
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:23,199
Breaking tricks with pure force.

661
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:24,760
That's sort of a plan.

662
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:26,800
Mom!

663
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,840
To trick him out for lunch,

664
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,679
I'll need money for support.

665
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,239
Support! Support!

666
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,679
My Lady, Master's back.

667
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,400
He asks Young Master Fan Xian to see him in his study.

668
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:42,880
Keep this for me for a while.

669
00:39:43,239 --> 00:39:44,280
I was wondering

670
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,599
what's the drumstick about.

671
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:46,360
I'll tell you everything later.

672
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,519
Master wants to see Fan Xian right when he's back?

673
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,239
Yes, Madam.

674
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,480
It's no big deal.

675
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,800
Keep watching.

676
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:07,039
Yes.

677
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,440
Your father's attitude to Fan Xian

678
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,199
is of key importance.

679
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,320
Mom!

680
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:15,440
What attitude?

681
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,920
He left Fan Xian in Danzhou

682
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,719
for so many years.

683
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,320
Did he ever go back to visit him?

684
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:21,119
That's the weirdest part.

685
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,440
Your father is not a cold man.

686
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,320
If he visited Fan Xian

687
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,239
in Danzhou occasionally,

688
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:28,639
I wouldn't be so nervous.

689
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:30,039
But he just left him there

690
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,119
and ignored him.

691
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,960
It doesn't make sense.

692
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,000
So I sent someone

693
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,119
to watch Fan Xian in Danzhou.

694
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,440
I just want to know

695
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,320
whether he contacted Fan Xian secretly or not.

696
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:42,400
I find it weird

697
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,880
all the time.

698
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,880
I can't protect you

699
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,920
for a lifetime.

700
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,239
You have to rely on yourself eventually.

701
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,119
As to your future, I...

702
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,559
Money! How much will you give me?

703
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,079
Not a dime!

704
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,760
No money! Then I can't beat him.

705
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,480
I can't! I can't!

706
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,920
Master said you could go in

707
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,440
without reporting.

708
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,559
Close the door.

709
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:48,159
Madam.

710
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,400
Still inside?

711
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,480
Yes.

712
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,760
There's no sound. It's very quiet.

713
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:00,599
Sizhe! Sizhe!

714
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:02,199
Wake up!

715
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:05,280
Mom, ten taels of silver will be enough!

716
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:05,840
You...

717
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:09,519
It's improper for me to go.

718
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,960
Just go to your father's study.

719
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:13,760
Say that

720
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:15,360
you're worried that he might be hungry.

721
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,880
Ask him if he wants any pastries.

722
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:18,599
Take the chance to see

723
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,920
what Fan Xian is doing

724
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,280
in the study.

725
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,920
Mother, you're right.

726
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,280
I'll do as you command.

727
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,480
Take Young Master there.

728
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,440
Yes.

729
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,760
So obedient.

730
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,320
He's finally made some progress.

731
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,320
Lead the way faster!

732
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,360
Yes.

733
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,599
It's so late, but my dad hasn't eaten anything yet.

734
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,880
I'm so worried!

735
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:00,639
Really worried!

736
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,639
Young Master?

737
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,480
Am I silly?

738
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,159
Young Master?

739
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,039
Madam, Young Master has run away.

740
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:37,880
Feeling anxious after waiting so long?

741
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:42,239
Father, good evening!

742
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:47,760
To answer your question, I'm not anxious.

743
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:51,280
After waiting in Danzhou for so many years,

744
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,639
no need to be anxious for a little longer.

745
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,039
It sounds like a complaint.

746
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,880
Should I shed tears

747
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:01,679
and cry for an hour with you in my arms

748
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,559
to express

749
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:03,760
my regret?

750
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,360
Please don't!

751
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,280
I think so, too.

752
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:08,639
Then let's get down to business.

753
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:12,079
What kind of person do you want to become?

754
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,880
I want to become the richest man in the world,

755
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:18,920
living a peaceful and romantic life
with many young and beautiful wives.

756
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,719
Sorry, I'm a vulgar man.

757
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,079
How will you build up a fortune?

758
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:24,440
I've already thought about that!

759
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:26,920
I have a unique technique.

760
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,559
Under high temperatures,

761
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:30,920
I can make something marvelous out of sands

762
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:32,960
which is much smoother and
more transparent than the crystal.

763
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,400
I call it glass.

764
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:35,800
Once it is made...

765
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,000
Where did you get that?

766
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,039
Your mom made it before.

767
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,079
And the technique is mature.

768
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,400
Never mind. I've got something else.

769
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,960
I can use grease

770
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:56,360
to produce something special

771
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,360
which can clean both clothes and human body.

772
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,880
Smooth as grease

773
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,679
with fragrance,

774
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,719
it's far better than honey locust and wood ash.

775
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,079
I call it soap.

776
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,039
Your mom made it before.

777
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:15,440
She not only made soap,

778
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:16,960
but also perfumed soap.

779
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:18,840
That's fine.

780
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,280
Actually, I've got something else.

781
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:21,480
Nowadays,

782
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,400
besides honey,

783
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,199
sweet food are usually made of

784
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
maltose or malt.

785
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,159
Even saccharose is pretty rough.

786
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:26,800
I've got a technique

787
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,480
to further refine the saccharose into

788
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:30,119
granulated sugar as white as snow.

789
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:31,159
And the flavor is excellent.

790
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,320
White granulated sugar.

791
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:34,280
There are two full jars in the kitchen.

792
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,719
Also made by my mom?

793
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,440
Yes, your mom made it back then.

794
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,559
Why haven't I seen these things

795
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:42,599
in Danzhou?

796
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:43,840
They are only used by

797
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:45,400
influential officials

798
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:47,880
and circulated in big cities.

799
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,320
So I'm to blame

800
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,039
for living in the rural area.

801
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:53,599
Do you have any other ideas?

802
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,280
No.

803
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,360
Why is my mom always one step ahead of me?!

804
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,239
Your mom ran a firm,

805
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:11,199
so she had countless fancy ideas.

806
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:12,960
Back then, the scale of her firm

807
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,039
was already No.1

808
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,239
in the world.

809
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,159
It was the fortune center of the world.

810
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,159
I've heard about that.

811
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,960
Rumor has it that after she died,

812
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,519
the firm was registered under the state treasury.

813
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:25,679
That's not true.

814
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:27,719
It was controlled by the imperial family

815
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,519
and was named Neiku
(Homophone for underwear in Chinese).

816
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:33,639
Who came up with such a vulgar name?

817
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:34,559
Mind your words!

818
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,800
It was named by His Majesty.

819
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:42,679
What's so vulgar?

820
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:46,360
Never mind. Go on.

821
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,159
Diligent in handling complicated national affairs,

822
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,079
His Majesty has no energy

823
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:53,480
to manage Neiku in person.

824
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,400
Therefore,

825
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,920
he put Li Yunrui, the Princess Royal,

826
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,159
in charge.

827
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,559
The Princess Royal is in charge of Neiku?

828
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,760
She's extremely beautiful

829
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:15,360
and very gentle.

830
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,880
Though she's not related to His Majesty by blood,

831
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,679
she's deeply trusted.

832
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,239
And she's not married yet.

833
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,480
Father,

834
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:47,440
are you into her?

835
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Nonsense!

836
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,400
Since we met,

837
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,719
you've talked from the firm to the Princess Royal.

838
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:54,440
You said we would talk about business,

839
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:55,920
but you only talked about gossips.

840
00:48:57,039 --> 00:48:58,400
Do you know what gossip means?

841
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,880
The Princess Royal

842
00:49:00,039 --> 00:49:02,440
has a daughter with Lin Ruofu,

843
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,119
the current Prime Minister.

844
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,039
You just said

845
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,320
she's not married yet.

846
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,679
It's a big secret.

847
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,559
You're definitely gossiping!

848
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,360
The Princess Royal's daughter

849
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,440
is named Lin Wan'er.

850
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,760
She is the woman

851
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:20,360
you come to marry.

852
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:22,480
Bastard son and bastard daughter,

853
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:25,119
we're really made for each other.

854
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,960
His Majesty proclaimed that

855
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,400
whoever marries Lin Wan'er

856
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,559
can take over

857
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,679
Neiku

858
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,440
from Li Yunrui,

859
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,800
the Princess Royal.

860
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:40,639
Chen Pingping and Fei Jie

861
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:42,400
don't want you to come to the capital now.

862
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:43,880
I take you here

863
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,440
while they are away.

864
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:47,599
Because now

865
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,320
is the best chance to get back

866
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,280
your mom's properties

867
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,199
and reclaim

868
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:52,960
what should be yours in the first place.

869
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,199
Here!

870
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:09,960
This is for you.

871
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,000
What's this?

872
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,400
The summary of important things of Neiku over the years.

873
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,519
Read it carefully.

874
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,400
It's helpful for you to reclaim the properties.

875
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,119
Actually, I...

876
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:19,719
But you should be more careful.

877
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,920
Neiku is a money tree for the imperial family.

878
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,519
A lot of people don't want you to take over.

879
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:28,199
My greetings to you, Your Majesty!

880
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:30,880
Arise.

881
00:50:31,559 --> 00:50:32,480
Thank you, Your Majesty!

882
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:36,800
It's late. What brings you here?

883
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:37,760
Your Majesty!

884
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,559
Fan Xian has arrived in the capital.

885
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,000
It's the kid Earl Sinan

886
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,920
kept in Danzhou.

887
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:49,760
Wan'er was sent out of the palace

888
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:51,760
right after I gave birth to her.

889
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:54,400
I've always felt guilty

890
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,840
and wanted to find her a good husband.

891
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:58,960
But Fan Xian is a bumpkin from a remote place

892
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,480
with no fame or talent.

893
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,320
He's no match for Wan'er!

894
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,039
So, you...

895
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,039
I don't want Wan'er to marry him.

896
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:09,519
So the Princess Royal doesn't like the marriage.

897
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,000
That's right.

898
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,719
She's not happy with it from the start.

899
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:13,679
Then it's over.

900
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,639
Without the consent of the mother-in-law,

901
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:16,559
there will be no marriage.

902
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:18,119
She has no say

903
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:19,440
in your marriage with Lin Wan'er.

904
00:51:19,719 --> 00:51:20,719
She's her mom, yet she has no say in this?

905
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,880
For the imperial family,

906
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,719
family affection is never the theme.

907
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,079
You want to stop Fan Xian from marrying Wan'er?

908
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,079
Your Majesty, I beg your support!

909
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:48,079
The Princess Royal

910
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:51,960
Eunuch Hong,

911
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,599
I'm sorry.

912
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,880
When it comes to the imperial family,

913
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,920
only His Majesty can make the call.

914
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,280
No one cares if you like it or not.

915
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:19,320
That is a warning for you

916
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:21,800
to never cross the line.

917
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:26,119
Yes.

918
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:31,480
As long as His Majesty consents,

919
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:32,960
what others think

920
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:34,000
doesn't matter.

921
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:35,679
But why does His Majesty

922
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:36,519
have to make me

923
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:37,440
marry Lin Wan'er?

924
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,239
His Majesty has four sons.

925
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:41,119
The eldest one is away leading troops.

926
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,480
The youngest one is still a child.

927
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,119
Now the Crown Prince and the second prince

928
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,039
are fighting for the throne.

929
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:49,800
How is that relevant to me?

930
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:52,760
The Princess Royal has supported

931
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,039
the Crown Prince all along.

932
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:56,559
It's like the imperial wealth

933
00:52:57,239 --> 00:52:58,320
is controlled by the Crown Prince.

934
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,679
It's way too dangerous.

935
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:02,400
So the Head of Neiku must be replaced.

936
00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:03,599
Exactly.

937
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,159
By taking over Neiku,

938
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:07,519
I practically shake the foundation of the Crown Prince.

939
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:10,000
This might be the cause of

940
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:12,760
the assassination in Danzhou,

941
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,840
You mean

942
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:15,880
it's the Crown Prince and his followers who tried to kill me.

943
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,199
It's probable with interests concerned.

944
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:23,199
You've said all these

945
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,719
to clear

946
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:26,039
Liu Ruyu.

947
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,119
You don't believe me?

948
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,920
You even drag the Crown Prince into this.

949
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,280
Does it matter if I believe you or not?

950
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,039
Follow me.

951
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,400
I'm hungry.

952
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,480
Finished talking? Go ahead and take a seat.

953
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:02,519
I have to say this.

954
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:03,360
You don't want to eat,

955
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,440
but Fan Xian can be hungry.

956
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,719
We have important things to discuss. Please leave us.

957
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:30,639
Yes.

958
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:34,239
Only me?

959
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:46,679
Get out now!

960
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,199
Yes.

961
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:51,519
Did you send

962
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:54,480
Butler Zhou to Danzhou?

963
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,559
Master, you've known that.

964
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,400
Danzhou is so faraway.

965
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,719
I thought

966
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,599
it would be reassuring to send someone trustworthy

967
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:06,039
to take care of Xian'er.

968
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:07,440
He tried to assassinate Fan Xian

969
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,519
in Danzhou.

970
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,840
A...assassinate?!

971
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:13,679
You don't know that?

972
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,079
I haven't heard from him this month.

973
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,519
I've no idea.

974
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:18,599
There won't be any letters.

975
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:21,239
My mother has sent him onto a fish boat.

976
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,360
He won't get down in recent years.

977
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,840
Staying away for all these years,

978
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,880
he actually dare betray his master.

979
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,760
Thank God Xian'er is all right.

980
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,599
Butler Zhou confessed it all.

981
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,880
He had received your secret letter,

982
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:43,559
asking him to kill Fan Xian

983
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,719
with the Investigator's Office.

984
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,840
How come the Investigator's Office is also involved?

985
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,840
They also received a fake order.

986
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:53,199
The Investigator's Office only answers to His Majesty.

987
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,480
Whoever can insert spies in the Investigator's Office

988
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,639
must be from the imperial family.

989
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,960
And Lady Yi, mother of the youngest prince,

990
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,599
happens to be your cousin.

991
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:06,960
Master, you mean

992
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,119
I am the one who wants to kill Fan Xian?

993
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:08,800
Aren't you?

994
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:09,960
No, it's not me.

995
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,079
Why not?

996
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:11,719
I...

997
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:12,800
Tell him.

998
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,719
If I want to kill you,

999
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:23,960
I'll definitely

1000
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:24,960
find a stranger

1001
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,519
to do the job.

1002
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,320
I'll never ask Butler Zhou to do it.

1003
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,360
I... I'm not that stupid.

1004
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:31,039
Maybe you did it the opposite way.

1005
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,559
I have no reason to kill you.

1006
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:33,800
You don't want me to inherit the family properties.

1007
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,039
No, Fan Xian.

1008
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:36,239
I might be particular about you,

1009
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,360
and I might try to suppress you,

1010
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:38,719
but I'll never try to kill you.

1011
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:39,159
Why?

1012
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,719
If you die because of me,

1013
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,480
Master is sure to

1014
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:43,960
drive Sizhe and me out of the Fan mansion.

1015
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:46,320
I...

1016
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,280
This...

1017
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,320
Ruoruo.

1018
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,400
I think she's made a point.

1019
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,880
If she wanted to kill you,

1020
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,920
she wouldn't involve her minion.

1021
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,480
Right.

1022
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:00,960
So?

1023
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:02,920
Words alone

1024
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:03,800
can't prove anything.

1025
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:04,880
I...

1026
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:07,239
You can investigate on your own.

1027
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,239
Let's eat first.

1028
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:20,960
Father,

1029
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:22,880
I'm leaving for studying.

1030
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:24,960
Me, too.

1031
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:29,199
Yes.

1032
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:37,840
Master,

1033
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:39,159
the room for Xian'er

1034
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,119
is tidied up.

1035
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,280
I'd like to show him around now.

1036
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:43,000
See if he needs anything else.

1037
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,480
You may leave first.

1038
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:45,960
I need a word

1039
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,159
with him.

1040
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:49,079
Yes.

1041
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,280
You're in the capital city now.

1042
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:03,719
Learn to be cautious

1043
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,199
later on.

1044
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:07,719
I'm pretty cautious all the time.

1045
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,000
How can you call yourself cautious by bring
the assassin of the Investigator's Office

1046
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:13,400
to the capital city.

1047
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,880
So you know about Teng Zijing.

1048
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:17,840
The guards escorted you to the capital

1049
00:58:18,519 --> 00:58:19,519
are all elites.

1050
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,519
You really think they wouldn't notice

1051
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,239
when there was one more person.

1052
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:30,599
What's this?

1053
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,880
Arrest warrant.

1054
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,039
I found it in the files of the Ministry of Penalty.

1055
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:45,119
It's for Teng Zijing.

1056
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:46,840
What crime did he commit?

1057
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:48,639
I don't know, and I don't need to know.

1058
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,039
Just be careful of him.

1059
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,239
It's an old warrant.

1060
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,800
Anyway, he's not here now.

1061
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,960
Stay away from the Investigator's Office

1062
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:03,599
in future.

1063
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,320
Moreover,

1064
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,159
I will make secret investigations to find out

1065
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,719
whether the Crown Prince is the one who tried to kill you.

1066
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:12,159
Don't act rashly on your own.

1067
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:14,199
Act rashly?

1068
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:16,159
What can I do?

1069
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:18,880
Can I rush into the Eastern Palace and kill the Crown Prince?

1070
00:59:21,679 --> 00:59:22,800
Back then,

1071
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:26,280
your mom could really do that!

1072
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:28,199
So awesome!

1073
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,239
She was bound to no rules of the world.

1074
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:34,039
She could always

1075
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:36,360
make unexpected moves.

1076
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:40,559
How did she die?

1077
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,840
She was killed.

1078
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,119
Those who killed her, are they still alive?

1079
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,199
I've no idea.

1080
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:48,760
In theory,

1081
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,719
the villains who killed your mom

1082
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:54,679
were all wiped out back then,

1083
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,880
but Chen Pingping and I both think

1084
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,519
there is hidden danger

1085
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,719
in the capital city.

1086
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,719
So,

1087
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:08,880
I've always kept you in Danzhou.

1088
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:15,679
Eventually,

1089
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:17,480
you still take me to the capital city.

1090
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:18,559
I've told you.

1091
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:21,000
It's the best chance to get back

1092
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,440
your mom's properties

1093
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,320
You're right.

1094
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:24,960
Well.

1095
01:00:25,719 --> 01:00:27,960
You're also tired. Have a good rest.

1096
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,920
As to your marriage with Lin Wan'er,

1097
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:37,719
I'll arrange everything for you.

1098
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,159
No need to worry about anything.

1099
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,440
I don't want to marry her.

1100
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:43,960
What did you say?

1101
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:44,960
I said

1102
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,320
I didn't want to marry Lin Wan'er.

1103
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,639
I've said so much,

1104
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,519
but you still don't get it?

1105
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:52,519
I get it.

1106
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:55,639
My mom used to have a firm.

1107
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,559
Now it belongs

1108
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:57,760
to the imperial family.

1109
01:00:58,519 --> 01:00:59,599
By marrying Lin Wan'er,

1110
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:00,760
I can take the firm back.

1111
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,119
Now is the perfect chance.

1112
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,000
I understand all the things you've said.

1113
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,800
I just don't want to marry her.

1114
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:06,599
Why?

1115
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:07,840
I'm falling in love with

1116
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,760
a drumstick thief.

1117
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:10,000
What's this?

1118
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:12,559
Actually, it has nothing to do with her.

1119
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:14,599
Even if I hadn't met her,

1120
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,119
I still won't marry Lin Wan'er.

1121
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,880

your mom's painstaking labor for a lifetime.

1123
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:22,400

1124
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:27,199

1125
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,440

1126
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:29,599

1127
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:35,920

1128
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:38,960
It can move.
