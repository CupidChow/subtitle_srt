Xie Bi'an?

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,480
is not only good sword

18
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,640
but also a scary one.

19
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,879
Let him in.

20
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,400
You sent Wan'er back?

21
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,960
I don't remember
having such pavilion before.

22
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,240
Just built it.

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,639
Watch out!

24
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,800
There is no base!

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,000
This will be removed after the drink.

26
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,719
This is just for a drink?

27
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,639
You can't leave me waiting

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,680
in the middle of the road, right?

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,680
So I built this pavilion.

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,039
Why do you look at me like that?

31
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,719
As a prince,

32
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,599
wouldn't it be a breach of duty

33
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,360
if I don't live extravagantly?

34
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,759
That makes sense.

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,039
A toast to you.

36
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:55,639
Good liquor.

37
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,319
Is it?

38
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,199
With the support of this scenery,

39
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,639
any liquor can be good.

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,400
When do you set out?

41
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,680
In a couple of days.

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,400
When you come back,

43
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,319
you'll enjoy enviable reputation.

44
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,439
By then, the imperial examinations
held in spring will start soon.

45
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll plead His Majesty

46
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,080
to appoint you as the examiner.

47
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,360
I don't have any reputation.

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,280
The title of the Poetic Genius Fan
is enough.

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,439
Once you organize
the imperial examinations held in spring,

50
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,280
you'll become the examiner
of those students.

51
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,360
It's hard to fully describe

52
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,120
the advantages behind it.

53
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,159
Feel it yourself.

54
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,520
I'm just curious

55
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,159
why Your Highness
give such a good chance

56
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,479
to me.

57
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,960
You're not hateful

58
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,319
and can drink with me together.

59
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,120
Even if you follow the Crown Prince
in the end,

60
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,520
we can still be friends.

61
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,400
Your Highness is most generous.

62
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,000
There are a lot of routes to the north.

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,079
The guardian at Fengming Pass
is my follower.

64
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,040
If you go through there,
I'll ask him to protect you.

65
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:31,759
Thank you,

66
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,360
but we probably won't
go through Fengming

67
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,360
this time.

68
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:35,959
Because it's a long route.

69
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,079
Then forget about it.

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,000
The feast is over and
now it's time to move apart.

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,279
It is a pretty good day.

72
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,279
I'll wait for your return.

73
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,399
See you!

74
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,639
Don't tell anyone

75
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,439
about which pass you'll go through

76
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:36,639
for today's journey.

77
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,720
Keep the decision to yourself only.

78
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,000
I understand.

79
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,519
Your poison technique
is better than ever.

80
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,839
This is newly made.

81
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,600
Smash it at critical moment.

82
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,279
It won't take any lives

83
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:54,279
or hurt anyone physically,

84
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,680
but even Great Masters

85
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,759
will sleep quite a while from it.

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,439
Thank you, Teacher!

87
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,040
No problem.

88
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,360
Just don't show off with it.

89
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,000
The little emperor clearly requires

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,160
to send Si Lili back to Beiqi.

91
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,920
Do they have any private relationship?

92
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,240
Don't stare at her!

93
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,120
The curtain is specially made.

94
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
She can't hear what we're talking about.

95
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,639
It doesn't make sense.

96
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,360
If the little emperor

97
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,279
really has a private relationship
with her,

98
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,600
why did he send her to the capital city

99
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,360
as a secret agent?

100
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,279
Here comes Xiao En.

101
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,759
The smell of sunlight.

102
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,879
Go! Go! Hurry!

103
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,360
Do you have family?

104
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,600
Tell them to stay alive.

105
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,480
I will find them.

106
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,759
It's your luck to get out.

107
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,439
Don't irritate the descendants
at this time.

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,319
You'll regret it

109
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,720
if he kills you by mistake.

110
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,040
If I'm killed,

111
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,560
so will be you son.

112
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,279
You'll regret that.

113
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,960
Then stay alive and stop flaunting.

114
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,279
Otherwise the Investigator's Office
will catch you again.

115
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,919
Chen Pingping,

116
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,240
Fei Jie!

117
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,559
You are still alive.

118
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,200
Very good!

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,080
What are you laughing at?

120
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,399
What is he laughing at?

121
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,480
I'm laughing at your legs.

122
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,000
They're destroyed by me.

123
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,080
I thought you are laughing at yourself.

124
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,840
As a loser being imprisoned in jail

125
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,039
for so many years

126
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,279
who couldn't move an inch,

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,360
do you feel very comfortable?

128
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,720
Hold him!

129
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,360
You're old now.

130
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,320
Control your temper

131
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,559
and care for your own health.

132
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,559
Do you really let me go back?

133
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,759
Do you really want to stay?

134
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,360
You'll regret it.

135
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,200
He is Fan Xian,
Director-General of the Investigator's Office.

136
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:00,879
He'll escort you.

137
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,399
Nice to see you, Senor Xiao.
How are you doing?

138
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,559
Are you going to escort me?

139
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:08,480
Yup!

140
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:10,000
Who are these people to you?

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,080
Master Fei is my teacher.

142
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,600
The Head is my senior friend.

143
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,080
They all treat me like families.

144
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,360
Take a good look at this kid.

145
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,480
This will be your last chance.

146
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,960
You should
take a good look at this yard,

147
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,159
as you may come back again
in the future.

148
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,639
Be careful on the way.
You're still too young.

149
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:33,960
I'll learn from you.

150
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,519
Fan Xian,

151
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,039
the mission and your carriage

152
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,000
are meeting you outside the city.

153
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:57,440
I appreciate your hard work.

154
00:10:57,679 --> 00:10:58,480
Please trust me.

155
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,960
I'll surely bring your son back safely

156
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,279
to the capital city.

157
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,480
Fan Xian,

158
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,960
let's go! I'll walk you there.

159
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,240
You go first.

160
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,759
I need to talk to him in private.

161
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,639
Send your teacher back early.

162
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,200
He's got injury on his body.

163
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,399
What?

164
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,840
He had a sticky fight

165
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,720
against the Embroidered Uniform
Guards of Shen Zhong in Beiqi.

166
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,159
Upon hearing that you're going to Beiqi,

167
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,879
he rode the horse for 800 miles

168
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,639
to get back to the capital city

169
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,159
and experienced six assassinations,

170
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:55,120
but he didn't stop
for any single minute.

171
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:57,919
He wasn't like this in the past.

172
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:00,960
Your appearance

173
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,799
changed us both.

174
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,320
He should take a rest.

175
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,080
Let me get him back.

176
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,799
Go to the Taiping Residence.

177
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,799
Someone wants to see you.

178
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,360
It could have not been you

179
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,360
to lead the mission to Beiqi this time.

180
00:12:57,039 --> 00:12:58,279
Then why is it me in the end?

181
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:02,600
You're young.
You should take up the challenge

182
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,120
to cultivate your mind and intelligence.

183
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,519
Your Majesty think
I have mental defects?

184
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,360
Do you know

185
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,200
what the missions are this time?

186
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,399
I heard there are a few,

187
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,600
but I am only told

188
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,080
to get Yan Bingyun back.

189
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,799
Nothing else.

190
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:22,960
Are my missions

191
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,600
assigned by Your Majesty in person?

192
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,080
Find the chance to kill Xiao En

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,480
after taking back Yan Bingyun.

194
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,039
You want me

195
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,919
to kill Xiao En

196
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,519
under the eyes of the Beiqi people?

197
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,399
There doesn't seem to be anything else

198
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,200
other than that.

199
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,639
And I can tell you

200
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,559
the Investigator's Office won't help you

201
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,759
as it may become suspicious as a result.

202
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,720
Your Majesty really flattered me.

203
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,320
What else do you have to say?

204
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,799
I do have a doubt.

205
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,320
Go ahead.

206
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,120
You can talk to me
in the palace as well.

207
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Why do you choose here?

208
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,200
This is different from the palace.

209
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,399
We're in
the monarch-subject relationship in palace,

210
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:01,919
but here...

211
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:02,679
What's the difference?

212
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,559
Come back alive.

213
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,679
What did you just say, Your Majesty?

214
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,320
Remember to come back alive.

215
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:15,399
It doesn't matter

216
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,039
even if the mission fails

217
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:17,080
as long as I can come back alive?

218
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,039
Don't ask while knowing the answer.

219
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:22,240
This is my order!

220
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,120
Piss off!

221
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:04,039
There is merely
monarch-subject relationship in the palace.

222
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,399
How different is it

223
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,320
in Taiping Residence?

224
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,200
You've met His Majesty?

225
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,559
I felt like I've met a fake emperor.

226
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,600
Do you think

227
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,399
about the mission this time?

228
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,120
Nothing.

229
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,240
Don't worry, Teacher.

230
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,279
Initially, I wanted to go to Beiqi

231
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,320
along with you.

232
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,039
No!

233
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,879
Head Chen has also said

234
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,000
I have killed too many Beiqi agents.

235
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,360
If I go with you,

236
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:30,879
it may be bad for you.

237
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,200
Just stay in the capital city
for a rest.

238
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,840
Wait for my return.

239
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,039
Pay special attention to
such a few people

240
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
when you reach Beiqi.

241
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,200
One is the

242
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,639
Commander-in-chief of Embroidered
Uniform Guards, Shen Zhong.

243
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,399
Head has told me about him.

244
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,879
The other one is Ku He,

245
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,240
the Great Master.

246
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,480
I heard that

247
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,000
he doesn't want Xiao En
to return to Beiqi.

248
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,559
Both of them are Beiqi people,
aren't they?

249
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,399
Guo Baokun and you
are both Nanqing people.

250
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,360
Do you like each other?

251
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,519
You're right.

252
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,519
But what can I do

253
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,000
if the Great Master

254
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,200
wants to plot against me?

255
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,919
He'll respect his own identity.

256
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,679
If he wants to stop Xiao En to return,

257
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,039
he will send his disciples.

258
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,639
Does he have a lot of disciples?

259
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,120
None of them matters

260
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,720
except the one

261
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,679
named Haitang.

262
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,960
That sounds like

263
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,919
a lady's name.

264
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,279
Haitang is also named as Haitang Duoduo.

265
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,080
She is the last disciple of Ku He.

266
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:33,679
She is

267
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,440
a famous talent in Beiqi

268
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,960
where the people respectfully
call her the Saintess.

269
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,519
So it is a lady!

270
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,559
You're the poetic genius
and she is the Saintess.

271
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,759
That's tit for tat.

272
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,080
She is said to be ranked as Ninth Dan.

273
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:46,840
It's quite easy

274
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,759
to become a Ninth Dan master, right?

275
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:48,799
There are just too many!

276
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
A Ninth Dan master is easy to defeat,

277
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,080
but if Ku He really wants

278
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,440
to stop Xiao En from going back

279
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,440
and does it himself,

280
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,120
we'll have to accept it.

281
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,720
Teacher, you know really a lot

282
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,599
about Beiqi.

283
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,279
Don't flatter me!

284
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,000
There is one more guy

285
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,680
who is the general of Beiqi,
Shangshan Hu.

286
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,599
This guy resists the savages
for a number of years

287
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,119
and wins all the battles.

288
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,119
Some said he is bad-tempered.

289
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:19,000
Some said he is soft and humble.

290
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,759
Isn't that contradictory?

291
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,279
That's the strange part.

292
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,720
Does he have dissociative disorders?

293
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,200
Shangshan Hu is Xiao En's adopted son.

294
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,240
He's been looking forward

295
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,880
to the return of Xiao En.

296
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,519
Then it's not likely for him

297
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:34,680
to plot against me.

298
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,480
After all,
I'm escorting his adoptive father back.

299
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,200
Yeah!

300
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,319
He should not plot against you.

301
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:42,319
Teacher,

302
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,880
what's the family name of Shangshan Hu?

303
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,680
Is it Shangshan

304
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,839
or Shang?

305
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:53,279
The mission is up there.

306
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,200
I'll leave you for now.

307
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,720
Sure!
Please take a good rest to recover.

308
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,000
Chen Pingping
shouldn't have told you that.

309
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:06,039
Let me give you some more information.

310
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,720
That little emperor of Beiqi

311
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,559
just took over the throne.

312
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,920
The Empress Dowager
hasn't handed over the power yet.

313
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,839
There is already inkling
between their fight for the throne.

314
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,759
I got it.

315
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,119
It's a good chance to take advantage

316
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,680
from the battle
between a mother and a son.

317
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,000
I intend to ask you to escape

318
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,880
while they're fighting.

319
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,240
Do you want to

320
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,519
get involved into

321
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,240
the political affairs of Beiqi?

322
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:24,920
No! No! No!

323
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,599
I didn't mean it.

324
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:28,519
She's gone?

325
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,160
One final reminder.

326
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,400
Don't lose your life.

327
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,519
Don't worry, Teacher.

328
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,519
I'll surely come back alive.

329
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,400
Why are you here?

330
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,160
We already said goodbye

331
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,039
at home, didn't we?

332
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,400
I'm not here to say goodbye.

333
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,359
I'm here to urge you

334
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,039
because you become negligent recently.

335
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,559
What do you mean?

336
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,079
The book!

337
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,000
You are very slow now with the book.

338
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:11,279
Danbo Bookstore

339
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,119
is in urgent need of your new chapters

340
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,160
for the Red Mansions.

341
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,519
If it weren't for the poem anthology

342
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,200
the other day,

343
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,319
we would have nothing to publish now.

344
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:17,839
I've been quite busy recently.

345
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:19,279
I don't care!

346
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,440
That's an excuse.

347
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,119
There isn't much to do

348
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:22,759
for your trip to Beiqi.

349
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,119
Spare some time every day

350
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:24,839
and finish a part.

351
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:25,759
Once you finish,

352
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,160
send it to me by post-horses.

353
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,160
Write more about the romantic stuff

354
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:31,720
like you love me but I don't love you.

355
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,039
The ladies from wealthy
and influential families

356
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:33,880
like that.

357
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,519
No wonder you followed me here.

358
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,839
Brother, don't worry.

359
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,839
I'll move to Wan'er's place tomorrow.

360
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,000
Why?

361
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,599
To protect my future sister-in-law
for you.

362
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,319
I'll stop her from seeing anyone else.

363
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,000
That's outrageous.

364
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,200
Shall I go or not?

365
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,640
Go to

366
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,319
Beat the hell out of those
who ingratiate Wan'er.

367
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,359
Sure, I got it!

368
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,440
As the elder brother,

369
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,759
you have set a wrong example.

370
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,200
Let's call it expression of nature.

371
00:19:57,759 --> 00:19:59,000
You're about to visit Beiqi.

372
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,119
Why are you still so naughty?

373
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,720
These are my bodyguards.

374
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:06,519
All of them are state-of-the-art.

375
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,920
They will go to Beiqi

376
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,000
along with you this time.

377
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,279
You keep so many guards

378
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,599
as an Assistant Minister
of Ministry of Revenue?

379
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,799
Gao Da and the swordsmen under him

380
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,480
are very reliable.

381
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,559
You can trust them

382
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
whatever you want to do.

383
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,880
I'm at Your Excellency's service.

384
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,480
How to spell your name?

385
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:27,920
G-A-O,
(The name is the Chinese

386
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,119
D-A!
translation of 'Gundam')

387
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,640
I have long desired to know you.

388
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,039
Your Excellency have heard of me before?

389
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,119
I kept a small horse in Danzhou.

390
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:37,839
It is named as Zaku.
(a type of robot from Mobile Suit Gundam)

391
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:39,039
I'll arrange a meeting for you

392
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,759
when I get the time.

393
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,759
Do we need to take a detour

394
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,200
to Danzhou?

395
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,799
I mean next time.

396
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,160
Alright! Forget about him.

397
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,440
He usually behaves himself strangely.

398
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,319
Take care of him

399
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,920
during the trip.

400
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,640
Sure!

401
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Wait outside the gate.

402
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,359
Don't show off or take any risks.

403
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,680
Just remember

404
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,119
you have families in the capital city

405
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,240
waiting for you to come back.

406
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,440
Brother,

407
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,799
drink up this bowl of farewell liquor.

408
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:19,680
What do I need to do?

409
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,839
He's not going to a battlefield.

410
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,839
I think it's pretty much like it.

411
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,720
Set out!

412
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,920
Got it.

413
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,039
Stop the carriage! Take a break!

414
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,599
Uncle Wuzhu.

415
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,200
According to what you said,

416
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,880
I went to Taiping Residence.

417
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:56,839
How's it going?

418
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,480
The defense is really strict.

419
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,480
You didn't get in?

420
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:08,519
I got in,

421
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:10,200
Did you get under water?

422
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,880
Did you see the mechanism
left by my mom?

423
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,119
It's a bit wired.

424
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:13,240
What is it like?

425
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,640
When I jumped up into the sky,

426
00:25:16,039 --> 00:25:17,240
I found the stone

427
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,240
is actually the key.

428
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,440
It's hard to describe it clearly.

429
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,200
I always feel that

430
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,319
you're the only one

431
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:25,039
in the world

432
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,279
who can understand the mechanism

433
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,640
left by your mom!

434
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,799
You have to wait

435
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,799
till I get back to the capital city.

436
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,240
Do you really want
to open that secret door?

437
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,599
Didn't you say

438
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:42,960
we'll be in grave danger

439
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,680
once we know the truth?

440
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,440
I know,

441
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,920
but what mankind can't beat

442
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,359
is the curiosity

443
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,720
to the unknown.

444
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,960
Anyway, curiosity kills the cat.

445
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,359
Sure!

446
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,279
What the lady left

447
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,279
in the case

448
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,759
are weapons, aren't they?

449
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,079
Why don't you bring them to Beiqi?

450
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:02,279
I left them at home.

451
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,400
Take care of them for me.

452
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,079
I'm also leaving.

453
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:06,960
Where did you go?

454
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,720
To the north.

455
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,960
Are you going to Beiqi along with me?

456
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,240
I'll go first.

457
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,000
Why?

458
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,039
Just now Fei Jie said

459
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,319
Ku He will possibly plot against you.

460
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,720
It's only a possibility.

461
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,559
Why do you look for Ku He?

462
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:22,920
To fight!

463
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,039
Uncle...

464
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,279
To beat him
till he's not able to harm you.

465
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,000
He is the Great Master!

466
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,880
The Great Master is who I want to beat.

467
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:37,480
That's really daring.

468
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,720
I don't care about anyone

469
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:41,319
under the level of Great Masters.

470
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,079
I see! Leave them to me.

471
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,519
So, we'll meet in Beiqi, right?

472
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,319
I must drag down Ku He

473
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,240
and therefore can't go to
the capital of Beiqi.

474
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,559
We won't meet then.

475
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,839
Be safe!

476
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,160
One last thing.

477
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:07,240
I seem to remember

478
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,359
the name Xiao En.

479
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:10,880
What do you mean?

480
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,480
The Lady Ye used to travel with Xiao En.

481
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:16,039
My mom?

482
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,839
She also told me that

483
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,799
she came to this world

484
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,160
because of Xiao En.

485
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,000
What else?

486
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:25,880
That's all I can remember.

487
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,720
So perhaps Xiao En knows

488
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,839
the secrets of my mom.

489
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:34,039
You can ask him yourself.

490
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:35,839
But the order I got is to kill...

491
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,599
There you come, Your Excellency!

492
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,319
What's up?

493
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:55,920
Your Excellency,

494
00:27:57,839 --> 00:27:58,960
Where did you find this guy?

495
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,880
You mean Wang Qinian?

496
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,079
What's wrong with him?

497
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,079
While the mission
was distributing solid food,

498
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,000
he stole the fruits in stock.

499
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,920
He is sneaky-behaved and filthy
and greedy in personality.

500
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,240
Your Excellency,
we can't keep people like this.

501
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,880
I'll talk to him about this.

502
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,880
Thank you for reminding me.

503
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,079
Your Excellency,

504
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,799
let me do it
if you want to drive him away.

505
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,640
OK!

506
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,400
Go ahead with your business.

507
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,759
Your Excellency,

508
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,960
you are back.

509
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,759
Are you going to eat

510
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:43,799
the solid food distributed just now?

511
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,799
No!

512
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,400
Your Excellency,

513
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,319
do you know what I found?

514
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,200
Tell me.

515
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,400
I found that

516
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,039
there are fresh fruits

517
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,000
in the luggage cart of the mission.

518
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,200
They are delivered here by post-horses.

519
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,440
I've taken some for you.

520
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,079
Wang Qinian,

521
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,359
I am the leader of the mission.

522
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,279
Do I need to steal the fruits?

523
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,960
Your Excellency,

524
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,160
these fruits are kept

525
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:21,400
with ice cubes.

526
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,119
They are gifts

527
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,240
we send to Beiqi, sort of.

528
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,039
But they are more and more uncommon

529
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,400
as we go further and further
into the north.

530
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:30,759
You just took the gifts

531
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:31,559
between two states.

532
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,519
Nobody will count them.

533
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:36,319
It won't be detected
if only we take a few.

534
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,759
It's not a big deal

535
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,759
to take a few fruits

536
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,480
given all the hardship on the way.

537
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,359
No, I won't take them!

538
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,160
Thank you.

539
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:55,440
I'm fine! I'm OK!

540
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:55,880
Go! Go!

541
00:29:57,319 --> 00:29:57,799
Let's go.

542
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:09,240
Your Excellency, take some!

543
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,480
Don't feel sorry for it.

544
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,440
I'll get you a few more.

545
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:18,680
Don't worry.

546
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,440
I'll be your sentry.

547
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,880
It's not easy to stay in this position.

548
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,839
-Go. -Go.

549
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,519
There is not much time left.
Hurry up with it!

550
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,359
Dad! Dad!

551
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
What are you doing here?

552
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,920
I was worried that you'll suffer.

553
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:09,839
This is insane!

554
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,079
I told you to break off

555
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:12,000
all relations with me.

556
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:12,839
Dad!

557
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,880
Did they beat you or insult you?

558
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,039
I am an official anyway.

559
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,000
They treated me well.

560
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,799
You don't need to worry.

561
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:20,519
Hurry up.

562
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,400
Dad,

563
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,279
I tried to bribe a lot of people,

564
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,480
but got refused.

565
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,640
Every one of them prevaricated

566
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,880
and refused to help.

567
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,160
Silver won't help. It's useless to try.

568
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,839
Dad, I've hired a bunch of killers.

569
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,759
They are the best of their kind.

570
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:38,920
What are you doing?

571
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:44,440
Fan Xian went to Beiqi with a mission.

572
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,279
That's a perfect chance.

573
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:47,839
I'll follow behind him

574
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,200
and initiate an attack

575
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:50,200
to take his life

576
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,880
when they get to the wilderness

577
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:52,279
so as to retaliate for you.

578
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,839
You must stop that.

579
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,759
Dad, don't worry.

580
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,680
I've read a lot of book
on the art of war

581
00:32:00,839 --> 00:32:02,160
and studied
a lot of examples of battles.

582
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,680
They give me a lot of insights.

583
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,000
Now it seems

584
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,519
I have the potential

585
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:07,799
to become a good general in the world.

586
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,519
That's not possible.

587
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,039
Don't do silly things.

588
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,319
This is not silly.

589
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:16,000
The patrol is coming. Leave now!

590
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,000
Dad, wait for my news.

591
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,200
No, don't do that.

592
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,720
It's dangerous to you.

593
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:34,680
Are you a beggar?

594
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,880
Do I look like one?

595
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,319
Are you a beggar?

596
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,759
Beggar...

597
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,319
Excuse me! Excuse me!

598
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:16,440
Are you a beggar?

599
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:18,119
I'm not only a beggar,

600
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,839
but also a cook.

601
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,359
I'm Zhao Da!

602
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:26,759
Are they all here?

603
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,119
Set off now.

604
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,039
Fan Xian has already gone out of town.

605
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,759
Wait a moment, Young Master!
They are on the way.

606
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,319
I told you to gather them here

607
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,640
in the capital city!

608
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,640
It's harvest time in the countryside.
They will come after that.

609
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,000
Well...

610
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,759
Take a seat! Sit down!

611
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,079
Young Master,

612
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,359
all of us are veterans

613
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,039
retired from the frontiers.

614
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,960
We have farm work
only after we got back.

615
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:03,720
Generally,

616
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,960
we'd also help with

617
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
weddings and funerals

618
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,639
so that we have sustenance.

619
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,760
But don't worry, Your Excellency!

620
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,639
We're most adept

621
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,000
in murdering and robbing

622
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,880
without any mistakes.

623
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,119
Fan Xian has already gone!

624
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,400
It's a sure thing!

625
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,280
The mission can't travel fast.

626
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,760
We can catch up with them
even if we set off a few days later.

627
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,519
Really?

628
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,079
The Patrol Division
has to stop from here.

629
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,079
We'll have to rely on ourselves

630
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,440
further to the north.

631
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,159
There shouldn't be any danger

632
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,639
in our own territory.

633
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,039
But Xiao En is infamous.

634
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,079
Your Excellency,

635
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,920
we must beware of him all the time.

636
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,639
I poison him every day.

637
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,079
It's better to have someone

638
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:52,920
watching over him all the time.

639
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,400
But I have to look out
for the surroundings.

640
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,519
My guards fear him

641
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,639
as much as they fear tigers

642
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,800
and dare not to approach.

643
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,400
Totally understandable.

644
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:02,840
Oh. Your Excellency.

645
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,880
I saw Wang Qinian

646
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,760
stealing fruits again.

647
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,679
You bumped into him again?

648
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,280
I watch over him all the time.

649
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,599
Your Excellency, we can't let him stay.

650
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,639
If Your Excellency feels embarrassed,

651
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,400
I can be the bad guy and drive him away.

652
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:20,639
That's not necessary.

653
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:22,880
Why?

654
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,000
Actually, all of his behaviors of such

655
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,239
are an illusion.

656
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,639
He is a first-class

657
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:29,400
warrior.

658
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,199
Brave and perseverant!

659
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,119
Is that true?

660
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,480
That's...

661
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:52,400
To be frank,

662
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:53,360
Actually,

663
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,440
there will be accident

664
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,920
to leave Xiao En alone

665
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:56,960
in the carriage.

666
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,360
As soon as I said that,

667
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,039
Wang Qinian volunteered

668
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,199
to take the same carriage with Xiao En

669
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,000
for the rest of the journey

670
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:03,960
so as to set an example for the mission.

671
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,159
Did he really say that?

672
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:13,960
Absolutely!

673
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:28,440
Warrior Wang,

674
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:33,559
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,159
For what?

676
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,480
I have been misled at the start

677
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,079
by the illusions you put up.

678
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,840
Now it seems

679
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,599
you're the true hero.

680
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,719
I'm flattered!

681
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,159
Xiao En killed people massively

682
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,360
in a cruel and ruthless manner.

683
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:53,719
He is a real devil on earth.

684
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,800
He is indeed unforgiveable.

685
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,719
You are the only one

686
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:58,719
who has no fear towards him.

687
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,960
How can you tell that?

688
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,039
Your voluntary move

689
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:05,519
is no different from

690
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,599
feeding yourself to a tiger.

691
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,280
I really admire you.

692
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:10,960
I'm flattered!

693
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,159
From today on,

694
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:12,920
we are sworn brothers

695
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,280
through thick and thin.

696
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,679
Should you have any misfortune,

697
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,000
I'll surely kill Xiao En

698
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:19,480
to avenge you.

699
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,079
Your Excellency,

700
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,800
did this guy
take the poisonous mushroom?

701
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,239
Actually, he bumped into

702
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:38,960
your stealing of the fruits.

703
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,760
And he still admires me?

704
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:44,559
Then,

705
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,920
I kind of helped you out
with a few good words.

706
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,559
Mr. Xiao,

707
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,840
I'll stay with you

708
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,079
from today onwards.

709
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,840
I got some warm water for you

710
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,840
for a comfortable face wash.

711
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,360
Do you think

712
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,400
it will work

713
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,920
if I kidnap you as a hostage

714
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,480
to threaten that young guy?

715
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:56,880
Mr. Xiao,

716
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,440
since they assigned me here,

717
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:00,840
it means

718
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,639
I'm a person

719
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:04,360
of little importance.

720
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,360
right?

721
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:08,159
Why would the lords

722
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,239
out there

723
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:10,519
care about my life?

724
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,519
Let me clean your face.

725
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:23,119
Do you massage?

726
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:28,239
You want massage?

727
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,960
Aren't you afraid of me?

728
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:55,280
Your reputation is widely-spread.

729
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:57,400
Of course, I'm afraid.

730
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,800
What if I kill you?

731
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,079
His Excellency Fan is very rich.

732
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,400
My wife and daughter

733
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,440
will live a good life.

734
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
What's your name?
(What are you screaming for?)

735
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:23,719
I didn't scream!

736
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,360
I didn't!

737
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:28,679
I mean what's your name?

738
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,760
My name is...

739
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:36,679
Wang Qinian.

740
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,199
Wang Qinian,

741
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,159
I got it.

742
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:43,679
Come on! This side.

743
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,800
Here. This side.

744
00:41:58,679 --> 00:41:59,679
I know you are there.

745
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:03,840
It's been ages. You don't change much.

746
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,360
I've lost my memory

747
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,599
and don't remember much about you.

748
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,960
Then why do you come to me?

749
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
To fight with you.

750
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,760
What's the reason for that?

751
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,239
Xiao En is returning.

752
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,480
If you stay here

753
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,840
and don't go back to Beiqi,

754
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,440
I can give up the fight.

755
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,360
Xiao En shall not return alive.

756
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,239
Then, let's fight!

757
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:32,880
Stop!

758
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:34,599
He's right.

759
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,800
If you accept the fight,

760
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:39,760
it's hard to survive.

761
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,719
Almost got him.

762
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,440
He detected you long time back.

763
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,599
Really?

764
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,360
and changed direction three times

765
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,280
while we were talking.

766
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:45,920
Awesome!

767
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:48,440
Master,

768
00:43:49,639 --> 00:43:50,519
I can't beat this guy.

769
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,960
Go to the territory of Nanqing

770
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,039
and kill Xiao En!

771
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:55,239
Don't let him return.

772
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:58,800
Master, you said it too loudly.

773
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,519
He's heard it.

774
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,119
How do I leave?

775
00:44:03,159 --> 00:44:04,199
Anyone can leave

776
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,280
except the Great Master.

777
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:11,639
See you!

778
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:18,599
Your skin is so fine and smooth.

779
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:20,400
It's flawless!

780
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,880
What do you use for face care?

781
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,920
Haitang!

782
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:25,199
I know! I know!

783
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:26,239
I'm leaving right away!

784
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,800
That's fantastic!

785
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,960
Master, beat him!

786
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:13,559
He probably can't hear me.

787
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:57,360
Your Excellency,
I settled Xiao En well now.

788
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:58,639
He is locked right in that carriage.

789
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:00,000
Two guards are watching over him.

790
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,000
How was it with you?

791
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,760
I've said plenty of witty words

792
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,079
which completely erased

793
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:06,400
his intent to kill me.

794
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:27,559
Your Excellency, she has a crush on you.

795
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,719
Nonsense!

796
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,079
She was captured by me.

797
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:30,599
Your Excellency,

798
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:33,239
she likes you.

799
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:33,920
See?

800
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:35,639
Why are you making fun of me as well?

801
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:36,480
I'm not!

802
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,360
Anyone can perceive that.

803
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:39,920
You see?

804
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,000
You don't understand.

805
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,880
She is a prisoner.

806
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,599
Prisoner also has feelings.

807
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,079
I didn't expect Shangshan Hu

808
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:52,079
to hear someone as decent as you

809
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,280
to say wise words like this.

810
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,639
Anyone will naturally understand human mind
as they see more and more people.

811
00:46:58,079 --> 00:46:59,559
We are kindred spirits.

812
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:01,440
Human mind might be unpredictable,

813
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,960
but it's most valuable to have feelings.

814
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,599
Enough of that.

815
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,480
You two come with me to the room.

816
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,320
You...

817
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,079
repeat every word Xiao En told you

818
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,000
in the exactly

819
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,880
the same way.

820
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,039
May I know how old your wife is?

821
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,599
Words like that

822
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:18,840
completely erased his hostility

823
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,880
against me.

824
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,039
His tone became much softer.

825
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,519
You are indeed eloquent

826
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:27,760
and good at psychological tactics.

827
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,280
It's a requisite skill

828
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:32,000
to survive in the world.

829
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:33,679
It's the so-called tactic

830
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:36,719
to use different words towards
different targets...

831
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:37,559
You've done it wrongly.

832
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,360
What?

833
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:48,679
I said you've done it wrongly.

834
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:50,719
Your Excellency!

835
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:53,199
Wang has been neither humble nor pushy

836
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,239
and put his identity

837
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:55,119
to the lowest.

838
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,079
Xiao En must think

839
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,320
kidnapping him

840
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,360
would not pose any threat
to Your Excellency.

841
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:01,280
So definitely, he won't do it, right?

842
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,480
If I may ask,

843
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:04,960
which one of them is wrong?

844
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:08,960
All of them!

845
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,039
All of them?

846
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:13,119
All the words you said

847
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,199
will lead only one consequence.

848
00:48:14,679 --> 00:48:15,400
Xiao En will kill you for sure

849
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,599
in less than a day.

850
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:52,760
Your Excellency,

851
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:53,760
this is a tiring march.

852
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,000
Please go to the camp for a rest.

853
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:56,199
We will proceed with the patrol.

854
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,880
We'd better not neglect anything
at the border of the states.

855
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:01,880
Beiqi has been overwhelmed
by our crackdown.

856
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:03,440
There won't be anything bad
in these days.

857
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:07,159
Your Excellency,

858
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,000
we found a cavalry ahead.

859
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,119
Hold it!

860
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:12,880
Put it down.

861
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,519
Wait here in silence.

862
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:25,280
Director Yan, there is an urgent edict.

863
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:38,840
Report it back that I'll go in person.

864
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:39,719
Yes!

865
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,360
What do you want to do?

866
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:25,559
I've applied poison

867
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:27,280
to the dishes for you

868
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:29,480
in the past days.

869
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,800
The taste is good.

870
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,280
Now thinking back,

871
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:37,000
it seems I'm not paying any respect
to you as a senior.

872
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,000
So, you don't want to do it any more

873
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
from today onwards?

874
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:46,079
What are you doing?

875
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,400
Here has been sieged airtightly.

876
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:52,159
Senior, please cherish your life.

877
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:21,920
Well,

878
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:34,079
Is it used to kill Wang Qinian?

879
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:35,440
Yes!

880
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,719
Wang Qinian is

881
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:40,559
my right hand.

882
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:46,920
Wang,

883
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,480
I think His Excellency is right.

884
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:51,079
No, he is not!

885
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:52,760
Both of his hands

886
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,000
are tied up.

887
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,360
How will he kill me?

888
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,519
This tree...

889
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,360
Your Excellency!

890
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,400
If I don't stop him,

891
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:03,000
you'll die of this

892
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:03,840
by tomorrow.

893
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,719
But Your Excellency,
I just don't understand

894
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,559
why he has to kill me.

895
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,519
You've read about Xiao En's life,

896
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:16,880
right?

897
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,239
Yes, I have. The Investigator's Office
gave me his introduction.

898
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:23,079
It says he is ruthless and vicious

899
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:24,360
and full of scheming ideas.

900
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,440
However, I still don't get it.

901
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:27,559
I already told him

902
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:29,000
I'm of little importance.

903
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:30,760
Besides, killing me

904
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,800
will not set him free.

905
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:33,039
Then why will he

906
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:34,119
still want to kill me?

907
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,480
He is a human.

908
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,639
Just think about it from his position.

909
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:39,519
What emotions would you have

910
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:40,360
if you were imprisoned for many years

911
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,679
without day light?

912
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,519
Anger!

913
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:47,719
Grudges!

914
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:48,760
Right?

915
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,159
All of them!

916
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:52,079
All these negative emotions

917
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,199
have been suppressed for so many years.

918
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,199
He needs to unleash them.

919
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:56,159
Judging from his past behaviors
on record,

920
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,119
blood can alleviate his anger the best.

921
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,159
So he will kill me

922
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,800
just to unleash his anger?

923
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,199
This journey to the north

924
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,039
is a chance for Xiao En to escape.

925
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,599
Once he kills

926
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:10,239
anyone important of my side,

927
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,320
he might lose his chance

928
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:13,039
as I'll retaliate.

929
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,239
So I told him

930
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:17,199
you're my right hand.

931
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,559
If you are right,

932
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,719
will he seize me

933
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,079
to threaten you?

934
00:53:26,199 --> 00:53:26,679
No!

935
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,119
Xiao En won't take the risk

936
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,400
unless it's someone
that has blood tie with me.

937
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:32,599
Once he loses it,

938
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:34,719
he will be killed by numerous arrows.

939
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:37,039
To survive

940
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:38,559
is the top priority

941
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:39,480
to Xiao En at the moment.

942
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,159
Yes!

943
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,800
Your Excellency also has poisoned him.

944
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,440
So it doesn't have any risk at all

945
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,079
in this sense.

946
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:21,320
We'll take the route from Cangzhou
to leave the country.

947
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:24,960
Your Excellency,

948
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,119
do we need to send someone

949
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,559
to explore the way beforehand?

950
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,679
The reason why His Excellency

951
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,280
reveals it now is because

952
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,679
he doesn't want more people to know.

953
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,280
This journey will be dangerous.

954
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:37,480
I have kept it to myself all the time

955
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,400
to avoid interception ahead.

956
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,800
Your Excellency is so careful.

957
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:45,320
This journey will surely be safe.

958
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,199
Vegetables!

959
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,159
Come and check it out!

960
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:06,119
Come and check it out!

961
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:07,239
Cheap vegetables!

962
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:07,920
Cheap vegetables!

963
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,159
-Cheap vegetables! -Fresh vegetables!

964
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:12,960
Are these the assassins you find for me?

965
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:22,159
Fresh vegetables!

966
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,880
Sweet and tasty!

967
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,360
Are you sure they know how to kill?

968
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:32,719
They do!

969
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,159
Once bet, no regret!

970
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:37,400
No! No! No!

971
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,760
Sweet and tasty!

972
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,840
Are they...

973
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,840
selling vegetables?

974
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,719
They bring those from the countryside.

975
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,239
As they don't have road permit,

976
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,519
they can't get through the gate

977
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,880
and have to sell here.

978
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:51,199
I want them here to kill...

979
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:52,599
Kill people!

980
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:54,320
They'll do that

981
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,800
after selling up these.

982
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,079
Your Excellency, look,

983
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:03,599
that bag is prepared for you.

984
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,280
Especially prepared for you.

985
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,159
They were watered
with our own liquid dung.

986
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:20,880
Super tasty!

987
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:27,639
Your Excellency,

988
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
we're going beyond our domain of patrol

989
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:29,840
if we walk further ahead.

990
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:31,639
I need to kill someone.

991
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,280
Follow me!

992
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,639
Your Excellency is fleeing away?

993
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,920
I'll be back after I kill that guy.

994
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,480
I've got everything settled in the camp.

995
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,000
It's a severe breach of law for frontier
force to go through the border.

996
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,039
If I leave by myself,

997
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,559
all of you will be guilty

998
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:47,760
and your lives won't be spared.

999
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:49,800
After I finish the killing
and get back to the camp,

1000
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,000
I'll ensure your safety.

1001
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,039
If you are unwilling to go,

1002
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,039
you're free to leave.

1003
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:00,239
Who do Your Excellency want to kill?

1004
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,519
Don't ask. Just follow me!

1005
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,599
Where to?

1006
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:06,360
Cangzhou!

1007
00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:08,199
The person we're going to kill

1008
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,679
will go through Cangzhou to Beiqi.

1009
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,679
This needle is hollow.
The poison is inside.

1010
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,079
We have to do this

1011
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:36,119
for you are an elder senior.

1012
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,400
When do you plan to kill me?

1013
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,480
Senior, you must be muddled.

1014
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:45,320
I'm escorting you back to Beiqi.

1015
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,960
Chen Pingping won't set me free

1016
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,800
to the north.

1017
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,960
I don't know what the Head is thinking.

1018
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,440
I'm only taking care of
my own assignment.

1019
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,400
You're not bad, young man!

1020
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:00,039
Thank you, Senior Xiao!

1021
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,599
Two cultivations a day

1022
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:05,360
without stop.

1023
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:06,760
I didn't have that kind of perseverance

1024
00:58:07,039 --> 00:58:10,320
when I was your age.

1025
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,199
A slow sparrow
should make an early start.

1026
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:14,519
I have no talent,

1027
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,800
so I have to rely on hard work.

1028
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,360
You have good talent

1029
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:19,239
and strong perseverance.

1030
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,360
If you can fight against
the strong alone,

1031
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,679
your potential will be motivated

1032
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:24,599
to an even higher level.

1033
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:26,920
You can ask me

1034
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,280
if you still have anything in doubt.

1035
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:32,320
Stop the carriage!

1036
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:35,119
Well,

1037
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:37,320
Stay with him carefully.

1038
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,400
Yes!

1039
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,840
Do you want to chat about anything?

1040
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,760
I can chat with you.

1041
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:08,800
You...

1042
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,000
look very tired.

1043
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:17,239
Xiao En has been keeping inducing me
all the way,

1044
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:18,960
which is indeed tiring.

1045
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,320
So, what do you come to me for?

1046
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,400
I'm fine.

1047
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:40,000
Do you want me to massage for you?

1048
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,960
That's most kind of you.

1049
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:54,320
Turn around!

1050
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:07,639
Gently! Gently!

1051
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:19,440
Why do you heave a big sigh?

1052
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:22,639
It was I who arrested you.

1053
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:25,920
Yes.

1054
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:31,559
It was I
who threatened you in the dungeon.

1055
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,280
So logically,

1056
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:43,239
it would be demanding
for you not to hate me.

1057
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,079
Why do you treat me like this?

1058
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,639
I was knocked out by your poison
on the pleasure boat.

1059
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,840
When I fled from the capital city,

1060
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,559
you chased me down in person.

1061
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:01,119
And in the dungeon, you interrogated me.

1062
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:06,199
Maybe it's my destiny

1063
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:08,920
to be bullied by you.

1064
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,960
Even so,

1065
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:14,639
it is you

1066
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:15,679
who saved my life in the end

1067
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:18,039
so that I can get out of the trouble.

1068
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:21,360
I don't know

1069
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:25,239
whether I should hate you
or thank you in my heart.

1070
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,800
I tossed and turned on bed.

1071
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,159
Your shadow gets carved in my heart.

1072
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:39,960
I just couldn't tell.

1073
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,880
Why are you still sighing?

1074
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:47,440
Am I really

1075
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,320
