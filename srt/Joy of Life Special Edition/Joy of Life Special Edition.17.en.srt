16
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,000
Your Majesty.

17
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,359
Her Highness is kneeling outside.

18
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:43,319
Is Her Highness still kneeling?

19
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,680
Yes.

20
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,479
Nothing has happened
in the Imperial Study.

21
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,520
You'll get Her Highness
into bigger trouble if you go there!

22
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,319
Do you want to watch it happen
without doing anything?

23
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
If we can do nothing about it,

24
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,800
maybe someone else can.

25
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,919
At this moment,

26
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:09,439
nobody would stand out
to offend His Majesty.

27
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:23,800
Your Highness.

28
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,879
You can't go, Your Highness.

29
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:42,280
Do you want to see me?

30
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,120
What's up?

31
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,240
What is Lin Wan'er

32
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,240
What?

33
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,560
A wife-to-be.

34
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,240
Do you want to marry her

35
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,680
for Neiku

36
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,240
or for herself?

37
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,639
Even if she's a maidservant

38
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,719
or a slave girl,

39
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,879
I'll marry nobody but her.

40
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,520
So you really fall in love with her.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
Are you holding the program

42
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:10,919
of "Agony Father"

43
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,719
in the middle of the night?

44
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,080
The Princess Royal

45
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,680
has been kneeling
outside the Imperial Study

46
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,439
for quite a while.

47
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,439
How do you know about

48
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,360
what's happening in the palace?

49
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,519
It's not important.

50
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,319
The point is what you should do.

51
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,560
I'd make it up with a kick.

52
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,319
Since the result is already clear,

53
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,480
why don't you be generous

54
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,040
and intercede for her?

55
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:37,399
Intercede for her?

56
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,319
We should have mercy.

57
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,800
Don't be too ruthless.

58
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,600
Don't drive her too hard.

59
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,399
Insidious as she is,

60
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,279
Li Yunrui has a lot of
loyal followers as well.

61
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,439
If you shall have a foothold
on the imperial court,

62
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,120
you must learn

63
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,319
the tactic of hardness and softness
to turn enemies into friends.

64
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,920
She tried to kill me!

65
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,240
Fan Xian,

66
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,279
have you ever considered

67
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,160
how Lin Wan'er will feel?

68
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,319
Just remember

69
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,160
Li Yunrui is her biological mother
after all.

70
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,720
You beat Li Yunrui in this round.

71
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,040
What next?

72
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:27,079
You want to drive her up to the wall.

73
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,120
How would Lin Wan'er think about it?!

74
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,199
If you plan

75
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
to get married in future,

76
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,000
will you get estranged because of this?

77
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,720
Fan Xian,

78
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,759
if you're sincere to her,

79
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,399
why can't you yield for her?

80
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,720
Allow me to think about it.

81
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,639
Tonight is the only chance

82
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,560
to intercede if you want.

83
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,160
Auntie,

84
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,759
it's wide spread that

85
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,839
you are on my side.

86
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,959
I am!

87
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,879
If really so,

88
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,399
why don't I have visibility

89
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,600
when you bribed Zhu Ge
and contacted Zhuang Mohan?!

90
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,680
If you know all these,

91
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,639
it would be two people

92
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,360
kneeling here now.

93
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,160
Now I have to kneel anyhow!

94
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Please allow me to meet His Majesty!

95
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,399
Your Highness,

96
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,319
it's not good for you

97
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,680
to kneel with me now.

98
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,720
Your Highness,

99
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,079
His Majesty asks you to come in.

100
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,519
Auntie is physically weak.

101
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,439
Please have mercy on her, Your Majesty!

102
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,519
No one else dares to

103
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,480
intercede for her other than you.

104
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,720
Do you know why?

105
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,879
They are afraid to get implicated.

106
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,759
Aren't you afraid?

107
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:47,519
I can't bear to see her get punished.

108
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,879
Softhearted princes in history

109
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:51,000
came to no good end.

110
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,639
Your Majesty,

111
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,279
please have mercy on Auntie.

112
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,240
Let's wait a bit more.

113
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,759
For what?

114
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,560
Let's see

115
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,199
if anyone else will intercede for her.

116
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,279
Possibly nobody dares to

117
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
as it has come to this point.

118
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:13,680
Not necessarily.

119
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,120
Your Majesty.

120
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,879
Fan Xian, Chief Musician
of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices,

121
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,639
requests for a meeting.

122
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,120
Let him in.

123
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,559
Are you here to intercede?

124
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,200
If it weren't
for someone else's reminder,

125
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,879
I'd almost forget how Wan'er feels.

126
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,759
They are after all mother and daughter

127
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,480
no matter how much hostility

128
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,639
between them.

129
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,799
So,

130
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,759
To be honest,

131
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,919
it's a bit dis-organized in my mind.

132
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,240
So I found a place

133
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,000
and spent some time sitting there

134
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,240
and spent some time
straightening it out.

135
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:11,919
Then I rushed here.

136
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,960
It's not too late anyway.

137
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,639
You are here to intercede for her?

138
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,279
I, Fan Xian,

139
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,600
sincerely beg Your Majesty
not to have mercy

140
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,759
and punish Li Yunrui
by the most severe means!

141
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,039
Rise.

142
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,360
You don't enjoy kneeling.

143
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,279
If you are really here to intercede,

144
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,120
I'd be very disappointed.

145
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,799
The Investigator's Office

146
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,120
and the power of the Neiku

147
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,840
can only be handed over to someone who can hold
their ground however much pressure they have.

148
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,240
I didn't think that much.

149
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,639
I'm curious about

150
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
how you changed your mind.

151
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,279
As I said,

152
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,000
I found a place

153
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,440
and spent some time
straightening it out.

154
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,039
Where is the place?

155
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,200
Tomb of my deceased husband, Teng Zijing

156
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,360
now that it even dared
to do it in public.

157
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:33,639
If you stay,

158
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,480
this is just the beginning.

159
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,879
The road ahead

160
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,240
will be full of hazards.

161
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,360
In this case,

162
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,039
I'd never leave you alone
in the capital city

163
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,480
where you may encounter

164
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,519
where you may encounter

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,240
both open and covert attacks.

166
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:49,879
I stay

167
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,120
because I want to.

168
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,120
I won't regret

169
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,840
even if I have to undergo
the most severe trials

170
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,159
and lose my life.

171
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,480
If Li Yunrui

172
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,679
only works against me,

173
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,879
I'd yield for Wan'er.

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,639
It's not easy
to meet someone you truly love

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,919
in a life time.

176
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,159
But that's not
the only point to consider.

177
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,639
She killed Teng Zijing.

178
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:22,960
There is no reason for me

179
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
to let her go!

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,799
All for a house guard?

181
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,000
No, it's for a human life.

182
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,759
You're not completely polished.

183
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,879
No one should be polished with
their judgement of right or wrong.

184
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,480
I'm afraid

185
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,679
no one will come to intercede for her.

186
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:51,000
Let her go!

187
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,919
Thank you, Your Majesty.

188
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,240
Send her far away.

189
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,600
Your Majesty, where shall she go?

190
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,440
She's been in the capital city
for so many years.

191
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,960
Xinyang is her fief.

192
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,480
She can go back there.

193
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,000
Your Majesty.

194
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,200
His Majesty wants you
to leave the capital city

195
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
for Xinyang.

196
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,440
Did Fan Xian come to intercede?

197
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,720
He came to throw a stone.

198
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,519
Fantastic!

199
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,799
I thought he came to intercede.

200
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,240
I was quite worried about that.

201
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,679
Too much luggage.

202
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,519
We should start packing up.

203
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,000
Auntie,

204
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,320
maybe I can try it again.

205
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,600
His Majesty's mind is like an abyss.

206
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,039
It can't be persuaded or guessed.

207
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:18,879
Whatever happened,
she is the Princess Royal.

208
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,559
She can't be sent to
the Ministry of Penalty.

209
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,000
Sending her to Xinyang

210
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,360
is already the most severe penalty.

211
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,080
She doesn't deserve to die.

212
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,639
Get out of the way!

213
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,720
Princess, please return!

214
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,639
Her Highness said
she doesn't want to see you.

215
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
I'll just wait here.

216
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,480
No matter how long you wait,
Her Highness won't see you.

217
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:05,799
She doesn't want to leave.

218
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,720
Shall you meet her?

219
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,120
Given her physical condition,

220
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,639
she will be seriously ill
if she stands there for a night.

221
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,000
She will leave if she can't persist.

222
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,039
Her Highness might be weak physically,

223
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,840
but her temper

224
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,159
is just like that of Your Highness.

225
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:44,600
She won't leave

226
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:46,320
if she says so.

227
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,920
Come in.

228
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,359
There is freshly made ginseng tea.

229
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,079
Take some to warm up.

230
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,000
Are the maids in the palace all gone?

231
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,920
They are seeking other means of living,

232
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,480
thinking that by changing new hosts,

233
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:26,319
they can stay in the capital city.

234
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,680
It's not an easy thing.

235
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,759
It is far better than following me.

236
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:34,720
It is only too indifferent.

237
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,480
Kind-hearted people

238
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,799
have been devoured in the palace.

239
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:44,640
This is not right!

240
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,680
I shouldn't meet you now.

241
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,759
But since we have met,

242
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,440
I will leave a few words to you.

243
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
Now that I have lost,

244
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
you still come to see me.

245
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,079
That's a leap into the abyss.

246
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,160
In biological sense,

247
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,920
we are mother and daughter.

248
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,279
It justifies it.

249
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,079
Have you betrayed Nanqing?

250
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,480
Does it really matter at this moment?

251
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,440
If you're wronged,

252
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,559
I'll intercede with His Majesty.

253
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,400
Don't you understand the words

254
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,920
I just said?

255
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,160
So,

256
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:49,200
have you betrayed Nanqing?

257
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,720
Yes.

258
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:52,720
What else do you want to ask?

259
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,240
Did you attempt to hurt Fan Xian?

260
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,839
I did!

261
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:06,720
You clearly know

262
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,440
he is my fiancé.

263
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:09,960
Well,

264
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:12,799
Are you here to question me

265
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,880
before I leave?

266
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,799
You came to see me

267
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,640
just a few times

268
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,680
ever since I was born.

269
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,359
I thought it must be
very difficult for you

270
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,880
and things would become better
after I grow up.

271
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,799
Later, I was taken out of
the imperial harem

272
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,839
and suffered from severe illness.

273
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,640
You never ever came to see me

274
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,440
in the imperial residence.

275
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,440
When I was seriously ill,

276
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,079
I always wondered

277
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:43,960
whether you would come

278
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,720
before I died.

279
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,599
Do you even

280
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,519
have me as a daughter

281
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:51,480
in your heart?

282
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,839
You sabotaged Fan Xian
without hesitation

283
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,519
for your fighting of power

284
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,559
because you never cared

285
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
and will never care

286
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,400
how I feel.

287
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,559
Why would I care

288
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,440
how you feel?!

289
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:11,480
Happiness, suffering,

290
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,960
loneliness and sadness.

291
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,400
Who doesn't have these feelings

292
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,000
as long as living in this world?!

293
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,880
But you can only feel them

294
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,000
when you are alive.

295
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,400
Lin Wan'er,

296
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,119
I just want you to stay alive.

297
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
I don't care about anything else.

298
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,119
Do you think

299
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,920
what I did is just as simple as

300
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,000
colluding with Beiqi
and betraying Nanqing?

301
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,039
Why wouldn't I see you?

302
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,240
Why would I hide from you

303
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,400
and the far, the better?

304
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:47,680
Because only by doing so,

305
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,160
can you stay out

306
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,240
when it breaks out

307
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,880
and stay alive

308
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,359
while I'm punished by hacking process.

309
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,440
What else have you done?

310
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,359
Stop asking!

311
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,880
You don't need to know.

312
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
Live your own life

313
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:14,720
in future

314
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,359
and take me as a vicious monster.

315
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,039
Stay away from me.

316
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:20,839
What about Fan Xian?

317
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:23,200
I told you I like him.

318
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,119
Killing him is also for my good?

319
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,880
If it's not because you like him,

320
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,240
I would not necessarily need
to take his life.

321
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,799
Why is that?

322
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,400
As a woman,

323
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,839
you must not only rely on yourself

324
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,839
but also choose the right man.

325
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,680
Choosing the right man
is critically important

326
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,680
to the rest of your life.

327
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,759
I've chosen him.

328
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,200
People like Fan Xian

329
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,200
won't end up good.

330
00:22:54,599 --> 00:22:55,160
Otherwise, I'm afraid it might be hard

331
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,640
Why does His Majesty

332
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,359
get him in the capital city?

333
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:07,920
To take over Neiku

334
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,559
and the imperial financial power?

335
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,279
What else?

336
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,160
It's very clear that

337
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,640
Fan Xian is very close

338
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:16,039
to the Investigator's Office now.

339
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,440
Yes.

340
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:19,640
A lot of people will say he has
enjoyed success when he was young

341
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,200
and has a great future.

342
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,640
But have you noticed that

343
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,799
the Neiku and Investigator's Office

344
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,240
are the forefront for
the fighting of power

345
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,279
between the Crown Prince
and the Second Prince.

346
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:30,200
These are the position
stared by all eyes.

347
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,559
Fan Xian will become

348
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:33,720
the most hated person

349
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,160
after he steps on there.

350
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:36,680
What lurk

351
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:38,640
in the imperial court

352
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
are dreadful monsters.

353
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,480
And Fan Xian

354
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,640
is a bait in the trap.

355
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,799
However glorious he is now,

356
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,920
he will be equally tragic in future.

357
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:50,640
Under the attacks of dreadful monsters,

358
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,519
what else ending will he have

359
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,279
other than being smashed into pieces?!

360
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,559
If it is merely a marriage contract,

361
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,440
I'd help you cancel it.

362
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,359
But you told me

363
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,400
you like him.

364
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:13,799
What else can I do?!

365
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,519
If I don't kill him,

366
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,799
I'm sending you onto
an unreturnable path.

367
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,319
The good thing is

368
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,119
your sickness is getting better anyway.

369
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,839
After I leave,

370
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,519
find an excuse

371
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,680
and break up with Fan Xian.

372
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,920
I'll think of a way

373
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,680
to cancel the marriage contract for you.

374
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:56,039
I like him.

375
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,400
Then forget about him.

376
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:03,480
You like him,

377
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,960
but it doesn't mean you need
to die with him.

378
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:07,960
Do you know

379
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,759
my favorite food?

380
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,039
What do I love to eat most?

381
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,359
Do you know what I like most

382
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,880
in my heart?

383
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,960
I only know staying alive

384
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,079
is the premise of like.

385
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,799
I like eating drumsticks.

386
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,960
You don't know it, but Fan Xian does.

387
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,319
I was stealing drumstick

388
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,200
when he first met me.

389
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,319
I liked the starry sky

390
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,160
at the beginning

391
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,720
because that's
the most beautiful scenery

392
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:46,640
I had ever seen

393
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,839
as I grew up alone.

394
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,160
You don't know it, but Fan Xian does.

395
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,880
I've given him

396
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,720
the deepest loneliness

397
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,440
in my heart.

398
00:25:58,039 --> 00:25:58,960
Once he knows,

399
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,920
I'm no longer alone.

400
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,359
He is what I like most now

401
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:04,839
in my heart.

402
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,240
If he is stepping onto a path to death,

403
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,640
I'd follow him.

404
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,400
Life is a long journey.

405
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,559
There are more
and better things and better people

406
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,000
waiting for you in the future.

407
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
If I find a person

408
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,640
to entrust my loneliness,

409
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:53,480
my life becomes meaningful

410
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,200
no matter it's long or short.

411
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,559
But you don't even have a life,

412
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:57,960
how come it becomes meaningful?

413
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,839
Didn't you just say

414
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,480
you'll stay away from me

415
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,039
to keep me uninvolved?

416
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,519
Why didn't you

417
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,839
stop doing those dangerous things

418
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,279
for me?

419
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:21,279
You've chosen your way,

420
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:25,160
so have I.

421
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
You also said

422
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:30,119
choosing the right man

423
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,559
is the way to survive.

424
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,960
So the man chosen by you

425
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,400
and relied by you

426
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:36,920
must not be my father, is it?

427
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,119
Who is he?

428
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,160
Who is it

429
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,160
that made you pay so much?

430
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,319
Just one last reminder!

431
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,839
Don't come to see me when I
leave the capital city tomorrow.

432
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,640
Greetings, Your Highness!

433
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,240
She's already gone.

434
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,039
You don't have to drive her this hard,
do you?!

435
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,319
Your Highness,

436
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,240
I'm seeing her off

437
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,640
on behalf of Wan'er.

438
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,799
I don't know anything about
what Auntie did.

439
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,119
Of course.

440
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,160
I'm humbly seeing Your Highness off

441
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,200
on behalf of Wan'er.

442
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,559
Thank goodness that

443
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,480
you didn't come to intercede for me.

444
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,480
It seems
that Your Highness don't want me

445
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,440
to intercede for you.

446
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,519
It's...

447
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,359
If you intercede for me,

448
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,759
I will have no excuse to revenge you.

449
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:34,839
It's all good now.

450
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,000
I can make some efforts

451
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,880
and prepare something

452
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,319
as a surprise for you.

453
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,640
Save it!

454
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,400
I'm most happy already.

455
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:43,799
Really?

456
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:44,319
Yep.

457
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,799
I once said that

458
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,839
I'll drive Your Highness
out of the capital city.

459
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,200
Now it came true.

460
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,319
The happiness in my heart
is beyond my description

461
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,119
and I'm in an ever-higher spirit.

462
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,799
To be very honest, Your Highness,

463
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,920
I had half a bowl more of rice

464
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,799
for today's breakfast.

465
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:00,680
That's good!

466
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,799
Keep a good appetite
and take care of your body.

467
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:04,799
Wait for my return.

468
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,200
If Your Highness returns again,

469
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,200
you may not leave necessarily.

470
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,640
Living in the capital city forever
is my wish.

471
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,599
Driving Your Highness
out of the capital city

472
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,519
is also my wish.

473
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,720
Please set off, Your Highness!

474
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Oh. Fan Xian,

475
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,920
I've left you a present.

476
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,079
Let's go.

477
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,200
Teng Zijing is probably watching!

478
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:04,720
It must be so.

479
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,599
It's a pity to just drive her away

480
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:08,000
and let her live.

481
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:10,079
Your Excellency, please mind your words.

482
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,519
I didn't say it's her!

483
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,680
Just now I heard

484
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,960
Her Highness said

485
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,200
she prepared a gift for you.

486
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,839
You must be careful!

487
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:20,039
Let's go.

488
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,319
Your Excellency!

489
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:28,680
Young Master Guo!

490
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:29,839
Have you had breakfast?

491
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,640
I won't let you go!

492
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,400
Your Excellency,
are we gonna notify the imperial court?

493
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,160
Forget about it!

494
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,359
Is Guo Baokun

495
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:41,039
the trap she set up

496
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,039
for us?

497
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,559
Li Yunrui's trap

498
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,680
won't be this easy.

499
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,400
Wait!

500
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,440
Why are you here?

501
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,799
She is my mother after all.

502
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,319
I'm sorry!

503
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,920
She wanted to hurt you and
you just tried to protect yourself.

504
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,039
I understand.

505
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,240
You are still willing to see her off

506
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,039
at this time point.

507
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:18,559
I'm the one who should be thankful.

508
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,759
She said the path you've chosen

509
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,839
will turn yourself into
the target of public criticism

510
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,720
which is therefore a dead end.

511
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,640
What I want to tell you is

512
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,279
whichever road you take is fine

513
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,400
as long as you like it.

514
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,160
I'll keep you company.

515
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,440
Uncle! Master Yuan!

516
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:09,599
Take a seat!

517
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,680
Master Yuan,

518
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,680
this round of play
doesn't hold any promise.

519
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,119
Not good! Not good! Not good!

520
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:35,680
This move is not good!

521
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:37,319
You can retract a move?!

522
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:38,920
His Excellency has retracted
dozens of moves

523
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:41,359
in today's game.

524
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,440
How do you play like that?

525
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,640
Playing the game of Go
is like fighting in the battlefield.

526
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,000
Its tricks are exquisite and extraordinary
which are beyond prediction.

527
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,799
That's also the principle
of conducting ourselves.

528
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,279
You are still young

529
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,920
and should learn about it from life.

530
00:33:58,359 --> 00:33:59,359
May I ask

531
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
whether Master Yuan
can retract his moves or not?

532
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,559
Of course not!

533
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,359
Your Excellency is indeed very smart.

534
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:06,319
Your self-conduct is admiring.

535
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,920
I also want to remind you the fact that

536
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,280
there is not so much fairness
in the world.

537
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,440
Sometimes,

538
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,679
it takes a lot of means

539
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:21,079
to start well and end well.

540
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,239
So Your Excellency's game today

541
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,159
is meant to remind Mr. Fan.

542
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:28,840
I don't understand.

543
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,480
why you retracted your moves

544
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,960
in the past.

545
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,840
I invite you here

546
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,679
to discuss something.

547
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,679
Li Yunrui lost and left
the capital city.

548
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,800
That's reasonably

549
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,920
it's time to prepare for the wedding

550
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,000
between you and Wan'er.

551
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,679
There is change to
the marriage contract?

552
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:52,400
It's not related to
the marriage contract.

553
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,039
A lot of officers
from the Six Ministries

554
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,199
submitted memorials to the throne

555
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:58,760
the other day in the Imperial Study

556
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,840
about your leakage of information

557
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,199
that led to the seizure of Yan Bingyun.

558
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,119
They all required it
to be thoroughly investigated.

559
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:08,360
But it was leaked

560
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,519
by the Princess Royal.

561
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,960
Li Yunrui only admits
colluding with Zhu Ge

562
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:14,719
to gang up for personal interest.

563
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
She never admits

564
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,239
giving away Yan Bingyun.

565
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,320
That's her trap.

566
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:25,880
What did His Majesty say?

567
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,280
He didn't say anything

568
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,440
other than watching
the mounting public indignation.

569
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,599
Uncle,

570
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,559
I didn't do anything.

571
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:40,599
I am wronged.

572
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,719
The truth is not important.

573
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,840
Then what is important?

574
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,039
Your attitude.

575
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
I don't understand.

576
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,440
I know a little bit

577
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,880
about His Majesty.

578
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,840
If I don't make it wrong,

579
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,400
he will reach out to you very soon.

580
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,199
Reach out to me? For what?

581
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:11,280
Whatever he asks you to do,

582
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,800
required by His Majesty.

583
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
He is the emperor.

584
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:17,519
How can I deny his requirement?!

585
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,599
He didn't make the decision on court.

586
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,760
Naturally it will be determined
in private.

587
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:23,719
Fan Xian,

588
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,079
your wedding with Wan'er

589
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,280
is under preparation.

590
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:29,440
Once you're married,

591
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,039
I'll transfer you to
the Ministry of Personnel.

592
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,599
So don't create any trouble

593
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,280
at this important point.

594
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,079
If it's not a distinct order,

595
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,440
unless you're clearly requested to
with an imperial edict.

596
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,119
If there should be any trouble,

597
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:43,719
put it on me.

598
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,880
Is that even possible?

599
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,960
The emperor and the officer are not
like the master and the servant.

600
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,079
They are more like two chess players.

601
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,920
You can lose any chess piece,

602
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,559
but you also need
to fight for the necessary.

603
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:12,400
You didn't do anything wrong in this.

604
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,320
Besides,

605
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,679
in view of your title
as the Poetic Genius Fan,

606
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,119
even His Majesty

607
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,800
doesn't have any way

608
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
to force you on the court.

609
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,440
But how do you tell

610
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,159
His Majesty will find me in private

611
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,440
to allow me to justify myself.

612
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:31,239
His Majesty is most interested

613
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,440
in the fight between people

614
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:34,880
and can handle like nothing.

615
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,480
In his view,
you still need more testing.

616
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,840
And now is better than never.

617
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Your Excellency,

618
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,519
Mr. Fan is summoned
to meet His Majesty in palace.

619
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,400
There it goes!

620
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,960
Off you go!

621
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,400
Remember what I said.

622
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,320
No matter what you're requested,

623
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,800
don't promise

624
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,079
unless you're clearly requested to
with an imperial edict.

625
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,440
I'll have a try.

626
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,079
Lucky!

627
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,039
Master Yuan,

628
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,519
I won again this time.

629
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,599
There is still room left.

630
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:38,639
My bad! My bad! My bad!

631
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,880
It's OK now.

632
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,199
You won!

633
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,639
Your Highness! Your Highness!

634
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,599
This is...

635
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,360
Your Excellency! Please take a seat.

636
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,239
This side please.

637
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,320
What's going on?

638
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,599
I've no idea.

639
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,239
His Majesty summoned us

640
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,679
and didn't tell us why.

641
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,119
It's hard to tell if it's good or bad.

642
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,400
His Majesty's will
is deep and unpredictable.

643
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,400
Don't even try
to guess His Majesty's will.

644
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:37,320
Your Highness is reasonable and loyal

645
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,519
which is very admiring.

646
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,239
What do you think?

647
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,239
It's a contest between Your Highnesses.

648
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:45,320
I'd rather stay impartial.

649
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:48,920
Only you

650
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,000
dare to say anything you want.

651
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:31,559
Your Majesty, everyone is here.

652
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,880
We can start the meal.

653
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,000
This is a family meal.

654
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,239
Help yourselves!

655
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,199
Your Majesty,

656
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,320
since it's a family meal,

657
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,800
my presence is improper.

658
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,639
You're thick-skinned. It's alright!

659
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:00,639
Go ahead with it!

660
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:07,559
I don't feel myself today

661
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:10,519
and can't eat anything.

662
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,199
So, I don't eat

663
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,840
and I'll watch you eating.

664
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,559
We haven't had any gathering
for a long time.

665
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,239
I've got a lot of memorials to handle.

666
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,039
So liquor won't be served. There you go!

667
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,519
Help yourselves!

668
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,199
This is not on imperial court.

669
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,440
Don't stand on ceremony.

670
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,239
He was rigid ever since he was young.

671
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,159
Now he is still a piece of wood.

672
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:46,519
Look at him!

673
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:50,599
Never showed much table manners
from childhood.

674
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:53,400
He is still like this.

675
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,599
Fan Xian.

676
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,480
Yes.

677
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:06,280
Who do you think is more promising
of them two?

678
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,440
This is a family meal.
You can speak at will!

679
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,039
No conviction?

680
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:15,840
No!

681
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,400
Then I'm gonna say it.

682
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,559
Your Majesty,
are you playing a joke with me?

683
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:27,320
This question will put me

684
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,639
in a deep trap.

685
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:29,280
No matter how I answer it,

686
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,199
it's leading me to death.

687
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,599
Loyal ministers don't fear death.

688
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,480
If all loyal ministers die,

689
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,760
there would be
only sinister ministers left.

690
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,400
Are you the loyal type

691
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,480
or the sinister type?

692
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,679
It's up to Your Majesty.

693
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,239
I'm OK either way.

694
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:45,800
How do you two

695
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,440
think of him?

696
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:52,639
Spectacularly talented and important
to the kingdom.

697
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:58,159
Loyal ministers and sinister ministers
are common.

698
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,960
But crafty loyal ministers are rare.

699
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,079
Important

700
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,360
and rare!

701
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:09,639
They are really high comments to him.

702
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,760
He deserves

703
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,559
however high comments.

704
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,280
If so,

705
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,519
he should be protected in future.

706
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,360
No matter whichever one of you
take over the throne,

707
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:23,840
he should be
an important minister on court.

708
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:31,239
Your Majesty is still young and strong.

709
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,679
You'll live a long life.

710
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:37,880
I agree.

711
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:39,920
Live a long life?

712
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,079
If I live a long life,

713
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:50,639
will you be happy

714
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:51,960
or unhappy?

715
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,639
Come on! Take a seat!

716
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,039
Go on with it!

717
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:05,400
Hurry!

718
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,400
Do you like it?

719
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,679
Your Majesty,

720
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,360
I've no idea.

721
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,119
I've no idea.

722
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,199
I was too nervous
to feel the taste of it.

723
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,039
Don't let her

724
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,360
reported the other day that

725
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:28,960
you leaked
highly confidential information

726
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,000
which is related

727
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:32,639
to Yan Bingyun's being trapped in Beiqi.

728
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,679
Do you know it?

729
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:39,039
I've heard of it.

730
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:40,239
Me too.

731
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:43,440
You have a lot of followers

732
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,559
with a wide network of adherents.

733
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,360
It's bad enough

734
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:47,480
if it's spread out there

735
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,840
for just a few days.

736
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,039
I have no adherents,

737
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,039
but I'll still eradicate
the misunderstandings

738
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:55,039
from an impartial standpoint.

739
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,079
I do have some friends

740
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,320
on the court.

741
00:44:57,639 --> 00:44:58,800
I'll warn the ones who need to be warned

742
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,280
and persuade the ones who need to be.

743
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:03,960
I'll stop the rumor
from confusing the masses.

744
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:09,159
Fan Xian,

745
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:12,239
you need to prove yourself innocent

746
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,159
and resolve this.

747
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:21,440
How do Your Majesty
want me to handle it?

748
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,639
Escort Xiao En to Beiqi

749
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:26,760
and get Yan Bingyun back .

750
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,679
We are in short of a leader.

751
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,880
Your Majesty want me

752
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,719
to go to Beiqi for the exchange?

753
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,280
Only your personal participation

754
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:36,320
can erase the misgivings on court.

755
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,559
Is that an imperial edict?

756
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:39,320
It's a suggestion

757
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,280
which depends on you.

758
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:50,800
Remember what I said.

759
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,400
No matter what you're requested,

760
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:53,960
don't promise

761
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,159
unless you're clearly requested to
with an imperial edict.

762
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,360
Fan Xian,
you had been to the Lin's Residence

763
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,559
before coming to the palace?

764
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,559
Yes, I did.

765
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,199
Prime Minister has a lot of
practical experience.

766
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:08,159
You should listen to him.

767
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:10,280
If I don't want to go to Beiqi,

768
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:12,079
does that constitute disobedience to
the imperial edict?

769
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:12,960
No!

770
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:15,480
But your engagement has to be changed.

771
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,840
What do you mean?

772
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,480
There are a lot of misgivings
from the six divisions on you.

773
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,800
If you marry Lin Wan'er

774
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,400
and take over the Neiku,

775
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,400
that doesn't make much sense.

776
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,679
It's not too bad for you.

777
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,239
If that's the case,

778
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,880
you can fix another marriage contract

779
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,360
as there are a lot of good ladies
in the capital city.

780
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:47,920
I'd like to go to Beiqi.

781
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:49,800
Think about it. Think about it.

782
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:51,519
I'm not forcing you.

783
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:53,559
You must think about it carefully.

784
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,239
I really want to go. I can't wait.

785
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:56,800
Alright!

786
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,519
Ask Chen Pingping for the schedule.

787
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:03,840
I'll hold the wedding for you

788
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,719
after you come back from Beiqi.

789
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:08,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

790
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,400
I'm a bit tired and need a rest.

791
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,920
Finish it by yourselves.

792
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:43,199
I'm fine.

793
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:55,119
I'm fine.

794
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:50,679
Rise.

795
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,840
Are you waiting for me?

796
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:01,119
I want to say goodbye here
to Your Highness.

797
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,920
You lost the title as Director

798
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,039
and got banished
to defend the remote boarders

799
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:07,400
because of me.

800
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,320
It's hurting me

801
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,599
inside my heart.

802
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:24,840
Fan Xian was assigned
by His Majesty to go north.

803
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:25,760
and set off right away.

804
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:26,679
Alright!

805
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,159
Your Highness, a message from the court

806
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:37,920
says Fan Xian will lead a mission
to go north.

807
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,840
My place of stationing

808
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:42,719
is also on the way to the north.

809
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:44,519
As soon as I get Fan Xian's schedule,

810
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,559
I'll have
that delivered to you very fast.

811
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:48,760
I'll wait for that.

812
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,639
What are you reading?

813
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,119
You...

814
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:09,920
Look at these flowers.

815
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:12,719
There is abundant water and sunshine.

816
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:14,159
Why are they all withered?

817
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,199
The horrifying Head Chen

818
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,039
is now worried about the flowers
by the side of the wall.

819
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:25,840
They were planted
by your mom years back.

820
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:29,400
If you're worried,

821
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:31,280
we can have it trimmed by a gardener

822
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,840
or moved into a flowerpot.

823
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:35,519
Your mom said

824
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,199
it has its own destiny.

825
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:40,679
Let it grow as it likes.

826
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,440
So it's always left unattended?

827
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,480
Yeah!

828
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,800
No matter how far I go these years,

829
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:51,360
I had been thinking about them.

830
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:53,719
I was afraid of losing them
after I came back.

831
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,079
They may not be able to

832
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:01,920
go through this winter.

833
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:04,320
You miss her?

834
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:23,880
It's alright!
These flowers can still be saved.

835
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,519
They are in lack of potassium.

836
00:51:25,239 --> 00:51:25,840
Potassium?

837
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,719
I've grown some medical herbs

838
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:30,559
while I was learning poison
from the teacher.

839
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,000
I will make some medicine powder

840
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:33,039
and save these flowers with it.

841
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,000
Don't worry. I am its destiny.

842
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,440
Your mom planted them and you save them.

843
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,400
That's also destiny.

844
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:04,199
The journey this time

845
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,519
is both a test and an opportunity.

846
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:08,119
But bear in mind

847
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:09,920
to get Yan Bingyun back

848
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,000
in a safe way.

849
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,320
I got it.

850
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,599
One more point.

851
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,679
Stay vigilant to one person.

852
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,760
Shen Zhong, Commander-in-chief of
Embroidered Uniform Guards.

853
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:20,199
You must be careful with him.

854
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,079
He is a very dangerous person.

855
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:24,320
It mustn't be someone good

856
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,440
who can be remembered by you.

857
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:27,639
All the rest documents

858
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,199
have been put on your carriage.

859
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:30,719
Read them on the way.

860
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,920
You must memorize
the political situation of Beiqi.

861
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,360
Sure!

862
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,800
You're leaving for Beiqi

863
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:42,000
in a few days.

864
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:43,760
I'll send people to protect you secretly

865
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,199
in case Princess Royal
does something bad to you.

866
00:52:47,159 --> 00:52:47,639
Sure!

867
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,519
Have you met Lin Ruofu?

868
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:50,480
Yes!

869
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,679
What did he say?

870
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,320
He asked me

871
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,239
not to promise anything

872
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:57,239
required by His Majesty.

873
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,199
But you promised it all.

874
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,679
His Majesty said

875
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,159
if I don't go to Beiqi,

876
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,800
my marriage will be changed.

877
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:08,920
Even though the task of visiting Beiqi

878
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,280
is important this time,

879
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:10,920
it is not as important

880
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,840
as your life.

881
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,360
I think you're a good person.

882
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:18,119
I...

883
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:20,400
A good person?

884
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,920
Nobody ever sees

885
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:25,920
to say something like this
over the years.

886
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:27,360
I have a good sense of judgement

887
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:28,480
which can save a lot of trouble.

888
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,679
After you come back from the north,

889
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:35,880
you can gradually take over

890
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,639
the Investigator's Office.

891
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:39,519
By then,
the Neiku and the Investigator's Office

892
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:40,800
will be all in your hands.

893
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,440
I'll assist you secretly

894
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:47,360
to turn you into
the No.1 minister of Nanqing.

895
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,519
No one will be able to jeopardize

896
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,079
your safety by then.

897
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,679
Not even His Majesty?

898
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,719
You shouldn't ask like that.

899
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:55,559
I'll keep my mouth shut!

900
00:53:59,039 --> 00:53:59,639
Go!

901
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,639
Someone is waiting for you
in the Bagua Hall.

902
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:03,239
Waiting for me?

903
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,920
You'll see after you arrive.

904
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,880
Junior Fellow Apprentice,
do you still remember me?

905
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,119
Senior Fellow Apprentice Leng?

906
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:12,280
Yeah! Yeah!

907
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,760
Mr. Fei is away.
I'm in temporary charge of the Third Division.

908
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,559
I heard you're going to Beiqi?

909
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,760
The Third Division

910
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,840
prepared something for you.

911
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,599
Come and check it out.

912
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,760
Nice to meet you,
Senior Fellow Apprentices!

913
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,920
Nice to meet you,
Junior Fellow Apprentice!

914
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:23,119
Let's catch up later.

915
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:23,920
Come over here.

916
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:36,679
You are in pretty good shape.

917
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:37,920
This is the right size.

918
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:40,800
Come on. Have a try!

919
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,320
What's this?

920
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,519
See!

921
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:50,440
It is fire-proof when worn inside.

922
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,280
But it can't resist constant burning.

923
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,320
It can also defend you from

924
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,920
the harm of

925
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:57,719
some sharp weapons.

926
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:58,960
If your enemy

927
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,199
uses machete axe,

928
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,039
you'd better evade from that.

929
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,960
This is a newly-developed crossbow.

930
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:07,280
Pad here and it'll shoot the arrows.

931
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,000
Wrong direction.

932
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:13,639
It's very hidden

933
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,000
but not so destructive.

934
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:16,719
It is deadly
only if shot to lethal parts.

935
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,639
Never mind!

936
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:20,960
A4 poison is easy to be detoxicated.

937
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:21,639
He will come back to life

938
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:22,840
after a while.

939
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,440
Umbrella cover made of asbestos cloth.

940
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:27,000
Very strong umbrella structure.

941
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,719
Open it when falling down from high.

942
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,480
It'll help reduce the speed of falling.

943
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:33,440
This rope can sustain

944
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:35,239
the weight of four to five people

945
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:36,079
without a problem.

946
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,519
You can strangle a few people

947
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,519
with it when you feel bored.

948
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,039
This looks just like a jade pendant.

949
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:45,360
You can smash it in times of emergency

950
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,880
and hide yourself.

951
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,719
I have put some piquant powder as well

952
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,599
which can stop the enemies.

953
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:53,840
Open the door quickly!

954
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:57,239
No!

955
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:01,920
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

956
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,400
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

957
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,639
Don't swing it. There are needles in it.

958
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:09,119
Look!

959
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,679
It's C6 poison on them

960
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:12,719
which is not lethal
but will make you itchy.

961
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,199
Itchy.

962
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:30,599
Murder!

963
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:35,039
Your Excellency,
please get off the carriage!

964
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,079
What happened?

965
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,039
There are enemies ahead
trying to attack us.

966
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:39,880
Who are they?

967
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:40,719
I didn't see clearly.

968
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,840
We've lost touch

969
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,000
with most of the people
protecting Your Excellency.

970
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
They are very terrific people.

971
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:46,239
How about Your Excellency leaving first?

972
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:47,039
I'll defend at the back.

973
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:47,599
Your Excellency. Leave first.

974
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:56,840
Everyone from the Third Division
comes here.

975
00:56:59,079 --> 00:56:59,920
People protecting Your Excellency
are completely annihilated.

976
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:00,960
Your Excellency. Go now!

977
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,360
Teacher,

978
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,320
It stinks!

979
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:21,719
The Third Division's crossbow.

980
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,559
No. 3 poison. Oh no!

981
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:24,159
No. 4 poison.

982
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,639
You're back!

983
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,159
Just now

984
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:31,360
I saw a lot of sneaky people

985
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,599
around you.

986
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:33,920
I'm fine.

987
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,320
I've knocked them down.

988
00:57:43,639 --> 00:57:44,719
Why do you look at me like that?

989
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,000
They are from the Sixth Division?

990
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:53,519
They protected me.

991
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,800
The Investigator's Office
has too many people.

992
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,960
I don't know them all.

993
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,239
They are not dead, are they?

994
00:57:58,239 --> 00:57:58,880
No!

995
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,440
My poison is not lethal.

996
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,000
Let's go.

997
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:05,159
Your Excellency!

998
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:07,920
Mr. Fei.

999
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:11,239
Well, he...

1000
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:12,159
I'm serving

1001
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,079
His Excellency Fan now.

1002
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:17,519
Let's go together.

1003
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,599
Mr. Fei, haven't seen you for ages.

1004
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:30,800
Your Majesty.

1005
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:38,159
Are you here to argue?

1006
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,800
I dare not to.

1007
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,679
Then you're here for Fan Xian.

1008
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:45,280
Beiqi is our enemy after all.

1009
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:46,679
It doesn't have to be him

1010
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,559
for the visit.

1011
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,480
Minister Lu has left his position
for his hometown due to sickness.

1012
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,920
You have to take over the position

1013
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,800
as the Minister of Ministry of Revenue.

1014
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,519
I'm here not for promotion.

1015
00:59:01,719 --> 00:59:03,360
I can give up the Assistant Minister

1016
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,199
if I can stop Fan Xian from going north.

1017
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,039
You want to breach the laws
and regulations of the imperial court?

1018
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,920
What if he gets killed?

1019
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:12,239
He should take up more challenges

1020
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:13,440
as a young man

1021
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:16,480
otherwise how will he take up
bigger responsibilities?

1022
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,400
Then leave the bigger responsibilities.

1023
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,239
Do you know what I like about you?

1024
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,559
A lot of people don't wish him to go!

1025
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,119
You are the only one
who comes to me for it.

1026
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,719
If someone else comes for it,

1027
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:41,559
it's a disobedience to the law.

1028
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:43,559
Who do Your Majesty mean?

1029
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,079
You have to take over the position

1030
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,800
of Minister of the Ministry of Revenue.

1031
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,239
So does Fan Xian with his visit.

1032
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:55,599
Your Majesty.

1033
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:56,679
No bargaining!

1034
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,719
Then please allow my personal guards

1035
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,960
to protect him on the way north.

1036
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:07,079
Don't do this again!

1037
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,000
You want me to help you stand up?

1038
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:18,320
Leave us.

1039
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:47,960
Didn't you say

1040
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,920
you have important things to tell me?

1041
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,239
I'm going to Beiqi.

1042
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:53,079
I know.

1043
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,920
Actually, I don't want to go.

1044
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:56,760
Then don't!

1045
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:00,199
If I don't go to Beiqi,

1046
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:04,519
the marriage contract will be gone.

1047
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:06,880
I've passed on your order

1048
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,920
Who else's could it be?

1049
01:01:11,719 --> 01:01:13,079
We can elope.

1050
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,760
I don't want you

1051
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:20,079
to force yourself

1052
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,480
into something you don't like for me.

1053
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:26,679
You must come back alive

1054
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:29,599
from this journey.

1055
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,440
I'll be waiting for you here

1056
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:37,159
with cherry flowers.
