=Episode 9=

16
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,359
To be honest,

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,640
I've no idea.

18
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,879
how many floors the dungeon has.

19
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,079
You can go ask first.

20
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,280
I will ask someone to dig

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,840
a small enough dark room

22
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,400
under the deepest floor

23
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,680
for you to live alone.

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,239
It doesn't sound horrible.

25
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,319
What do you think is better
to be kept there?

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,280
In such a narrow

27
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,479
and retired place,

28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,360
merely designed for reserving things.

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,639
There will be no light

30
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,840
and sound

31
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,400
but the endless darkness and silence.

32
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,000
Trust me,

33
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,400
no one can stay

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,400
in such a place like that.

35
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,120
I can choose to die.

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,159
At least, I can commit suicide.

37
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,280
Take one,

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,439
you will be poisoned
to death immediately.

39
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,919
I have offered you the chance to choose.

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,639
Either

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,400
you spend the rest of your life
in the place under the deep ground,

42
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,319
or

43
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,759
I don't mind you

44
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,759
poisoning yourself
to death in front of me.

45
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:30,120
If I die,

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,159
you will never know

47
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,080
who the guy is.

48
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,000
Do as you wish.

49
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:57,879
Help yourselves!

50
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,680
What are you hesitating for?

51
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,400
Isn't death what you want?

52
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,159
Take it.

53
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,960
Si Lili, you won't poison yourself.

54
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,520
If you want to die,

55
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,120
you'd have killed yourself

56
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,319
when black knights appeared
outside the capital city.

57
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,920
When I went downstairs,

58
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,839
I saw you there alone,

59
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,800
locked in the cage

60
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,639
without messy hairs.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,879
You should have tidied yourself up.

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,759
How can a person

63
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,879
who cares that much about her appearance

64
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,439
will be willing to die?

65
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,600
Si Lili, you're so young

66
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,439
that you have too many hopes.

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,279
You'll get to know one day,

68
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:46,920
hope

69
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,319
is the most horrible thing

70
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,639
in this world.

71
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,160
I'll never break my promise.

72
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,800
Tell me his name

73
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,439
and I'll keep you safe.

74
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,519
If I tell you the name,

75
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,600
how would you know
whether I'm telling the truth?

76
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,519
I can judge for myself.

77
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:11,920
Fine.

78
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,519
I tell you the name.

79
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,480
Don't send me
to the Ministry of Penalty.

80
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,959
Don't let me suffer these tortures.

81
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,439
Don't let anyone else humiliate me.

82
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,360
I will keep my words.

83
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,560
Aren't you afraid of me
lisping my tongue to death?

84
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,360
Do you dare?

85
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,480
It's you again.

86
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,120
Your Excellency Zhu,
Your Excellency Yan.

87
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,360
To tell you the truth,

88
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,600
I return to

89
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,160
take my stuff.

90
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,000
but unexpectedly,

91
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,720
our Investigator's Office is

92
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,000
fortified so heavily.

93
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,040
Good. It's great.

94
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,480
What do you want to take?

95
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,879
Your Excellency,

96
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,120
there are some bank notes

97
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,439
hidden in some of my office-copies

98
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,360
with postils

99
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,480
on the desk of my room.

100
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,480
Hide bank notes in the office-copies?

101
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,680
Your Excellency may not know that

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,240
My wife always

103
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,600
frisks me

104
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,839
in an extremely thorough way.

105
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,720
So,

106
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,160
I can only choose some other ways
to hide my stuffs.

107
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:37,120
Go search his room.

108
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,079
As you wish.

109
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,839
You see.

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,879
Fan Xian, don't investigate it anymore.

111
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,360
Don't tell anyone the truth

112
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:07,160
I investigate you for.

113
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,120
If someone else questions you,

114
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,240
you can say
you're the secret agent of Beiqi.

115
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't tell anyone

116
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,959
what the guy forces you into.

117
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,959
But if someone asks me

118
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,839
what you talked with me,

119
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,600
what should I answer?

120
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,199
There must be some other
secret agents in the capital city.

121
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,639
Give him some names.

122
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,800
Choose those who don't
get along well with you.

123
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,120
Tell him this is all that

124
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,800
I have found today.

125
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,160
You hide everything

126
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
to protect that guy?

127
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,639
I want you to trust me.

128
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
I am the only one

129
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,600
who is willing to keep you alive

130
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,800
who wants to save your life.

131
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,439
Fine.

132
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,720
The bank note belongs to me.

133
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,439
Thank you, Your Excellency.

134
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,159
Wang Qinian,

135
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,120
How is the interrogation going?

136
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,200
She has admitted that

137
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,080
she is the secret agent from Beiqi.

138
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,840
We have already known it.

139
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,240
This is the list of names of those

140
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,240
Beiqi secret agents
who are hiding in the capital city.

141
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,240
What else?

142
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,039
That's all.

143
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,240
You really got something.

144
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,639
Leave the rest to me.

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,480
Wait!

146
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:55,840
What do I need to do?

147
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,600
I have promised to let her go.

148
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,960
You promised?

149
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,919
No killing, no interrogating.

150
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,039
No torturing.

151
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,279
Just lock her in the dungeon.

152
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,679
Fan Xian, do you think you have

153
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,120
the right to make the decision?

154
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,399
He does have.

155
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
It's what the Head asks him to do.

156
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,240
The follow-up to Si Lili's case

157
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,039
will be handed over to Fan Xian.

158
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,399
Interrogate harder and harder.

159
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,399
Interrogate harder.

160
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,600
We must be able to find out something.

161
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:24,840
It's the Head's decision.

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,120
My plan is really simple.

163
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,039
Lock her inside.

164
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,159
Don't let anyone bother her.

165
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,919
I have another question.

166
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
don't let anyone know

167
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:36,799
I can't let others know

168
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Do as you wish.

169
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,120
Your Excellency, what do you think?

170
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,000
It's the Head's decision.

171
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,759
Can I take him away?

172
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,759
It's up to you.

173
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,519
Let's go, Wang.

174
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:24,720
You said you wouldn't
come with me, didn't you?

175
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,799
I couldn't help

176
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,559
but come here to check it out.

177
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,279
Wang Qinian, you're a good man.

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,879
What are you laughing at?

179
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,200
I never thought I would be the one

180
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,120
to send you

181
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,919
the Good Man Card.

182
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,360
What is the Good Man Card?

183
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,000
Nothing.

184
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:53,080
Nothing will happen tonight.
You can go home.

185
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,519
Your Excellency,
have you found out any clues?

186
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,480
You guys.

187
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,720
Listen to me.

188
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,320
Keep what I say in mind.

189
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,120
Later when you go outside in the street,

190
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,120
use all your strength to

191
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,879
ring drums and gongs.

192
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,000
Use all your strength.

193
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:19,480
You who beat drums

194
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,600
don't stop

195
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,240
until you break your drums.

196
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,279
And you who beat small cymbals

197
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,320
should make it louder than big cymbals.

198
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:27,559
And you who beat big cymbals
should make it louder than gongs.

199
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,360
Are you clear?

200
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,399
Fan Sizhe.

201
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,200
You're running wild again.

202
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:33,120
Sister, I'm not.

203
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,120
I'm intending to help Fan Xian.

204
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:36,360
Fan Xian says

205
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:37,919
he's going to meet
my future sister-in-law.

206
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,720
He asks me to

207
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,919
make a greater show of power.

208
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,200
This is magnificent.

209
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,519
Turn around, you guys.

210
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,039
Brother.

211
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,200
I went to Wan'er's place yesterday

212
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,559
and was stopped by her second brother.

213
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,279
I guess it must be
because of me sneaking

214
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,799
into Wan'er's room.

215
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,360
I pondered over it for the whole night

216
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,120
and finally figured it out.

217
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,480
I'd better go there in public

218
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,759
in this way and at an open
and frank attitude.

219
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,320
I will please him

220
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,960
and transfer his anger to happiness.

221
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,240
Isn't it magnificent enough?

222
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,639
A wedding ceremony
won't be better than this.

223
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,120
Not to mention him sneaking in,

224
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,399
now he goes so far as to

225
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,080
come here with ringing gangs and drums.

226
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,240
If I don't split him to death,

227
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,360
I will give up my fame.

228
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,399
The ones using
long weapons guard outside.

229
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,480
Those who are good
at hidden weapons burn his bridge.

230
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,559
Don't be flustered.

231
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,960
Kill him as soon as he steps
into the courtyard.

232
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,879
I will face the music

233
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,360
after he dies.

234
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,879
Let him in

235
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,600
but give him little chance
of going back.

236
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:41,559
Dismiss.

237
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:42,720
As you wish.

238
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,840
Fan Xian, from the Fans mansion,

239
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,720
goes specially to the imperial residence

240
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,080
to visit the Princess.

241
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,799
This a great story on everybody's lips.

242
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,600
Hope everyone can join us
to celebrate for him.

243
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,440
Bravo.

244
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,159
Bravo.

245
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,200
Fan Sizhe is really gregarious.

246
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,720
Brother,

247
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,879
Mr. Lin is the second brother

248
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,320
of the sister-in-law after all.

249
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,080
I know it.

250
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,840
You went to her boudoir secretly.

251
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,720
It's natural that he got angry.

252
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,399
So I go there in public this time.

253
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,799
It's no better than sneaking.

254
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,200
Really?

255
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,480
If you do it like this,

256
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,840
it seems like you show disrespect

257
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,720
to Mr. Lin.

258
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,480
Do you think so?

259
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,159
You didn't do this on purpose, did you?

260
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:51,240
On purpose for what?

261
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,639
You go there in public deliberately to

262
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:54,720
deceive the public

263
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,960
and relax their vigilance

264
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,639
by the farce with Mr. Lin.

265
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:00,679
Why should I do that?

266
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,559
Could it be that you've found clues

267
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,480
to the case happened
in the Niulan Street?

268
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,000
Brilliant.

269
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,080
Is that so?

270
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,159
It's not proper to talk about this now
I will tell you the details later.

271
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:10,879
Ruoruo,

272
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,000
you can't go any further.

273
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:13,879
Or…

274
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,720
I'll wait here for you.

275
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,480
Okay.

276
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:24,279
Second brother,

277
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,440
Second brother, why do you
have to create tension?

278
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,759
This bastard Fan Xian,
his motive is execrable.

279
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,279
Why does he come here

280
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,240
aggressively?

281
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,559
Because I don't let him see you.

282
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,960
Your identity can't be known
by the public.

283
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,840
Now he makes

284
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,600
everyone know it deliberately.

285
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,879
He wants to force me to retreat

286
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,200
without interfering

287
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,799
in the name of the Prime Minister.

288
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:46,360
Fine.

289
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,480
I won't show up to stop him.

290
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
I'll let him in.

291
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:53,879
Once he comes in,

292
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,840
he won't have the chance to go back.

293
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,559
Second brother,

294
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,159
why do you have to do this?

295
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:07,679
Second brother,

296
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,679
Her Highness is
as gorgeous as a goddess.

297
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,480
I, Fan Xian, have been
adoring her for long.

298
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,559
Since we have the marriage contract,

299
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,399
I should have the chance to meet her.

300
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:24,360
Am I right?

301
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,960
Let him in. Let him in. Let him in.

302
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,559
Let him in. Let him in.

303
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,320
Let him in. Let him in. Let him in.

304
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,200
Let him in.

305
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,960
Let him in. Let him in.

306
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,720
Let him in. They should meet each other.

307
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,840
Let him in. Let him in.

308
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,960
Thank you for coming here.

309
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,080
Thanks.

310
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,200
Thank you.

311
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,039
Let him in. Let him in. Let him in.

312
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,799
Let him in.

313
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,080
Let him in.

314
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,080
Yes!

315
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,000
You should leave!

316
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,000
The Second Young Master
is going to kill you.

317
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,279
To think it over,

318
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,720
it's ridiculous to come here today
in this way.

319
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,039
I'll see you again.

320
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,960
They're indeed masters of seventh Dan.

321
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,559
Second Young Master.

322
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,200
How's it going?

323
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,519
As you have ordered,

324
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:09,720
we surrounded Fan Xian

325
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,440
as soon as he stepped
into the courtyard.

326
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,160
But unexpectedly,

327
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,799
he is so crafty.

328
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,079
He climbed over the wall and ran away

329
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,200
after exchanging several blows with us.

330
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:17,680
We didn't chase him anymore.

331
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:18,960
Trash!

332
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:20,240
Back off!

333
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,480
As you wish.

334
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,400
Brat!

335
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,759
Is he a psycho?

336
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:30,039
He came here with great fanfare

337
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,240
but left without hesitation.

338
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,799
What on earth does he want?

339
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,720
He is not supposed to

340
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,920
go against you.

341
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,480
He has gone too far!

342
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,480
Second brother,

343
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,920
It's His Majesty

344
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,880
who ordered us to get engaged.

345
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,519
But you're a daughter

346
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,640
of the Prime Minister.

347
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,359
We don't have connections in public.

348
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:47,960
Wan'er.

349
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,079
You know the identity of our father.

350
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,359
He can't accept you in public.

351
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,319
And he has a guilty conscience.

352
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,039
I know it.

353
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,359
Though he doesn't speak it out loud,

354
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:01,160
you're still the daughter
of the Lin family.

355
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,680
People like Fan Xian

356
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,200
deserve you.

357
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,240
Second brother,

358
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,440
you have just met him for several times,

359
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,640
why do you make such a judgement?

360
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:13,000
This is what our father wants.

361
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,039
He has already
prepared the office-copy well

362
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,680
and will choose a right time
to report to His Majesty in person

363
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,279
and ask him to call off
the marriage contract.

364
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,319
Whatever messes Fan Xian makes,

365
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,400
he won't be able
to change the overall situation.

366
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,920
He won't get a chance to marry you.

367
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,279
I've just heard
that you went to find Wan'er.

368
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,720
Why are you here?

369
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,039
The same question I asked you last time.

370
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,759
Who was the guy

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,599
staying with Si Lili

372
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,559
in the Joy Tsin House the other day?

373
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,920
No matter how many times you ask me,
I won't say anything.

374
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,319
He is Lin Gong.

375
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,880
He is the second son of the Lin family.

376
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:14,799
I didn't

377
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,000
I have known the answer

378
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:19,960
through your eyes.

379
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,480
Exactly.

380
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:03,240
I didn't believe it

381
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,079
when I first heard

382
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:04,799
the name.

383
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,519
Since I don't have a feud with him,

384
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,119
so I roughly investigated

385
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:08,799
his background.

386
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,880
I drew a simple conclusion that

387
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,079
the Second Young Master
of the Prime Minister Mansion

388
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,440
is one of the flat-out followers

389
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,240
of the Crown Prince.

390
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,400
So,

391
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,559
this is the reason why

392
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,079
you don't dare to tell me the truth.

393
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,240
The Ye family has the support
of the Great Master,

394
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:27,319
so the son of Prime Minister doesn't

395
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:28,039
mean anything to you.

396
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,960
But when it comes to the Crown Prince,
the situation is different.

397
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,160
If you offend the Crown Prince,

398
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,920
the status of the Ye family
in the Nanqing

399
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,359
will be at risk.

400
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,039
You know that

401
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,599
the Crown Prince is the future emperor
of the Nanqing.

402
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:42,319
No matter who asks me
about this question,

403
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,480
I won't admit that

404
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,319
the one I met the other day
was Lin Gong.

405
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,279
I know,

406
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,079
What I want is the truth.

407
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,400
I won't make you testify for me.

408
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,640
Fan Xian.

409
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:58,680
Forget about it!

410
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,079
You shouldn't go any further.

411
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:05,559
If no one died,

412
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:06,759
I would be willing to let it go.

413
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,559
Cheng Jushu was killed by you.

414
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,640
He is not the real murderer.

415
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,200
But the man died is just a guard.

416
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,880
Everyone says the same thing.

417
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:20,519
It really

418
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,359
makes me furious the most.

419
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,160
Have I said anything wrong?

420
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,359
Does the guard have another identity?

421
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,960
No, he doesn't. He is just a guard.

422
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,400
People in the whole world
take him as nobody.

423
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:38,880
I don't agree with them.

424
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,599
What else can you do?

425
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,000
Thanks for telling me the truth.

426
00:21:56,599 --> 00:21:58,680
Wan'er, take care of yourself

427
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,039
and don't be bothered by these things.

428
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,839
Since His Majesty ordered Fan Xian
to leave Danzhou,

429
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,039
he must have made up his mind.

430
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,759
Father and I will take care of these.

431
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,440
His Majesty won't allow us to

432
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,519
call off the marriage contract,

433
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,640
even though Father
submits the memorials.

434
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,319
The result won't change.

435
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,799
There is always a way.

436
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,000
Don't worry.

437
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,559
I won't put you at risk.

438
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,000
But I'm willing to marry him.

439
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,440
You're deceived by

440
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,720
the sweet words of that brat.

441
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,359
He really has a glib tongue

442
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,519
and doesn't behave seriously sometimes,

443
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,640
but the expression
in his eyes is really pure.

444
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:37,799
Second brother,

445
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,440
I don't know what has happened

446
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,559
between you two,

447
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,519
but he is definitely
not a flibbertigibbet.

448
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:43,319
What kind of man he is

449
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,160
That doesn't matter anymore.

450
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,960
Maybe he is a good man,

451
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:46,960
or maybe as you say,

452
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,559
he is sincere.

453
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:48,559
But he isn't supposed
to come to the capital city.

454
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,559
Many people have been staring at him.

455
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,359
What do you mean?

456
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:00,680
Wan'er, our family owes you a lot.

457
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:02,680
Sometimes,

458
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,559
I don't really know

459
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,079
how I can make it up to you.

460
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,960
Second brother,
you've always been kind to me.

461
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,680
I know that in my heart.

462
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,440
Dad seldom comes to see you

463
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,440
for the sake of the overall situation
and our family.

464
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,920
I know,

465
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:26,759
But sometimes I couldn't help wondering.

466
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,200
If we can't protect our family members,

467
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:32,400
what's the meaning of maintaining
the glory of our family?

468
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,160
I don't allow you to marry him

469
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,000
for fear that he might
get you into trouble.

470
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,680
I just want to protect you.

471
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,079
I'll leave this to you.

472
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:53,880
Don't let him see you ever again.

473
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:51,799
Brother.

474
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,000
Lin Gong is the one
who wants to kill me.

475
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,680
The Second Young Master? Why?

476
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,279
Is he a follower of the Crown Prince,

477
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,599
or is it about the financial power
of the Neiku?

478
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,240
Nobody has ever asked me!

479
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,160
Nobody! Never!

480
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,079
They just want the financial power
of the Neiku, right?

481
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:26,079
I'll give it to them.

482
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
I never want it myself.

483
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:32,680
They can just ask,

484
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,799
but they actually chose to kill people!

485
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,200
Why did you

486
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,400
make a fuss

487
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
at the imperial residence just now?

488
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,079
I broke into the imperial residence

489
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,119
to offer him a chance to kill me.

490
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,920
I've noticed that his subordinates

491
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,799
are all martial arts masters of
and above the Seventh Dan.

492
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,480
They are strong enough

493
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,799
to capture Cheng Jushu.

494
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:50,519
Later, I visited Ye Ling'er.

495
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,640
From her,

496
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,759
I confirmed that Lin Gong
is the real killer.

497
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,359
So Lin Gong follows the Crown Prince?

498
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,000
Now, I have no evidence to prove that

499
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,960
the Crown Prince is involved.

500
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,319
So for now,

501
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,119
Lin Gong is my only revenge target.

502
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:12,680
When will you take a move?

503
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,279
Quick-tempered as I am,
I can hardly wait.

504
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:17,200
I'll kill him tonight.

505
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:18,440
Didn't you just say that

506
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,599
he's surrounded by martial arts masters?

507
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:20,279
I still have to go!

508
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,279
Only to avenge Teng Zijing's death?

509
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,720
I do it for Teng Zijing,

510
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:24,839
but not only

511
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:25,720
for him.

512
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,720
Who else?

513
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,839
Ruoruo, look!

514
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,240
Most people in the world

515
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,720
are ordinary, just like them.

516
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,839
But there're always some theories,

517
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,839
some big potatoes

518
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:45,640
that regard them as insignificant.

519
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,799
He's dead, but he's just a guard.

520
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,759
I've heard that so many times.

521
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,799
Ruoruo, I enjoy crowds.

522
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,319
I think that
without the ordinary people,

523
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,920
Nanqing won't exist.

524
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,000
Nor will the world.

525
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,640
Pick me something fat.

526
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,640
Look at this. And this.

527
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,319
I made it! I made it!

528
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,759
So I want to fight

529
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:19,640
with the hows and whys in the world

530
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,599
and tell those big potatoes that

531
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,839
ordinary people are important.

532
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,680
Brother,

533
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
you only think about them.

534
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,119
Why don't you think about yourself?

535
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,759
About what?

536
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,000
Lin Gong is the elder brother
of Lin Wan'er,

537
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,720
just like us.

538
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,000
If you open it

539
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,079
Lin Wan'er kills me,

540
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:46,240
will you still marry her?

541
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,240
I know you want to revenge.

542
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:54,480
You refuse to accept what has happened.

543
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:56,680
I understand it all,
so I won't stop you.

544
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,759
But you must understand that

545
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,839
if you kill Lin Gong yourself,

546
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,599
there will be no future

547
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,799
for Wan'er and you.

548
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:11,279
Ruoruo, please go back first.

549
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,839
I want to be alone.

550
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:24,880
Brother,

551
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:28,160
I know you want to revenge.

552
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,359
You refuse to accept what has happened.

553
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,519
I understand it all,
so I won't stop you.

554
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,599
But you must understand that

555
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,680
if you kill Lin Gong yourself,

556
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:36,960
there will be no future

557
00:29:38,119 --> 00:29:39,640
for Wan'er and you.

558
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:50,720
Uncle Wuzhu.

559
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,039
Start again.

560
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,519
Lin Gong planned the assassination
on the Niulan Street.

561
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,680
Teng Zijing died a grim death
because of me.

562
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:58,720
I know.

563
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,160
I want to kill him.

564
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:02,880
You're hesitant.

565
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,680
I'm not.

566
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
I'm the one that he wants to kill!

567
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,480
Teng Zijing died for me!

568
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,599
I have to kill him.

569
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,160
You're utterly confused!

570
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,160
If you go now,
you'll get yourself killed.

571
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,799
Uncle, step aside.

572
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:15,680
Let's go back.

573
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,240
So do you also think that

574
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,119
Teng Zijing's death

575
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,200
means nothing?

576
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:20,279
That's right.

577
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:32,000
That'll be enough.

578
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,000
You've made some progress,

579
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,839
but you still lack patience.

580
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,480
Uncle Wuzhu.

581
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,759
Uncle Wuzhu.

582
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:10,359
Uncle Wuzhu.

583
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,759
Brother, what's up?

584
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:15,759
Where's Uncle Wuzhu?

585
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:17,160
Uncle Wuzhu.

586
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:18,759
The man who helped you in Danzhou?

587
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:20,440
No.

588
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:22,680
Why am I home?

589
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,319
What's the matter?

590
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,480
Brother, where are you going?

591
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,079
To kill Lin Gong.

592
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,920
He left.

593
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,720
This morning,

594
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,319
Lin Gong left the city in a hurry.

595
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:35,400
How did you know

596
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,799
Ye Ling'er from the Ye mansion
came to see you.

597
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,000
She brought the news.

598
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,799
Where does Lin Gong go?

599
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,200
She didn't mention that.

600
00:32:59,039 --> 00:32:59,759
Kill him.

601
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:01,880
No one can see my face.

602
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,480
What's up?

603
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,319
Wait! My sheep!

604
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
We must start
from the Prime Minister's mansion.

605
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,079
The impresses of carriages
are different.

606
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,519
Only by searching from the start

607
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,839
can we find a trace.

608
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,799
I've been thinking recently.

609
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,359
You might have flaws,

610
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
but capable as you are,

611
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,960
how come you're just a clerk?

612
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,359
I just seek ease and comfort.

613
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:29,079
Then you should never follow me.

614
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:30,759
These days,

615
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,319
what I did

616
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,480
is extremely dangerous.

617
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,480
Your Excellency,
you're generous after all.

618
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,480
Don't mention the money.

619
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,119
It's only an excuse.

620
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,680
We both know that

621
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,400
you follow me for some other reasons.

622
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:45,680
The Prime Minister's mansion
is right ahead.

623
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,519
I won't ask if you don't want to say.

624
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,000
I have met you before!

625
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:02,160
You're the subordinate of Chengze.

626
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,079
Distinguished as His Highness is,

627
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,160
how dare you call him like that!

628
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,519
I won't next time. See you.

629
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,400
His Highness wants to see you.

630
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:11,800
I have something urgent to deal with.

631
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,199
I'll ask for his forgiveness in person
some other day.

632
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,920
His Highness is nearby.

633
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,280
Go by yourself.

634
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,480
Your Excellency, please go ahead.

635
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,559
Though I've read the Red Mansions
for several times,

636
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm still fond of reading it.

637
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:41,719
Have you read it?

638
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,639
Why are you reading here?

639
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,000
Cross ventilation

640
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,000
makes it shady and cool here.

641
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,679
It's really a good place
for reading at noon.

642
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,639
The beauty of the capital city

643
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,320
lies not in various mansions,

644
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,880
but in streets and alleys.

645
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,159
It does have a distinctive flavor.

646
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,119
Your Highness, do you think I'm silly?

647
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,440
Why do you say so?

648
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,679
Your Highness, you find a place

649
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:03,800
to enjoy the cool and read the book
when you're free.

650
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,039
And I happen to be around.

651
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,119
How silly am I

652
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,119
to believe this crap?

653
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,320
You're right.

654
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:15,159
I'm actually waiting for you.

655
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:17,800
Are you looking for Lin Gong?

656
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:18,960
How do you know?

657
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,559
This morning,

658
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,639
Lin Gong and the Crown Prince
met at the Eastern Palace

659
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,559
and had a quarrel.

660
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:25,960
Your name was heard vaguely

661
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:27,920
outside the study.

662
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,760
Then Lin Gong left the capital
in a hurry.

663
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,760
So I wait for you
near the Prime Minister's mansion.

664
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,920
And you really show up.

665
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:35,119
Your Highness, how can you know

666
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,079
what happened in the Eastern Palace?

667
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,079
I sure have spies there.

668
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:41,119
Is it appropriate to tell me that?

669
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:42,320
It doesn't matter.

670
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,719
It's not a secret.

671
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:45,400
I've also got spies
from the Crown Prince around me.

672
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,440
How loving and touching

673
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,480
you are!

674
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:51,800
No one but you

675
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,079
has ever talked to me like that.

676
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,519
Your Highness,
are you waiting for me here

677
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,840
to tell me that?

678
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,360
I'm asking you,

679
00:35:58,599 --> 00:35:59,920
are you looking for Lin Gong?

680
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,360
Yes.

681
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,039
I won't ask you why.

682
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:02,719
I only ask you,

683
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:03,639
will there be a fight?

684
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,079
Yes.

685
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,639
This morning, Lin Gong left

686
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:06,400
with many guards.

687
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,199
They are all martial arts masters.

688
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:07,800
Do you know?

689
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,920
I know. They are masters of
or above the Seventh Dan.

690
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:09,760
Can you defeat them?

691
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,440
Not really.

692
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,280
Xie Bi'an is known as

693
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,840
"Faster than Light."

694
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:18,079
He is the best swordsman

695
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,039
in the capital city.

696
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,000
Faster than light?

697
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,000
Fast sword.

698
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,280
I know S.F. Express for being fast.

699
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,800
You actually

700
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,639
understand swordsmanship!

701
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:32,000
To attack fast,

702
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,360
besides a flexible figure,

703
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,440
you must borrow the power of nature.

704
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,519
Attacking with the wind
will sure make a difference.

705
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,400
Unbelievable!

706
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,079
With Xie Bi'an by your side,

707
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,079
you might stand a chance.

708
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:51,760
Your Highness, why do you help me?

709
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,440
I appreciate your talents.

710
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,639
Also, if you marry Wan'er,

711
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:57,760
you'll take over the Neiku.

712
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,519
I'm friendly with you

713
00:36:58,519 --> 00:36:59,960
for the sake of the properties.

714
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,800
I really appreciate

715
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,559
your frankness.

716
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,559
But this time,

717
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,400
no need to bother Mr. Xie.

718
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,320
Then be careful yourself.

719
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:13,280
Your Highness, aren't you angry?

720
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,079
It's perfectly justifiable
to choose the Crown Prince.

721
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,599
It makes sense that you don't choose me.

722
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,480
Why should I be angry?

723
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,239
Compared to the Crown Prince,

724
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:19,960
I think Your Highness
stand a better chance.

725
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:24,079
If you have time,
we can meet more often.

726
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:26,159
We won't talk
about national affairs, but romance.

727
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,239
Second Young Master,

728
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:09,760
a blind man at the door
wants to see you.

729
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:11,280
A blind man?

730
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,840
Can he practice martial arts?

731
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,440
He doesn't have any vitality qi.

732
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,639
Let him in.

733
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:19,440
Everyone, watch out!
Prepare to attack at any time!

734
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,440
Who are you?

735
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,119
How do you find me?

736
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,880
I didn't

737
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:46,840
How dare you!

738
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:47,960
How can you call the Second Young Master

739
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,880
by his name?

740
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,559
Everything is related.

741
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,800
You want to kill Fan Xian,
so I will kill you.

742
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,599
Kill him!

743
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,000
Second Young Master,

744
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:00,920
shall we ask who sent him?

745
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,199
After killing him,

746
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:04,159
the man behind him is sure to show up.

747
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,679
Bury him.

748
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,960
Actually, I only want to kill you.

749
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,039
Kill him!

750
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,559
I'm the son of the Prime Minster

751
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,360
and the follower of the Crown Prince.

752
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,199
Whatever you want,

753
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,000
I can give it to you.

754
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,719
A martial arts master as you are,

755
00:41:04,199 --> 00:41:05,800
I can promise you a bright future.

756
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:07,599
No matter what...

757
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,079
Your Excellency, where are we going?

758
00:42:31,159 --> 00:42:31,639
Out of city?

759
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,440
Find him.

760
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:12,800
Is he dead?

761
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,880
Your Excellency, he's dead.

762
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,840
Here!

763
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:50,719
It's really Lin Gong.

764
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,159
How do you get the information?

765
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,719
It just appeared on my desk

766
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:08,079
out of nowhere.

767
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,639
I followed the lead

768
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:11,159
and found him there.

769
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:13,880
Have you got anything
from the handwriting?

770
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,199
The handwriting is too neat.
It's hard to find any clue.

771
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,119
I just don't get it.

772
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,079
Lin Gong was killed.

773
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,639
Why did the killer give us the address

774
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:23,760
to collect the body?

775
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,760
Judged from Lin Gong's wounds,

776
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,320
they might be caused by sword.

777
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,400
Then let's investigate

778
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:29,159
Recently,

779
00:44:29,159 --> 00:44:30,559
the capital city in recent days.

780
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,880
The killer is highly skilled.

781
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:34,559
Only one man is so good at sword

782
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,800
both in and out of the capital city.

783
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:37,840
Who is it?

784
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,400
Xie Bi'an,

785
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:45,079
Xie Bi'an?

786
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:49,239
Lin Gong is the follower
of the Crown Prince.

787
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,639
Let's submit a secret memorial
to the imperial palace,

788
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,440
and let His Majesty make the call.

789
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,519
It's the only way.

790
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,519
The capital city will soon
descend into chaos.

791
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,000
Are you hungry?

792
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,360
I've asked the kitchen cook

793
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,360
to make the pastries for you.

794
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:23,920
Take it as the midnight snack.

795
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:26,880
You have something for me.

796
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,400
No.

797
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:30,199
Brother, don't get me wrong.

798
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,440
I haven't seen you

799
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,559
for days.

800
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,719
I really miss you.

801
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,199
You usually call me by my name.

802
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:40,519
Brother, here is the thing.

803
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:43,000
I've find a place for our shop.

804
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,239
We'll employ servants

805
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,559
from our mansion.

806
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:46,360
So we can open the shop

807
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:47,440
in just a few days.

808
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:49,440
You still remember it?

809
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,639
Of course, I do.

810
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,159
It will make a huge profit.

811
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:53,800
How can I forget?

812
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:54,679
Brother,

813
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,400
are you still writing the Red Mansions?

814
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:59,000
How should we

815
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:00,239
name the shop?

816
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:03,199
Why do you look at me like that?

817
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:04,800
Did I say anything wrong?

818
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,039
Uncle...

819
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,400
Right! The book.
[*'book' is a homophone for 'uncle' in Chinese]

820
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,679
Just keep writing.

821
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:09,599
Don't...

822
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,480
He's fine. He just passed out.

823
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:29,760
Can you tell me

824
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,920
After knocking me out last night,

825
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:34,400
where did you go?

826
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:36,840
Do you know

827
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,639
he might have ran away

828
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:39,119
during that moment?

829
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:41,559
I killed Lin Gong.

830
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,880
I followed him out of the city

831
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,079
and killed him.

832
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,159
If you want to kill him,

833
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:47,599
then why did you stop me last night?

834
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,400
Because you were hesitant.

835
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,880
You were utterly confused.

836
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,400
Who gave you the right to kill him?

837
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:54,719
Your mom did.

838
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:56,039
If you can't make the call,

839
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:57,400
I'll make it for you.

840
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:58,360
You always say so.

841
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,480
You were hesitant to kill him,

842
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:00,880
so I would kill him for you.

843
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:02,360
-You always say that!
-Whoever wants to kill you,

844
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,639
I'll kill him.

845
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:04,960
You always say that!

846
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,079
Then where were you

847
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:08,199
when I was assassinated

848
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:08,760
on the Niulan Street?

849
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:11,159
Where were you

850
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:12,199
when someone tried to kill me?

851
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,119
I was not in the capital city

852
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,800
when the assassination took place.

853
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,559
I'm sorry!

854
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,880
It won't happen again.

855
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:34,440
Sir! Sir!

856
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,079
Please show mercy!

857
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:41,440
Thank you! Thank you!

858
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,800
Thank you! Thank you!

859
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,760
You're not in the capital city recently.

860
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:09,480
Where have you been?

861
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:11,639
I went to the Jiangnan area.

862
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,239
Why did you go there?

863
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,199
Do you still have your mom's box?

864
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:36,800
I want to open the box

865
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,079
left by your mom,

866
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,480
but I can't remember the past clearly.

867
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,000
I only remember that the key
should be in the capital city,

868
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:47,320
but I can't remember the exact place.

869
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,079
If the key is in the capital city,

870
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,239
why did you go to the Jiangnan area?

871
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,360
I remember vaguely that

872
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,280
your mom and I talked about the box

873
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,519
in the Jiangnan area.

874
00:48:58,199 --> 00:48:59,800
So I revisited the places

875
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:01,079
Look at you!

876
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,639
whether I can remember something or not.

877
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,079
Have you got any clue?

878
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:06,000
Yes.

879
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,559
Now I've confirmed that

880
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:09,760
the key to the box

881
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:10,920
might be kept in two places.

882
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,719
It might be kept in the palace.

883
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,400
The imperial palace?

884
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:15,119
Right.

885
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,639
We can search for it if we have time.

886
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,000
Uncle...

887
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,159
the imperial palace is filled
with martial arts masters.

888
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,320
And you said yourself that

889
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,880
one of the Four Great Masters

890
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
might be there.

891
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,119
If we don't know

892
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,119
who he really is,

893
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:29,440
it might be dangerous.

894
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,800
If he's really in the imperial palace,

895
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:31,679
perhaps,

896
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,519
he might be
that old eunuch surnamed Hong.

897
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,599
Hong Sixiang?

898
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,599
Can we sneak into the imperial palace

899
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:38,880
without being noticed by him?

900
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:39,880
Probably not.

901
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,519
We have to break in.

902
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,480
Then tell me

903
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,840
the other place.

904
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:46,800
The key

905
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,599
might be kept

906
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:49,519
where your mom once lived.

907
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,519
Does it have a name?

908
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:52,960
the Taiping Residence now,

909
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:53,599
Where?

910
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,519
around the capital city

911
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:55,320
What's the exact location?

912
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,440
I can't remember.

913
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,119
Help me find it.

914
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,480
No problem.

915
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:07,920
I have to ask my father.

916
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:15,719
Don't let Fan Jian know I'm back.

917
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:16,239
OK.

918
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:18,280
That's all for now.

919
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,159
Find the Taiping Residence
as soon as possible.

920
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:22,719
I'll stay in the capital city
these days.

921
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,280
Where are you staying?

922
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:28,760
Uncle...

923
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:31,679
Uncle...

924
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:39,480
Uncle,

925
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,039
next time you leave,

926
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:44,599
just let me know.

927
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:48,679
Fine.

928
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:34,599
Sister!

929
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:53,840
Why did I sleep on the floor

930
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:55,639
of your room

931
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:56,840
last night?

932
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:58,039
I don't know.

933
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,440
Then do you know

934
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,039
I came to see you last night?

935
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,039
I don't remember.

936
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:08,679
Is our mansion haunted?

937
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:18,280
Come to my study.

938
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,280
Who?

939
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:26,760
Me.

940
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,559
I also finished eating.

941
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:39,880
Mom,

942
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,840
since Fan Xian

943
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,039
came to our mansion,

944
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:44,599
Dad seldom

945
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:45,599
finds fault with me.

946
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,320
He has nothing to say to you.

947
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,320
It's not a good thing.

948
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:50,679
Mom,

949
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:53,159
this is not what we should

950
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:54,400
be worried about now.

951
00:52:56,599 --> 00:52:58,760
What we should be worried about the most

952
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,599
is that our mansion is haunted.

953
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,119
Oh my God!

954
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:06,679
How come I have such a son?!

955
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:16,639
Brother.

956
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:21,480
Lin Gong is dead.

957
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:25,119
How did you do it?

958
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,239
I didn't.

959
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:29,800
Whatever,

960
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,239
just handle it cautiously.

961
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:54,719
Lin Gong is dead.

962
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:56,119
Really?

963
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,440
It was discovered
by the Investigator's Office.

964
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,000
He died in a desolated yard

965
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,039
in the suburb yesterday.

966
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,239
The killer might be a sword master.

967
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,800
How could it happen?!

968
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,719
Have they found the killer?

969
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,760
Is Wuzhu back?

970
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:15,119
I haven't seen him for a long time.

971
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,599
Is Uncle Wuzhu involved?

972
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,000
I'm just asking.

973
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,880
Off you go!

974
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,119
Do you know Taiping Residence?

975
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:44,480
Why do you ask?

976
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:45,320
I heard that

977
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:46,920
my mom used to live there.

978
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:47,679
Yes.

979
00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:49,159
I want to visit her past residence

980
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,239
to mourn for her.

981
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:51,159
You can't go there.

982
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:51,960
Why?

983
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:52,760
I did say that.

984
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,280
your mom's identity

985
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,360
must remain a secret.

986
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:56,480
I will keep a distance.

987
00:54:56,599 --> 00:54:57,280
No,

988
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,440
You'll have to wait

989
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,119
till you inherit the Neiku.

990
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:04,639
Father.

991
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:05,800
Say no more.

992
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,679
I'll leave now.

993
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:19,559
Brother.

994
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,280
Brother. Brother. Brother.

995
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:25,360
Have you thought of a name?

996
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:26,360
What name?

997
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:28,119
A name for our business.

998
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,119
For our bookstore?

999
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:30,840
Let's call it Danbo Bookstore.

1000
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:31,719
Danbo?

1001
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,960
There's an allusion to it.

1002
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,519
Only by remaining indifferent to fame
and fortune can one show his high ideals.

1003
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:35,239
Fine! Fine! Fine!

1004
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:36,159
It doesn't matter.

1005
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:37,360
Illusion or not, that's not important.

1006
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,480
The most urgent task for you

1007
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,039
is to write your book.

1008
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:42,519
When our bookstore opens,

1009
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:43,599
its future and prospect

1010
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:44,719
all counts on you.

1011
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,880
Don't engage yourself
in all the social activities.

1012
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:46,679
Younger Master Fan Xian,

1013
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,480
the Crown Prince has the door blocked

1014
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:49,800
and orders to see you
in the Eastern Palace.

1015
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:50,719
Your Highness,

1016
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,320
Younger Master Fan Xian,

1017
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,239
the sedan of
the Prime Minister's mansion

1018
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:54,079
has arrived at the door.

1019
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,320
The Prime Minister wants to see you.

1020
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,079
Lin Ruofu?

1021
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:57,519
Can they just let him write his book?

1022
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,119
Get lost!

1023
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:02,440
Just leave us.

1024
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,320
Yes.

1025
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,440
It must be for Lin Gong's death.

1026
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,559
I have nothing to do
with Lin Gong's death.

1027
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,440
Why do they want to see me?

1028
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:15,599
I'm afraid

1029
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,960
you'll figure that out
after seeing them.

1030
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:20,239
Then who should I see first?

1031
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,199
Prime Minister Lin Ruofu

1032
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:27,880
and the Crown Prince
are not on the same side.

1033
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:29,199
Whoever you choose to see first,

1034
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:30,679
you'll offend the other one.

1035
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,119
Younger Master Fan Xian,

1036
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:34,440
the imperial guards are here.

1037
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:36,039
His Majesty ordered to see you
through a verbal instruction.

1038
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,039
Now you don't have to choose.

1039
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:44,199
Hurry up! Don't keep
His Majesty waiting.

1040
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:57,679
They have to meet

1041
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:00,639
after all.

1042
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,920
Mr. Fan, come with me.

1043
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,800
His Majesty is waiting for you.

1044
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:27,960
It's you again.

1045
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:29,519
It must be fate.

1046
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:30,159
Please!

1047
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:34,079
Eunuch Hou and I

1048
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:35,320
are somewhat connected.

1049
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,239
For my trial of beating Guo Baokun,

1050
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:38,440
you came to my rescue in the court of

1051
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,840
the Prefecture of Capital City.

1052
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:41,360
When I first arrived
in the capital city,

1053
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,519
you were the one who drove my carriage.

1054
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,480
That is to say,

1055
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:45,960
you sent me to the Qing Temple

1056
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,039
on purpose.

1057
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:48,440
Mr. Fan,

1058
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,000
I've no idea

1059
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:51,639
what you're talking about.

1060
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,039
That's fine. I'll remember
everything in heart.

1061
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,159
Eunuch Hou, this is for you
to buy some tea.

1062
00:57:57,159 --> 00:57:57,559
Kill people!

1063
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,679
What are you doing?

1064
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:01,199
Madam Liu Ruyu of your family

1065
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,480
is a descendant of the Duke,

1066
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,400
and she used to visit
the imperial palace frequently.

1067
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:08,000
I kind of watched her grow up.

1068
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,280
We are kind of related.

1069
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:11,159
How can I exploit a younger member
of the family?

1070
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,400
I didn't know you're so connected

1071
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,360
with my family.

1072
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:14,840
Then as a younger member,

1073
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,119
I definitely should pay my respect.

1074
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:16,840
Well...

1075
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,320
It's not much.

1076
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:18,800
No!

1077
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,039
Eh...

1078
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:22,119
I'm so flattered.

1079
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,519
Paying respect to rites and
carrying forward illustrious virtues,

1080
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,760
plus outstanding poetry talents,

1081
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:32,280
no wonder His Majesty
often mentions you.

1082
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:34,039
Really?

1083
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,559
His Majesty really likes

1084
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:39,320
your seven-syllable poem with the line

1085
00:58:39,559 --> 00:58:41,280
"A thousand miles from home,
I'm grieved at autumn's plight."

1086
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:42,360
May I ask

1087
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:44,280
when His Majesty asked about me today,

1088
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:45,440
was he happy or angry?

1089
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,119
He looked calm

1090
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,519
with no sign of anger.

1091
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,119
Thanks for telling me.

1092
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,760
In that case,

1093
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,320
I'll tell you something else.

1094
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,679
His Majesty loves
to make bows and arrows.

1095
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,159
Never touch

1096
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,840
those stuff.

1097
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:18,239
How come there's someone

1098
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:19,679
walking the high walls
in the imperial palace?

1099
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,400
No one here dares do that

1100
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,840
for sure.

1101
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,280
Eunuch, I've seen that.

1102
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,480
He might be an assassinator.

1103
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:28,000
Please!

1104
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:29,440
Assassinator?

1105
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:30,639
Who will he assassinate?

1106
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,119
His Majesty, of course.

1107
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,719
Then should we call out for help?

1108
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:36,760
No need to worry.

1109
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,960
It's improper to call out loud.

1110
00:59:40,039 --> 00:59:41,760
Then won't His Majesty be in danger?

1111
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,000
Don't worry. He won't be able
to touch him.

1112
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,960
You look so composed.

1113
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,199
Assassination happens
occasionally these years.

1114
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,840
I'm used to it.

1115
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,480
Occasionally?

1116
00:59:56,119 --> 00:59:59,159
Now Nanqing is the most powerful.

1117
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,000
Beiqi and Dongyi Town

1118
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,960
fear His Majesty deeply.

1119
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:07,719
It's common for them
to send assassinators.

1120
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:26,760
It's you.

1121
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,400
You really don't know who I am?

1122
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,760
Whoever you are,

1123
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,119
don't step into

1124
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,440
the main hall.

1125
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,199
His Majesty is in the Imperial Study.

1126
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,079
So His Majesty was the one
who worshipped in the Qing Temple.

1127
01:01:04,119 --> 01:01:04,599
Eunuch Hou.

1128
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:07,519
who's that man in armor?

1129
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:09,719
That is Gong Dian,

1130
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:11,960
Deputy Director of

1131
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,440
Imperial Guards

1132
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:14,920
and Imperial Bodyguard.

1133
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:17,280
Have you met him before?

1134
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:18,960
I hit him by palm at the Qing Temple.

1135
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:22,199
Gong Dian is a martial arts master
well above the Eighth Dan.

1136
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,199
Mr. Fan, you're really outstanding
at such a young age.

1137
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,440
Eunuch Hou.

1138
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,840
does Gong Dian

1139
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,559
have any friends?

1140
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:30,880
Of course he does.

1141
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:31,880
What's up?

1142
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:33,719
Then don't they all have to

1143
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:35,039
call him Laogong?
[*Laogong is homophone for husband in Chinese.]

1144
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:36,360
He's really good
at taking advantage of others!

1145
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:39,599
Mr. Fan,

1146
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:41,440
when you go inside,

1147
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:43,960
do remember to keep you head down.

1148
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,280
Don't look straight at His Majesty.

1149
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,599
Do feel relieved. I understand it all.

1150
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,679
Look, you're wrong again.
