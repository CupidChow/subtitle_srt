=Episode 15=

16
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,159
Your Excellency!

17
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,400
Wait here.

18
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,680
Uncle...

19
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,199
The plan remains unchanged.

20
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,759
We've got about half an hour.

21
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,479
I'll lure Hong Sixiang away,

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,159
and you shall sneak inside to
get the key.

23
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:16,599
Wait!

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,520
Well,

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,280
You'd better not betray your identity.

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,080
I stole the clothes and sword

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,719
from the mission of

28
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:28,680
Dongyi Town.

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,680
Yun Zhilan?

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,319
There're only a few Ninth Dan
martial arts masters

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,639
in the capital city.

32
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:36,439
I want them to think that

33
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,080
the first apprentice of Si Gujian
is the one

34
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,800
who sneaks into the imperial palace.

35
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,759
So you've got a plan.

36
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:43,719
I often sneaked into places

37
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:44,639
with your mom

38
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,520
back then.

39
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,599
I'm used to that.

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Be careful yourself.

41
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,639
You may not be able to

42
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,479
stop Yan Xiaoyi's arrows.

43
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:56,879
The imperial harem is so big.

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,120
I may not run into him.

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,680
Who are you?

46
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,319
Sorry, it's a mistake.

47
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,439
I've taken the wrong way.

48
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,879
Taking a wrong way to
the imperial palace,

49
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,919
you must be the first one

50
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,400
in the world.

51
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,199
I have to work for my country.

52
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,639
Please forgive me.

53
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,039
I'll leave at once.

54
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,879
Lad, this is the imperial palace.

55
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,120
It's not up to you

56
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,560
to leave.

57
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:09,439
Front!

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,959
Back!

59
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,240
You're an apprentice of Si Gujian.

60
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,920
Director Yan, what's wrong?

61
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,560
Have you heard anything?

62
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,920
No.

63
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,600
Get me my bow.

64
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,519
Yes.

65
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,639
Judged from our experience
in the Taiping Residence,

66
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,360
Yan Xiaoyi has exceptionally
good hearing.

67
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:09,759
If you get close,

68
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,199
he'll notice whenever you go wrong.

69
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,120
When you enter the imperial palace,

70
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,079
don't run or jump.

71
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,639
Director Yan, is there anything wrong?

72
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,240
Nothing sounds strange.

73
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,160
The leopard cats kept by
the imperial consorts

74
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,240
are really fat.

75
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,759
They might cause the sound

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,959
just now.

77
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:45,120
Keep patrolling.

78
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,160
Yes.

79
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,160
Another thing
you should be cautious about.

80
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,399
Never go high.

81
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,759
That's right.

82
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,079
Besides his good hearing,

83
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,839
Yan Xiaoyi is an archer.

84
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:23,279
For archers, their eyes are the best.

85
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,759
If I go high,

86
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,920
thought it's late at night,

87
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,040
he might still see me.

88
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,480
Wang Qinian,

89
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,559
Your Excellency!

90
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:16,559
Get me the locksmith.

91
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,080
Just copy this key.

92
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,519
It's not a key.

93
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,600
There's no such key

94
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:40,799
or such lock in the world.

95
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,960
You're fooled?

96
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,240
Whatever it is,

97
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,039
can you make a copy?

98
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,480
Ingenious as it is,

99
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,200
it takes time.

100
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,080
Just make a general model.

101
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,279
No need to focus on the details.

102
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,879
Do it roughly?

103
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,279
Right. How long will it take?

104
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,759
Without paying attention to the details,

105
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,279
it'll take about fifteen minutes.

106
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,000
Hold on.

107
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,000
I need to pee. I need to pee.

108
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:18,960
Go ahead. Go ahead.

109
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,080
What're you staring at?

110
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,320
Let me tell you.

111
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,000
Just now, a weirdo

112
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:52,720
fell from here

113
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,120
to the ground.

114
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,919
The he stepped onto an umbrella

115
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:55,840
and flied away.

116
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,879
Then an old eunuch

117
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,679
flied through the air like an arrow.

118
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,159
Like an arrow.

119
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,120
Look, the floor tiles are broken.

120
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,480
This is the fake one.

121
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,240
And this is the real one.

122
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,000
Thank you.

123
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,600
Who said it's a key?

124
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,840
What lock can it open?

125
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,039
Stop asking so many questions.

126
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:17,559
Yes.

127
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,480
Your Excellency!

128
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:25,559
No need to follow me.

129
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,080
I'll put the fake one back.

130
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,159
After that, I'll go back myself.

131
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,240
Yes.

132
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,840
Your Excellency,
this is a top secret, right?

133
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,000
I trust you.

134
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,279
Well,
how should we deal with the locksmith?

135
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,720
What do you mean?

136
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,960
Should we get rid of him?

137
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,440
We only asked him to make a key.

138
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,159
No need to kill him for that.

139
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,919
Give him a good pay

140
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and send him out of
the capital city tonight.

141
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,799
Ask him to stay outside for a while.

142
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:57,759
Are you testing me?

143
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,559
Your Excellency, you're bold

144
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,960
but soft-hearted.

145
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,799
Is that a good thing?

146
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,559
If you want to do great things,

147
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,039
you're too merciful.

148
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,480
But you'll make a good friend.

149
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,759
Your Excellency, there's one more thing.

150
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,159
Go ahead.

151
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,240
Since you want to give him a good pay,

152
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,840
you should give me the money.

153
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,600
Where can I get money

154
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,200
for you late at night?

155
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,120
Pay it for me now.

156
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:24,960
Your Excellency!

157
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
can you write me

158
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,080
a loan receipt

159
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,919
so that I can

160
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,120
gain some interests.

161
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,159
Fuck off!

162
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,279
Your Excellency, please be careful.

163
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,679
Everything goes on smoothly this time.

164
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,320
After putting back the fake key,

165
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,559
we can complete
the mission successfully.

166
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,559
I just hope there will be no accident.

167
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,759
Avoid trouble

168
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,080
and don't raise new issues.

169
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,519
You should be fine.

170
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,080
The Princess Royal
is waiting for you inside.

171
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,240
If the Princess Royal

172
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,919
If love between both sides
can last for aye,

173
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,559
why need they stay together
night and day?

174
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,639
Love is depicted so well
that it almost makes me heartbroken.

175
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,120
Take a seat.

176
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,960
I had copied some of Fan Xian's poems

177
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,840
on the banquet.

178
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,399
Even now,

179
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,159
those poems seem marvelous.

180
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,279
What do you think?

181
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,279
Yes.

182
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,679
The poems are amazing.

183
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,279
Can there really be a fairyland

184
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:36,039
in the world?

185
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,279
Fairyland is purely imaginary.

186
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
I actually think

187
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,799
Are there no records

188
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:48,399
are written by Mr. Fan himself.

189
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,039
Writing hundreds of excellent poems
without a break,

190
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,000
it's beyond common sense.

191
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,000
Is he really a genius

192
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,799
descended from heaven?

193
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,039
If he's a genius descended from heaven,

194
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,080
then he's definitely

195
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,559
a poetic genius.

196
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:11,960
I summoned you tonight

197
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:13,879
to ask you something.

198
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,759
You promised me to

199
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,960
humiliate Fan Xian

200
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,600
and ruin his name on the banquet.

201
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,240
Have you lived up to your word?

202
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,000
I framed Fan Xian up today

203
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,879
at the cost of my good reputation.

204
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:32,279
Though I've lost,

205
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,240
I'm utterly convinced.

206
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,440
But there's one thing

207
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,759
I don't understand.

208
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,679
Your Highness
didn't tell me in advance that

209
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:47,039
Fan Xian is a poetic genius,

210
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,200
or I wouldn't have made

211
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,879
a fool of myself.

212
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,879
I didn't expect that

213
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,159
he's so genius.

214
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,440
That's fine.

215
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:02,000
You lost. How can it be fine?

216
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,759
Luckily he wrote

217
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,759
over one hundred poems overnight.

218
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,400
Otherwise,

219
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,519
the world

220
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,359
would be misled by me

221
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,160
and think him as

222
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,119
a shameless person

223
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,400
who copied other's work.

224
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,000
He's unharmed,

225
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,119
but your reputation
is completely ruined.

226
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,279
That's better than

227
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,799
feeling guilty all my life.

228
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,559
You're relieved. What about me?

229
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,799
Thanks to me, you caught Yan Bingyun

230
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,680
to exchange Xiao En back to Beiqi.

231
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,240
In the world, how many people know

232
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,519
the vicious villain Xiao En

233
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,319
is actually the younger brother of

234
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,640
the literary giant Zhuang Mohan?

235
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,200
I helped you and Beiqi

236
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,240
in defiance of world opinions.

237
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,160
I did you such a big favor,

238
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,559
only to be told that

239
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,480
you are relieved.

240
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,160
If I were not trapped
by family affection,

241
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,119
how would I come to Nanqing

242
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,279
and fall into your trap?

243
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:17,640
Go back

244
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,839
and tell that little emperor of yours.

245
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,519
He owes me.

246
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,160
He'll have to pay me back in future.

247
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,880
I'm confused about one thing.

248
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,160
Young and talented

249
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:42,960
as Fan Xian is,

250
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,000
he will be the pillar of Nanqing

251
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,160
in future.

252
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,039
Your Highness,

253
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,920
why do you have to kill him?

254
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,359
You even gave away

255
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,240
the secret agent
of your Investigator's Office!

256
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,079
Yan Bingyun did suffer a little,

257
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,640
but he's still alive.

258
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,000
As to why I have to

259
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,960
kill Fan Xian,

260
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,559
I just love to see him

261
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,880
helpless.

262
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:17,319
Assassin!

263
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:52,880
Did it miss?

264
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:03,759
The arrowhead is broken,

265
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,640
and there are scraps of clothes.

266
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,480
He must be shot.

267
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,759
There's no blood.

268
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,359
Is he unharmed?

269
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,960
Whoever shot by me must be injured.

270
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,000
Split up and search for him carefully.

271
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,960
Yes.

272
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,240
That guy was shot with an arrow.

273
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,319
He must've been seriously injured.

274
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,119
The guards are looking for him.

275
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,559
So why are you here

276
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,039
instead of searching for him?

277
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,880
I'm worried about Her Highness' safety.

278
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,240
With me here,
you have nothing to worry about.

279
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,519
He came here for my sake.

280
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,079
Your Highness.

281
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:19,440
Xiaoyi, can I beg you for something?

282
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,680
Your Highness.

283
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:23,440
please never say the word "beg".

284
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,680
Find that assassinator

285
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:35,599
and kill him.

286
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:37,359
You don't want to
get more information from him?

287
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,799
I was having a talk

288
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,960
with Zhuang Mohan

289
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,400
and he saw it.

290
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,480
Your Highness.

291
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,720
I made a deal with Zhuang Mohan

292
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,480
and told him Yan Bingyun is from

293
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,079
the Investigator's Office.

294
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,240
Did you get it?

295
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,200
Yes.

296
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:55,799
If you want to do your bit

297
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,319
as an imperial guard,

298
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,160
you can report it to His Majesty now.

299
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,680
I won't blame you.

300
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,000
That year, my family was all killed

301
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:07,640
in that mountain village

302
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:09,640
and I was starving to death.

303
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,119
If you hadn't passed by and saved me,

304
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,880
I must have died.

305
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:16,039
I owe you a life.

306
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,799
I'm ready to pay you back anytime.

307
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,160
Rise.

308
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,680
Your Highness.

309
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:36,839
Go ahead.

310
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,559
I think that guy is Fan Xian,
judging from his figure.

311
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:42,880
Fan Xian?

312
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,279
He wore a mask. It's hard to tell.

313
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,119
But they're similar
in figure and height.

314
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,279
He spit blood because of me

315
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:50,559
Fan Xian joined the poetry contest
and got drunk.

316
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,519
He was carried home.

317
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,599
It couldn't be him.

318
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,519
Let's make a conclusion
after having a look.

319
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,200
If he isn't at home right now,

320
00:24:57,839 --> 00:24:58,880
it must be him.

321
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,759
Go there now.

322
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,680
If anyone stops you,

323
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,279
tell them it's me that sent you there.

324
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,599
Yes.

325
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,400
Your Highness.

326
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,559
why did you tell him

327
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:14,160
about the kid.

328
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,599
It's impossible to hide it from him.

329
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,279
You're all thumbs.

330
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:40,440
Be careful.

331
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,160
Don't spill

332
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,440
the porridge.

333
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,359
Honestly! Ruoruo.

334
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,079
Madam.

335
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,720
You're still here?

336
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,160
Yeah. I am.

337
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,000
How is it going with Fan Xian?

338
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,519
He... He's still sleeping.

339
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,119
I'll come in.

340
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,960
Is he sleeping?

341
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,279
Have you stayed up all night

342
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,880
to take care of him?

343
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,519
I'm good.

344
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:13,319
He drank too much

345
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:15,000
last night,

346
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,759
so I got up early

347
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,279
and made some porridge cooked for him.

348
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,119
Fan Xian...

349
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:25,440
He's still sleeping.

350
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,200
He caught a slight cold last night.

351
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,839
I've got one more quilt for him.

352
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:30,839
And the medicine is being decocted.

353
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:32,160
He can take it when he wakes up.

354
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,079
Do you want to have a look at him?

355
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,319
Nah.

356
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:46,640
Let him sleep.

357
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,279
You'd better go back and have a rest.

358
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,000
I'll stay.

359
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,160
I'm good.

360
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:53,799
I don't understand

361
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,200
some poems I read last night.

362
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,920
I want to ask him when he wakes up.

363
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,240
You...

364
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,799
Madam.

365
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,160
Keep it down.

366
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:12,799
There is something else

367
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,839
I need to take care of.

368
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:14,960
You...

369
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,720
Madam, please go ahead.

370
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:18,920
I'll leave you alone.

371
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,319
Someone wants to see Fan Xian
so early in the morning?

372
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,119
Exactly.

373
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,000
Who?

374
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,279
Madam, it's him.

375
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,759
This is the backyard. Don't...

376
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:45,920
You can't break in.

377
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,559
I have met you before!

378
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:51,359
You're an imperial guard.

379
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,160
I'm Yan Xiaoyi,
Director of Imperial Guards.

380
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,559
Let me pay my respect to you.

381
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,119
Well,

382
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,039
are you here to search my house
by His Majesty's order?

383
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,200
Of course not.

384
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,119
Princess Royal

385
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:02,519
asked me to see Fan Xian.

386
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,759
As you know,

387
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,000
it's better to get such matters done
without delay.

388
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:07,440
But it's so early.

389
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,240
Why are you in such a hurry?

390
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
It's because Her Highness
thinks highly of him.

391
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,200
Madam,

392
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,799
shall I wake His Lordship up?

393
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,799
I just want to make sure he's alright

394
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,160
and ask him a few questions.

395
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,680
Then I'll go back.

396
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:22,319
Keep it.

397
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:23,880
Follow me.

398
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:47,960
Ruoruo.

399
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,680
Someone from the imperial palace

400
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,759
is here to visit Fan Xian.

401
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,559
Ruoruo.

402
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,640
Check if he's woken up.

403
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,559
This is Director Yan.

404
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:13,720
He's still sleeping.

405
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,880
I won't wake him up.

406
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:15,960
I'll just go inside
and have a look at him.

407
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,079
Then my job will be done.

408
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,039
Please step slightly.

409
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,000
Lady Ruoruo, please step aside.

410
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,880
He's not well.

411
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,519
You'd better see him later.

412
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:30,440
Please forgive me.

413
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,839
Yan Xiaoyi, what are you doing?

414
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,319
I'm sorry,
but I'm under orders to do that.

415
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,480
Here is the mansion of the Assistant
Minister of Ministry of Revenue.

416
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:39,000
Her Highness has no right to do
that to an imperial officer.

417
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,680
Lady Ruoruo, what are you afraid of?

418
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,319
I have good hearing.

419
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,240
I don't think
I can hear anyone breathing

420
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,839
in the room.

421
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,400
Ruoruo.

422
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,839
Let him in.

423
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:24,960
Sorry.

424
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,559
I drank too much last night.

425
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:30,640
I have such a massive hangover
that I can't get up.

426
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:32,960
I have another question.

427
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,119
I'm a sound sleeper

428
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,839
and I have quiet breathing.

429
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:40,799
Director Yan,

430
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,599
how about listening to it
more carefully?

431
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:47,000
Do you mind leaving us alone?

432
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:49,319
Her Highness asked me to
pass on a message to Fan Xian.

433
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,319
It's ridiculous!

434
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,039
I'm fine.

435
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:53,799
Madam. Ruoruo.

436
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,160
Help me

437
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,680
withdraw the curtains.

438
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,039
I'll have a talk with Director Yan.

439
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:01,759
Please wait outside.

440
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:19,640
Madam.

441
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,079
Take off your clothes.

442
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,640
These guys

443
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,279
really need more discipline.

444
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
They're running wild.

445
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,039
Ruoruo, are you okay?

446
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:44,720
I'm good.

447
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,240
I'm not into that.

448
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,759
An assassinator sneaked into the palace.

449
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,359
Really?

450
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,519
Is it caught?

451
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:56,319
No.

452
00:31:58,759 --> 00:31:59,799
It can be considered

453
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:00,680
your neglect of duty, right?

454
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,240
The assassinator was shot
in the back of his waist.

455
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,359
He must be injured.

456
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,200
Show me your back.

457
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,759
Are you suspicious of me?

458
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,079
I believe it's you.

459
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:09,839
No.

460
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,400
No.

461
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,319
Are you doing that
by His Majesty's order?

462
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,000
No.

463
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,640
Then why should I do as you said?

464
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,160
Are you afraid of being found out?

465
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,680
You pushed my sister

466
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,799
at the gate, right?

467
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:29,640
I'll say sorry to her later.

468
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,839
Kneel down and confess in front of her.

469
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,039
What did you just say?

470
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:34,759
Let's make a bet.

471
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,680
I'll take off my clothes.

472
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,839
If I'm injured,

473
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,839
you can take me to
the Ministry of Penalty,

474
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,000
the Supreme Court,

475
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,039
the Investigator's Office,

476
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:45,240
or any other place you want.

477
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,200
If I'm not injured,

478
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
you kneel down

479
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,960
and give a kowtow to Ruoruo.

480
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,240
Why do I have to bet with you?

481
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,440
Then you can leave.

482
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,279
I can look at it myself.

483
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,160
Do you know

484
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:07,319
how many poems

485
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,400
I wrote last night?

486
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,960
Do you know how His Majesty
and other officials will punish you

487
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:20,279
if you hurt me at this moment?

488
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,480
I don't care.

489
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,000
Even if the Princess Royal
will get into trouble?

490
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:31,240
If you don't dare to bet,

491
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,720
push the door open and get out.

492
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:37,599
Are you trying to scare me?

493
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,119
You're thinking too much.

494
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,440
Fine. I'm in.

495
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:45,480
Show me your back.

496
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
What if

497
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,640
the assassinator is not injured
although it's shot?

498
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,160
Aren't you worried about it?

499
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:00,319
Even a Great Master will be injured

500
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,200
if he's shot by me with an arrow.

501
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,599
I see.

502
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,760
Director Yan,
will you keep your promise?

503
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:46,719
I'm sorry.

504
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,360
Director Yan.

505
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,360
How about staying here for breakfast?

506
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,199
What's going on?

507
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,599
He pushed Ruoruo.

508
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,639
This is the least price he should pay.

509
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,920
You're protective of your sister.

510
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:07,320
Madam. Ruoruo.

511
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,840
I'm still sleepy.

512
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,719
I want to have more sleep.

513
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,960
Okay. Go have a rest.

514
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:13,719
Brother!

515
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:15,519
It's okay. Go back.

516
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:17,480
Let's go.

517
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,599
Don't hold it back. Spit it out.

518
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,440
Luckily, I met you on the way.

519
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,800
I had to hurry back

520
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,599
and came in

521
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,360
without letting Yan Xiaoyi know.

522
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,360
Neither of them was easy.

523
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,519
You're shot with an arrow.

524
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:01,920
Yes.

525
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:02,880
Yan Xiaoyi's arrow.

526
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:03,840
I'm not sure.

527
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:05,119
He said so.

528
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:06,760
There is no wound.

529
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,239
Uncle, do you want me to be injured?

530
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,559
He was not exaggerating.

531
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,599
Even a Great Master would be injured

532
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,039
if he's shot with Yan Xiaoyi's arrow.

533
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:22,719
He's the only Ninth Dan archer or above

534
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,719
in the world.

535
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,880
It's a coincidence
that the arrow was blocked off

536
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,760
when it was shot in my waist.

537
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:40,400
The key?

538
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,599
Exactly

539
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,360
Yan Xiaoyi's arrow

540
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,360
can even make cast iron break.

541
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:49,800
But the key is not damaged.

542
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:52,079
I don't know what it's made of.

543
00:36:58,239 --> 00:36:59,119
Have you got everything done?

544
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,119
Almost.

545
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,760
I didn't have enough time

546
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:05,079
to put the counterfeit back.

547
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:05,920
Why?

548
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,039
I saw the Princess Royal

549
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:10,000
had a secret meeting with Zhuang Mohan

550
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,119
and heard some secrets.

551
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:12,679
The Princess Royal

552
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:13,599
made a secret deal with Beiqi

553
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:14,480
my collusion with Beiqi

554
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,760
to get Xiao En back.

555
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:16,840
Do you know?

556
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,039
Xiao En is

557
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:18,960
Zhuang Mohan's younger brother.

558
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,679
So, why didn't you

559
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,199
put the counterfeit back?

560
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,360
Fine.

561
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:27,599
Anyway, there is almost nothing

562
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,440
you really care about.

563
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,639
Don't worry.

564
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:34,559
I'll find a way

565
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:35,280
to put it back.

566
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,039
What's most important,

567
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,880
I'll finally know

568
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,119
what's in the box

569
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,360
my mom left.

570
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,679
Your memory. You open it.

571
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,840
But what's inside

572
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,920
may not be left for me.

573
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,079
We don't know until it's opened.

574
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,119
Why are you laughing?

575
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:15,719
Uncle...

576
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,480
you don't know

577
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,559
how ridiculous

578
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,599
life can be

579
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,000
in the world.

580
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
You sound surprised.

581
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,320
No!

582
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,760
Do you know

583
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:28,880
how many resources and years

584
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:30,159
it'd take to make this?

585
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,159
Over ten years have passed.

586
00:39:36,039 --> 00:39:37,119
Does it still work?

587
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,440
I have no idea.

588
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,840
Let's have a try.

589
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,599
Your Majesty, it's my fault.

590
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,360
The assassinator's whereabouts
is unknown.

591
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:56,079
But I'm sure

592
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,679
he's shot with my arrow.

593
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:00,599
Tell him about it.

594
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
There are two assassinators.

595
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:07,199
One of them slipped into
the imperial harem beforehand.

596
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,840
And I chased the other out
of the imperial palace.

597
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,960
Now thinking back,

598
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,719
it was a trick to lure the tiger
from the mountain.

599
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:15,320
Did you catch him?

600
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,119
No.

601
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:18,039
He even ran away from you.

602
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,760
Is he a Great Master?

603
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,199
Judging from his skill,
he's just reached the Ninth Dan,

604
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,360
but he was quick.

605
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:26,360
The swordsmanship he used is Si Gujian.

606
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,159
Si Gujian?

607
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,400
The mission of Dongyi Town
is still in the capital city.

608
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:33,000
Is it Yun Zhilan?

609
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,039
It couldn't be him.

610
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,119
Is it possible

611
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:37,199
he used Si Gujian to mislead us?

612
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,719
No!

613
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,519
That guy has grasped

614
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,599
the essence of Si Gujian.

615
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,239
It must've had something to do with
Dongyi Town.

616
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:46,159
Your Majesty.

617
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,480
let's search the mission.

618
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Even if it's not Yun Zhilan,

619
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:50,800
it must've been someone related to him.

620
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,599
Do you have evidence?

621
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,239
We will as long as
we catch the two assassinators.

622
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,920
What if you fail to do that?

623
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,639
Well...

624
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:00,039
The two assassinators sneaked into
the imperial palace late at night

625
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,400
and escaped unscathed.

626
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,559
If it spreads around,

627
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,239
it'd be unbearable shame for us.

628
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:07,360
I acknowledge my sin.

629
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,039
Seeing that guy is skilled at Si Gujian,

630
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,079
I couldn't help

631
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:12,400
to see more

632
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:13,840
so that I chased him for a long time.

633
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,440
Actually, it's my fault.

634
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,440
Before you admitted your fault,

635
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,920
you'd better think about
why they wanted to kill Li Yunrui.

636
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,760
Of course to create chaos
in the capital.

637
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,920
And then?

638
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,039
That's right.

639
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:26,559
If they did it,

640
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,159
what's the point of killing
a Princess Royal

641
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,000
for Dongyi Town?

642
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,599
You can leave.

643
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:37,760
Got it.

644
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,320
See?

645
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:50,039
I said it doesn't work.

646
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,039
It can't be opened.

647
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,159
The password is correct.

648
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:01,760
We opened it.

649
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,599
Why?

650
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,400
Uncle.

651
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,320
It gives me a reason

652
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,119
to believe

653
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:08,840
there is some hidden secret

654
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
between you and my mom.

655
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,719
I really can't remember.

656
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:16,719
You don't need to say anything.

657
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,239
Let me have a look at

658
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,639
what she had left.

659
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,119
Are you sure it's not Fan Xian?

660
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:37,480
It couldn't be him.

661
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,519
As I said,

662
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:40,960
Fan Xian joined the poetry contest

663
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,920
and got drunk.

664
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,400
How could it be him?

665
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:47,119
Two assassinators worked together?

666
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:49,400
It might have something to do with
Dongyi Town.

667
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:51,920
What did they want to do?

668
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:54,639
To kill me?

669
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,199
His Majesty also had doubt about that.

670
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,400
Xiaoyi, it doesn't make sense.

671
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,559
Find a way to tell Zhuang Mohan

672
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,039
and ask him to leave Nanqing.

673
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,639
The sooner the better.

674
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:22,559
Got it.

675
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:42,039
Something has gone wrong, right?

676
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:46,880
I have to think about it.

677
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,280
The iron is great,

678
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:04,599
but I wonder in which way

679
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,119
it was made to become like this.

680
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,920
I also wonder

681
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:12,719
why on earth

682
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:15,519
she left this stuff.

683
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,519
To kill people.

684
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,639
To kill people?
It doesn't have sharp blades.

685
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,920
Do you know something about it?

686
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:31,119
I know.

687
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,519
Uncle...

688
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:39,800
This is a great weapon.

689
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,079
Weapon?

690
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:51,239
An unparalleled weapon.

691
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,840
A letter.

692
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,400
It says "To Wuzhu".

693
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,679
Read it for me.

694
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:19,800
It's for you.

695
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,159
You can read anything

696
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,960
that belongs to me.

697
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:25,119
Okay.

698
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:41,880
Your Excellency.

699
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:45,159
Trust me.

700
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,559
Trust me.

701
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,840
Okay. Well.

702
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:51,480
Let's say goodbye here.

703
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,239
Remember what I said.

704
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,440
Take your stuff.

705
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,480
Don't come back to the capital

706
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,840
for the time being.

707
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,119
Don't be recognized.

708
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:03,679
Don't worry.

709
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,519
I shaved myself

710
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,719
because of this issue.

711
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,960
Nobody would recognize me.

712
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,159
Good! Good! Good!

713
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:09,840
Go ahead.

714
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,719
You said the horse would be mine.

715
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,280
It's for me.

716
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,840
You have to keep your promise.

717
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:16,800
I will.

718
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,719
That's great. I'm leaving.

719
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:18,559
Do you know how much

720
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:19,559
the horse cost me?

721
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:21,199
I paid for you.

722
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:22,760
That's right. You promised.

723
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,119
Don't break your word.

724
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,119
-Go. -Go. Go.

725
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:26,039
Go!

726
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,000
Don't tell anyone

727
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,360
about what happened last night.

728
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,599
I know the rules.

729
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,440
Head Chen.

730
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,960
Who is that guy?

731
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,960
Answer me.

732
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:51,920
What happened

733
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,920
last night?

734
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:56,719
Who is he?

735
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:59,920
He's just a locksmith.

736
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,239
Here is the thing, Head Chen.

737
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,639
Yesterday,

738
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,800
I asked him

739
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,480
to unlock the door of
someone else's home.

740
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,679
So, I asked him

741
00:47:08,679 --> 00:47:09,760
to get out of here.

742
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,159
Head Chen.

743
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:14,079
Look.

744
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:15,679
It's the first time

745
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:16,679
I stole something.

746
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:18,079
Please forgive me.

747
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,960
I can send a black knight

748
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,280
to get him back.

749
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,280
No.

750
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,480
I just asked him

751
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,639
to make a key.

752
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,119
Did the assassination attempt in
the imperial palace

753
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,519
have anything to do with you?

754
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,239
Did it have anything to do with
Fan Xian?

755
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:44,119
No.

756
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,079
No.

757
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,760
Do you know how capable he is?

758
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,360
Yes.

759
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,199
I'm giving you one more chance.

760
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:05,559
Is it Fan Xian that did it?

761
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,039
No!

762
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,639
Why don't you read?

763
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,360
The wording

764
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:40,280
is really special.

765
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:42,760
I'll begin.

766
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,840
Dear Zhuzhu, let me give you a kiss.

767
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:49,159
Zhuzhu is me.

768
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,280
I know.

769
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:56,320
Is it funny?

770
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,119
No.

771
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,000
I like you very much.

772
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:04,320
I tried many times

773
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:05,920
to introduce a girl to you,

774
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:08,760
but you're always like a cold fish.

775
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,559
This madam...

776
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,360
Sorry. You can't call me madam.

777
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:14,280
I think

778
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,559
you must be very popular among girls

779
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,599
if you smile more.

780
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:21,239
I think she's right.

781
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,880
Uncle, did she try to fix you up?

782
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,159
I don't remember.

783
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:31,320
Are you angry?

784
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:32,840
Why?

785
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,440
Forget about it. I'll continue.

786
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:37,840
At this moment,

787
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:39,599
I'm staying in the capital alone.

788
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,840
So I decide to write you a letter.

789
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,199
You wouldn't listen to me

790
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,159
and has gone to fight in
that temple again.

791
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,079
I guess you'd lose again

792
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,199
and finally come back.

793
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:52,719
So,

794
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:54,679
I'm writing this letter

795
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:55,880
to laugh at you in advance.

796
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:06,880
Uncle, you're smiling.

797
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:09,800
Really?

798
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,480
Did you really go to fight
in that temple

799
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,440
and lose?

800
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,119
I think so.

801
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,800
Is it the so-called divine temple?

802
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,119
I don't remember.

803
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,039
Why did you fight?

804
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,039
I don't remember.

805
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,119
What's the relationship between my mom

806
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,000
and you and that divine temple?

807
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:32,119
Forget that.

808
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:33,559
I guess you don't remember, either.

809
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,000
Let's go on.

810
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,880
I've been worried about one thing.

811
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,800
I'm worried how you'll live in the world

812
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,079
without curiosity or desire

813
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:46,000
or anything you'd like to do.

814
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:47,760
So, I decide to leave the letter

815
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,559
in the box

816
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,159
and wouldn't ask you to open it.

817
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:52,199
If you open it

818
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:53,960
of your free will someday

819
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,280
and read the letter,

820
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:56,920
I'd be very happy

821
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,320
and surprised.

822
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,280
Can you tell me

823
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:04,840
what made you

824
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:06,840
want to open the box?

825
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Nothing special.

826
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:12,320
I just want to know

827
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:14,679
what you left

828
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:15,719
to the world

829
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:19,639
and whether you'd mention me.

830
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:24,800
Uncle Wuzhu.

831
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,760
Go on.

832
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,679
This madam came to this world,

833
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,360
in parenthesis,

834
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:42,159
this madam means me, your sister.

835
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,719
I came. I saw. I played.

836
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:45,880
I was once the richest person.

837
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:46,800
I even...

838
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,079
...pulled the old emperor's beard.

839
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:55,000
I just didn't unify the whole world.

840
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:03,039
But what's the point of doing that?

841
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,639
If there is

842
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,079
still something I want to do,

843
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,440
I want to see the world

844
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,519
become a better place

845
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,000
and everyone can

846
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:15,039
smile more brightly.

847
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,719
It sounds stupid, right?

848
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:21,280
Don't laugh.

849
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,519
I didn't.

850
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,639
I don't know why,

851
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:31,440
but I feel like
I'm writing my last words.

852
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,400
Zhuzhu,

853
00:52:34,199 --> 00:52:35,480
I don't know how long would pass

854
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:37,320
when you see the letter

855
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,159
and I don't know if I'd still be alive.

856
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,480
If I'm already dead,

857
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,079
just destroy everything in the box.

858
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,719
I don't need anyone else

859
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,880
to know my story.

860
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:49,400
They don't deserve it.

861
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:54,960
Zhuzhu,

862
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:58,920
actually, you don't understand

863
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:01,960
where I'm from.

864
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,719
Do you know? I'm lonely.

865
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:10,920
There are many people in the world,

866
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:15,320
but I'm lonely.

867
00:53:17,079 --> 00:53:20,280
I'm really lonely.

868
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:25,920
But luckily, you've been with me

869
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:30,119
when I felt most lonely.

870
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:33,760
Zhuzhu,

871
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:36,719
I really miss you.

872
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:48,039
That's all.

873
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,519
Do you miss her?

874
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,840
What does it mean?

875
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,440
It...

876
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:07,280
It means

877
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,880
no matter if you're walking,

878
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,960
eating,

879
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:14,519
sleeping,

880
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:15,320
fighting,

881
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,159
or doing something else,

882
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,000
and no matter
how many people are around you,

883
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:21,639
you can't

884
00:54:21,639 --> 00:54:22,679
drive her out of your mind

885
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,440
and you speak her name quietly.

886
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:29,400
You hear many people speak,

887
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,480
but you just want to hear

888
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:33,559
her voice.

889
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:36,920
You've seen many faces,

890
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:39,159
but you just want to see

891
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:41,280
her smile.

892
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:45,719
In this case, you miss her.

893
00:54:57,239 --> 00:54:58,400
I miss her.

894
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,119
Assassinators sneaked in last night?

895
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,960
They showed up at Guangxin Palace.

896
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:20,559
Did they aim to kill Li Yunrui?

897
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:22,119
It's still unknown.

898
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,119
She doesn't want to
lose control of Neiku.

899
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,000
It makes some guys jealous.

900
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:32,079
Was everything going well

901
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,880
here last night?

902
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,239
Everything as usual.

903
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,039
And I had a good sleep.

904
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,519
I'm relieved to hear that.

905
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,159
There is one more layer here.

906
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:08,480
One more letter.

907
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,719
Zhuzhu, don't open this letter.

908
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:14,000
What's this?

909
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:15,840
I've no idea.

910
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,400
Do you want to open it?

911
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,719
Can I open it?

912
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,480
She didn't say you can't do that.

913
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,480
Hi, my son.

914
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,239
You didn't misread it.

915
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,920
This letter is for you.

916
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,639
I wasn't born

917
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,960
when she wrote it, right?

918
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:52,000
Right.

919
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:55,400
How did she know she'd have a son?

920
00:56:56,199 --> 00:56:56,760
She guessed.

921
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,599
Only you can have a chance to

922
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,559
read the letter.

923
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,440
I know.

924
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,880
You have a lot of questions

925
00:57:10,119 --> 00:57:11,079
about yourself,

926
00:57:11,239 --> 00:57:12,280
about me and about the world.

927
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:15,039
I'll tell you the answer now.

928
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,280
Fan Xian,

929
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,639
there is no time travel

930
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:21,400
and there is no parallel spacetime.

931
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,599
Here is still the Earth.

932
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,280
It's still our world.

933
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,199
The Earth has never stopped spinning

934
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,880
during the past over four billion years.

935
00:57:34,679 --> 00:57:35,960
During the long period,

936
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,239
several special eras

937
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:38,199
have appeared.

938
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,599
As global cooling
happened substantially,

939
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:43,559
areas at higher latitudes

940
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,360
witnessed the formation of
massive ice sheets.

941
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,440
Water condensed into ice.

942
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:51,480
Both atmospheric circulation
and ocean currents

943
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:52,800
changed accordingly.

944
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,880
In such an era,

945
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,719
the entire planet went white.

946
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,719
That's called a major ice age.

947
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,079
It's interesting.

948
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,719
It would happen

949
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:05,679
every once in a while.

950
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:08,400
In our day,

951
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,920
there was much speculation

952
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,800
about when the next ice age

953
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:14,199
would arrive

954
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,800
and if humans would become extinct.

955
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,719
Our time has ended.

956
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:37,320
Fan Xian,

957
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,199
we opened the Forbidden Door.

958
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:49,360
I hope our time would revive

959
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:50,840
when a new era arrives.

960
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,800
Have you ever seen a sci-fi movie?

961
00:58:58,559 --> 00:58:59,480
People might be frozen

962
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,559
in an instrument.

963
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:05,800
Years later, people sleeping inside

964
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,880
would come out
as the instrument is opened.

965
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:12,840
I'm

966
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,440
just a living example.

967
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,440
My mom was revived from a frozen state.

968
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:27,719
Frozen?

969
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,480
It could be.

970
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:35,920
When I woke up,

971
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:38,159
the ice age had been over.

972
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:40,280
The old days are gone

973
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,280
and new humans have appeared.

974
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:44,480
They've gone through primitive society

975
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:46,480
and then slavery society.

976
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,639
Now, they're living in feudal society:

977
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:51,760
Nanqing.

978
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:54,320
have you ever considered

979
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:55,440
why people here

980
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,599
also speak Chinese

981
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,360
and behave

982
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,199
like we did in our day?

983
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,039
Because I'm not the only one

984
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:05,159
who was revived after being frozen.

985
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,000
Many pioneers

986
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
survived

987
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,400
and spread civilization to new humans.

988
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:13,599
It can be considered

989
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:14,559
some heritage from our time.

990
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,880
Their legends

991
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,639
are the secrets of the divine temple.

992
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,679
What on earth is the Forbidden Door?

993
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,760
Why did it cause an ice age?

994
01:00:24,679 --> 01:00:25,400
How on earth

995
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,519
did humans in our day become extinct?

996
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:27,559
And,

997
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:29,239
if I was revived after being frozen,

998
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:30,639
why did I become a baby?

999
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:40,079
You're not revived after being frozen.

1000
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,760
You're an exceptional case.

1001
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:43,639
Let me put it this way.

1002
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,159
We had an experiment

1003
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:46,440
about datamation of memories.

1004
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,199
You're one of the guinea pigs.

1005
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,400
And you're the only one that made it.

1006
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,880
I know you have many questions.

1007
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,800
The answer you're looking for

1008
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:57,880
is hidden

1009
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,159
in a place called Taiping Residence.

1010
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,440
If you've ever been there,

1011
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,239
you'd find there is a pond in the yard,

1012
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,320
at the bottom of which

1013
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:07,760
is hidden a starting gear.

1014
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:09,480
Through operation of it,

1015
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:10,960
you'd see

1016
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,119
a blank door is opened in the house.

1017
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,679
From the secrets of the Forbidden Door

1018
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,719
to the reason why humans became extinct,

1019
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:18,239
all the answers you're looking for

1020
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:19,400
can be found there.

1021
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,440
Go there if you want to find it out.

1022
01:01:26,679 --> 01:01:27,519
Personally, I hope

1023
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:28,880
you won't work on these secrets.

1024
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:31,800
If you go behind the Forbidden Door

1025
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,360
and find the truth,

1026
01:01:34,519 --> 01:01:35,599
you're destined to go back

1027
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:36,800
to where I escaped

1028
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,000
and face the most horrible things

1029
01:01:39,639 --> 01:01:41,119
underground.
