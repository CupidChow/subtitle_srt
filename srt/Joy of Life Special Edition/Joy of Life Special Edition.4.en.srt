=Episode 4=

3
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,719
Once we win
the poetry gathering tomorrow,

4
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:46,000
we'll spread the word that

5
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
he's rude and dumb

6
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,120
with no morality or talent.

7
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,719
Self-dignified as the Prime Minister is,

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,359
he certainly won't marry Wan'er

9
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,680
to such a joke like him.

10
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,840
Your Highness,
you're really resourceful!

11
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,519
However, you must defeat him

12
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
in the poetry gathering tomorrow.

13
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,439
Your Highness,
I've studied poetry since childhood.

14
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,599
No need to worry.

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,879
Moreover, today, before the Yishi House,

16
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,319
I got acquainted with He Zongwei,

17
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:09,840
the famous poet in the capital city.

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,680
I'll go with him tomorrow.

19
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,520
I'll make sure that Fan Xian is defeated

20
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,360
and ashamed.

21
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,639
I just don't get it.

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,039
He actually agreed to
attend the poetry gathering.

23
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,560
Does he want to make a great coup?

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,199
I care nothing about
the poetry gathering.

25
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,520
I mainly go there to see girls.

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,199
Girls?

27
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,000
I heard many female scholars

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,199
will attend the gathering.

29
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,599
That's true.

30
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
Many female scholars

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,560
do like to attend the poetry gathering.

32
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,879
Brother, which girl are you looking for?

33
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,080
My Lady Drumstick.

34
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,800
Drumstick?

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,280
Such a weird name.

36
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,560
It refers to a real drumstick.

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Did you bring it back yesterday?

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,879
Yes. The same drumstick.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
Why do you keep it?

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,840
It's a love token.

41
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,520
It stinks.

42
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,199
Brother.

43
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,319
Aren't you just back yesterday?

44
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:09,759
How come you're in love already?

45
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,800
And the token

46
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,800
is so

47
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:15,800
special.

48
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,759
Yesterday before I got back,

49
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,159
I went to the Qing Temple.

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,039
Why did you go there?
It's not on your way home.

51
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,199
You should ask that driver.

52
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:22,879
How could I know?

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,759
Then what?

54
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,639
Then under the censer table

55
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,680
in the side palace hall
of the Qing Temple,

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
I met her.

57
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,000
In the side palace hall
of the Qing Temple?

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,319
She might be at
the poetry gathering tomorrow.

59
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,400
I have to go there.

60
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,439
I'll go with you tomorrow.

61
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,560
If she's there,

62
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,719
I'll ask her name for you.

63
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,159
If she's not there,

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,919
I'll visit all the mansions one by one.

65
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,000
I will definitely find her for you!

66
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,960
How are you

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,000
more anxious than I am?

68
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,800
Brother, you know what?

69
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:50,800
This is

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000
what you called

71
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,479
romantic.

72
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,439
So it not only exists in stories,

73
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:58,319
but in real life as well.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,199
We must find her!

75
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,639
Brother, but Your Majesty

76
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,719
has appointed a marriage for you.

77
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,159
Destiny is so marvelous.

78
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,319
Will it be possible that

79
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,480
Lady Drumstick

80
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,879
is actually Lin Wan'er?

81
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,399
Impossible.

82
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,480
Princess Lin is sick.

83
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,560
I heard she can't eat any meat or fish.

84
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,199
So she can't eat the drumstick

85
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,920
or go out for a trip.

86
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,759
What's wrong with her?

87
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,879
I've no idea.

88
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,279
It doesn't matter.

89
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:40,439
What matters now is to
find my Sister-in-law Drumstick.

90
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,879
Lady Drumstick sounds fine,

91
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,600
but Sister-in-law Drumstick

92
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,639
is not so good.

93
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,800
Well, I shall look for her right away!

94
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,279
Be patient! You've never seen her.

95
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,480
You won't recognize her
even if you see her.

96
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,720
That's true.

97
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,439
What's wrong?

98
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,000
I forgot.

99
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:00,120
I waited for you here

100
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,439
to tell you something.

101
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,240
Teng Zijing was caught by dad

102
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,720
the moment he arrived at our mansion.

103
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now he's locked up in the backyard.

104
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,399
Why did dad catch him?

105
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,120
I've no idea.

106
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,120
Also, Fan Sizhe is kneeling

107
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,639
in front of the study.

108
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,079
How is Fan Sizhe

109
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,800
involved in this?

110
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,319
Dad suspects that

111
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,680
he incited you

112
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,920
to fight with Guo Baokun,

113
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,560
so that you and the Crown Prince
will be enemies.

114
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,560
Can Fan Sizhe be

115
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,399
so cunning?

116
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,240
OK. I see.

117
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,079
Just wait here.

118
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,920
I'll handle it.

119
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,480
Look at you!

120
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,560
One is caught,
and the other is kneeling.

121
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,399
Why didn't you tell me first?

122
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,360
Your IQ is as low as a basin.

123
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,079
Your IQ is as low as a basin.

124
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,680
Does it hurt?

125
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,519
Get up.

126
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,120
Dad asked me to kneel.
I dare not get up!

127
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,480
I'll talk to him.

128
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,560
What can you say?

129
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,240
Father.

130
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,519
Where have you been?

131
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,959
The Investigator's Office.

132
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,439
Why did you go there?

133
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,680
To see the stele left by my mom.

134
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,360
Did she say those words?

135
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,480
Yes, he will.

136
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,120
I can still remember

137
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,600
the look on her face
when she said those words.

138
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,720
I've never heard of

139
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
such a great dream!

140
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,639
It's also unrealistic.

141
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,199
You mom wanted to
change the whole world.

142
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:42,879
That stele is covered with dust.

143
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,000
It's been forgotten for a long time.

144
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,399
Well, forget it.

145
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,759
I'm here to ask you

146
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,120
why is Fan Sizhe kneeling outside.

147
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,639
Don't make a sound. Don't talk.

148
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,120
Don't ask me.

149
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:10,839
Mom, why are you here?

150
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,879
Prince Jing's son
supports the second prince,

151
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,160
while Guo Baokun
supports the Crown Prince.

152
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,920
You've told me

153
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,000
the second prince
is also competing for the throne.

154
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,680
Exactly.

155
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,399
So the two

156
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,040
are incompatible as water and fire.

157
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,480
You fought with Guo Baokun

158
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:33,639
and will attend
the poetry gathering held

159
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,120
by Prince Jing's son.

160
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,759
To others,

161
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,279
you've chosen to
support the second prince.

162
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,079
It's a big deal.

163
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,639
The Crown Prince won't tolerate it.

164
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,519
Anyway, the Crown Prince won't like me.

165
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,560
Just let Fan Sizhe get up.

166
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,160
What a coincidence!

167
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,199
He took you to the Yishi House.

168
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,240
Then you got into a fight
with Guo Baokun right away.

169
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,000
And then Prince Jing's son
showed up just in time.

170
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,600
I also find it coincidental.

171
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,199
So I suspect that

172
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,279
the Crown Prince and the second prince

173
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,120
had us followed all along.

174
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,800
It's also possible that

175
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,800
Fan Sizhe set the trap deliberately.

176
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,079
Impossible.

177
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:17,319
Fan Sizhe

178
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,639
didn't do this.

179
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,839
You really trust him?

180
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,079
The best idea

181
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:22,959
he could come up with is to beat me up.

182
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,839
He couldn't figure out

183
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:25,959
such a complicated trap.

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,439
What about his mother?

185
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,759
She's capable of that.

186
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,399
But father,

187
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:35,720
let's be honest.

188
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,480
If she comes up with
such a sophisticated scheme,

189
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,120
will she send Fan Sizhe

190
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,039
to execute it?

191
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,039
No way.

192
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:42,960
I'm telling you!

193
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,320
If there's a banana hanging on the beam,

194
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,080
Fan Sizhe might not be able to

195
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,679
get it down.

196
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:48,759
OK.

197
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,320
If you choose to believe him,

198
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,000
then he can get up.

199
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
You should apologize to him.

200
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,279
You put him on his knees for so long

201
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,200
with no evidence.

202
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,519
Don't you think

203
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,320
you're too hard on him?

204
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,519
He's disappointed me for so many times.

205
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,000
How?

206
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,960
He's neither adept with pen
or the sword.

207
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,039
He idles about every day.

208
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,799
He's really good for nothing!

209
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,480
Fan Sizhe is money-mad indeed.

210
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,559
But have you ever wondered why?

211
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,919
Here you are.

212
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,519
I've asked Ruoruo about him.

213
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,840
He never indulged himself in

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,120
a dissipated life.

215
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,000
Then why is he money-mad?

216
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,360
Moreover,

217
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,039
he's good at something.

218
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,279
He's gifted in

219
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,919
business and financial accounting.

220
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,080
But

221
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,399
those are not the right ways.

222
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,720
Right or not,
let's put that aside for now.

223
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm asking

224
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,360
why is he

225
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,679
money-mad?

226
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,279
You know why?

227
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,919
Because you are the Assistant Minister
of Ministry of Revenue,

228
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,679
who is in charge of the world wealth.

229
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,039
How is that relevant?

230
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,919
In the Yishi House,

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
at first Fan Sizhe

232
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,879
just bickered with others.

233
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,480
He didn't make a punch

234
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,279
until Guo Baokun
said something disrespectful

235
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:12,679
about you.

236
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,919
In his heart,

237
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,879
he admires you the most.

238
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,720
Mom, what have you heard?

239
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,080
You are the Assistant Minister
of Ministry of Revenue,

240
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,799
so he is obsessed with business.

241
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,279
He might not know himself that

242
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,159
he's made all the efforts

243
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,399
because he wants to help you

244
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,559
subconsciously.

245
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,000
The one kneeling outside

246
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,679
is your son.

247
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,159
You might find him useless.

248
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,120
But he's done everything

249
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,519
to gain

250
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,639
your appreciation.

251
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,960
You wronged him.

252
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,679
You owe him an apology.

253
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,320
Get up.

254
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,039
Me?

255
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,240
I'm OK. My legs are numb.

256
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,919
I've kept you on your knees for so long

257
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,720
out of no reason.

258
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,080
Do you wonder

259
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
why?

260
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,159
I must have done something

261
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,840
to upset you.

262
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:43,679
What do you want?

263
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,159
I can grant you a wish.

264
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,559
What do you want?

265
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,000
Really?

266
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:00,480
Anything?

267
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,240
Just say it.

268
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:08,960
Dad.

269
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
I want to

270
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,879
play Pai Gow with you.

271
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,080
play Pai Gow with you.

272
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,039
Dad, we should play with money.

273
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,519
Fine. Wait for me in the hall.

274
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:38,759
Yes, he will.

275
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,360
There's one more thing.

276
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,759
You must release Teng Zijing.

277
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,559
He had a record

278
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,600
in the Ministry of Penalty

279
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,320
and he came back to
the capital with you.

280
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,600
I'm afraid he's up to something.

281
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,720
He's my friend.

282
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
It's too extravagant

283
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,480
to have a friend in the capital city.

284
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,960
Sure, I'll have him released.

285
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,679
Be careful yourself.

286
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,000
Why didn't you apologize

287
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
to Fan Sizhe just now?

288
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,840
How can a father

289
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,720
apologize to the son?!

290
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,960
Just stick to that sense of pride.

291
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,240
Thank you!

292
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,519
Thank me?

293
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,559
I owe you one.

294
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,919
Your guards

295
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,159
can't catch me at all.

296
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,440
I didn't resist

297
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,320
for your sake.

298
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,879
I should thank you in that sense.

299
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,240
Did you get the file?

300
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,879
Not yet!

301
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:55,159
Why?

302
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,919
It's said that
it's hard to find as there are too many.

303
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,039
Wang Qinian will send it to me tomorrow.

304
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,879
That's good!

305
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,720
I owe you on this.

306
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,600
Why does everyone owe me?

307
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,320
How about this?

308
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,320
Shall I kill

309
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,120
Liu Ruyu for you?

310
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,440
Let's calm down!

311
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,519
I understand that

312
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,480
you want to
express your gratitude to me.

313
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,120
But can you choose another way?

314
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,720
She is very suspicious

315
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,519
for the Danzhou assassination.

316
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,799
Suspicion is all it is about.

317
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:18,279
Besides, the Crown Prince
is also suspicious.

318
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,799
You want to kill the Crown Prince?

319
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,360
It's a bit difficult.

320
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,240
We've gotta get it planned well.

321
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,759
Can we just have a normal conversation?

322
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:26,000
I have no other feat left.

323
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,480
I don't need your feat

324
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,679
and certainly not your meat either.

325
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,679
It's just a joke.

326
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,200
Have you heard of the saying that

327
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,759
the dancer goes feat not meat?

328
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:38,159
No!

329
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:41,519
Forget about it!

330
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,360
Mine is ready.

331
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,960
Are you all ready?

332
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,360
So, here comes the first pair.

333
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,480
Once they are put down,
it's fixed. No regret!

334
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,919
No change once you put it down.

335
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:03,039
I'll turn mine first.

336
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,000
Nine!

337
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,519
Not as big as mine!

338
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,240
That's too small!

339
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:15,720
Excuse me!

340
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,519
Excuse me! Excuse me!

341
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,679
Needless to see!

342
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,799
D three plus two four. That's Gee Joon.

343
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,000
Nothing can be bigger than this.

344
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,200
Let's see.

345
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,320
Mom, one tael please.

346
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,240
And one tael from sister.

347
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:28,799
Dad, you should pay me

348
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,519
for what you owed

349
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,200
from last game.

350
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,679
That's two taels five qians and eight fens.
(Qian and fen are currency units in ancient China.)

351
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:33,240
Right?

352
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Don't kick me!

353
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,159
It's not necessary to
calculate so clearly

354
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,200
within the family.

355
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,360
No, that's not right.

356
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,240
It needs to be super clear
among family members.

357
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,559
Why would we play it if not for money?!

358
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,320
Don't you think so?

359
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,080
Come on!

360
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,559
Let's not stop this

361
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:47,559
if we don't use up
the money today, alright?

362
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,360
Let's keep playing then.

363
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:54,720
This is more like a family.

364
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,200
Stop cottoning up.

365
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,120
Financial matters should be settled
clearly though we are a family,

366
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:58,840
right?

367
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,440
One tael! One tael!

368
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,519
Two taels five qians and eight fens.

369
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,879
Thank you, dad!

370
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:19,960
Here comes the Teens!

371
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,039
Money! Money! Money!

372
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,000
Come on, sister!

373
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,080
I don't have any money left.

374
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,000
That's not a problem.

375
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,480
I have a lot.

376
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,200
You are my biological elder sister

377
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,919
and you can borrow it from me

378
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,320
if only you pay me the interest.

379
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:31,799
What do you think?

380
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
It's getting dark.

381
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:41,519
Let's call it a day!

382
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,759
Mom,

383
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:58,600
did I win all the money

384
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,399
from dad just now?

385
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,720
Evidently!

386
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,279
Why didn't he scold me?

387
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,319
Excuse me! I've gotta go now!

388
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,759
What do you think of Fan Xian?

389
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,880
Not bad. He's a good guy!

390
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,920
He can fight and also write books.

391
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,720
The books he wrote are great!

392
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,559
They sell very well.

393
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,559
We even want to

394
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,000
open up book stores together.

395
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,160
That's not bad!

396
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,359
He can teach you a lot.

397
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,680
What's the matter, mom?

398
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:34,720
You have hated him

399
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,599
for a long time.

400
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,960
Now it seems we'd better

401
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,559
not be enemies of him.

402
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,400
You're right!

403
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,400
May I?

404
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,160
Where is His Highness?

405
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,119
Please wait patiently, Mr. Guo.

406
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,599
His Highness should arrive in no time.

407
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:28,599
Brother,

408
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,000
all the ladies are on that side

409
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,799
for today.

410
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:32,960
I'll need to join them as well.

411
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,079
How about me?

412
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,279
Who can stand out from
the poetry gathering this time?

413
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,880
Who knows!

414
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,559
A lot of scholars want to
make a great coup with it.

415
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,640
They are all here today.

416
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,599
It's the first time to
have such a grand scene.

417
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,000
It's such a great honor

418
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,880
to be part
of a poetry gathering like this.

419
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,359
What a bliss!

420
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,559
You really came here.

421
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,119
Aren't you afraid to lose face?

422
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,440
Now that you have come, shall we...

423
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,559
Do you think you can hide

424
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,480
by turning a deaf ear?

425
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What a jerk!

426
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,480
What a scene!

427
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,519
A man breaks in.

428
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
How impolite he is!

429
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,400
He is so rude!

430
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,279
She is not there!

431
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,119
Men live in this world based on rites.

432
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,880
A gentleman can have no fancy clothes

433
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,160
but cannot do without rites.

434
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,000
Who are you?

435
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,640
I'm He Zongwei.

436
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,960
We've met yesterday

437
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,720
at Yishi House.

438
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,240
Are all the ladies here?

439
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Is there anyone else coming?

440
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,000
Fan Xian,

441
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,240
why are you so rude?

442
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,319
Calm down, gentlemen!

443
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,480
Since this is a poetry gathering,

444
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,440
we'd better make friends
by composing poems.

445
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:32,920
Your Highness,

446
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,279
do you know a lady

447
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,759
who likes to hold a drumstick?

448
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,200
What...

449
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:38,160
is it again?

450
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,519
Drumstick!

451
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,119
Namely, the leg of chicken.

452
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,119
We will prepare that during lunch.

453
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,960
Take your seats please.

454
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,079
Your Highness is right.

455
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,400
As this is a competition among scholars,

456
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,480
of course,
we should do it by composing poems.

457
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,480
What's the point to compete with that?

458
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,599
You will lose for sure!

459
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,000
How arrogant you are!

460
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,759
That's ridiculous!

461
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,359
Who do you think you are?

462
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,960
A great master of poem?

463
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:15,480
Alright! Tell me how do we do it.

464
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:27,880
One!

465
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,440
Two!

466
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,599
Three!

467
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,640
Four!

468
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:32,720
Five!

469
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,839
Six!

470
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,680
Seven!

471
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,680
Eight!

472
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:36,640
Nine!

473
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,640
Ten!

474
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:40,079
Your Highness!

475
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,559
Take ten steps till here.

476
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,079
The poem must be completed

477
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,839
and read out loud

478
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:49,079
so that everyone present
can evaluate who wins.

479
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:50,799
Do you agree?

480
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:51,680
Fantastic!

481
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,960
Red Mansions is indeed awesome.

482
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,640
It's a sufficient lifetime comfort

483
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:29,839
to read such a marvelous book.

484
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,720
Report it here!

485
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,640
His Highness asked me to report.

486
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,720
For the poem contest,

487
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,680
Guo Baokun proposed to
compose a poem within ten steps.

488
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,319
Before the dusk comes,

489
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,039
all poems will be considered together.

490
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,279
Did Fan Xian agree with it?

491
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:46,640
Fan Xian refused it.

492
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,039
He said no matter how many poems

493
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,400
Guo Baokun and He Zongwei compose,

494
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,519
he will win it with just one.

495
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,880
That's very arrogant!

496
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:56,640
Good!

497
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,759
One poem is enough to win it?!

498
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,039
Countryside man like you

499
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,640
can probably only compose one poem.

500
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,759
After you!

501
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:34,519
I feel a strong urge to write poetry

502
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,039
and express my feelings at the moment.

503
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,960
Please excuse me.

504
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,319
At the tower, I stand in the mist;

505
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,640
a boat on the river
forms a picturesque view.

506
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,559
A wide expanse
of mist-covered waters shields the sky;

507
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,640
A scholar writes articles
in the dim light.

508
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:34,000
Well done!

509
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,400
That's really a good poem.

510
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:41,119
Good point with the last line.

511
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,440
Quite a good poem that is!

512
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,160
The falling tone
and rising tone don't match.

513
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,000
Let's keep that aside first.

514
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,359
The poem is full of fancy words

515
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,720
which shows no sign of thinking.

516
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,119
You...

517
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:57,440
Mr. Guo!

518
00:24:59,119 --> 00:24:59,960
Mr. Fan,

519
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:01,559
It may have some flaws,

520
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,799
but composing a poem in such
a short while is already not easy.

521
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,160
Since you want to
see some sign of thinking,

522
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,799
at the time when I left home

523
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:11,960
for the capital city

524
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,519
with a whole lot of dreams,

525
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,759
I also composed a poem.

526
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,119
Simple and crude it might be,

527
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:19,599
it has the thoughts
from inside my heart.

528
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,680
Just read it out if you want!

529
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,400
Your Highness!

530
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:26,640
-May I? -Please!

531
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,119
Please!

532
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:29,400
Mr. Guo!

533
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,720
I look towards the east skyline,
far and remote;

534
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,319
I start up a journey in white,
on a frosted road.

535
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Don't say I'd travel alone.

536
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:50,640
The green hills
will see me off in the glow.

537
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,759
Good! Good! Good!

538
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,279
There was a bit of arrogance

539
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,519
when it was composed.

540
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,480
Did you ever predict

541
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,599
you would end up as a follower

542
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:07,920
licking others' boots?

543
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,880
That's really mean.

544
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:11,880
Are you able

545
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,240
to compose any really good poems?

546
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Here it goes!

547
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,359
Mr. Fan,

548
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,279
one poem in ten steps.

549
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,839
Don't you need to reconsider it?

550
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:23,799
I didn't find the person
I wanted to see.

551
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:24,559
So I'm not in a good mood.

552
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,599
I'll just write it directly.

553
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,839
Gentlemen, let's make a bet.

554
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:34,279
After I write down my poem,

555
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,400
I'll stop composing poem
for my whole life

556
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,000
if you can come up with better ones.

557
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:41,240
If I lose,

558
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,720
I'll never compose poems any more.

559
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,960
It's not poems that you're composing.

560
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,400
It's trouble.

561
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,319
The wind so swift,
the sky so wide, apes wail and cry;

562
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,799
water so clear and beach so white,
birds wheel and fly.

563
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,480
The boundless forest sheds its leaves
shower by shower;

564
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,680
the endless river rolls its waves
hour after hour.

565
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Well done! That's really a good poem.

566
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,440
A thousand miles from home,
I'm grieved at autumn's plight;

567
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,960
I'll now and then for years,
alone I'm on this height.

568
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,759
Living in times so hard,
at frosted hair I pine;

569
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,839
cast down by poverty,

570
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:13,440
I have to give up wine.

571
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,680
A thousand miles,
autumn's plight, years of illness.

572
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,960
A few lines of words depict the
millennium sorrow so thoroughly.

573
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,640
This poem from today's poetry gathering

574
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,200
will be remembered by history.

575
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,160
I'm done!

576
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,079
It's your turn.

577
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:55,799
Take your time.

578
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,880
Make it as long as it needs to be.

579
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,680
As long as it can be better
than this one,

580
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:00,559
you win.

581
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:05,359
That's Du Fu's work.

582
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,759
The poem named On the Height

583
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,640
is considered to be the best Lüshi.

584
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,480
Don't you ever try to compose poems
for the rest of your life.

585
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,000
Where is the toilet?

586
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,400
In the backyard.

587
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,279
Which way?

588
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,119
This way!

589
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,920
Take care of my sister.

590
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,559
It's amazing!

591
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,359
Just awesome!

592
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,599
Forgive me, Saint of Poem!

593
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,680
I'm sorry.

594
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,599
But they are really too arrogant.

595
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:42,039
I have to teach them a lesson
with your poem.

596
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:42,880
Mr. Fan,

597
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,400
You're indeed outstanding in literature.

598
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,440
But scholars need mental cultivation.

599
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,640
You don't have to

600
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,119
look down on scholars in the world.

601
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,000
If you can calm down
and focus on self-cultivation,

602
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,559
you're bound to become

603
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,519
a master of words.

604
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,880
Guo Baokun is shameless.

605
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:03,720
You're even worse.

606
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,039
When Guo Baokun humiliates others,

607
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,160
you repeat with him aside.

608
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,960
When he aggressively proposed
for a poem contest,

609
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,079
why didn't you ask him
for self-cultivation?!

610
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,599
As you have lost the contest,

611
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:13,480
you require me to
maintain self-cultivation

612
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,400
and make concession.

613
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:16,000
Scholar He,

614
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,759
don't you feel ashamed?

615
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Let him in.

616
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,599
Why would I get in?

617
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,079
Then go back!

618
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:19,799
Fan Xian,

619
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:21,640
You know me?

620
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,920
The Crown Prince takes you as enemy.

621
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,599
Of course, I need to remember your name.

622
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,400
Who are you?

623
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,599
You have three chances to make a guess.

624
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,839
The Second Prince!

625
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:47,640
Smart!

626
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,119
Is there anything I can help you?

627
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,000
The Crown Prince and I got estranged

628
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,440
and you're a person he doesn't like.

629
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,039
You want to draw me over to your side?

630
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,119
I will kill you

631
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,039
and present your body

632
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,160
to him as a gift

633
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,359
so that we can
be reconciled like before.

634
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:17,200
If so, you might need to consider

635
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,640
if his sword is faster

636
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,079
than my hand reaching out to you.

637
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,279
Looks like the sword is faster.

638
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,000
So sweet!

639
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:47,960
You'll be dead
with a simple click of my tongue.

640
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,640
Your Highness won't let that happen.

641
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:52,480
Why not? As I said,

642
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,920
I can reconcile with Crown Prince

643
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
with your head.

644
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,319
Your Highness and the Crown Prince
can't reconcile

645
00:32:58,319 --> 00:32:59,519
with a thousand heads of Fan Xian.

646
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:00,160
How dare you!

647
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:10,960
Any other reasons?

648
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,000
If Your Highness really want to kill me,

649
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,319
this will not be the place,

650
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,839
nor by this means.

651
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:23,039
This is so unwise.

652
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,279
Bi'an,

653
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
retrieve your sword.

654
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,839
Your poem is very good!

655
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,039
I wanted to meet you
as soon as I read it.

656
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,160
I don't want to meet you.

657
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,279
If I had known that you're here,

658
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,359
I would not have walked this way.

659
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,359
Why?

660
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,480
The Crown Prince must think

661
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,440
I have come under your service

662
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,359
once he knows

663
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,599
I have met Your Highness.

664
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:07,480
My days to come

665
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,039
will be difficult.

666
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,280
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

667
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,679
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

668
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:27,880
Your Majesty!

669
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,039
Mr. Fan has composed

670
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:32,159
an unprecedentedly good poem.

671
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,920
Read it!

672
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,079
Yes!

673
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,280
The wind so swift,
the sky so wide, apes wail and cry;

674
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,880
water so clear and beach so white,
birds wheel and fly.

675
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,599
The boundless forest sheds its leaves
shower by shower;

676
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,960
the endless river rolls its waves
hour after hour.

677
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,679
A thousand miles from home,
I'm grieved at autumn's plight;

678
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,679
I'll now and then for years,
alone I'm on this height.

679
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,559
Living in times so hard,
at frosted hair I pine;

680
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:09,000
cast down by poverty,
I have to give up wine.

681
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:14,440
It's just a bit too gloomy.

682
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:16,679
After writing it down,

683
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,559
Mr. Fan went to the backyard
and met the Second Prince.

684
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,599
I couldn't approach

685
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,679
because the Second Prince
has a swordsman with him.

686
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,880
I was unable to hear

687
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,480
what they talked about.

688
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,239
Where is the Crown Prince?

689
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,679
He is meeting Princess Royal

690
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,599
at the Guangxin Palace.

691
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:34,639
How attentive he is!

692
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,639
Give the poem to him.

693
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,280
Yes!

694
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,440
Your Majesty!

695
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:42,320
Do you have anything else to deliver?

696
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
Ask him to read the poem carefully

697
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,719
and tell him the story

698
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,000
happened at the Prince Jing's mansion.

699
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:50,760
Yes!

700
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:00,840
I'll now and then for years,
alone I'm on this height.

701
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,840
Living in times so hard,
at frosted hair I pine;

702
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,519
cast down by poverty,
I have to give up wine.

703
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,360
Guo Baokun loses badly.

704
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:23,840
His Majesty sends this.

705
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,760
It's said to be composed by Fan Xian.

706
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,119
He requires you to read it.

707
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:36,719
Smart!

708
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,880
You have not only the talent
as a scholar

709
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,519
but also the wisdom as a worldly person.

710
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,559
That is rare.

711
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,599
Thank you very much, Your Highness!

712
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,519
The Crown Prince will know about

713
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,360
us meeting each other sooner or later.

714
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,599
Aren't you worried about that?

715
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,800
Your Highness, do you know any girl

716
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,039
who likes to eat drumsticks?

717
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,559
Do you believe love at first sight?

718
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,480
I didn't either,

719
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,880
but I do now.

720
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,280
I met a girl

721
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,920
who had a drumstick in her hand.

722
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:25,559
I want to share the story

723
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,639
with you.

724
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,559
Are you interested?

725
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:28,480
Good!

726
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:30,719
Go ahead. I'm all ears.

727
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:35,719
This poem is amazing!

728
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,159
Judging from it,

729
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,079
I think Fan Xian is of much talent.

730
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,280
Auntie,

731
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,199
it's not bad if Wan'er marries him.

732
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,079
He deserves her.

733
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,320
Besides the poem,

734
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,280
His Majesty also sent me word that

735
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,119
Chengze is in urgent need of talents

736
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:56,599
and he's meeting Fan Xian

737
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,199
in Prince Jing's mansion.

738
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,440
It'll be late even if you hurry there.

739
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,920
Chengze is scheming.

740
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
He's been thinking about

741
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:13,000
taking over Neiku.

742
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,559
Luckily, we got the word in time.

743
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,679
We still have time to make preparations.

744
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,280
It seems

745
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:24,079
His Majesty

746
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,280
cares about you more.

747
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,199
Auntie,

748
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,280
why do you hate Fan Xian so much?

749
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,360
Of course it's for the throne.

750
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:37,400
Drink some tea.

751
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,559
I've told you the whole story

752
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,159
of me and the drumstick girl.

753
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,880
Did you get it?

754
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,599
Yes. Got it.

755
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,719
No, you didn't.

756
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:53,559
I want to marry her.

757
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,760
But my father and your father

758
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:00,000
want you to marry Wan'er.

759
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,360
I don't agree.

760
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,920
Now that I want to
break off my marriage contract,

761
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,159
I won't take over Neiku.

762
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,159
The marriage contract
is approved by my father.

763
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,599
How will you break it off?

764
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,119
Just wait and see.

765
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,599
What if you can't

766
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:25,679
see the drumstick girl anymore?

767
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:27,440
I've been lucky.

768
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,199
Fan Xian,

769
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:05,199
Do you want it?

770
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,320
No.

771
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,320
Let's eat what we like.

772
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:22,920
Did you steal it?

773
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,599
Are you hungry?

774
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,000
Not really.

775
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,920
Do you live here?

776
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,519
You're not allowed to eat drumsticks?

777
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:37,679
Are you a maidservant?

778
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,519
Help yourself. Eat.

779
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,679
You...

780
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:48,559
I can't do it with you staring at me.

781
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:49,000
It's okay.

782
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:50,599
I like to watch others eat drumsticks.

783
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,559
How about you?

784
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,199
Why are you here?

785
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,679
I'm...

786
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,320
I'm a servant.

787
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:13,400
I'm here with my Young Master

788
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,280
for the poetry gathering.

789
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,280
Look. You're a maidservant.

790
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm a servant.

791
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,039
What a perfect match!

792
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,079
I don't think so.

793
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:21,480
You don't live here.

794
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:22,719
How about

795
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:23,800
me transferring here?

796
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,599
It's not as simple as you think.

797
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,599
You...

798
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,559
Who is your Young Master?

799
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:34,119
Um. I'm...

800
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,159
Guo Baokun.

801
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,079
He's my Young Master.

802
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:36,920
We're here for the poetry gathering.

803
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,400
I've heard he's competing

804
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:42,760
with Fan Xian in poetry.

805
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,119
He lost badly.

806
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,480
He can't do it at all.

807
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,280
He's stupid.

808
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:50,360
Isn't he your Master?

809
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,159
But I'm righteous.

810
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:52,760
I don't tell lies.

811
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,599
You coughed up blood that day.

812
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,400
What happened?

813
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
He hit me.

814
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,480
He often did that.

815
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,679
But you look happy

816
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,280
when you said that.

817
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,760
It's because I saw you.

818
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,719
Help yourself.

819
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,719
You can eat the drumstick
while talking to me.

820
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:34,920
Is Fan Xian

821
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,480
also there?

822
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:40,880
Can you show me which one is him?

823
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,039
Why do you want to see him?

824
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,519
Nothing. I'm just curious.

825
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,880
Forget about it if you don't want to.

826
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,079
What are you doing?

827
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:03,559
Go. I'll show you who is Fan Xian.

828
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:22,119
That one.

829
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,519
He looks a little serious.

830
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,000
I think he's just so so.

831
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,320
Are you married?

832
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:44,519
Why are you asking this?

833
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:45,760
I'm just curious.

834
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:48,159
No.

835
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,679
What a coincidence! Neither am I.

836
00:44:51,159 --> 00:44:52,440
I didn't ask you.

837
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,159
Between a serious man like him
and a handsome man like me,

838
00:44:57,519 --> 00:44:58,719
which one do you like better?

839
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,639
Your Master is gone.

840
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:04,880
Go look for him.

841
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:07,280
No hurry. You haven't answered me yet.

842
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,559
I'm leaving.

843
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,480
What's your name?

844
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:39,760
Fan, what are you looking at?

845
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,679
Youth.

846
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,199
Youth.

847
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,119
What are you doing?

848
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,159
Your Excellency.

849
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:39,000
My daughter

850
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,719
is picky about food.

851
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,519
I want to let her know

852
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,440
how the dessert served here tastes.

853
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:47,320
No problem,

854
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,960
but do you have to come here
by climbing the wall?

855
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,239
Your Excellency,

856
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:53,440
it's troublesome to
come in from the front door.

857
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,519
I don't want to be questioned.

858
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:55,159
That's why I did it.

859
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:56,760
There are some jars

860
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,440
near the wall.

861
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,559
They made me fall down.

862
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:00,360
Can you have them

863
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,360
moved to somewhere else?

864
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,360
Cut the crap.

865
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,159
How is that thing going?

866
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,079
Here is the file

867
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,199
you need.

868
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,199
File D No. 534.

869
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,079
It's all

870
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:14,320
about Teng Zijing.

871
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,719
Your Excellency.

872
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,559
Teng Zijing was killed

873
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:19,280
in Danzhou.

874
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,199
Why do you need it?

875
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,559
Are you curious?

876
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,199
No. No. No.

877
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,119
I shouldn't have said that.

878
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,719
Take your time.

879
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,320
I'm leaving.

880
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:30,440
I'll take this to my daughter.

881
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:32,960
Hold on.

882
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,400
Don't cross the wall.

883
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,039
Go to the front door.

884
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,719
Is it...

885
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,159
Just go straight ahead.

886
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:45,079
Tell the gatekeeper

887
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:46,159
I gave the dessert to you.

888
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:49,360
Thank you, Your Excellency.

889
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:03,519
Wang Qinian once saw me,

890
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,559
so I have to avoid him.

891
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:07,039
It says something

892
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:09,440
about my wife and son, right?

893
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:22,239
Calm down.

894
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:23,280
Give it to me.

895
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,960
Everything was okay.

896
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:34,119
Why are they fighting?

897
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,400
I'll help you no matter what.

898
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,400
Calm down.

899
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:01,960
We need to be more thoughtful

900
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:02,960
at this moment.

901
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,400
Thoughtful?

902
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:09,360
You want me

903
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,880
to be patient, right?

904
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,760
I just want to say

905
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:14,400
I can give you a hand

906
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,320
no matter what you want to do.

907
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:16,960
Don't bother!

908
00:49:17,559 --> 00:49:18,320
We're bound to each other by no ties.

909
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,360
You don't have to do anything for me!

910
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,639
Hold on.

911
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:35,440
Stay out of

912
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,360
my business.

913
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,119
What's the matter?

914
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,519
His wife and son were killed.

915
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,480
Who did it?

916
00:49:57,159 --> 00:49:58,480
Guo Baokun is ruthless.

917
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:01,599
He fell out with you

918
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:03,480
on purpose.

919
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,280
I know.

920
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:06,039
He doesn't want to get me involved.

921
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:08,639
I didn't expect

922
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,280
Guo Baokun is so cruel.

923
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,039
Where do you think

924
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,960
I can find Guo Baokun tonight?

925
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,000
Brother!

926
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:17,079
Help me find it out.

927
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:21,880
He...

928
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,039
He may be found by the Liujing River.

929
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:25,920
Why?

930
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,960
Guo Baokun is a playboy.

931
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,400
He visits the brothels
all the year round.

932
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,440
You can find that line of business a lot

933
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,280
along the Liujing River.

934
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,800
How did you know that?

935
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,480
I checked his background

936
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,239
after you fell out with him.

937
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,320
Brother, he works
for the Crown Prince after all.

938
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:47,639
No matter what you do,

939
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,840
you have to keep yourself safe.

940
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,679
I see.

941
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:51,719
Ruoruo,

942
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,119
get someone

943
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,320
to send word to Li Hongcheng.

944
00:51:05,639 --> 00:51:07,480
Your Highness, it's cleared up.

945
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:12,679
The atmosphere here is good.

946
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:14,880
It's like real life.

947
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:18,480
I'd love to

948
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:19,719
share happiness with common people,

949
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:22,679
but I don't like to stay with them.

950
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:26,079
What are you going to do tonight?

951
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,760
Fanxian invited me

952
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,119
to go to the Liujing River.

953
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,039
He's heard that

954
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,480
there are many beautiful girls there.

955
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,920
He wants to drink and chat with me.

956
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:35,679
Where are you going to meet?

957
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,480
He said he's a newcomer,

958
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
so it's up to me.

959
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,440
Your Highness,

960
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,639
you said

961
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:43,360
you fell in love with a girl
at first sight.

962
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:44,800
Why did he

963
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,000
want to visit brothels?

964
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:47,880
Interesting.

965
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:49,679
So,

966
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,480
shall I go or not tonight?

967
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,239
Of course you should do it.

968
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:53,880
Where should I...

969
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:57,119
All right.

970
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:01,280
Sir, I haven't seen you for a long time.

971
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:02,039
This way, please.

972
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,199
This way, please.

973
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:04,519
On the third floor as usual.

974
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:06,880
This is one of the most

975
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,159
well-known brothels in the capital city.

976
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:09,840
They have
several pleasure boats on the river.

977
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,079
It's said
the most popular courtesan here

978
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,599
is kind of related to
the royal bloodline.

979
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:14,079
The Guo family
has lots of rules to follow,

980
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,039
so Guo Baokun
always goes home before midnight.

981
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:19,880
Where are you going?

982
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:21,480
I'm going inside with you.

983
00:52:22,199 --> 00:52:22,960
Go back.

984
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,960
Let me go with you.

985
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:26,840
Father will teach me a good lesson

986
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,840
if he knows

987
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,880
I take you here.

988
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,320
I won't tell him.

989
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,239
Ruoruo,

990
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:34,320
I'll be distracted

991
00:52:34,599 --> 00:52:35,639
if you go inside with me.

992
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,599
I promise

993
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:38,719
I won't act rashly.

994
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:42,840
Go back.

995
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:43,719
But...

996
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,360
Brother!

997
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:50,119
This way, please.

998
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,360
This way, please.

999
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:04,960
Sorry to have kept you waiting, Li.

1000
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:06,400
I just arrived.

1001
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,039
Your poems

1002
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:09,440
are being delivered.

1003
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:14,920
Who's there on the pleasure boat?

1004
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,679
A new courtesan

1005
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,719
called Si Lili.

1006
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:19,280
She's a little famous,

1007
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:20,719
but she seldom shows up.

1008
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:23,239
Many men spent lots of money,

1009
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,079
but they still failed to see her.

1010
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,199
So, what's the point of

1011
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:27,880
sending my poems there?

1012
00:53:28,199 --> 00:53:29,199
She is different

1013
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:30,119
from others.

1014
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:31,880
Let's go inside
and keep waiting there. Go.

1015
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:07,280
Si Lili!

1016
00:54:11,159 --> 00:54:12,320
Si Lili!

1017
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:14,079
Si Lili!

1018
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,039
Si Lili, look at me!

1019
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,480
Look at me!

1020
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:22,440
Si Lili!

1021
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,000
Si Lili!

1022
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,840
Look at me!

1023
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,480
Here!

1024
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,119
Miss Lili, here!

1025
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,320
Miss Lili! Miss Lili!

1026
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:02,039
Si Lili, look at me!

1027
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,519
She's coming over toward me.

1028
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:06,679
Look at me!

1029
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:09,559
Yeah. She's coming over.

1030
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,599
I'm nervous.

1031
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,559
Pleasure boat is drawing near.

1032
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,639
Gorgeous fireworks
light up the night sky

1033
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,800
each time when Miss Si Lili comes over.

1034
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:18,440
Her boat has never moved before.

1035
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,239
She's coming over for you.

1036
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,360
And she's never invited a man back.

1037
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:23,960
She's still a virgin.

1038
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:27,000
Miss Lili.

1039
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:33,199
Fan, are you nervous?

1040
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:35,840
I'm trying to adapt to it.

1041
00:55:36,519 --> 00:55:37,400
Beautiful!

1042
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:38,920
You've never been in a brothel?

1043
00:55:39,159 --> 00:55:40,719
Yes, never in this life
and my past life.

1044
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,480
She's coming over.

1045
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,079
She's coming over.

1046
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:21,239
She's coming over.

1047
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,760
Is she a fairy from Heaven? Gorgeous!

1048
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:31,400
So beautiful.

1049
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:32,840
Miss Lili.

1050
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:34,679
Hurry up. Follow me.

1051
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,760
Miss Lili.

1052
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,760
Amazing.

1053
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,199
Miss Lili.

1054
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,480
Miss Lili.

1055
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,800
It's His Highness.

1056
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,599
That explains why.

1057
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:52,880
Si Lili: ink plum blossom.

1058
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,719
Miss Lili.

1059
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:55,920
You're really elegant and beautiful.

1060
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,880
He's Mr. Fan.

1061
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,519
Who is that guy?

1062
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:03,400
Mr. Fan.

1063
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,880
I've been thinking

1064
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:10,679
what kind of person

1065
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,360
can write such a poem.

1066
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,320
I like your poem.

1067
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,639
And

1068
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:20,719
you're also not bad.

1069
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,360
How about a boat trip on the lake?

1070
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,920
A gifted scholar
and a lovely lady. Perfect!

1071
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,960
Fan, it seems

1072
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,760
you'll stay overnight on the boat.

1073
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:35,679
His Highness,

1074
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,719
I'm not that kind of person.

1075
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:46,199
Let me drink a toast to you, Miss Lili.

1076
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:48,800
Mr. Fan,

1077
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:50,679
I'll be yours tonight.

1078
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,400
Please be gentle with me.

1079
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:11,599
He drugged me, but didn't sleep with me.

1080
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,000
Shall I follow him?

1081
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:15,079
No.

1082
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,079
You can leave.

1083
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:18,760
Stay alert.
