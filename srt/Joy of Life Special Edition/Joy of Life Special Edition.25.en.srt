=Episode 25=

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,400
Is it
because the Nanqing martial arts masters

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,959
all tend to bully the weak
and fear the strong?

18
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,319
I won't force you.

19
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,040
As long as you admit that

20
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,200
martial arts masters from Nanqing
are weak and coward,

21
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,519
I can

22
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,319
let you off.

23
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:20,520
Then let's fight.

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,479
I have something to say.

25
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,560
Senior, let me fight him instead.

26
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:34,520
Why?

27
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,319
I'm the Saintess of Beiqi,

28
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,520
but he talked wildly,

29
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,719
on the Hall, saying that

30
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:41,240
he fell in love with me at first sight.

31
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,719
He must be good

32
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,560
at martial arts.

33
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,599
Today, I want to see

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
how deeply

35
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,479
he loves me.

36
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,560
Your Majesty, I beg your approval.

37
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,000
Langtao.

38
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
back off.

39
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,319
Will you fight me?

40
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:10,560
Of course. Why not?

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,240
What weapon will you use?

42
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,000
Sword.

43
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,879
His Excellency once fought
a Ninth Dan martial arts master,

44
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,240
and he's also
the poetic genius sent from Heaven.

45
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,879
Haitang is the Saintess of Beiqi

46
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,479
and the youngest martial arts master
above the Ninth Dan.

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,639
Among the younger generation,

48
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,000
the most famous two

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,360
are finally competing for victory!

50
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,159
Wang,

51
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,120
why aren't you excited?

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,400
This fight

53
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,840
won't be exciting to watch.

54
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,360
How do you know?

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,800
Just wait and see.

56
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:02,240
Are you fighting

57
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,680
or dancing?

58
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,480
It's Her Majesty's birthday.

59
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,480
What are you doing?

60
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,399
Are you cheating Her Majesty?

61
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:41,120
Saintess, your martial arts skills
are really amazing.

62
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:41,959
I really admire you.

63
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,800
Your Excellency,
you're really resourceful.

64
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,120
I fail to control my strength

65
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,199
when fighting with a real competitor.

66
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:48,759
I didn't mean to hurt this minister.

67
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,680
I'm really sorry.

68
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,759
Your Majesty,

69
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,879
our fight ends in a tie.

70
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,240
Good! Good! Good!

71
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,879
On such an auspicious day,

72
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,480
a tie is the best.

73
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:14,240
That fight was really beautiful.

74
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,600
So auspicious!

75
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,560
I like it.

76
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,399
When we see the princess back home,

77
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,600
we must say

78
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,600
they fought each other relentlessly

79
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,560
with blood all over their faces.

80
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:29,560
Why?

81
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,079
Otherwise, I'm afraid it might be hard

82
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,919
for His Excellency to explain.

83
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,279
Thank you, Your Majesty.

84
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,240
Fan Xian,

85
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,159
I heard after going back to Nanqing,

86
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,759
you'll take over
the financial power of Neiku.

87
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,759
After that,

88
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:50,960
Embroidered Uniform Guards

89
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,080
will do business with your branch
on behalf of Beiqi.

90
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,080
I see.

91
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,000
Wait!

92
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:06,240
Your Majesty,

93
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,799
I find it inappropriate.

94
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,840
We'd better consider carefully
before making the decision.

95
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,159
Commander Shen,

96
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,559
I've thought it

97
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,360
through.

98
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,200
It can only benefit Beiqi.

99
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,919
Nothing is inappropriate.

100
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,559
Fan Xian is too cunning to trust.

101
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,559
Your Majesty, please think twice.

102
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,600
Your Majesty,

103
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,919
I have something to report.

104
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,120
I originally intended to hold it
after the birthday celebration,

105
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,519
but since Shen Zhong is too arrogant,

106
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,840
I can't tolerate it anymore.

107
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
Tell me about it.

108
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,000
Shen Zhong, Commander-in-chief of

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,320
Embroidered Uniform Guards,

110
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,279
is suspected of colluding
with the Investigator's Office

111
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,440
to sell military information.

112
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,840
Treacherous as he is,
he should be punished.

113
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,879
Your Majesty, please be perceptive
and perspicacious.

114
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,639
Having controlled Embroidered Uniform
Guards for so many years,

115
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,799
Shen Zhong is loyal to Beiqi
all the time.

116
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,120
By accusing him of treason,

117
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,159
you'd better not talk recklessly.

118
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,360
I have evidence.

119
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,759
What evidence?

120
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,200
Our war against Nanqing

121
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,200
was started by mistake,

122
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:17,960
but we suffered great losses.

123
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:19,799
After all,

124
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,039
we lost because

125
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,200
our military information was leaked.

126
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,799
Yan Bingyun from the Investigator's Office
pried into information in Shangjing

127
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:28,919
and leaked the military information.

128
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,240
Everyone here

129
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,320
must have known about this.

130
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,039
But what you don't know is that

131
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,399
after coming to Shangjing,

132
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,039
Yan Bingyun and Lady Shen fell in love

133
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:44,279
and often saw each other in private.

134
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:45,919
It's pretty obvious as to

135
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,279
who leaked the military information.

136
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:49,720
Nonsense!

137
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,919
Yan Bingyun and Lady Shen

138
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,879
were intimate with each other.

139
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,600
Many people can prove that.

140
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,799
What's more,

141
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,960
when Yan Bingyun was caught,

142
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,559
Lady Shen visited him many times.

143
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:05,200
Their love was true.

144
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:06,759
Additionally, when Fan Xian

145
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,120
tried to rescue Yan Bingyun,

146
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,480
Lady Shen was the one

147
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,320
who led the way.

148
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,720
Many officers from Embroidered
Uniform Guards saw that.

149
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,919
Your Excellency,

150
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,120
do you still want to deny it?

151
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,639
She was deceived by Yan Bingyun.

152
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:22,919
Your Majesty,

153
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,039
I've never told my family

154
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,960
about military information.

155
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,120
Yan Bingyun couldn't have

156
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,639
got information from her.

157
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,120
Having told her or not,

158
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,960
you know it better than me.

159
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:41,559
Your Majesty,

160
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,799
my loyalty to Beiqi

161
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,799
is without question.

162
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,200
The frontier forces
were defeated repeatedly,

163
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,159
and His Excellency Shen,

164
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,840
knew the military deployment very well.

165
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,279
Your Excellency,

166
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,879
your sister and you

167
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:55,799
are really suspicious.

168
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,360
Your Majesty,

169
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,480
though I'm not capable,

170
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,519
I know

171
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,039
I'm a citizen of Beiqi.

172
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,440
I would never betray my country.

173
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,679
I know

174
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,720
Shen Zhong is loyal.

175
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,240
His Excellency Shen may be loyal,

176
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,960
but his sister...

177
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,679
I suggest

178
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,120
sending Lady Shen to prison

179
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,519
and using cruel torture
to find out the truth.

180
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:25,919
Your Majesty,

181
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,799
though my sister

182
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,440
was blinded by love,

183
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:29,679
she would never

184
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,600
betray our country.

185
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,720
Your Majesty,
please be perceptive and perspicacious.

186
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,039
Your Majesty, what do you think?

187
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,639
Mother, it's up to you.

188
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,639
Loyal and brave all the time,

189
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,879
Commander Shen has rendered
many meritorious services to Beiqi.

190
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:58,320
It's inappropriate

191
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,759
to humiliate a meritorious minister.

192
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,480
But there's something

193
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,480
suspicious about it.

194
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,639
Even if your sister

195
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:09,120
didn't leak the secrets,

196
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,480
Shen Zhong, you're to blame

197
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,159
for not teaching her properly.

198
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,840
You can still be the Commander-in-Chief,

199
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,879
but the python pattern on your robe

200
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,960
should be removed.

201
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,799
Her Majesty has given the order.

202
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,320
What're you waiting for?

203
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,360
You killed my personal guards

204
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,600
and my adoptive father.

205
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,279
Have you ever thought
this would happen to you?

206
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,720
Fan Xian.

207
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:17,759
Yes.

208
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:19,639
The business between Neiku

209
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,879
and Embroidered Uniform Guards

210
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,799
is settled.

211
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,399
After returning to Nanqing,

212
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,440
you should arrange it
as soon as possible.

213
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,279
I see.

214
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,039
Your Majesty,

215
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,919
I still find it inappropriate.

216
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,519
Commander Shen is excited and indignant.

217
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,200
It's not appropriate for him
to discuss government affairs.

218
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,759
Send him back

219
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,240
for a few days' rest.

220
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,919
Your Majesty,

221
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:53,039
whatever I say,

222
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,679
I say it for the benefits of Beiqi.

223
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,639
I'm selfless, Your Majesty!

224
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,600
You're selfless.

225
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,399
Are you suggesting we are selfish?

226
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,240
Her Majesty decides
to do business with Neiku.

227
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,600
Is Her Majesty

228
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,480
selfish?

229
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
Take him away.

230
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,080
The traitor will endanger our country!

231
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,200
Your Majesty, think twice!

232
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,960
The traitor will endanger our country!

233
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,799
Your Majesty, think twice!

234
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,679
The traitor will endanger our country!

235
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,279
Your Majesty, think twice!

236
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,279
The traitor will endanger our country!

237
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,120
Mr. Fan, when will you leave?

238
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,440
Your Majesty, I'll leave tomorrow.

239
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,279
After parting this time,

240
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,519
I wonder when we can meet again.

241
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:02,919
Mr. Fan, you should

242
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,200
spend more time writing your book.

243
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,039
I'm still waiting for
the following chapters.

244
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,240
Yes, Your Majesty.

245
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,840
Making a man like Shen Zhong

246
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,240
lose all his authority

247
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,279
in such a short time,

248
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,720
Your Excellency, you're really amazing!

249
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:22,639
However,

250
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,919
he's still the Commander-in-Chief.

251
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:26,519
He won't hold the position for long.

252
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:28,080
Others will take over his power
when he falls into disgrace.

253
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,399
It's only a matter of time.

254
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,159
It's a bit too fast.

255
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,879
Your Excellency, what's your concern?

256
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,559
Though we've taken down Shen Zhong,

257
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,200
we still haven't got

258
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,320
the name of

259
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:39,919
the smuggler.

260
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:42,120
Your Excellency.

261
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,120
Your Excellency, Shangshan Hu is here.

262
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,720
He wants to see you.

263
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,880
Where's the body of my adoptive father?

264
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,240
There's a cave on the cliff.

265
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,200
Was he buried inside?

266
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,279
I didn't bury him under the ground.

267
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,200
He said in his last wish that

268
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,079
after being locked up

269
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,240
deep in the dungeon for decades,

270
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,079
he was scared of
the darkness under the ground.

271
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,000
He wanted

272
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,759
to rest in the light.

273
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,119
Tell me the exact place.

274
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,000
I've written it for you.

275
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,079
I was intended to kill you

276
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:50,680
before you leave Shangjing.

277
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:59,519
I'll leave tomorrow.

278
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,400
You'd better hurry.

279
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,400
Given that you've disposed of
my adoptive father's body,

280
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,160
I'll spare your life this time.

281
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:12,400
Fan Xian,

282
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,440
after my mourning period,

283
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,319
I'll go to Nanqing in person

284
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,079
to take your life.

285
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:24,480
I'll wait for you.

286
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,200
Gao Da!

287
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:39,960
Your Excellency.

288
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,000
Ask Haitang Duoduo

289
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:43,759
over.

290
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:47,799
What's wrong?

291
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,200
Your Excellency,
there are many people in the mission.

292
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,640
It's easier for the princess
to find out.

293
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,880
Please be cautious.

294
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,240
Hurry up and go!

295
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,799
Stop hanging out with Wang Qinian.

296
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,519
I...

297
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,480
What?

298
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:17,039
Your Majesty,

299
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:17,680
I've passed on your order

300
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,480
in advance.

301
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,599
Those who are loyal to you

302
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
in different ministries

303
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,319
all know that

304
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,359
we'll deal with Shen Zhong today.

305
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,200
For those who want to help Shen Zhong
out of old friendships,

306
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,599
some are controlled

307
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:31,960
and some are sent away from the capital.

308
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,079
With my followers

309
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,839
and my mother's followers

310
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,480
working together,

311
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,279
Shen Zhong stands no chance.

312
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,039
He Daoren goes to see Fan Xian secretly.

313
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,559
Guo Baokun is the nominal Chief.

314
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,480
He Daoren is the actual future

315
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,599
Chief of secret agents
in Shangjing Town.

316
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,720
After I leave,

317
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,200
you should take charge of
the intelligence network in Shangjing Town.

318
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,039
I'll try my best.

319
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,000
Take it easy.

320
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,400
After our smuggling business expands,

321
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,839
we can buy information

322
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,079
openly.

323
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,920
It won't be long

324
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,720
before secret agents
can live a safe life.

325
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,279
What else do you want to tell me?

326
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,119
I can't stay long

327
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,079
for fear that I might be discovered.

328
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,359
Nothing else.

329
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,079
No need to see me before I leave.

330
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,559
Protect yourself. Don't be discovered.

331
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,279
Your Majesty, since you've known

332
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,720
He Daoren is a secret agent of Nanqing,

333
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,599
why not catch him?

334
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,680
What can we get

335
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,440
by catching him?

336
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,119
Sometimes,

337
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,680
enemies can

338
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,920
do things for us.

339
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,920
Look at the situation now.

340
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,000
Shen Zhong has no future.

341
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,599
Now we don't have to fight him.

342
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,920
So why not use our enemies?

343
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,200
But now,

344
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,480
He Daoren is useless

345
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:04,599
after defeating Shen Zhong.

346
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,319
No hurry.

347
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,440
By keeping He Daoren,

348
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:11,119
Nanqing can only

349
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,160
get the information

350
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,680
we want them to get.

351
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,400
Your Majesty, you want to use He Daoren

352
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,519
to sow distrust among our enemies.

353
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:22,960
But Her Majesty

354
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,839
has got Shangshan Hu.

355
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,400
Mother will never send Shangshan Hu

356
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,319
back to the army.

357
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
From now on,

358
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,720
that tiger is useless.

359
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:37,319
I'm afraid Fan Xian

360
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,440
will become a formidable enemy of Beiqi.

361
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,319
Fan Xian will never be our enemy.

362
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:46,400
Remember that

363
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
the biggest enemy

364
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,599
always comes from within.

365
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,720
Those princes from Nanqing

366
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,119
are all hard to deal with.

367
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,400
Fan Xian still has

368
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:03,720
a long way to go in future.

369
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,079
You're leaving.

370
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,839
Why ask me over?

371
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,839
I want to see someone.

372
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,119
Si Lili can't see you for sure.

373
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:37,519
It's Zhuang Mohan.

374
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,200
Didn't he spit blood

375
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,119
after being pissed by you?

376
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,279
You still can't let him go?

377
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,799
I was entrusted by someone
to send him a message.

378
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:48,640
Why do you ask me for help?

379
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,160
You can see him yourself.

380
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:51,880
I don't want others

381
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,839
to know about it.

382
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:56,400
What about me?

383
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,039
I cry, "Can't you see? Can't you see?

384
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,240
The green leaves are fresh
but the red flowers are fading!"

385
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,319
You're crabapple blossoms.

386
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:01,920
You're no mortal.

387
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,000
You're smooth-tongued

388
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,160
when asking for help.

389
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:08,920
Do me a favor.

390
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,559
I assure you

391
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,839
it won't harm Beiqi.

392
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Nor will I scold him.

393
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,799
Master Zhuang.

394
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,400
No need to stand up.

395
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:06,200
Fine.

396
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,319
Take a seat! Take a seat! Take a seat!

397
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,440
Look!

398
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,759
The line "One who has seen the ocean
thinks nothing of mere rivers.

399
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,839
One who has appreciated the clouds over
the Wushan Mountain sees nothing of mere clouds."

400
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:23,839
has beautiful diction
and neat antithesis.

401
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,880
But without knowing the context of
the latter sentence,

402
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,759
it doesn't

403
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:30,000
make any sense.

404
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,200
It really doesn't make any sense.

405
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,519
Wushan Mountain
is a holy mountain in the far south.

406
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,000
This mountain is renowned for
its unparalleled cloudscape.

407
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,880
The latter sentence uses its name

408
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,599
to express the loyalty in love.

409
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,160
I see.

410
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:44,480
I've checked

411
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,200
many books,

412
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,319
but I just couldn't find
Wushan Mountain.

413
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,480
Luckily, you explained it to me.

414
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,680
Are you annotating
the poetry collection?

415
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,480
Yes.

416
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,200
I have another question.

417
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,720
Look!

418
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,640
Prince Chen paid at a banquet
in the Palace of Perfection.

419
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,759
Ten thousand coins for a cask of wine,
with many a laugh and quip.

420
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,519
What's the literary quotation?

421
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:11,799
Prince Chen

422
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,599
is a prince surnamed Cao.

423
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,240
He once held a banquet

424
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,039
in the Palace of Perfection.

425
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,000
A prince surnamed Cao?

426
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,160
In past dynasties,

427
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,440
no one from the imperial families
was surnamed Cao.

428
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,200
Master Zhuang,

429
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,319
I told you

430
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,599
on the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest

431
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,359
that all these poems come from

432
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,559
another world.

433
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,960
So these literary quotations certainly

434
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,519
won't be found in historical records.

435
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:38,880
Then,

436
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,839
it's a fairyland in dream?

437
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:44,680
It's not a fairyland. It's...

438
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,400
What?

439
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,799
It's the imprint left by

440
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:47,559
another era.

441
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,319
What?

442
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:50,640
Era?

443
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,680
It is earlier than all history

444
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,839
for hundreds and thousands of years.

445
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,200
It's a splendid

446
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
civilization

447
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,680
lost in the

448
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,839
river of time.

449
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,480
I don't get it. I don't get it.

450
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,720
Are you referring to

451
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:12,400
the ancient times?

452
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,839
It's even earlier than that.

453
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:15,839
How do you know these?

454
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,759
Since I was born,

455
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:19,799
these things

456
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,000
have been carved in my mind

457
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,480
as if I've seen them in my dreams.

458
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:29,039
So it is

459
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,200
a dreamland.

460
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:32,680
Can I put it this way?

461
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,400
Yes, you can.

462
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,680
Good.

463
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:43,960
Now I understand why there're so many

464
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,359
unknown literary quotations.

465
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,640
It's not because I'm a poor scholar.

466
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,880
How can I know stuff

467
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
of the fairyland?

468
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,200
Don't let it bother you.

469
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,359
Fine.

470
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
When you came in just now,

471
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,039
why was there no report?

472
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,160
Actually,

473
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,440
I sneaked in to see you.

474
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,680
Your servant was lured away

475
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:24,839
by my friend.

476
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,799
Why do you sneak in?

477
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,119
Actually, I know

478
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,519
you are in Shangjing,

479
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,599
and I want to see you very much.

480
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,880
But my servant stops me

481
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,720
from visiting you.

482
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,160
He said my condition would go worse

483
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,319
if I see you.

484
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:47,680
Master Zhuang, are you sick?

485
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,880
I'm just old.

486
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:06,359
Don't! Don't! Don't!

487
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:17,200
Your Excellency,

488
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,680
back on the Hall of Prayer
for Good Harvest,

489
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,799
I framed you up.

490
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,599
Till today,

491
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,240
I feel guilty all the time.

492
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:28,920
Today,

493
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,079
by seeing you,

494
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,519
I can finally apologize to you
in person.

495
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:36,559
Your Excellency,

496
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,880
please be magnanimous and forgive me.

497
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,680
Master Zhuang, you don't have to!

498
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,799
I know you did that

499
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,599
to save Xiao En.

500
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
To be honest,

501
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,160
though he is surnamed Xiao,

502
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,839
he's my full brother.

503
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,240
Actually, Master Zhuang,
I visit you this time

504
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,359
because Senior Xiao asked me to.

505
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:15,480
Really?

506
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,039
He finally wants

507
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,119
to contact me.

508
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,880
Did he ask you

509
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:28,039
to tell me anything?

510
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,359
What's wrong?

511
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,680
Is he dead?

512
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:57,960
All men

513
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,880
must die.

514
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:05,200
Senior Xiao died in peace.

515
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,400
He lived a miserable life.

516
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,519
That's because

517
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,440
he killed so many people.

518
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:20,559
Nowadays, man gets power

519
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,960
by killing others
and setting places on fire.

520
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,039
Your Excellency Fan,

521
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,799
you shouldn't be like that.

522
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,000
Man like you
who's capable of writing wonderful poems

523
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,759
shouldn't be defiled by
the secular world.

524
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,759
Master Zhuang, I promise you.

525
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:39,799
I'll never be like that.

526
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,079
Good!

527
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:58,359
Isn't that Commander Shen?

528
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,440
Her Majesty ordered you

529
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,519
to rest at home for a few days.

530
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,559
But our Division can't operate

531
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:07,640
without a leader.

532
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:08,960
There's no other way.

533
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
From tomorrow on,

534
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,319
I'll take your position temporarily.

535
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,200
Feel relieved to rest at home.

536
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,799
Just leave

537
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:18,839
all the trouble

538
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,279
to me.

539
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,720
Your Excellency,

540
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:36,400
why are you still here?

541
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,160
Seriously speaking,

542
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,880
you're defying the imperial order.

543
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Don't make it hard for me.

544
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,839
Should I find someone to help you?

545
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:54,920
Who are you?

546
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
How dare you break into the Division?

547
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,839
What we're going to do today is simple.

548
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,240
Stop and kill the Nanqing mission.

549
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:20,519
There's no imperial edict.

550
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:23,200
It's my own decision.

551
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:26,359
Everyone,

552
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:30,039
succeed or not,

553
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,720
this operation will cost your lives.

554
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,279
I'm also afraid to die.

555
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,079
But on second thought,

556
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,359
if I can save Beiqi

557
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,160
by sacrificing my life,

558
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,240
it's totally worth it.

559
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,359
With me or not, it's up to you.

560
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:57,839
I won't force you.

561
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:01,480
Commander Shen,

562
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,759
you should think is through.

563
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,240
Guards!

564
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,039
You traitors,

565
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,200
how dare you

566
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,119
do this?

567
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,359
Whoever leaves

568
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,559
will be killed!

569
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,680
Do you know

570
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,240
that will cost your lives?

571
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,079
You!

572
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,359
Come back!

573
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:31,400
Come...

574
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:32,559
Come on!

575
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:33,839
Take them!

576
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,000
Come on!

577
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:40,880
Come on!

578
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:01,920
Your Excellency, do you trust

579
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,279
Guo Baokun to stay in Shangjing?

580
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:05,480
You're right.

581
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,680
What about leaving you behind?

582
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,679
Guo Baokun can
definitely complete the task!

583
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:34,840
Your Excellency.

584
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,440
She's here.

585
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,719
See me off with a load of things?

586
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,400
Master Zhuang has passed away.

587
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,480
What?

588
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:57,880
He died this morning.

589
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,000
When he was on his deathbed,
he asked me to go to his place

590
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,239
and hand these things over to you.

591
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:05,760
This is a list compiled by him.

592
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,079
He left all the books he collected

593
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,199
to you.

594
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:18,719
It means he relies on you

595
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:19,920
as for the inheritance of literature.

596
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:22,719
He places great expectations on you.

597
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,719
Actually, I just saw him twice.

598
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,280
As for the inheritance of literature,
it's all about the spirit.

599
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,719
His last words are

600
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:38,320
that you should follow your heart.

601
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,679
He also said...

602
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,440
I've been living a happy life.

603
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,639
I've never felt wronged

604
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,199
or cheated myself.

605
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,320
Your Excellency Fan,

606
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,360
I hope it's the same case for you.

607
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,639
Live a happy life.

608
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,639
Be happy.

609
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:03,239
Happy.

610
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,440
Happy.

611
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,000
Happy.

612
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,000
I must go too.

613
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,519
I think

614
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,960
we'll see each other again.

615
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,719
Lili is also here.

616
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,280
Where?

617
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:45,320
Stop looking.

618
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,039
She's staying where she can see you.

619
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,559
Biejie.

620
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:00,880
"Please don't"?
('Biejie' sounds like 'Please don't' in Chinese)

621
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,559
What a weird name.

622
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,039
Go! Hurry!

623
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,199
Mr. Yan!

624
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,400
Leave here now.

625
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,960
My brother wants to kill all of you.

626
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,519
Leave here before it's too late.

627
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:16,360
Go!

628
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,199
Brother!

629
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,840
For the sake of our country,

630
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:43,800
kill all the Nanqing people.

631
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:46,079
Is Shen Zhong crazy?

632
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,800
The Imperial Guards are also here.

633
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,039
They're here to protect Lili.

634
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,639
I know about your wounds most.

635
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:03,719
Don't be afraid.

636
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,159
You won't die.

637
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,599
I'll save you.

638
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,639
You won't die.

639
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,639
Heaven wants to destroy Beiqi!

640
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:05,920
Fan Xian.

641
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:07,920
Don't move!

642
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:20,039
A large number of goods in Neiku
have been smuggled.

643
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,800
Actually, I've paid attention to that.

644
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:24,159
But the money

645
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,199
has been transferred

646
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,960
to the biggest family of Nanqing,

647
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,440
the Ming family.

648
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,639
The Ming family?

649
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:33,360
This family

650
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:36,239
works for the Second Prince
and Li Yunrui.

651
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:40,920
No.

652
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:43,519
Li Yunrui
has been supporting the Crown Prince.

653
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,880
You're fooled.

654
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,079
Why did you tell me about it suddenly?

655
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:54,519
I want to exchange it

656
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:57,800
for my sister's life.

657
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,760
To be honest,

658
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,480
I really want to

659
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,719
kill you and Yan Bingyun.

660
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,000
I know.

661
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,400
The odds are against us.

662
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:16,119
When the Imperial Guards showed up,

663
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,639
I made a choice.

664
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,719
I didn't stop

665
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:22,679
when my sister stood in the way,

666
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:26,039
but she's not fatally injured.

667
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:30,760
Only by doing that

668
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,800
can I give her a chance to survive.

669
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:45,960
I'll die, anyway,

670
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:51,480
but I'm afraid

671
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,400
life will be harder for her

672
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:55,159
if she stays in Beiqi alone.

673
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,320
Your Excellency Fan,

674
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,519
please take my sister

675
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,599
to Nanqing.

676
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:21,719
I promise.

677
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,280
Your Excellency Shen,

678
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,360
you can leave with us.

679
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,559
None of
the Embroidered Uniform Guards of Beiqi

680
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:10,400
has ever chosen to give in to the enemy.

681
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:19,559
Take him back

682
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,920
and wait for His Majesty's orders.

683
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,079
-Go. -Go.

684
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:28,679
Go.

685
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,320
Go.

686
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,440
Go.

687
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:32,119
Go.

688
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:32,760
Go.

689
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:33,679
Go.

690
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,400
If it hadn't been for Lili,

691
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:52,119
the majority of you

692
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:54,320
would've been killed here.

693
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,440
Remember what she did for you.

694
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,440
I'll pretend not to see her.

695
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:00,960
Hide her in the cart and take her back.

696
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,679
Now we really have to say goodbye.

697
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:13,360
But I always think

698
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,679
we'll see each other again.

699
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,159
A lot of people are anxious about

700
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:18,559
the possibility of
your staging a comeback.

701
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:21,440
It just proves they're afraid of you.

702
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:24,800
It's not easy

703
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:28,039
to rise from the ashes.

704
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:29,239
So,

705
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,559
if I kill you at this moment,

706
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:34,280
nobody would feel pity for you.

707
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:36,679
The Empress Dowager would just scold you

708
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:38,239
when she knows about it.

709
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,119
She may not punish you at all.

710
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,719
Did you force my subordinates

711
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,280
to kill themselves?

712
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:47,880
Yes.

713
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,639
Was my adoptive father killed by you?

714
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,599
Exactly.

715
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,239
That is

716
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,639
why I'll kill you!

717
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,000
I know.

718
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:01,679
Grand General,

719
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:03,320
His Majesty hasn't issued
an imperial edict.

720
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,039
It's snowing.

721
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,360
Go to hell!

722
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,719
This is

723
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,239
my revenge.

724
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:38,920
Lady Shen's wound is nothing serious,

725
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,199
but she hasn't come round.

726
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:42,559
You don't need
to tell me anything about her.

727
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,599
But I saw you hold her in your arms.

728
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:49,760
She's a Beiqi person.

729
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:51,000
Not anymore.

730
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,960
Someone said

731
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,360
people who have feelings

732
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:56,960
and know about his love

733
00:49:58,119 --> 00:49:59,199
are stronger

734
00:49:59,199 --> 00:49:59,840
than those who are cold and ruthless.

735
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,639
Now that you know

736
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,599
it was the Second Prince
that tried to kill you,

737
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,159
what will you do?

738
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,159
I'll ask him why he did that

739
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,519
when I go back.

740
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,679
Once you ask him this question,

741
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,039
there'll be no turning back.

742
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:14,840
He wants to kill me.

743
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,599
How can I pretend not to know about it?

744
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,920
Your opponent is a prince.

745
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,320
Do you think the odds are in your favor?

746
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,400
I don't care about the odds.

747
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,760
What do you care about?

748
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:23,920
I have to fight back now
that he wants to kill me.

749
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,480
Only in this way
can I live a happy life.

750
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,840
Will you help me

751
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,280
when we go back to the capital city?

752
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:39,000
You can think about it

753
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:39,679
on the way.

754
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,320
No matter if you decide

755
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,519
to help me

756
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:46,960
or to support the Second Prince,

757
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,159
you have to make a choice

758
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:49,719
since you've known the truth.

759
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:53,519
I'll wait for your reply.

760
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:33,000
What's up?

761
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,559
Someone is around.

762
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:41,679
Where?

763
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,320
Your Excellency!

764
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,079
I'm bad at everything else

765
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,119
except the art of

766
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,000
tracking.

767
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,760
Your Excellency, you know that.

768
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:50,960
I'm sure

769
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,840
someone is watching us out there.

770
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:03,039
Your Excellency,

771
00:52:03,639 --> 00:52:04,159
the cakes are for you.

772
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:13,000
What are you looking at?

773
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:20,880
Who is it?

774
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:45,920
Xie Bi'an?

775
00:52:57,039 --> 00:52:57,599
Mr. Yan.

776
00:52:58,639 --> 00:52:59,159
What's up?

777
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:01,000
His Excellency Fan wants to see you.

778
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:20,599
Xie Bi'an is here.

779
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,800
The swordsman
that works for the Second Prince?

780
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:25,159
Exactly.

781
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:26,760
Where is he?

782
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:28,920
I let him go have a rest.

783
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:31,599
Is he here to deliver a letter?

784
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:33,159
Yeah.

785
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,159
He wanted us to open it
at the same time.

786
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:44,599
It's for you.

787
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,440
Let's treat the letter

788
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,400
like face-to-face conversation.

789
00:54:03,639 --> 00:54:04,679
I miss you

790
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:06,760
since you left the capital city.

791
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:09,719
I know myself well enough.

792
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,760
You know,

793
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,920
I'm a little lazy.

794
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,079
I hate to beat around the bush.

795
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,599
So, let's get straight to the point.

796
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:19,840
Fan Xian,

797
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:22,119
you must've known

798
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:23,679
what I did in Shangjing.

799
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,199
Let me put it this way.

800
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,159
In this world,

801
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:31,280
it's the most difficult thing
to be an emperor's son.

802
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,559
Conflicts also take place
among men in other families,

803
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:35,960
but as a loser,

804
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:38,320
they'll just lose bright futures,

805
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:40,559
lose family property

806
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,760
or lose face.

807
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,400
If I lose,

808
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:50,360
I'll die.

809
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:54,039
So, I've done all those things

810
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,480
to survive.

811
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:58,480
I hope you can understand.

812
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:01,559
You must've guessed

813
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,800
the one you fought

814
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,159
is on my side.

815
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,079
I have to admit

816
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,000
what happened to you

817
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,440
was caused by me.

818
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,639
I don't have much choice.

819
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,519
Please forgive me.

820
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,719
However, to be honest,

821
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,840
I think really highly of you.

822
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,480
A man shouldn't live in the past.

823
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,400
If you forgive and forget,

824
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,000
I swear

825
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,559
I'll make you

826
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:36,639
the most powerful minister in Nanqing.

827
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,920
Since then, the Fan family

828
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,440
will be the No.1 family in Nanqing.

829
00:55:46,119 --> 00:55:47,199
I've heard you dream of

830
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,920
living a life without worry.

831
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,360
I can help you do that.

832
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,960
You have my word.

833
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,679
I asked Xie Bi'an

834
00:55:57,679 --> 00:55:58,639
to take you a gift.

835
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:00,519
I hope you can feel

836
00:56:00,519 --> 00:56:01,840
my great sincerity

837
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,639
and agree to give me a helping hand.

838
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:13,440
What did he write in the letter?

839
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,599
Tell me about yours first.

840
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,559
He promised to give me a high position
with a high salary.

841
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,920
In a word,
he hopes I can forgive and forget.

842
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:29,639
He said everything that should be said,

843
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:32,079
but no details have been given.

844
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,119
There is even no signature.

845
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:36,199
It can't be used as evidence.

846
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,320
He's cunning.

847
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:43,199
A life without worry?

848
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,360
Yep.

849
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,440
You know,

850
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:50,840
I'm not ambitious.

851
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:53,639
I just want to live a rich, cozy life.

852
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,559
I have no desire to go further ahead.
All I want is to live quietly.

853
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:02,719
Then you should say yes.

854
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,199
I'd like to,

855
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:09,159
but those who died

856
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:10,519
hold me by the corner of my clothing.

857
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,840
I want to keep them quiet.

858
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,159
I want to let them loosen their grip.

859
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:19,800
You don't want to reach a compromise?

860
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,400
Everyone has to be responsible

861
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,960
for the consequences of
his choices in life.

862
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:28,559
He'll be rewarded
if he does things right.

863
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,280
He'll be punished

864
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:32,159
if he does things wrong.

865
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,559
If a thing happens

866
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:35,559
and the consequences are ignored,

867
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:39,159
I'll be resentful.

868
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,920
If I'm resentful,

869
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,039
how could I live a happy life?

870
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,079
How about you?

871
00:58:03,159 --> 00:58:04,079
What did he write in the letter to you?

872
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,760
He asked me to understand something.

873
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:10,239
If the truth is exposed,

874
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:11,920
he'll do all he can to revolt.

875
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,639
By then,

876
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,639
disturbances are bound
to happen in Nanqing.

877
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,480
So what?

878
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,719
Everything the Investigator's Office
has done

879
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,679
aims to prevent Nanqing

880
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:24,320
from falling into turmoil.

881
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:26,559
That's also my duty as long as I live.

882
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,400
Will you tolerate corruption

883
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:31,559
to prevent turmoil?

884
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,679
I need more time to think about it.

885
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
He said he's got me a gift.

886
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,039
How about looking at it with me?

887
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:00,400
Your Excellency.

888
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:03,760
Where is Wang?

889
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:05,840
He's arranging with the mission.

890
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,320
He said it's safer
not to let too many people

891
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,960
know about what's happening here.

892
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,920
Wang Qinian is considerate.

893
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:12,800
Yeah.

894
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,679
Mr. Yan,
you had a narrow escape from death.

895
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,079
Congratulations.

896
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,679
I have a question for you.

897
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:22,400
Please go ahead.

898
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,960
When did the Second Prince know about

899
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,119
what the mission had done in Shangjing?

900
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:31,199
The two places are thousands of miles apart
and it's inconvenient to communicate,

901
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,760
so His Highness didn't know

902
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,400
what the mission had done in Shangjing.

903
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:35,760
So why did he ask you

904
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:37,199
to send us such a letter?

905
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:41,400
Because His Highness

906
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:43,840
believes in His Excellency Fan.

907
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,119
On the day
when you left the capital city,

908
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:47,480
His Highness said that

909
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:49,599
you'd find out the truth

910
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:51,480
about what happened in Shangjing.

911
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:53,639
When you go back,

912
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:55,880
tell him that I believe his sincerity.

913
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,039
But I'm narrow-minded.

914
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,599
I won't forgive him.

915
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,199
His Highness asked you

916
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,440
to accept his gift.

917
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:18,599
Please look at the stamp.

918
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,519
Danbo Bookstore.

919
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,559
Your brother is my good buddy.

920
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:30,039
Of course I'll give you more chances.

921
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:31,960
Do you mean

922
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,159
there is something else I can do

923
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:35,679
to make more money
besides running a bookstore?

924
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:39,159
It'll let you

925
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,480
make a fortune.

926
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,639
His Highness said

927
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:50,920
Fan Sizhe is pure and cute

928
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:52,719
and he's a likeable guy.

929
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,119
Fan Sizhe is a legitimate child

930
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:02,599
and I'm a bastard son.

931
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,360
Do you think
I'm getting well along with him?

932
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,159
His Highness said

933
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:10,000
you look cynical and

934
01:01:10,039 --> 01:01:12,039
act weird at ordinary times,

935
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,920
but by nature,

936
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,800
you care about your family and friends.

937
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,079
He said

938
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:18,239
he couldn't get it wrong.

939
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,800
He's quite confident.

940
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:25,400
The box has three layers in total.

941
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,440
I've been observing your hands.

942
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,639
I've measured your hand size in secret.

943
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:47,320
Okay.

944
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:48,880
I like it.

945
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,199
How could you

946
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:04,320
catch Fei Jie?

947
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,159
Mr. Fei is an expert
on poisons and poisoning.

948
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:10,159
Of course we couldn't catch him.

949
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,039
But everyone

950
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,519
has a soft spot.

951
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:16,079
Really?

952
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:20,679
I don't know

953
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:21,960
what his soft spot is.

954
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:26,039
Your Excellency Fan,

955
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:28,119
you're

956
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:29,480
Mr. Fei's soft spot.

957
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,840
Is this a threat?

958
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,559
His Highness treats Fan Xian
as a good friend.

959
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:40,559
Of course he wants to

960
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:41,599
take care of people around him.

961
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,519
What if I don't agree to support him?

962
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,559
His Highness
has been making preparations.

963
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:52,039
He's got lots of money

964
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,000
and some troops.

965
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,480
They'll be here tomorrow

966
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:58,760
to protect you on your way back.

967
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,760
Do you think how many soldiers you need

968
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,840
to kill me?

969
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,199
His Highness also wants to know

970
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,000
how many people need to die

971
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,280
before you regret

972
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,119
having made a wrong decision.

973
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,599
I'll come here again tomorrow.

974
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:19,519
I hope you can

975
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,440
give His Highness

976
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,480
a clear-cut answer by then.

977
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:24,440
If you say yes,

978
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,320
I'll protect you and make sure you
go back safe and sound.

979
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:28,679
If not,

980
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:30,480
I'll kill you.

981
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:36,679
Your Excellency.

982
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:52,320
What time is it?

983
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,440
I've no idea.

984
01:04:55,639 --> 01:04:56,480
It's not early, anyway.

985
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:01,400
Gao Da!

986
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,800
Form up and get ready to hit the road.

987
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:05,760
That's right.

988
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,239
I'm here to see you off.

989
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,119
You've thought about it for a night.

990
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,360
What's your choice?

991
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,280
Fan Sizhe is the legitimate child
of the Fan family.

992
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,920
If he dies,

993
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:37,719
my father won't leave it at that.

994
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,760
Mr. Fei serves as Director of the Third
Division of the Investigator's Office.

995
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,880
If he dies,

996
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:46,719
the Investigator's Office
won't let it go at that.

997
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:49,280
He doesn't dare

998
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,159
to kill the two of them.

999
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:55,519
So, what on earth

1000
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:56,320
is your choice?

1001
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,559
It's not about my choice,

1002
01:05:58,199 --> 01:05:59,559
but yours.

1003
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:01,199
You can

1004
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:03,840
kill all of us here!

1005
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:05,920
Then after you go back,

1006
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:07,760
all of you will be considered
betrayers of Nanqing.

1007
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,519
Your family will get into trouble

1008
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:09,719
and you'll never rise again.

1009
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:19,159
If you don't,

1010
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,159
you'll have to helplessly watch me

1011
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:23,239
go back.

1012
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,679
As for the things
he asked you to take to me,

1013
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:29,960
I'll give them back to him one by one.

1014
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:36,519
And ask yourself

1015
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:40,119
if you're sure

1016
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:42,760
you can kill me.

1017
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:55,760
Your Excellency!

1018
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,360
Everything the Investigator's Office
has done

1019
01:07:16,159 --> 01:07:17,000
aims to prevent Nanqing

1020
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,960
from falling into turmoil.

1021
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:20,159
That's also my duty as long as I live.
