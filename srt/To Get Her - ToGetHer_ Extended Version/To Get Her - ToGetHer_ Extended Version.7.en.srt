1
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:05,862
Hee-young / But the fact that we're all doing this kart game together—

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:10,133
Hee-young / Just the experience itself was so much fun
Hee-young / Now that I've done it myself

3
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,168
Hee-young / I think I’ll want to do more of this in the future

4
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,036
Hee-young / If I get the chance

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,048
Seo-yeon / I thought everyone was crazy in love

6
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,385
Seo-yeon / Like, “They’re that crazy about love?”

7
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,410
Min-woo / But I was more blown away

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,156
Min-woo / By how into the game everyone was

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,589
Hee-young / When she whispered unexpected tips to me

10
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,834
Hee-young / It felt hot, not cold at all

11
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,604
Hee-young / Just the right side

12
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:41,941
Min-woo / Oh just here? Just this side felt warm
Hee-young / Yeah, this side was on fire

13
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:52,975
Min-woo / I thought doing leisure activities with total strangers

14
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:55,378
Min-woo / Would be too distracting

15
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,047
Min-woo / I had that kind of preconception

16
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,083
Hee-young / But I think that got totally broken

17
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:02,985
Min-woo / Yeah, my assumptions were totally challenged

18
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:07,500
Min-woo / Compared to quiet dates, this kind of thing

19
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:10,169
Min-woo / Helps you get to know someone better

20
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:14,330
Min-woo / It could be a great opportunity
Seo-yeon / Doing those kinds of activities

21
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,099
Seo-yeon / Kind of helps cover things up, don’t you think?

22
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,100
Seo-yeon / Like that awkwardness?

23
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,001
Hee-young / Yeah exactly
Min-woo / Totally, totally

24
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:21,637
Min-woo / I always thought one-on-one dates

25
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,316
Min-woo / Were the best kind

26
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,842
Min-woo / But doing something more spaced out like this

27
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:26,686
Min-woo / Feels even better

28
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,912
Hee-young / In a completely new setting

29
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:33,416
Hee-young / You get to see sides of them you wouldn’t normally see

30
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,584
Min-woo / So true

31
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,488
Min-woo / Talking together, then staying in separate rooms

32
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,367
Min-woo / You can’t really know someone in just a few days...

33
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,893
Hee-young / The way people play games

34
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:46,462
Hee-young / Says a lot about them

35
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:50,600
Min-woo / It’s not just about knowing the rules or winning or losing

36
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,502
Min-woo / It’s about how they take it in, you know?

37
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,448
Min-woo / You can really see their personality

38
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,041
Min-woo / For me, it was such a great experience

39
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:02,755
Min-woo / I liked this leisure activity the most

40
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,426
Min-woo / I feel like today was the real start for me
Seo-yeon / I think I’ll remember this for a long time

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,686
Hee-young / Hee-young was so cool and

42
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:12,221
Hee-young / Handled everything so well

43
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:14,367
Min-woo / It was kind of sexy

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,649
Min-woo / Oops, we came the wrong way...

45
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:31,707
Hee-young / Oh well, all roads lead somewhere

46
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:32,485
Min-woo / That’s true~

47
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,292
Min-woo / Oh, this way?

48
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,185
Hee-young / Wow, this road is so pretty though

49
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:42,995
Wow

50
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,065
Min-woo / Let’s go
Hee-young / I love it even more!

51
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,098
Hee-young / This road is seriously so nice

52
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:59,612
Hee-young / Total lucky find

53
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,506
Hee-young / Seriously, this road is gorgeous
Min-woo / So pretty, right?

54
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,741
Hee-young / I really love this peaceful vibe

55
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:08,244
Hee-young / I think I really needed some peace

56
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:14,383
Min-woo / I thought I was totally extroverted

57
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:16,853
Min-woo / Like I'd be similar to the others

58
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,489
Hee-young / Ah~ I see

59
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,902
Hee-young / Yeah, I could see how you’d think that when we first arrived

60
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:26,162
Hee-young / But all three of us were on max energy then

61
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,997
Hee-young / The girls were already so hyped

62
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:30,733
Hee-young / Yeah, and when we came in at first

63
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:34,337
Hee-young / The three of us in our room kinda drained the energy

64
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:38,851
Hee-young / And they had already gotten so close so fast

65
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,488
Min-woo / Yeah, exactly...

66
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:57,426
Seo-yeon / Sigh...

67
00:03:57,436 --> 00:04:01,073
Seo-yeon / I don’t think the four-person date was all that fun for me

68
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,867
Seo-yeon / There wasn’t really any romantic tension

69
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,736
Seo-yeon / Just...

70
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:11,183
Seo-yeon / I kept thinking about the two girls back at the house

71
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:20,326
Han-kyul / Hee-young was really incredible today

72
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:22,652
Han-kyul / I felt like I was just along for the ride

73
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:26,689
Han-kyul / So I kind of felt guilty the whole time

74
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,492
Han-kyul / I was worried I’d come across as totally useless

75
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:32,828
Han-kyul / Honestly, I was a bit scared at first

76
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:35,808
Han-kyul / And I actually was bad at it

77
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,294
Min-woo / So we’re supposed to go in, right?

78
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,666
Hee-young / Nice driving
Min-woo / Cool, huh?

79
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:38,704
Seo-yeon / Oh wow, that’s pretty

80
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:50,973
Seo-yeon / What are you gonna make?

81
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,084
Han-kyul / That cup

82
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:54,376
Seo-yeon / Cup? What kind of cup?

83
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:59,949
Han-kyul / Hmm... just something simple and basic

84
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,193
Han-kyul / Like this one?

85
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,365
Min-woo / What about you?

86
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:09,969
Hee-young / Me...

87
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,073
Hee-young / I like drinking stuff, so maybe a cup?

88
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:16,298
Min-woo / I feel like you’d like something like this

89
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:19,144
Min-woo / Something cute and charming

90
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,048
Hee-young / I actually prefer more traditional styles

91
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,317
Hee-young / But I like this too, yeah

92
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:36,352
Han-kyul / Ugh, I’m doomed

93
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:40,332
Han-kyul / I’m failing at appealing my charm everywhere

94
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:44,526
Han-kyul / I’m bad at this and now I’m failing at this too?

95
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:51,110
Han-kyul / I’m in big trouble

96
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:56,115
Seo-yeon / Vase... a vase...

97
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:06,925
Seo-yeon / I think I’ll make this one

98
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:13,399
Seo-yeon / I want to use this chance to give a gift

99
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,836
Seo-yeon / I’m planning to give it to Da-gyo as a present

100
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,437
Min-woo / Isn’t this cute?
Hee-young / Oh this? I told you to go with this one

101
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:31,707
Min-woo / Okay okay, got it
Hee-young / It goes with everything, even at home

102
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,152
Min-woo / Okay okay

103
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:06,785
Seo-yeon / How do you wear this?

104
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,689
Min-woo / Oh okay okay, that’s it

105
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,099
Min-woo / Hair, your hair

106
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,167
Min-woo / Arm

107
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:29,875
Min-woo / Hey
Seo-yeon / Is that wrong?

108
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,171
Seo-yeon / Thanks

109
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:36,915
Min-woo / Hair, your hair

110
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,285
Seo-yeon / Thank you~

111
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:46,682
Min-woo / I’m looking forward to that one

112
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,127
Min-woo / How is she gonna make it?

113
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:16,755
Seo-yeon / My hair’s getting in the way...

114
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:30,135
Hee-young / Have you ever made pottery before?
Min-woo / It’s my first time

115
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,272
Han-kyul / I’ve never done anything like this before

116
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,366
Min-woo / You’re doing great~

117
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,801
Hee-young / Hm?

118
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:39,878
Min-woo / When did you flatten it like that?

119
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,815
Min-woo / How are you so good at everything? How do you do this?

120
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:47,519
Hee-young / When you want to raise it up, press a little more here

121
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:52,724
Min-woo / Hee-young looked so good doing pottery

122
00:09:53,358 --> 00:09:57,529
Min-woo / I was surprised by how talented she is in so many ways

123
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,398
Min-woo / She was really cool

124
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:07,339
Han-kyul / Hee-young is seriously good at everything

125
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:10,008
Han-kyul / I totally spaced out watching her piece

126
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,811
Han-kyul / She was really good at it

127
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,637
Min-woo / You have to press a bit, right?
Hee-young / Yeah, lightly?

128
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:17,916
Hee-young / Yeah, lightly?

129
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:24,056
Han-kyul / What do I do with this

130
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,127
Han-kyul / Wait, even this part... ugh...

131
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,730
Han-kyul / I don’t think I can do this either

132
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,360
Min-woo / Unnie, while watching this

133
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,828
Min-woo / Yours turned weird too

134
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:42,664
Seo-yeon / Oh no no no, I must be going crazy

135
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:46,912
Min-woo / Yours turned weird too
Seo-yeon / Oh no no no, I must be going crazy
Han-kyul / I think it’s gaining a soul of its own

136
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,708
Seo-yeon / Honestly, with pottery

137
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,409
Seo-yeon / I thought I’d be pretty good at it

138
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:56,154
Seo-yeon / But it was a disaster

139
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:59,524
Seo-yeon / It was actually really hard

140
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:03,619
Seo-yeon / At first I thought, “Maybe I’ll make one as a gift”

141
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,664
Seo-yeon / That was my plan

142
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:08,390
Seo-yeon / But I gave up

143
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,837
Min-woo / Seriously, what kind of pottery turns out like this

144
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,374
Han-kyul / How do I fix this? Can it even be saved?

145
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:31,580
Min-woo / Oh no
Han-kyul / What should I do

146
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,358
Min-woo / Wait, your hand! Keep your hand in!

147
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:38,230
Min-woo / No no, you got this, hold on

148
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,733
Han-kyul / You should probably go work on yours...

149
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,959
Min-woo / No, I really want to fix this one

150
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,161
Min-woo / I seriously just want to restore this
Han-kyul / I’m basically doing a mud mask now

151
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:46,905
Han-kyul / A clay mask

152
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:48,964
Min-woo / This is totally unpredictable

153
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:53,645
Min-woo / I’m just sticking my hand into this dried-up clay again and again

154
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,082
Min-woo / And I keep noticing little things

155
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:00,452
Min-woo / Han-kyul is someone who keeps catching my attention

156
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,127
Min-woo / That’s way better now, right? What do you think?

157
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,730
Han-kyul / I feel like I’m going to ruin it again

158
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:17,002
Min-woo / But do you really have to follow the shape exactly?
Han-kyul / Can’t I just leave it like this and call it done?

159
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:20,562
Min-woo / Let go of the idea that it has to be a “perfect” pottery piece

160
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:24,810
Hee-young / Try finding peace in this moment
Han-kyul / I’ll just let it harden as-is

161
00:12:24,843 --> 00:12:28,547
Min-woo / Just go with the flow, seriously

162
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,210
Han-kyul / That was another moment when

163
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,422
Han-kyul / I felt like I messed up

164
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:43,952
Han-kyul / Up until then, it kind of felt like

165
00:12:43,962 --> 00:12:47,889
Han-kyul / She might actually see me as someone she could date

166
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:49,524
Han-kyul / I thought I was getting those signals

167
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:53,228
Han-kyul / But after that, she just started treating me like I was cute

168
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:54,539
Han-kyul / Like a baby

169
00:13:05,884 --> 00:13:08,320
Min-woo / What is that now?

170
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,993
Han-kyul / I switched mine to a bowl

171
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:16,785
Min-woo / Huh?
Han-kyul / A bowl

172
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,186
Min-woo / You just pressed it like that?

173
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:19,231
Min-woo / You just pressed it?
Han-kyul / Yeah

174
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:25,037
Seo-yeon / Everyone’s struggling in their own way lol

175
00:13:25,537 --> 00:13:28,040
Min-woo / Someone save me

176
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,276
Min-woo / Can someone please help me out

177
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,854
Min-woo / You’ve got strong hands

178
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,793
Min-woo / Still, it’s better than before

179
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,163
Min-woo / Thank you, thank you

180
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:59,204
Min-woo / This one looks the most like actual pottery

181
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:18,847
Min-woo / Mine looks the best

182
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:20,459
Seo-yeon / What are you even saying?

183
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,828
Seo-yeon / Honestly, the nicest one is...

184
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,289
Seo-yeon / Hee-young’s is the prettiest
Min-woo / We have to take a photo of this

185
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,536
Hee-young / Yeah, let’s take pictures
Min-woo / It’s just too funny

186
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,238
Let’s take one of each person’s

187
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:35,073
Seo-yeon / Take them and send them to everyone

188
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:47,819
Hee-young / Now we all need to gather

189
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,678
Hee-young / Do you know how to do that thing?

190
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:50,355
Min-woo / The MZ thing?

191
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,092
Hee-young / Just put your hand here

192
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,862
Min-woo / Ah yeah I know what you mean

193
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:16,381
Mi-rang / I’m so curious, who picked who?

194
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,516
Ri-won / How did they even...

195
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,251
Mi-rang / How did it end up with 8 people...

196
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:21,776
Ri-won / Let’s all guess once everyone’s back

197
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:23,078
Mi-rang / Let’s play a game

198
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,514
Ri-won / We’ll use an A4 paper and guess who picked who

199
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:26,214
Mi-rang / Ooh I like that

200
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,627
Ri-won / Sounds fun, right?

201
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:33,221
Da-gyo / I’m just kind of curious

202
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:34,166
Jin-ah / About what?

203
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:39,261
Da-gyo / What I’m curious about is—

204
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,830
Da-gyo / Are you totally fixed on Hee-young right now?

205
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,564
Da-gyo / Like, completely?

206
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,733
Jin-ah / Yeah, I was. I even told her yesterday

207
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:47,102
Jin-ah / That I wanted to get to know her more

208
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,171
Da-gyo / And you have no regrets about not exploring anyone else?

209
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:49,638
Da-gyo / That’s what I was wondering

210
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,839
Da-gyo / That’s what I was wondering
Jin-ah / Yeah, I’m okay with it

211
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:51,306
Da-gyo / Oh really?

212
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:53,041
Jin-ah / That’s how I’ve felt all along, but now—

213
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:54,910
Da-gyo / Then maybe you should go more all-in

214
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,689
Da-gyo / How about having a deeper talk about it, just the two of you?

215
00:15:57,722 --> 00:15:59,981
Jin-ah / The thing is, she keeps saying

216
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:02,294
Jin-ah / “We’re here to get to know everyone”

217
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,386
Da-gyo / But I think maybe she’s just being careful...

218
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,987
Da-gyo / I think you're too worried about burdening her

219
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:07,999
Da-gyo / You might be able to let go of that worry a bit

220
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,358
Da-gyo / Based on what I heard yesterday

221
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:11,503
Da-gyo / I think she’s actually...

222
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,295
Jin-ah / Okay okay

223
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,639
Jin-ah / Okay okay
Da-gyo / So let that go and...

224
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,632
Da-gyo / From what I see, you’re not even—

225
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:19,334
Da-gyo / Wait, are you about to cry?

226
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:20,669
Da-gyo / But seriously

227
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,238
Da-gyo / You're thinking way too much like—

228
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,473
Da-gyo / “What if I’m coming on too strong?”

229
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:27,509
Da-gyo / But it’s really not something to worry about

230
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,911
Jin-ah / Really? I guess I’m just kind of scared

231
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:31,590
Da-gyo / Yeah, I think that’s it

232
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,683
Da-gyo / To me, it seems like you two are really—

233
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,650
Jin-ah / Just fumbling around?

234
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,553
Da-gyo / If I’m being honest, yeah, you kind of are

235
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:41,489
Da-gyo / A little bit of a mess

236
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:43,959
Da-gyo / I really think the two of you should

237
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,428
Da-gyo / Have a serious conversation

238
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,597
Da-gyo / You should try to let go of that pressure

239
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,865
Da-gyo / Even just a little bit

240
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:55,237
Da-gyo / I know things are messy and tangled, but—
Jin-ah / You're so mature, Da-gyo

241
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,315
Da-gyo / The most important thing is

242
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,208
Da-gyo / That you do what you really want

243
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:01,910
Da-gyo / Without worrying about what others think

244
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,788
Da-gyo / I just want you to express your feelings somehow

245
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,549
Jin-ah / Why are you laughing? Tell me too

246
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,717
Da-gyo / It’s just funny

247
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,395
Da-gyo / It’s just funny
Jin-ah / Tell me, I wanna know too

248
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:15,557
Da-gyo / Today, you two should just go out

249
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:19,194
Da-gyo / Open that door, go out to the terrace

250
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:23,241
Da-gyo / And just talk for a bit

251
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,279
Ri-won / What are you doing?

252
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:30,972
Ri-won / Don’t tell me you’re eating ramen again?

253
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:33,952
Mi-rang / No
Ri-won / Gosh, I’m so sick of ramen

254
00:17:34,185 --> 00:17:36,311
Mi-rang / I’m curious who wrote down what

255
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,346
Ri-won / Me? I don’t know

256
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:41,283
Mi-rang / No way, you stuck with that same person?

257
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,184
Ri-won / What?
Mi-rang / The person you liked from the beginning?

258
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:44,185
Ri-won / And who would that be?

259
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:47,165
Mi-rang / Isn’t it the person you’re rooming with?

260
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,125
Ri-won / I don’t know

261
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:52,527
Mi-rang / Come on
Ri-won / Okay okay

262
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:53,762
Ri-won / Alright, alright

263
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,006
Mi-rang / You really don’t know?

264
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,034
Mi-rang / You’re the only one who doesn’t know, everyone else is guessing

265
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,569
Ri-won / You’re curious?

266
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:04,105
Ri-won / I actually know

267
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:04,906
Mi-rang / Who is it?

268
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,809
Ri-won / Da-gyo and I picked each other

269
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:09,187
Ri-won / We matched, but today—

270
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:13,281
Ri-won / Someone else picked you, Mi-rang

271
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,051
Mi-rang / Me? I doubt it

272
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,830
Mi-rang / It’s not me, but maybe someone... like Da-gyo—

273
00:18:19,197 --> 00:18:22,467
Ri-won / Yesterday, you got two notes, Mi-rang

274
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:23,725
Ri-won / One was from Da-gyo

275
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,804
Ri-won / And one was from someone else who likes you

276
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,462
Ri-won / So two people

277
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:30,732
Ri-won / And today that person picked you again

278
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:34,169
Ri-won / But Da-gyo ended up becoming a couple with someone

279
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,480
Ri-won / So the other one wrote your name again

280
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:39,441
Mi-rang / But I really have no idea who that second person is

281
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,386
Ri-won / That’s possible if they’re not making it obvious

282
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,247
Ri-won / If they’re not showing it, of course you wouldn’t know

283
00:18:46,257 --> 00:18:47,525
Mi-rang / Is it you?

284
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:51,663
Mi-rang / Nope, you’re not allowed

285
00:18:52,964 --> 00:18:54,489
Mi-rang / Do you want to go on a date with me?

286
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,601
Mi-rang / Don’t say “nope”

287
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:02,597
Mi-rang / Huh? That smile means something...

288
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:04,733
Ri-won / That was just hilarious

289
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,836
Ri-won / I seriously didn’t expect you to say that

290
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:08,646
Ri-won / It cracked me up

291
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:12,507
Mi-rang / Suspicious! Is it you?

292
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:15,944
Ri-won / Wh-what?
Mi-rang / You don’t even know yourself, right?

293
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,812
Mi-rang / Hey, is it me?

294
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:19,691
Ri-won / Who knows?

295
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:28,356
Mi-rang / I’m dying to know who everyone picked

296
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,325
Mi-rang / I don't think it's me  

297
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,260
Ri-won / Well, I mean—  

298
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,228
Mi-rang / Who is it?  

299
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,597
Mi-rang / Just give me a hint—is it someone from this room or the other?  

300
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:39,544
Ri-won / I’ve told you before  

301
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:40,735
Ri-won / It’s from this room  

302
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:42,670
Mi-rang / Oh right  

303
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,382
Ri-won / But you still never know for sure  

304
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,642
Mi-rang / Must’ve been tough going on that date then  

305
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:50,145
Ri-won / I mean...  

306
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,615
Mi-rang / Oh no... tears incoming  

307
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,449
Ri-won / No, no  

308
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:59,320
Mi-rang / What? Should I give you a chance to cry?
Ri-won / I’d never cry  

309
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,389
Mi-rang / Your eyes look glossy right now  

310
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:02,957
Ri-won / Mine?  

311
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:06,628
Mi-rang / Honestly, I think staying in here is better  

312
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:09,741
Mi-rang / Or do you think going out on a different date would be better?  

313
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:13,368
Ri-won / If we go out...  

314
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,970
Ri-won / If the doenjang jjigae tastes good, we could just stay here  

315
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,771
Ri-won / I think they'd like it  

316
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:17,872
Mi-rang / Doenjang jjigae?  

317
00:20:17,882 --> 00:20:19,474
Mi-rang / I'm not making doenjang jjigae right now though  

318
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,943
Ri-won / Huh? It’s not? The ingredients looked like it  

319
00:20:21,953 --> 00:20:26,024
Mi-rang / I just grabbed whatever was lying around  

320
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:29,317
Mi-rang / I was thinking maybe egg soup  

321
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:30,118
Ri-won / Sounds good  

322
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,720
Mi-rang / And we’ve got Spam, so with Spam—  

323
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,333
Mi-rang / Since there’s four of us  

324
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,502
Ri-won / Cooking here isn't easy with so many people  

325
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:48,847
Enjoy your meal  

326
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:50,448
Thank you, Chef  

327
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:52,250
Jin-ah / Thank you, Chef  

328
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,590
Da-gyo / Mi-rang cut it on purpose  

329
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,548
Da-gyo / I seriously love this soup  

330
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:01,893
Jin-ah / Yeah, the soup’s really good  

331
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:04,352
Mi-rang / Thanks  
Jin-ah / The soup’s honestly so good  

332
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:07,522
Jin-ah / I’m really liking this little “baby date” of the baby team  

333
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,389
Da-gyo / Baby date?  

334
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:09,901
Jin-ah / I love just chilling at home during the day  

335
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,092
Da-gyo / Just being inside somewhere warm like this  

336
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:11,970
Just being somewhere warm  

337
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:15,340
Da-gyo / And just looking at the weather outside is perfect  

338
00:21:15,473 --> 00:21:16,364
Jin-ah / This isn’t even a date  

339
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:19,067
Jin-ah / You can see the windmill from here  
Ri-won / It’s a home date today  

340
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:19,834
Jin-ah / The seaside windmill  

341
00:21:19,844 --> 00:21:21,569
Jin-ah / I like home dates  

342
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:23,348
Jin-ah / What do you think the others are doing?  

343
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,073
Da-gyo / Yeah I’m curious too  

344
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,642
Ri-won / Probably eating something tasty  
Jin-ah / Right  

345
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:29,210
Ri-won / Probably went somewhere with a good vibe  

346
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,755
Jin-ah / Is it better to eat something tasty with four people?  

347
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:32,814
Jin-ah / Or with just two?  

348
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:33,648
Ri-won / I prefer two  

349
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:34,459
Jin-ah / Me too  

350
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,693
Da-gyo / Two is definitely better  

351
00:21:35,793 --> 00:21:37,352
Ri-won / That’s why I wanted to go on a date too  

352
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:38,353
Ri-won / But I’m not really jealous  

353
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,788
Ri-won / Since it’s a group date with four people, I’m not envious  

354
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,525
Jin-ah / I thought Da-gyo and I had turned into fools after three days  

355
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,526
Jin-ah / The two of us kept—  

356
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:45,593
Jin-ah / What was it?  

357
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:46,304
What?  

358
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,797
Jin-ah / I mean, we didn’t even realize that  

359
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:53,444
Jin-ah / Everyone’s date picks were so tangled up  

360
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,069
Da-gyo / We didn’t know  

361
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:58,039
Da-gyo / We didn’t really get how complicated things were  
Ri-won / We need to do it right after we eat  

362
00:21:58,049 --> 00:21:59,841
Ri-won / Try to guess who picked who  

363
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,410
Ri-won / I haven’t really talked to Hee-young  

364
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,023
Ri-won / So I have no idea who she picked  

365
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,583
Ri-won / I can’t guess her at all  

366
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,518
Mi-rang / I can’t read Han-kyul either  

367
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:11,920
Jin-ah / Me too  
Da-gyo / Same  

368
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,398
Ri-won / Yeah, I don’t know about Han-kyul either  

369
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,890
Jin-ah / Can’t we just guess while eating? That might be easier  

370
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,592
Jin-ah / I want it to feel more casual  
Mi-rang / Yeah, like just talking it out  

371
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,894
Jin-ah / I’ll just say it instead of writing  
Mi-rang / Can’t we just say it without writing?  

372
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,231
Ri-won / Sure, let’s do that then  

373
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:24,776
Ri-won / I’ll go first  

374
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,367
Ri-won / In my opinion—  

375
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:27,178
Da-gyo / Wait, while eating?  

376
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,404
Ri-won / Da-gyo and Mi-rang picked each other  

377
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,316
Jin-ah / That’s what I thought too  
Ri-won / Yeah, so let’s go with that  

378
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:33,685
Ri-won / This is just Ri-won’s guess, okay?  

379
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:36,888
Da-gyo / Write “Ri-won’s guess” at the top  
Ri-won / I’ll label it as my guess, got it?  

380
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,480
Ri-won / Jin-ah picked Da-gyo—wait no no  

381
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,658
Ri-won / Jin-ah picked Mi-rang  

382
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:42,860
Jin-ah / I could’ve picked Da-gyo too  

383
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:46,387
Ri-won / Should I write down Hee-young here?  

384
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:48,756
Jin-ah / Yeah, go ahead  

385
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:50,335
Da-gyo / You're so thorough  

386
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:51,903
Ri-won / Then there's Seo-yeon  

387
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:54,062
Jin-ah / Wait, do you really think Seo-yeon picked Hee-young?  

388
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,039
Ri-won / Yeah  

389
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,475
Jin-ah / I was thinking someone totally different  

390
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,777
Ri-won / I seriously have zero info on Hee-young  

391
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:02,246
Ri-won / And here’s Han-kyul  

392
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,238
Jin-ah / You’re drawing an arrow to Han-kyul?  

393
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:05,516
Ri-won / No, Han-kyul to Hee-young  

394
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:10,121
Ri-won / I think Seo-yeon might’ve picked Da-gyo  

395
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,991
Jin-ah / Wow, your guess is totally different from mine  

396
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,684
Ri-won / Min-woo picked Han-kyul  

397
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:18,052
Jin-ah / Really? That’s so unexpected  

398
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:20,098
Jin-ah / I have no idea about Min-woo at all  

399
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:23,057
Jin-ah / Do you not want to say?  

400
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:25,536
Ri-won / But everyone already knows  
Jin-ah / I don’t  

401
00:23:27,238 --> 00:23:29,474
Jin-ah / Ah...  

402
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,377
Jin-ah / That’s it  

403
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,245
Da-gyo / Did you pick Han-kyul, Ri-won?  

404
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,780
Ri-won / Come on, you all know anyway  

405
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,305
Jin-ah / We really are clueless  

406
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,284
Da-gyo / I didn’t know  
Mi-rang / I kept saying it wasn’t true  

407
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:43,554
Ri-won / I didn’t say no, I said “We don’t know, right?”  

408
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:46,214
Da-gyo / Then you must’ve been really nervous today  

409
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:47,348
Jin-ah / Because you were with her?  

410
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:48,292
Da-gyo / No, not that  

411
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,451
Da-gyo / Because they didn’t bump into each other  

412
00:23:50,461 --> 00:23:52,353
Da-gyo / You probably worried when she didn’t show up  

413
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:55,867
Ri-won / I was so shocked I was about to go find her  

414
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,226
Jin-ah / Can we open these and see the results?  

415
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,962
Jin-ah / I want to compare  
Ri-won / Yeah we’re gonna open them, go ahead  

416
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,441
Mi-rang / But are we writing our own names too?  

417
00:24:03,574 --> 00:24:04,265
Ri-won / Yeah  

418
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:05,533
Mi-rang / Let’s skip writing our own  

419
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:07,211
Jin-ah / That’s up to you  
Ri-won / What? I already did  

420
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,710
Jin-ah / I already made my guesses earlier  

421
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,011
Jin-ah / But they’re so different  

422
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:17,822
Jin-ah / Anyway, I think—  

423
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,918
Jin-ah / I actually thought—  

424
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:25,853
Jin-ah / Park Hee-young  

425
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:28,733
Jin-ah / Picked Seo-yeon 

426
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:31,169
Jin-ah / Because the two of them talked a lot yesterday  

427
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:33,571
Jin-ah / They really chatted a lot here too  

428
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:37,732
Jin-ah / Han-kyul is a total mystery  

429
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:41,813
Jin-ah / And I can’t say anything about Ri-won because I know  

430
00:24:42,213 --> 00:24:45,283
Jin-ah / I had no idea about Min-woo either  

431
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,008
Jin-ah / I literally knew nothing  

432
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,743
Da-gyo / What?  

433
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,556
Jin-ah / That’s how I thought about Ri-won  

434
00:24:52,423 --> 00:24:53,491
Jin-ah / But then again—  

435
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:56,584
Jin-ah / With that “falls at first sight” vibe  

436
00:24:56,594 --> 00:24:58,853
Jin-ah / On the first day, Seo-yeon  

437
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:02,590
Jin-ah / She seemed really cheerful at first, then suddenly became calm  

438
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,303
Jin-ah / If that’s the reason someone fell for her  

439
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,864
Jin-ah / Then that’s how I made my guess  

440
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:13,845
Da-gyo / What I know is that Seo-yeon picked me  

441
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,873
Da-gyo / Because she came at me so confidently  

442
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,742
Da-gyo / But unnie misunderstood the rules too  

443
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:22,643
Da-gyo / She thought she could go out with the person she picked today  

444
00:25:22,653 --> 00:25:23,411
Da-gyo / So she told me  

445
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,813
Da-gyo / “Guess we’re going on a date today”  

446
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:27,715
Da-gyo / She said that to me  

447
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:29,584
Da-gyo / So I was like “Oh!”  

448
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:30,685
Da-gyo / Oh~  

449
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,996
Jin-ah / This girl?  
Da-gyo / This girl??  

450
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:32,987
Ri-won / That’s hilarious  

451
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:35,723
Da-gyo / That’s how it went, but then at that moment—  

452
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:38,926
Da-gyo / Was it Mi-rang and Min-woo?  

453
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:41,929
Da-gyo / Their result came out, so  

454
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:44,242
Da-gyo / They said “Let’s redo the match”  

455
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:45,777
Da-gyo / Like a rematch  

456
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,311
Jin-ah / We thought it was all finalized  

457
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,405
Da-gyo / So suddenly—bam!  

458
00:25:51,415 --> 00:25:52,607
Ri-won / This is so entertaining  

459
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:53,374
Da-gyo / Total mood drop  

460
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:55,887
Da-gyo / But now I get it  

461
00:25:58,422 --> 00:25:59,147
Jin-ah / And then?  

462
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:02,727
Da-gyo / I’m guessing Jin-ah picked Hee-young  

463
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,454
Jin-ah / Maybe  
Ri-won / Your thinking is so different from mine  

464
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,133
Da-gyo / I thought Ri-won picked me  

465
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,503
Ri-won / What? Wait a second  

466
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,442
Da-gyo / Because we actually talked a bit too  

467
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:21,302
Jin-ah / Da-gyo is seriously such a grown-up  

468
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,671
Jin-ah / Like, at first Hee-young and I went on a date  

469
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:26,073
Da-gyo / And I honestly can’t say anything right now  

470
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,375
Da-gyo / Because this whole situation between them—  

471
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,910
Da-gyo / I’m hearing both sides  

472
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,145
Jin-ah / And she’s not even passing that along  

473
00:26:31,155 --> 00:26:33,057
Jin-ah / That’s why I can really immerse myself in this  

474
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,516
Jin-ah / I’ve been honest about being confused too  

475
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:36,784
Da-gyo / That’s why I can’t make any predictions now  

476
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:38,462
Da-gyo / I don’t think this match-up makes sense  

477
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:40,988
Jin-ah / Right, the whole pairing—  

478
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:43,201
Jin-ah / The “baby and self” pairing doesn’t mean anything  

479
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:45,870
Da-gyo / I thought the matchups here meant something  
Jin-ah / Nope, they don’t  

480
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:51,943
Da-gyo / So I was like “Who would’ve picked me from here?”  

481
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,701
Da-gyo / What? What’s with that laugh, Wi-rang?  

482
00:26:53,711 --> 00:26:55,213
Da-gyo / I didn’t mean Mi-rang  

483
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:02,476
Jin-ah / So that’s how things got tangled up  

484
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:04,856
Ri-won / It’s because no one really understood the rules  

485
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:06,791
Jin-ah / But I find that part fun too  

486
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,192
Da-gyo / I misunderstood a bit, because—  

487
00:27:08,492 --> 00:27:10,017
Da-gyo / Earlier while cooking  

488
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:11,853
Da-gyo / I got a little closer to Ri-won  

489
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,222
Da-gyo / So I wanted to ask, “Did you by chance pick me?”  

490
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:17,091
Da-gyo / But I didn’t want to overthink it and be weird, you know?  

491
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:20,137
Da-gyo / You get what I’m saying, right?  

492
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:21,362
Ri-won / That’s kinda cute  

493
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:22,330
Da-gyo / We barely talked though  

494
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,898
Da-gyo / So if you had picked me it’d be kinda funny  

495
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,368
Ri-won / The person I talked to the least is definitely you, Da-gyo  

496
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:28,179
Ri-won / Hee-young and me, these two  

497
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,638
Jin-ah / Sorry, I misunderstood  

498
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,450
Da-gyo / Oh, so there was no meaning to that  

499
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,176
Da-gyo / I kept thinking something didn’t add up  

500
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,153
Jin-ah / Who else?  

501
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,679
Da-gyo / I have no clue about Min-woo  

502
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:40,915
Da-gyo / And Han-kyul...  

503
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:41,916
Da-gyo / I’m not sure about her either  

504
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:45,720
Jin-ah / We haven’t talked much with them  
Da-gyo / Yeah, I didn’t talk to Min-woo or Han-kyul  

505
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,921
Da-gyo / Who else is left?  

506
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,500
Jin-ah / The one next to you  

507
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,492
Da-gyo / I’m really sorry  

508
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:54,228
Da-gyo / I mean, I can’t say “of course” about Mi-rang  

509
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:56,964
Jin-ah / You probably picked her  
Da-gyo / Our date yesterday was nice  

510
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:57,775
Da-gyo / It’s hot  

511
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:00,878
Jin-ah / I think you guessed right  

512
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,745
Mi-rang / I feel like Min-woo  

513
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,157
Da-gyo / I really don’t know about Min-woo  
Mi-rang / Might have picked Seo-yeon  

514
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:17,161
Mi-rang / Since she already had a date with Han-kyul  
Jin-ah / You think she picked Seo-yeon?  

515
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,421
Da-gyo / You’d know better, being roommates  
Jin-ah / Next one  

516
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:23,758
Jin-ah / I thought so too actually  

517
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,593
Da-gyo / Huh? Suddenly?  

518
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,828
Ri-won / No switching your answers now  

519
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:29,363
Da-gyo / Acting sharp all of a sudden  
Jin-ah / It’s my power  

520
00:28:29,373 --> 00:28:30,441
Da-gyo / Using someone else’s idea  

521
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,266
Ri-won / Well, since she worked hard, let’s let this one slide  

522
00:28:32,276 --> 00:28:33,167
Ri-won / But not from now on  

523
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:33,901
Jin-ah / Okay  

524
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:35,436
Jin-ah / I like being given a pass like that  

525
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:38,005
Ri-won / You earned it for today  

526
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:41,943
Mi-rang / Honestly, I also think Seo-yeon  

527
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:43,354
Mi-rang / Picked Da-gyo  

528
00:28:43,754 --> 00:28:46,213
Jin-ah / You could feel that, huh? Next one  

529
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:48,516
Mi-rang / I wasn’t sure about Da-gyo actually  

530
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,327
Jin-ah / Then let’s do this  

531
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,887
Mi-rang / I thought she might’ve picked someone else  

532
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:57,892
Mi-rang / And that someone could’ve been Hee-young  

533
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,427
Ri-won / You think Da-gyo picked Hee-young?  

534
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,661
Jin-ah / This is fun  

535
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:05,376
Da-gyo / This is seriously funny  

536
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:07,234
Jin-ah / Don’t react to this  

537
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:08,769
Da-gyo / Got it  
Ri-won / This is so funny  

538
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:12,406
Mi-rang / I really have no clue about Hee-young  
Da-gyo / What about Ri-won?  

539
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,818
Da-gyo / Since you’re right here  

540
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:17,955
Mi-rang / Hmm... Ri-won picked Min-woo  

541
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,948
Mi-rang / That’s what I thought  

542
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:23,384
Mi-rang / Why else would she think of me as a rival?  

543
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,686
Jin-ah / Like, “Why treat me like a rival? I’m in love with her”  

544
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:27,631
Mi-rang / That’s the vibe I got  

545
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:29,690
Da-gyo / Wow, it really depends on the listener  

546
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,592
Da-gyo / Everyone interprets it so differently  

547
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:33,437
Jin-ah / I thought it meant the opposite  

548
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,462
Da-gyo / Same here  

549
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,730
Ri-won / I’m not that kind of person  

550
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,764
Ri-won / If Min-woo really saw me  

551
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:39,133
Ri-won / As a rival and acted like that  

552
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:42,613
Ri-won / I would’ve just let her win on purpose  

553
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,641
Jin-ah / I think I get you now, Ri-won  
Ri-won / That’s the kind of person I am  

554
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:51,345
Da-gyo / She really loves women  
Jin-ah / She’s such a great person  

555
00:29:51,355 --> 00:29:54,749
Ri-won / I probably acted like that on purpose  

556
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,559
Jin-ah / Jin-ah, Han-kyul is left  

557
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:58,486
Mi-rang / Honestly, I don’t think Jin-ah likes anyone right now  

558
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,087
Jin-ah / That’s actually a sharp guess  

559
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:03,657
Ri-won / Jin-ah’s in total fun mode  

560
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,971
Jin-ah / I... I’m emotionally broken, I don’t like anyone...  

561
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,734
Jin-ah / I gathered all these amazing women and still don’t like any of them  
Ri-won / None are her type  

562
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:17,915
Ri-won / There’s no one who can handle Kim Jin-ah  
Jin-ah / Thanks for saying that, that was fun  

563
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:22,219
Mi-rang / I think Han-kyul... maybe had something for Ri-won  

564
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:27,748
Jin-ah / Is it okay if I do this?  

565
00:30:27,758 --> 00:30:29,293
Jin-ah / Even if it stirs up trouble?  

566
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,152
Ri-won / Is this a Möbius strip?  
Jin-ah / Can I just try it once?  

567
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,229
Jin-ah / Just between us  

568
00:30:32,963 --> 00:30:33,998
Mi-rang / I don’t mind  

569
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:40,104
Da-gyo / You’re not gonna leave that till everyone comes, right?  

570
00:30:40,304 --> 00:30:40,828
Jin-ah / I kind of want to  
Ri-won / I will  

571
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:43,574
Jin-ah / I want to stir things up a bit  
Ri-won / Me too  

572
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:44,765
Ri-won / I’m leaving mine out  

573
00:30:44,775 --> 00:30:46,567
Da-gyo / I don’t want to leave mine out  

574
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:47,635
Jin-ah / That’s okay, just take yours out  

575
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,303
Jin-ah / Even that’s enough  
Ri-won / Take yours out  

576
00:30:49,313 --> 00:30:51,705
Ri-won / If you don’t want to leave it, then take it out  

577
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:53,751
Da-gyo / Maybe she mustered up courage to say it when no one was around  

578
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,976
Da-gyo / It might be hard to talk about later  

579
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:57,244
Da-gyo / You know what I mean?  

580
00:30:57,254 --> 00:30:58,679
Jin-ah / That makes sense  

581
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:00,124
Jin-ah / Because I’m just too...  

582
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,396
Jin-ah / Oh! That was really deep  

583
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,290
Da-gyo / Since it’s just us left here anyway  

584
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,025
Da-gyo / I just wanted to be honest  

585
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,527
Ri-won / Let those who want to leave it, leave it  

586
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:14,762
Ri-won / I think three is the perfect number  

587
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,541
Jin-ah / I really like that  

588
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,801
Jin-ah / I had so much fun doing this  

589
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:22,113
Jin-ah / Turns out I enjoy this kind of stuff  

590
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,275
Jin-ah / In that moment, it was fun  

591
00:31:28,285 --> 00:31:29,120
Jin-ah / But today overall  

592
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,513
Jin-ah / I spent a lot of time thinking about how I feel  

593
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,814
Jin-ah / And realized, “Ah, I’m like this”  

594
00:31:33,824 --> 00:31:37,551
Jin-ah / “So this is who I am” — that’s what today was like for me  

595
00:31:37,561 --> 00:31:41,355
Ri-won / “Does any of this even make sense?” That thought crossed my mind too  

596
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:43,357
Ri-won / It was just fun  

597
00:31:43,367 --> 00:31:47,138
Ri-won / It's not easy when everything’s this tangled up  

598
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,874
Ri-won / It’s fun  

599
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:55,836
Min-woo / Great job, everyone  
Seo-yeon / You worked hard  

600
00:31:55,846 --> 00:31:57,805
Min-woo / It wasn’t hard for me today  

601
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,140
Min-woo / I seriously had so much fun  
Hee-young / You worked so hard though  

602
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,809
Hee-young / And thanks for driving so well  

603
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:04,655
Hee-young / I'm really proud we won too  

604
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:07,224
Min-woo / Should we go in now with our heads held high?  

605
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,561
Min-woo / Let's go  
Hee-young / We’re the winners after all  

606
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,667
Hee-young / To building 2?  
Min-woo / Yeah  

607
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,261
Hee-young / Where should I throw this trash?  
Seo-yeon / I left mine in the car for now  

608
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:21,996
Hee-young / Really?  

609
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,797
Seo-yeon / Now I look like the weird one  
Hee-young / You left trash in the car?  

610
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:25,599
Hee-young / Why would you leave it there?  

611
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:27,768
Hee-young / We’re going to eat in there  

612
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:29,003
Min-woo / Still, it was fun, right?  

613
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,605
Han-kyul / Me? Honestly, I...  

614
00:32:31,615 --> 00:32:35,442
Han-kyul / Overall, today was just... ugh...  

615
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:38,445
Min-woo / You didn’t drift right, you were supposed to turn this way  

616
00:32:38,455 --> 00:32:41,549
Han-kyul / I kinda got lost  

617
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,960
Seo-yeon / We’re back  

618
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,052
Min-woo / We’re back  
Hee-young / We’re back  

619
00:32:45,062 --> 00:32:47,765
Min-woo / What? Why is no one here?  

620
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,461
Seo-yeon / What is this?  

621
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:56,774
Hee-young / What?  
Min-woo / Wait, what is this?  

622
00:32:56,974 --> 00:33:00,911
Seo-yeon / What is this?  
Hee-young / Are they guessing? Who guessed who?  

623
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,407
Hee-young / Are they seriously all guessing like this?  

624
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,475
Seo-yeon / Seriously, everyone...  

625
00:33:08,485 --> 00:33:10,945
Hee-young / Are they all crazy?  
Seo-yeon / Are they actually crazy?  

626
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,981
Hee-young / Are they insane?  

627
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,382
Hee-young / Are they kidding me?  

628
00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:17,895
Seo-yeon / Aren’t they all terrible at guessing though?  

629
00:33:22,733 --> 00:33:24,258
Han-kyul / But even from the beginning when the sketchbook was an object  

630
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:27,328
Han-kyul / I was already a little suspicious...  

631
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,630
Han-kyul / Hello  
Ri-won / I'm the only one here  

632
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,075
Seo-yeon / Get down here, hurry up and come down  

633
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,810
Han-kyul / Why are you alone?  

634
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,112
Hee-young / Where is everyone?  
Min-woo / Why are you the only one here, Ri-won?  

635
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:37,605
Ri-won / Either sleeping  

636
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:39,273
Ri-won / Or just resting  

637
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:40,084
Min-woo / Seriously?  

638
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:44,311
Seo-yeon / Did you like me? I had no idea  
Hee-young / Why is she acting like this all of a sudden?  

639
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:45,346
Ri-won / This is fun, right?  

640
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,247
Hee-young / They’re all crazy, we were making guesses  

641
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,315
Ri-won / Yeah, we were just guessing things  

642
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:50,551
Seo-yeon / Isn't this totally insane?  

643
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:53,587
Hee-young / Who’s the question mark?  
Ri-won / Did you think Seo-yeon picked Da-gyo?  

644
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:55,499
Seo-yeon / The one in the middle is a question mark? Oh, because you didn’t know?  

645
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:56,790
No  

646
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,194
Seo-yeon / I was drained and shocked because of that sketchbook  

647
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,929
Seo-yeon / Some people assumed I liked Da-gyo  

648
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:05,399
Seo-yeon / Apparently there were a few who thought that  

649
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:07,301
Ri-won / I don’t get Hee-young at all  

650
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,502
Hee-young / You don’t get me?  

651
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:11,081
Ri-won / Huh? If I don’t get someone, it’s usually Jin-ah  

652
00:34:11,782 --> 00:34:15,386
Hee-young / Well... maybe you really don’t get me  

653
00:34:17,454 --> 00:34:19,647
Han-kyul / Why am I the question mark on this one?  

654
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,126
Ri-won / Because we don’t know who you like  
Han-kyul / You really couldn’t guess?  

655
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:23,717
Seo-yeon / Really?  

656
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:25,296
Seo-yeon / I didn’t know  

657
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,272
Hee-young / Is that why you don’t like me?  

658
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,634
Ri-won / No, what are you talking about!  

659
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:42,636
Hee-young / So that’s what it was?  
Ri-won / I don’t know  

660
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:44,605
Hee-young / Right now...  
Ri-won / No, it’s not that  

661
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:45,839
Hee-young / We’re sisters  

662
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:47,708
Min-woo / Everyone's in a frenzy  

663
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:50,244
Hee-young / I just thought no one was interested in me  

664
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,879
Hee-young / I mean, I really thought no one here...  

665
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,191
Ri-won / You got a note yesterday, right? I didn’t see it  
Hee-young / I didn’t get anything  

666
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:56,750
Ri-won / Huh?  
Hee-young / I got zero  

667
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,385
Ri-won / What?  
Hee-young / Still zero for me  

668
00:34:58,395 --> 00:35:01,722
Ri-won / I’m actually shocked by that  
Seo-yeon / Yeah, that’s honestly shocking  

669
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:03,557
Ri-won / I thought you kept getting notes  

670
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:06,370
Hee-young / Nope, I was just sitting there, sucking my thumb  

671
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:10,230
Hee-young / Even though I kept going on dates with Jin-ah  

672
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,665
Hee-young / I thought I was showing interest  

673
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:13,834
Hee-young / So I figured we were getting to know each other  

674
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:15,803
Ri-won / That’s honestly so shocking  

675
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:18,372
Hee-young / But her words and actions started changing  

676
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,718
Hee-young / I’m like, “What am I supposed to do then?”  

677
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:24,678
Ri-won / I thought you were at least getting one or two every time  

678
00:35:24,688 --> 00:35:27,691
Ri-won / Consistently  
Han-kyul / Me too, I thought...  

679
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:30,651
Hee-young / I had already given up  

680
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:33,831
Hee-young / Because clearly, no one was interested in me  

681
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:37,634
Ri-won / No, that’s not true  

682
00:35:47,144 --> 00:35:48,369
Jin-ah / Even if my feelings change  

683
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,804
Jin-ah / There’s not enough time to get to know that new person  

684
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:52,082
Da-gyo / Oh, really?  

685
00:35:52,549 --> 00:35:55,309
Jin-ah / But I don’t think my heart will change anyway  

686
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,910
Jin-ah / So I actually feel really at ease  

687
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,947
Da-gyo / Unless I experience that situation myself  

688
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,415
Da-gyo / Even if it’s with someone else  

689
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,883
Da-gyo / I can’t know if I’ll waver or not  

690
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:05,753
Da-gyo / Unless I go through that with the person directly  

691
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:07,297
Da-gyo / It just doesn’t really hit me  

692
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:11,992
Jin-ah / But if the feeling is strong enough, you don’t need to go through it  

693
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:15,062
Da-gyo / A feeling strong enough that you don’t need to test it?  

694
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,864
Jin-ah / If you don’t have to, then don’t  

695
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,308
Da-gyo / Don’t go out of your way  

696
00:36:18,575 --> 00:36:20,734
Da-gyo / That’s why it’s hard for me too  

697
00:36:20,744 --> 00:36:23,804
Jin-ah / I feel like it is, but also kind of not  

698
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,340
Da-gyo / That’s the dilemma I need to decide on today  

699
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,819
Jin-ah / Yeah  

700
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,478
Jin-ah / Up until yesterday, I was confused  

701
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:34,681
Jin-ah / But my heart became really clear when I was texting  

702
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:35,482
Da-gyo / When you were texting?  

703
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:38,051
Jin-ah / When I was sending my message today  
Da-gyo / Today?  

704
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:42,589
Jin-ah / The feeling that I couldn’t even write another woman’s name  

705
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,991
Jin-ah / But until yesterday  

706
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,426
Jin-ah / I still felt kind of sorry  

707
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,895
Jin-ah / Since I hadn’t even sent a note, and all that  

708
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,264
Jin-ah / But today, that feeling of guilt is gone  

709
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,100
Jin-ah / Until yesterday, I wondered, “Does she not have feelings for me?”  

710
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,301
Jin-ah / “Does she want to get to know someone else?”  

711
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:55,536
Jin-ah / I had thoughts like that  

712
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,413
Jin-ah / But now I don’t care anymore  

713
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,039
Jin-ah / So it’s less about wanting to become a couple with you  

714
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:00,607
Da-gyo / Then haven’t you basically already made your decision?  

715
00:37:00,617 --> 00:37:01,575
Da-gyo / There's nothing to decide today then  

716
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:03,587
Jin-ah / Yeah, I guess that’s why I feel this way  

717
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:05,879
Hee-young / “I’m just going to show her how I feel first”  

718
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:07,681
Jin-ah / “You just go live your life freely”  

719
00:37:07,691 --> 00:37:09,149
Jin-ah / I didn’t want to say it in a mean way  

720
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:12,696
Jin-ah / So I was trying to say it in the prettiest way I could  

721
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,661
Hee-young / I’m back  

722
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:22,729
Da-gyo / Hee-young  

723
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,007
Da-gyo / Hey  

724
00:37:26,343 --> 00:37:28,502
Da-gyo / Huh? That’s what you did?  

725
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,948
Hee-young / I just went over there to drop off my clothes  

726
00:37:33,717 --> 00:37:35,809
Da-gyo / What did you do?  

727
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:36,944
Hee-young / I made pottery  

728
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:39,780
Da-gyo / Oh really? That sounds fun  

729
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,650
Hee-young / I’d always wanted to try it but it was my first time  

730
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,796
Da-gyo / I was going to say, “Do you work with your hands?”  

731
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:48,755
Da-gyo / Non-stop interrogation  

732
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:51,925
Hee-young / It was my first time, so I thought it’d be easy  

733
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:55,172
Hee-young / But keeping the balance perfectly was so hard  

734
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:16,250
Min-woo / What’s going on  

735
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,261
Mi-rang / I just got back from the convenience store  

736
00:38:17,294 --> 00:38:19,119
Seo-yeon / Really?  
Ri-won / By yourself?  

737
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:22,422
Min-woo / Oh, probably for dinner  
Ri-won / You went grocery shopping  

738
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:24,124
Seo-yeon / Whoa, you really bought Together ice cream  

739
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:26,670
Min-woo / It's chicken breast  

740
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,564
Ri-won / Whoa, is that puffed rice?  

741
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,266
Mi-rang / Not quite, but I bought something similar  

742
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:35,579
Mi-rang / And since we’re in Jeju  

743
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,405
Mi-rang / We had to have a drink of makgeolli  
Ri-won / I’m drinking starting tonight  

744
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:40,183
Min-woo / Oh, this Hallabong makgeolli  

745
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:42,042
Min-woo / You can only get it in Jeju  

746
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,877
Min-woo / Looks so good  
Ri-won / I’ve been wanting to try this properly  

747
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:46,890
Ri-won / But I need to nap for an hour first  

748
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:51,752
Min-woo / You're not skipping Polaroids, right?  
Ri-won / No, I’ll take them, I will  

749
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:55,022
Min-woo / Come here, let’s take one together  

750
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:58,091
Ri-won / Mi-rang, hurry up  
Min-woo / Mi-rang has the longest arms, she should hold it  

751
00:38:58,101 --> 00:38:59,259
Ri-won / Mi-rang, hurry  

752
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:02,539
Min-woo / But she might not get the angle right  
Ri-won / Yeah, don’t make her do it then  

753
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:05,933
Min-woo / Okay, we’re all in  

754
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,579
One, two, three  

755
00:39:13,483 --> 00:39:15,175
Min-woo / Why didn’t it take?  

756
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:15,809
Min-woo / Why didn’t it come out?  

757
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:19,723
Han-kyul / I was in it, I even winked on the side  

758
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:31,124
Min-woo / Come here, I’ll take a solo one for you  
Han-kyul / A solo? That’s a waste  

759
00:39:31,134 --> 00:39:32,092
Min-woo / Why is a solo a waste?  

760
00:39:32,102 --> 00:39:33,594
Han-kyul / If it’s just one person, it’s a waste of film  

761
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:34,795
Han-kyul / How many do we have left?  

762
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,763
Min-woo / Four left  

763
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:38,599
Han-kyul / Can I sit over there?  

764
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,712
Min-woo / On that stone wall? Make it feel more Jeju-like  

765
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:51,855
Min-woo / Looks good. One, two, three  

766
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,860
Seo-yeon / You could sell that for money  

767
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,231
Han-kyul / Shouldn’t I be the one paying you?  

768
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:14,411
Mi-rang / Excuse me, can I come in?  

769
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,939
Mi-rang / What are you doing?  

770
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,074
Da-gyo / I was just lying down  

771
00:40:21,084 --> 00:40:25,045
Mi-rang / We’re eating at 7  
Da-gyo / 7?  

772
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,147
Da-gyo / What time is it now? An hour left...  

773
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:29,526
Da-gyo / An hour?  

774
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,618
Hee-young / Hey!  

775
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:33,987
Mi-rang / Yeah?  

776
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:34,588
Mi-rang / What?  

777
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,623
Hee-young / Seriously  

778
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:38,392
Mi-rang / Why?  

779
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,793
Hee-young / The sketchbook caused total chaos  

780
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:41,828
Hee-young / They’re saying you’re the worst at guessing  

781
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:42,973
Hee-young / Are you crazy?  

782
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:44,464
Hee-young / You just listed everyone’s names randomly  

783
00:40:44,474 --> 00:40:47,511
Hee-young / They said you should just toss it. Yours was the worst  

784
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:49,846
Mi-rang / Wait, Hee-young...  

785
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,616
Mi-rang / Who did you say Hee-young picked again?  

786
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,242
Da-gyo / What did you do out there?  

787
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,954
Mi-rang / Let’s go talk outside  

788
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:04,317
Mi-rang / Oh, I also bought this  

789
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:05,185
Mi-rang / Oh, I bought that too  
Da-gyo / What is it?  

790
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:06,653
Mi-rang / I got Together ice cream too  

791
00:41:06,663 --> 00:41:08,155
Da-gyo / Huh? Really?  

792
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:09,289
Da-gyo / But why did you go alone?  

793
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:12,202
Mi-rang / Just to the convenience store… since I’m on dinner duty today  

794
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,062
Mi-rang / Whoa, then we can eat ice cream later  

795
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,174
Mi-rang / Yep, just you and me  

796
00:41:17,207 --> 00:41:20,167
Da-gyo / Huh? What is this?

797
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:25,238
Mi-rang / They say it helps with blood circulation...

798
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,184
Mi-rang / Not trying to show off or anything

799
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,619
Da-gyo / Thank you, seriously

800
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,656
Da-gyo / I really wanted this, every morning

801
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:35,258
Da-gyo / My legs were swollen today, so I had them raised

802
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,729
Da-gyo / Thank you
Mi-rang / Want me to open it for you?

803
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:40,987
Da-gyo / Yeah, I almost got it

804
00:41:40,997 --> 00:41:44,124
Mi-rang / I'll pretend like I opened it

805
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:47,060
Mi-rang / What were you doing when I was there?

806
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,564
Da-gyo / I cleaned up and wiped the table

807
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:56,246
Mi-rang / But Hee-young said I have no intuition

808
00:41:59,282 --> 00:42:01,041
Mi-rang / Who did Hee-young choose again?

809
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,519
Da-gyo / Hee-young?

810
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:19,870
Da-gyo / Unnie, but seriously, my neck just started hurting

811
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:23,230
Mi-rang / Really?
Jin-ah / Da-gyo, your neck hurts?

812
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,997
Jin-ah / Da-gyo's neck hurts?
Da-gyo / Yeah

813
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:26,543
Jin-ah / My neck really hurts right now too

814
00:42:26,576 --> 00:42:27,467
Jin-ah / Why is that?

815
00:42:27,477 --> 00:42:28,812
Jin-ah / Maybe it’s because I stepped outside earlier?

816
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:30,904
Da-gyo / We were exposed to cold wind

817
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:32,672
Da-gyo / We were exposed to cold wind
Mi-rang / Maybe it’s from yelling while riding the cart?

818
00:42:32,682 --> 00:42:34,518
Jin-ah / That’s a reasonable guess

819
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:37,387
Jin-ah / We really did a lot of screaming

820
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:51,334
Da-gyo / Should we go over there?

821
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:54,504
Da-gyo / Should we go that way?

822
00:42:56,306 --> 00:42:58,365
Jin-ah / Can we talk? Do you have time to talk?

823
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,966
Jin-ah / Do you have time to talk?

824
00:42:59,976 --> 00:43:01,478
Jin-ah / Or do you not really want to?

825
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,907
Jin-ah / Do you not really want to talk?

826
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,519
Jin-ah / I have something I want to say

827
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:12,512
Jin-ah / Why?

828
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:15,792
Jin-ah / You don’t really want to talk? Or can you at least hear me out?

829
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,131
Jin-ah / It’s not something heavy or anything

830
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,901
Jin-ah / You really don’t want to talk?

831
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,861
Jin-ah / Can I talk?

832
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,396
Jin-ah / What I was wondering is

833
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:32,809
Jin-ah / Was it too much for you, the way I acted?

834
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,434
Jin-ah / Like when you said

835
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:36,603
Jin-ah / "I feel like you left because of my choice"

836
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:39,049
Jin-ah / Something like that?

837
00:43:46,923 --> 00:43:48,258
Jin-ah / It’s just...

838
00:43:50,694 --> 00:43:52,829
Hee-young / I chose you

839
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:54,431
Hee-young / I was the one who chose you

840
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,507
Hee-young / I don’t understand what you’re saying

841
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:09,135
Jin-ah / Today? Today?

842
00:44:09,145 --> 00:44:10,647
Jin-ah / I mean, I just...

843
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:16,042
Hee-young / What are you trying to say?
Jin-ah / The reason is because...

844
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:18,188
Jin-ah / What I said earlier this morning

845
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,858
Jin-ah / Since I was the first to go out on the date

846
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,827
Jin-ah / I thought maybe you assumed I chose someone else

847
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,753
Jin-ah / That I left because of that

848
00:44:26,763 --> 00:44:28,231
Jin-ah / So...

849
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,134
Jin-ah / Still...

850
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:35,662
Jin-ah / I wanted to tell you that I chose you

851
00:44:35,672 --> 00:44:37,364
Hee-young / Are you crying because you feel bad?

852
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:39,609
Hee-young / Why are you crying?

853
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:48,685
Hee-young / Why are you crying?

854
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:09,105
Hee-young / Hm? Do you want some water?

855
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,676
Hee-young / It’s okay, it’s okay

856
00:45:14,077 --> 00:45:15,902
Hee-young / It’s okay

857
00:45:15,912 --> 00:45:18,471
Hee-young / Why are you crying?

858
00:45:18,481 --> 00:45:22,986
Hee-young / Why are you crying?

859
00:45:33,029 --> 00:45:36,399
Jin-ah / I tend to be overly conscious of things

860
00:45:38,234 --> 00:45:41,938
Jin-ah / So I... I like someone...

861
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,998
Jin-ah / When I like someone, I tend to express it a lot

862
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:46,766
Jin-ah / But even for me

863
00:45:46,776 --> 00:45:51,037
Jin-ah / I’ve started to speak more slowly now

864
00:45:51,047 --> 00:45:54,808
Jin-ah / In real life, we can take things slow

865
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:58,455
Jin-ah / I’m that kind of person too

866
00:45:58,488 --> 00:46:01,147
Jin-ah / But here...

867
00:46:01,157 --> 00:46:02,993
Jin-ah / With you

868
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:06,753
Jin-ah / It’s only been three days

869
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:11,224
Jin-ah / Even though this place is...

870
00:46:11,234 --> 00:46:12,425
Hee-young / What?

871
00:46:12,435 --> 00:46:13,660
Hee-young / Why are you crying?

872
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,438
Hee-young / Why are you crying?
Jin-ah / I don’t know

873
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,364
Jin-ah / Even though this place is

874
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:20,710
Jin-ah / Supposed to be about getting to know different people

875
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:22,902
Jin-ah / I’m not really interested in anyone else but you

876
00:46:22,912 --> 00:46:25,448
Jin-ah / I don’t want to get to know anyone else

877
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:29,386
Jin-ah / But when I say that

878
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:36,316
Jin-ah / You sometimes say things like “It’s good to explore others” during meals

879
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:39,352
Jin-ah / That feels so opposite of how I feel

880
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:41,388
Jin-ah / So...

881
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,857
Jin-ah / I just wish you’d understand

882
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:47,160
Jin-ah / That I wanted to go out with you

883
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,806
Jin-ah / That’s what I really wanted to say

884
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:53,166
Jin-ah / But saying that...

885
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:57,113
Jin-ah / Felt kind of embarrassing, or maybe it was my pride

886
00:46:57,947 --> 00:47:00,006
Jin-ah / So...

887
00:47:00,016 --> 00:47:04,177
Jin-ah / When you said, “You chose someone else, right?”

888
00:47:04,187 --> 00:47:08,448
Jin-ah / You said that...

889
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,827
Jin-ah / And even at the kart track

890
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,830
Jin-ah / You kept avoiding me so much

891
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,034
Jin-ah / I felt like...

892
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,427
Jin-ah / The way we express ourselves is just really different

893
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,072
Jin-ah / Our emotional language feels mismatched

894
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:27,500
Jin-ah / I tend to be intense in how I express myself

895
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,312
Jin-ah / I want to express so much all the time

896
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,773
Jin-ah / I was afraid it might be too much for you

897
00:47:33,783 --> 00:47:36,453
Jin-ah / So what I really wanted to say was

898
00:47:40,256 --> 00:47:41,781
Jin-ah / I thought you might've chosen someone else

899
00:47:41,791 --> 00:47:43,783
Jin-ah / I figured you probably did

900
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:45,351
Jin-ah / But honestly, I was okay with that

901
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:48,688
Jin-ah / Sure, it hurt, but

902
00:47:48,698 --> 00:47:50,356
Jin-ah / I can’t force your heart or your choices

903
00:47:50,366 --> 00:47:53,927
Jin-ah / That’s not something I can control

904
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:57,363
Jin-ah / But when I still have feelings for someone

905
00:47:57,373 --> 00:48:00,333
Jin-ah / Or I like someone

906
00:48:00,343 --> 00:48:04,080
Jin-ah / I can't really be just friends and act chill

907
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,840
Jin-ah / I keep...

908
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,609
Jin-ah / Even before you got here

909
00:48:09,619 --> 00:48:13,513
Jin-ah / I kept thinking I must really like you

910
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:15,992
Jin-ah / Saying “I like you” after just three days

911
00:48:16,025 --> 00:48:19,953
Jin-ah / Might sound ridiculous and silly

912
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:22,021
Jin-ah / But I want to be sure between us

913
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:23,423
Jin-ah / And I feel like I want to give that certainty, but can’t

914
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:24,968
Jin-ah / I think the desire to receive it is even stronger

915
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:28,228
Jin-ah / So I end up going in circles

916
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,097
Jin-ah / I thought maybe if I tried meeting someone else

917
00:48:31,107 --> 00:48:33,600
Jin-ah / I might become sure about how I feel about you

918
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:34,644
Jin-ah / That’s what I thought

919
00:48:35,578 --> 00:48:37,137
Jin-ah / But when I was writing the message today

920
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:40,707
Jin-ah / I couldn’t write anyone’s name but yours

921
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,243
Jin-ah / People keep saying things like this to me

922
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:46,146
Jin-ah / About other people...

923
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,524
Jin-ah / I really have no clue, do I?

924
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:51,127
Min-woo / I’m sorry... why are you crying?

925
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:56,789
Min-woo / I was just deciding when to come hang out...

926
00:48:56,799 --> 00:48:58,958
Min-woo / And my timing was...

927
00:48:58,968 --> 00:49:00,837
Jin-ah / Wow, terrible timing

928
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:02,262
Hee-young / And I just got here

929
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,731
Min-woo / Because if not today,

930
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:05,932
Min-woo / I might not get another chance to get close

931
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:06,666
Min-woo / So I wanted to start getting closer today

932
00:49:06,676 --> 00:49:09,212
Min-woo / I wanted to start getting closer today
Jin-ah / Hurry up and come here

933
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:12,639
Jin-ah / She made me cry
Hee-young / What? I made you cry? Are you serious?

934
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:16,509
Hee-young / I made you cry? You’ve got to be kidding me
Jin-ah / No, I made myself cry. No, no

935
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:19,556
Min-woo / Were you always like this?

936
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:21,314
Hee-young / I don’t make people cry

937
00:49:21,324 --> 00:49:23,793
Jin-ah / Why? A woman who makes another woman cry is cool

938
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:25,318
Jin-ah / Not good, but cool

939
00:49:25,328 --> 00:49:26,753
Hee-young / I don’t make people cry

940
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:28,364
Hee-young / I don’t make people cry
Min-woo / You should only make someone cry three times in your life

941
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:34,394
Min-woo / Honestly, everything I said

942
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,140
Min-woo / Was my awkward way of trying to lighten the mood

943
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,176
Min-woo / It was just a clumsy expression

944
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,245
Min-woo / I just hope you understand my intentions

945
00:49:43,112 --> 00:49:44,537
Jin-ah / I hoped she’d leave, but

946
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:48,141
Jin-ah / From what I could tell, Min-woo

947
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,376
Jin-ah / Isn’t someone who acts without clear intentions

948
00:49:50,386 --> 00:49:52,979
Jin-ah / She’s not the type to act in a way that makes you question her motives

949
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:55,748
Jin-ah / Usually when two people are talking and one’s crying

950
00:49:55,758 --> 00:49:57,116
Jin-ah / It’s normal to step out

951
00:49:57,126 --> 00:50:01,120
Jin-ah / But Min-woo did something out of the ordinary

952
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:03,022
Jin-ah / That means she had a reason

953
00:50:03,032 --> 00:50:07,327
Jin-ah / So honestly, I was okay with it

954
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,195
Jin-ah / And when Min-woo came in

955
00:50:09,205 --> 00:50:11,397
Jin-ah / Hee-young seemed to relax a bit

956
00:50:11,407 --> 00:50:13,166
Jin-ah / And she was a little kinder to me

957
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,567
Jin-ah / When Min-woo came in

958
00:50:14,577 --> 00:50:16,369
Jin-ah / I thought,

959
00:50:16,379 --> 00:50:18,271
Jin-ah / “If she’s even slightly calmed down now,”

960
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:20,974
Jin-ah / “Maybe we can have a better conversation again”

961
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:22,942
Jin-ah / So I was relieved

962
00:50:22,952 --> 00:50:25,945
Min-woo / I had a real reason to go hang out, so I did

963
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:29,115
Min-woo / But then I saw her crying, and I wanted to go in even more

964
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:32,418
Jin-ah / When I walked into that situation, Hee-young and I...

965
00:50:32,428 --> 00:50:35,655
Min-woo / I wanted to see how Hee-young and Jin-ah would respond and handle it

966
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:39,058
Min-woo / Whether it meant they were over

967
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:41,227
Min-woo / Or still ongoing—I wanted to see that

968
00:50:41,237 --> 00:50:45,642
Min-woo / Honestly, I just wanted to see Hee-young, so I pretended I didn’t know anything

969
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:49,402
Han-kyul / Is there someone you’re interested in right now?

970
00:50:49,412 --> 00:50:51,471
Seo-yeon / One person

971
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:53,039
Han-kyul / Did you send a message?

972
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:54,841
Han-kyul / Did anyone reply?

973
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,020
Seo-yeon / Sit down

974
00:50:59,522 --> 00:51:00,590
Seo-yeon / A reply?

975
00:51:00,623 --> 00:51:02,992
Seo-yeon / There wasn’t one

976
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,717
Han-kyul / Still zero votes?

977
00:51:04,727 --> 00:51:06,229
Han-kyul / Still zero votes?

978
00:51:06,262 --> 00:51:09,065
Seo-yeon / The replies are anonymous though

979
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,367
Han-kyul / But like,

980
00:51:12,535 --> 00:51:15,071
Han-kyul / I kind of wrote it in a way that makes it obvious

981
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:17,030
Han-kyul / So people would figure out who I meant

982
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,231
Seo-yeon / Really?

983
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,766
Han-kyul / Like the stuff I said that day and all

984
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,235
Han-kyul / I pretty much gave it away

985
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,112
Seo-yeon / Ri-won?

986
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:24,671
Han-kyul / No, no

987
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:25,648
Seo-yeon / No?

988
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:31,477
Seo-yeon / I really must have no intuition

989
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:34,490
Seo-yeon / Is it because I didn’t get a single reply?

990
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:39,962
Han-kyul / There’s just no real connection at all...

991
00:51:40,296 --> 00:51:43,389
Seo-yeon / Then the person you sent a message to today—

992
00:51:43,399 --> 00:51:46,903
Seo-yeon / Is she the same one you’ve been messaging all along?

993
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:47,760
Han-kyul / No, no

994
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,429
Seo-yeon / It’s someone different?

995
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,165
Han-kyul / I didn’t expect it to be this bad for me

996
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:53,843
Han-kyul / I’m really all over the place right now

997
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:57,470
Han-kyul / So more than I thought, I feel like

998
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,639
Han-kyul / I’m endlessly just...

999
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:03,519
Han-kyul / Maybe I’m just someone who lacks experience

1000
00:52:03,886 --> 00:52:07,080
Han-kyul / I thought “I can do this” and was overconfident

1001
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,881
Han-kyul / But now I’m painfully

1002
00:52:08,891 --> 00:52:11,884
Han-kyul / Really feeling the weight of that

1003
00:52:11,894 --> 00:52:14,931
Han-kyul / I feel like I’m going to regret it a lot

1004
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,666
Han-kyul / Even though I know I will

1005
00:52:16,699 --> 00:52:19,102
Han-kyul / I’ll probably keep doing things I regret

1006
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:24,006
Han-kyul / Anyway, that’s kind of where my heart is

1007
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:27,667
Seo-yeon / But you have to try your best while you can

1008
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,112
Seo-yeon / That’s the only way you won’t regret it later

1009
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:32,615
Han-kyul / Yeah, you’re right

1010
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:36,552
Seo-yeon / Do you regret coming here?

1011
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:39,345
Han-kyul / Me...

1012
00:52:39,355 --> 00:52:40,857
Han-kyul / Yes!

1013
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,599
Mi-rang / I brought this back

1014
00:52:49,632 --> 00:52:53,526
Da-gyo / What? Oh! Jeju makgeolli!

1015
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:56,763
Mi-rang / And then the Together one—later let’s split it

1016
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:57,230
Mi-rang / Let’s try it with olive oil

1017
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,233
Mi-rang / Let’s try it with olive oil

1018
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:03,446
Seo-yeon / Come here, let’s go to my room

1019
00:53:05,681 --> 00:53:08,408
Mi-rang / But whenever it’s just us going...

1020
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:09,752
Mi-rang / Why does everyone run away when it's just us?

1021
00:53:09,786 --> 00:53:11,654
Mi-rang / Why does everyone run away when it's just us?

1022
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:18,885
Mi-rang / It’s not too hot, right?

1023
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,863
Da-gyo / It’s just right...

1024
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:28,361
Han-kyul / If I keep going like this, it’ll just keep getting weirder

1025
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:32,642
Han-kyul / I keep thinking that endlessly

1026
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,769
Han-kyul / If I open up and say all this here

1027
00:53:36,779 --> 00:53:39,115
Han-kyul / It kind of feels like...

1028
00:53:39,148 --> 00:53:44,410
Han-kyul / Like I’m being overly emotional, so I’ve been avoiding it

1029
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:49,992
Seo-yeon / But if you don’t have a way to release those emotions

1030
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:53,095
Seo-yeon / This place can get really hard to endure

1031
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:57,356
Han-kyul / What do you do when you feel really frustrated?

1032
00:53:57,366 --> 00:54:04,006
Seo-yeon / I talk to my roommate, just talk it out

1033
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:07,743
Seo-yeon / Hang in there

1034
00:54:13,816 --> 00:54:16,552
Han-kyul / I don’t want to cry, but the tears keep coming

1035
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:20,156
Han-kyul / I feel like everyone here will criticize me

1036
00:54:20,189 --> 00:54:24,750
Han-kyul / I’m sorry

1037
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:28,231
Han-kyul / Honestly, I didn’t expect the age range here

1038
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:30,900
Han-kyul / To be so different from what I imagined

1039
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,526
Han-kyul / I’m actually at the age

1040
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:36,072
Han-kyul / Where you all could be raising kids

1041
00:54:36,105 --> 00:54:38,998
Han-kyul / I didn’t think there’d be no one around my age at all

1042
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:40,376
Han-kyul / I never expected that

1043
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,670
Han-kyul / So...

1044
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,315
Seo-yeon / But

1045
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:47,874
Seo-yeon / That’s not how I see you

1046
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:50,810
Seo-yeon / I don’t know how old you are exactly

1047
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,712
Seo-yeon / But let’s say you’re 20

1048
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:55,882
Seo-yeon / Then I’m 32, so that’s a 12-year difference

1049
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:57,059
Seo-yeon / A 12-year gap

1050
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:01,521
Seo-yeon / But I don’t see you as

1051
00:55:01,531 --> 00:55:03,432
Seo-yeon / Not a romantic option

1052
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,869
Seo-yeon / I don’t think, “I need to raise her” or anything

1053
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:11,397
Seo-yeon / In a relationship, both people should give what’s needed

1054
00:55:11,407 --> 00:55:14,610
Seo-yeon / We should both feel butterflies and offer each other stability

1055
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:17,313
Seo-yeon / Just as two confident adults

1056
00:55:17,346 --> 00:55:18,971
Seo-yeon / That’s how I see it

1057
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:20,116
Seo-yeon / And I think everyone else here

1058
00:55:20,149 --> 00:55:21,817
Seo-yeon / Sees you the same way too

1059
00:55:25,721 --> 00:55:27,513
Seo-yeon / But you’re being too hard on yourself like

1060
00:55:27,523 --> 00:55:29,849
Seo-yeon / “I’m too young,” or

1061
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,461
Seo-yeon / “I’m too different in age”

1062
00:55:33,062 --> 00:55:37,990
Han-kyul / Hearing that from you... really, thank you

1063
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,393
Han-kyul / I don’t know why I’m being like this

1064
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,772
Seo-yeon / It’s okay, don’t blame yourself too much

1065
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,164
Seo-yeon / Blaming yourself

1066
00:55:45,174 --> 00:55:46,075
Seo-yeon / Doesn’t help anyone

1067
00:55:46,108 --> 00:55:47,877
Seo-yeon / And it doesn’t help you either

1068
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:51,037
Han-kyul / Yeah, I think you’re right

1069
00:55:51,047 --> 00:55:54,116
Seo-yeon / It doesn’t help anyone

1070
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:57,810
Seo-yeon / You’ve just always

1071
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,090
Seo-yeon / Kind of acted like you’ve already given up

1072
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:07,153
Seo-yeon / And that makes you seem a little defeated

1073
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:10,399
Seo-yeon / I just felt bad seeing that, so

1074
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,836
Seo-yeon / I wanted to talk to you too

1075
00:56:13,869 --> 00:56:17,139
Han-kyul / Thank you so much

1076
00:56:17,773 --> 00:56:18,965
Han-kyul / I should stop saying sorry

1077
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:22,034
Han-kyul / And just say thank you instead

1078
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:24,870
Seo-yeon / Don’t even say thank you anymore

1079
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,384
Han-kyul / I’m really glad we had this talk

1080
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:35,491
Da-gyo / What’s this?

1081
00:56:35,524 --> 00:56:37,617
Mi-rang / This is so cute too

1082
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,028
Da-gyo / Jelly?

1083
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:45,334
Mi-rang / But for some reason, every time I see you

1084
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:47,737
Mi-rang / I think of peaches, I don’t know why

1085
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:51,374
Mi-rang / Do you hear that a lot?

1086
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,665
Mi-rang / This one’s a strawberry though

1087
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:57,513
Mi-rang / But just now, I suddenly wanted to say “peach”

1088
00:57:02,551 --> 00:57:04,010
Da-gyo / I see\~

1089
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,779
Mi-rang / What were you talking about when I wasn’t here?

1090
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:09,091
Da-gyo / What I’m curious about is—did you send me that message?

1091
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,017
Da-gyo / You sent that message to me, right?

1092
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,294
Da-gyo / Then, are you

1093
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:16,198
Da-gyo / Not curious about anyone else anymore?

1094
00:57:19,502 --> 00:57:21,093
Mi-rang / Why? Are you?

1095
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:23,629
Da-gyo / I was just curious how you could be so sure

1096
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:25,931
Da-gyo / What if I said, “I want to go on a date with Hee-young”?

1097
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:28,711
Da-gyo / How would you feel about that?

1098
00:57:29,945 --> 00:57:31,013
Mi-rang / I’d hate it

1099
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:35,741
Mi-rang / Today, when I saw your outfit—

1100
00:57:35,751 --> 00:57:37,553
Mi-rang / That scarf wasn’t even part of it

1101
00:57:39,555 --> 00:57:44,216
Mi-rang / But because your clothes were this color this morning
Da-gyo / That’s why?

1102
00:57:44,226 --> 00:57:48,621
Mi-rang / That’s why I did it too
Da-gyo / Wow, I really have no clue

1103
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,589
Mi-rang / So if I ended up going on a date with someone else

1104
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:53,469
Mi-rang / I was going to throw that scarf away

1105
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:58,497
Mi-rang / But what I’m sure about is

1106
00:57:58,507 --> 00:58:00,776
Mi-rang / I don’t want to go on a date with anyone anymore

1107
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,610
Mi-rang / Not with anyone else

1108
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,702
Mi-rang / But I hope you

1109
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:06,739
Mi-rang / Can go on a date without feeling pressured

1110
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:09,575
Mi-rang / I was just joking about throwing the scarf and all

1111
00:58:09,585 --> 00:58:10,653
Mi-rang / Or was it a joke? Really?

1112
00:58:10,686 --> 00:58:13,723
Da-gyo / Half joke, half serious

1113
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,293
Mi-rang / Still, thank you for being honest

1114
00:58:17,326 --> 00:58:19,985
Da-gyo / I just thought it was the right thing to say

1115
00:58:19,995 --> 00:58:24,133
Da-gyo / Because honestly, like Hee-young said

1116
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:25,735
Da-gyo / People might think I’m being two-faced

1117
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:28,771
Da-gyo / But I’ve never said anything I didn’t mean

1118
00:58:28,804 --> 00:58:32,732
Da-gyo / I’ve been sincere about everything

1119
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:35,010
Da-gyo / So I thought going on the date today

1120
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:38,080
Da-gyo / Might help me sort out my feelings

1121
00:58:38,914 --> 00:58:41,817
Da-gyo / But it didn’t, and now\...

1122
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,343
Da-gyo / Everything’s just a mess now

1123
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:45,521
Mi-rang / It’s fate

1124
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:50,392
Mi-rang / So you two couldn’t go on a date after all

1125
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:56,255
Mi-rang / I had a really fun time on our date the day before

1126
00:58:56,265 --> 00:58:58,924
Mi-rang / So I naturally thought Da-gyo would

1127
00:58:58,934 --> 00:59:01,527
Mi-rang / Want to keep dating me moving forward

1128
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:04,296
Mi-rang / But she said she wanted to try dating Hee-young

1129
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:08,477
Mi-rang / And my feelings just got really complicated...

1130
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,349
Mi-rang / I was annoyed

1131
00:59:13,382 --> 00:59:14,517
Mi-rang / But what if I told you

1132
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,886
Mi-rang / I chose someone else?

1133
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,321
Da-gyo / Who are you curious about?

1134
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:21,657
Mi-rang / It’s a secret

1135
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:24,083
Da-gyo / I told you though

1136
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,861
Mi-rang / Well, no one told you to say it

1137
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,353
Da-gyo / Got it

1138
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:28,264
Da-gyo / It’s fine, you don’t have to say it

1139
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:29,789
Da-gyo / Maybe you don’t want to

1140
00:59:29,799 --> 00:59:33,392
Mi-rang / No, it’s just there’s no need to say it now

1141
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:35,060
Da-gyo / Yeah, you’re right

1142
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,496
Da-gyo / I really appreciate you telling me though

1143
00:59:37,506 --> 00:59:39,074
Da-gyo / It makes me feel good

1144
00:59:39,108 --> 00:59:44,203
Mi-rang / Even if you dated someone else

1145
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:48,684
Mi-rang / I felt like in the end, you’d still choose me

1146
00:59:48,717 --> 00:59:55,357
Da-gyo / Oh really?
Mi-rang / Yeah... and now

1147
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,715
Mi-rang / I’m not going to overthink it

1148
00:59:56,725 --> 00:59:58,360
Mi-rang / I’ll just do what I want

1149
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:01,063
Mi-rang / It might be overwhelming for you

1150
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:03,889
Da-gyo / It’s okay

1151
01:00:03,899 --> 01:00:06,468
Mi-rang / Just enjoy it

1152
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:08,561
Mi-rang / Who cares

1153
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:11,540
Da-gyo / Let’s enjoy it

1154
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:13,032
Da-gyo / But wait

1155
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,333
Da-gyo / Shouldn’t we put this away? The makgeolli?

1156
01:00:14,343 --> 01:00:16,302
Mi-rang / Oh right!

1157
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,948
Mi-rang / But since we’re in Jeju

1158
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:20,916
Mi-rang / Don’t you think we should at least have one sip?

1159
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,818
Mi-rang / With everyone together

1160
01:00:28,457 --> 01:00:29,258
Da-gyo / What’s this?

1161
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:32,528
Mi-rang / Huh? What the?

1162
01:00:37,032 --> 01:00:39,835
Ri-won / I want to see their disgusted reactions

1163
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:44,840
Da-gyo / What is this?

1164
01:00:45,307 --> 01:00:47,466
Da-gyo / Why? Are you asking if I wrote it?

1165
01:00:47,476 --> 01:00:49,278
Da-gyo / Like I would write this...

1166
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:52,872
Da-gyo / Who wrote it?

1167
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:55,341
Mi-rang / Who was it?
Da-gyo / Oh, is it because it’s dinner today? Maybe that’s why it’s written

1168
01:00:55,351 --> 01:00:57,920
Mi-rang / Ah\~ but even a heart?

1169
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:59,922
Da-gyo / Right? I was shocked by the heart too

1170
01:00:59,955 --> 01:01:01,891
Da-gyo / Why do you hate it? lol

1171
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,186
Da-gyo / This is hilarious

1172
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:10,132
Da-gyo / Clink\~

1173
01:01:10,165 --> 01:01:12,268
Mi-rang / Draw a knife, like this

1174
01:01:42,164 --> 01:01:45,267
Han-kyul / Why are you crying again?

1175
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:47,860
Ri-won / Who’s crying?

1176
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,162
Han-kyul / I’m sorry

1177
01:01:50,172 --> 01:01:51,730
Ri-won / Why are you crying?

1178
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:54,043
Han-kyul / I’m sorry

1179
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,405
Han-kyul / Sorry for waking you

1180
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:02,141
Ri-won / Did you cry while talking again?
Han-kyul / Yeah

1181
01:02:02,151 --> 01:02:04,276
Ri-won / Even without drinking this time?

1182
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:06,845
Han-kyul / I feel kind of broken

1183
01:02:06,855 --> 01:02:09,815
Han-kyul / My head knows I shouldn’t cry

1184
01:02:09,825 --> 01:02:11,627
Han-kyul / But I just can’t stop the tears

1185
01:02:12,594 --> 01:02:15,965
Ri-won / It’s okay to cry when you need to
Han-kyul / I just feel bad

1186
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:49,865
Jin-ah / Unnie, what are you looking for?

1187
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:59,398
Jin-ah / Why do you keep ignoring my questions?

1188
01:02:59,408 --> 01:03:01,810
Jin-ah / Why do you keep ignoring my questions?

1189
01:03:02,644 --> 01:03:04,069
Jin-ah / I asked what you’re looking for

1190
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,916
Hee-young / No, it’s not that. I did answer

1191
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,791
Jin-ah / Are you mad at me? Are you? Huh?

1192
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,851
Hee-young / I just...

1193
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:23,655
Jin-ah / What’s there to be mad about?

1194
01:03:23,665 --> 01:03:25,657
Jin-ah / Should I not say things like this?
Hee-young / Huh?

1195
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:27,870
Jin-ah / Should I not talk about stuff like this?

1196
01:03:30,372 --> 01:03:32,541
Jin-ah / Do you even understand what I’m saying?

1197
01:03:32,574 --> 01:03:34,143
Jin-ah / Are you really getting it?

1198
01:03:38,313 --> 01:03:40,005
Jin-ah / Just tell me that—do you understand?

1199
01:03:40,015 --> 01:03:42,541
Jin-ah / Do you understand what I’m saying?

1200
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:44,309
Jin-ah / Do you?

1201
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,488
Hee-young / No... ha...

1202
01:03:46,522 --> 01:03:48,590
Jin-ah / Why?

1203
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:54,363
Hee-young / Let’s talk later, we have to cook now

1204
01:04:20,722 --> 01:04:24,293
Jin-ah / Did I leave my phone over there?

1205
01:04:25,627 --> 01:04:27,019
Jin-ah / Did I leave it there?

1206
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,697
Jin-ah / Did I leave my phone?

1207
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:29,631
Da-gyo / Maybe? Since it’s not here now?

1208
01:04:29,698 --> 01:04:30,856
Da-gyo / Could be because it's not here?

1209
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:32,291
Jin-ah / No, I think Hee-young 

1210
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,836
Jin-ah / is really mad at me about something

1211
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,527
Jin-ah / She’s mad

1212
01:04:35,537 --> 01:04:36,829
Jin-ah / Hee-young 

1213
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:37,863
Jin-ah / I don’t know why though?

1214
01:04:37,873 --> 01:04:39,808
Da-gyo / Didn’t you just talk with her?

1215
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,445
Jin-ah / No, we were about to talk but it got cut off

1216
01:04:44,346 --> 01:04:46,839
Jin-ah / I asked, “Do you not want to talk to me?”

1217
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,107
Jin-ah / And she said she didn’t

1218
01:04:48,117 --> 01:04:52,020
Jin-ah / She said, “Let’s talk later, we have to cook”

1219
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,655
Da-gyo / Really?

1220
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:55,891
Jin-ah / So she won’t really answer me

1221
01:04:55,924 --> 01:04:57,593
Jin-ah / I asked, “Can we talk?”

1222
01:04:57,626 --> 01:04:59,585
Jin-ah / “Do you not want to talk?”

1223
01:04:59,595 --> 01:05:01,730
Jin-ah / “Then can you at least listen? I have something to say”

1224
01:05:01,763 --> 01:05:02,888
Jin-ah / But she wouldn’t say anything

1225
01:05:02,898 --> 01:05:04,867
Jin-ah / She just wouldn’t respond

1226
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:06,592
Da-gyo / Really?

1227
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:09,094
Jin-ah / And then all she said was, “I picked you too”

1228
01:05:09,104 --> 01:05:11,530
Jin-ah / That’s the one thing she said

1229
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:14,176
Jin-ah / Usually, if you like someone, you can’t really

1230
01:05:14,209 --> 01:05:15,200
Jin-ah / just be casual friends with them

1231
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,203
Jin-ah / But here, we still have to live together

1232
01:05:18,213 --> 01:05:20,639
Jin-ah / I was trying to say, “I just want things to stay good between us”

1233
01:05:20,649 --> 01:05:21,773
Jin-ah / But she keeps avoiding the conversation...

1234
01:05:21,783 --> 01:05:25,320
Jin-ah / And then just earlier, she was looking for something

1235
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:28,790
Jin-ah / So I asked, “Unnie, what are you looking for?”

1236
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:29,381
Jin-ah / “What are you looking for?” but

1237
01:05:29,391 --> 01:05:31,517
Jin-ah / She kept ignoring me

1238
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,352
Jin-ah / Just completely ignoring me

1239
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,087
Jin-ah / “Unnie, what are you looking for? Why won’t you answer me?”

1240
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,599
Jin-ah / And she just said, “It’s nothing”

1241
01:05:37,766 --> 01:05:39,101
Da-gyo / Seriously?

1242
01:05:39,601 --> 01:05:43,028
Jin-ah / So I held on to her and asked

1243
01:05:43,038 --> 01:05:45,197
Jin-ah / “Are you mad at me about something?”

1244
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:47,743
Jin-ah / “Can you tell me what part upset you?”

1245
01:05:47,776 --> 01:05:50,045
Jin-ah / And she said, “Let’s talk later, we have to cook”

1246
01:05:50,078 --> 01:05:52,247
Jin-ah / I’m not exaggerating, that’s what she said

1247
01:05:53,649 --> 01:05:57,786
Jin-ah / But honestly, I don’t think I did anything to make her that mad

1248
01:05:59,988 --> 01:06:02,224
Jin-ah / Still, I’m really hurt by this

1249
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,183
Jin-ah / And honestly, I really hate

1250
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:10,222
Jin-ah / When things get awkward between people—that's what I’m worried about

1251
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:13,392
Jin-ah / I mean, if her feelings have faded or changed, that’s fine

1252
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:14,526
Jin-ah / That’s okay

1253
01:06:14,536 --> 01:06:18,307
Jin-ah / I’m fine with that

1254
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,566
Jin-ah / That’s okay, but now

1255
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:22,501
Jin-ah / The way she communicates

1256
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,436
Jin-ah / It’s like I’m begging her, and it just—

1257
01:06:24,446 --> 01:06:28,140
Jin-ah / Why is it hurting me so much?

1258
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,442
Jin-ah / Sure, I have romantic feelings

1259
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:34,012
Jin-ah / But she’s also someone I have to live with here

1260
01:06:34,022 --> 01:06:37,226
Jin-ah / And now everything feels so awkward

1261
01:06:38,927 --> 01:06:39,851
Jin-ah / That’s why now, if

1262
01:06:39,861 --> 01:06:41,496
Jin-ah / (Hee-young) says she wants to talk

1263
01:06:41,763 --> 01:06:43,599
Jin-ah / I don’t know\...

1264
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,537
Da-gyo / For now, let’s just go eat

1265
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:52,931
Jin-ah / I mean, personally, when it gets awkward like this

1266
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:54,032
Jin-ah / I end up sleeping alone

1267
01:06:54,042 --> 01:06:55,100
Jin-ah / And I just feel

1268
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:57,479
Jin-ah / so emotionally left out

1269
01:06:57,512 --> 01:07:00,339
Jin-ah / Honestly, I felt like I was being ostracized earlier

1270
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:01,039
Da-gyo / When?

1271
01:07:01,049 --> 01:07:02,484
Jin-ah / When I came in

1272
01:07:02,884 --> 01:07:04,553
Da-gyo / That’s why I stepped out while you two were talking

1273
01:07:04,586 --> 01:07:04,943
Da-gyo / I left on purpose

1274
01:07:04,953 --> 01:07:09,214
Da-gyo / I stepped out on purpose
Jin-ah / Seriously, this feels like high school girls

1275
01:07:09,224 --> 01:07:12,027
Jin-ah / I feel like I’m being bullied right now

1276
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:24,696
Hee-young / What’s this? Who did this?

1277
01:07:24,706 --> 01:07:26,632
Mi-rang / Who put this heart here?

1278
01:07:26,642 --> 01:07:28,200
Hee-young / So you split it?

1279
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:30,746
Mi-rang / I broke it up

1280
01:07:31,413 --> 01:07:34,516
Seo-yeon / Was that because the chef did it that way?

1281
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:42,948
Hee-young / Unnie, how long will it take?

1282
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:44,416
Mi-rang / I think it’ll be done soon

1283
01:07:44,426 --> 01:07:48,487
Hee-young / Then should I make something quick too?

1284
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:50,088
Hee-young / Like fried rice or something?

1285
01:07:50,098 --> 01:07:53,692
Mi-rang / Fried rice sounds perfect

1286
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,060
Hee-young / I was thinking Spam

1287
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,538
Hee-young / I really like Spam in kimchi fried rice

1288
01:07:56,571 --> 01:08:00,299
Mi-rang / Oh, I like Spam too
Hee-young / And doenjang stew with pork is good too

1289
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:02,167
Mi-rang / Okay, okay, okay

1290
01:08:02,177 --> 01:08:04,503
Mi-rang / Okay
Hee-young / Okay? Plan complete

1291
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:08,050
Mi-rang / We’re totally in sync when it comes to cooking

1292
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:22,754
Hee-young / This should be enough for the kimchi fried rice, right?

1293
01:08:22,764 --> 01:08:26,368
Mi-rang / You really know what you’re doing

1294
01:08:36,211 --> 01:08:38,870
Hee-young / The flame’s too low—should we move?

1295
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,882
Hee-young / To another spot?
Mi-rang / Sure, one sec

1296
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:56,621
Mi-rang / Okay

1297
01:08:56,631 --> 01:08:58,033
Hee-young / You sure?

1298
01:09:06,174 --> 01:09:07,466
Wow, we made a lot

1299
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,844
I'm so excited

1300
01:09:08,877 --> 01:09:11,436
Ri-won / You did such a good job

1301
01:09:11,446 --> 01:09:12,547
Mi-rang / You're so good at cooking

1302
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,015
Seo-yeon / Look at the egg—crazy good

1303
01:09:18,286 --> 01:09:19,411
Hee-young / Is this someone's drinking water?

1304
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:22,157
Mi-rang / Min-woo, Min-woo sat here for a bit

1305
01:09:25,627 --> 01:09:27,629
Hee-young / Oh, this was Min-woo's seat

1306
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:33,625
Hee-young / It was? I didn’t know

1307
01:09:33,635 --> 01:09:37,829
Min-woo / Me? I’m fine sitting anywhere

1308
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:40,942
Ri-won / Hee-young, come over here, come

1309
01:09:47,015 --> 01:09:48,407
Ri-won / What?
Min-woo / Let’s sit here

1310
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:51,653
Ri-won / No one wants to sit next to me though

1311
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:06,591
Jin-ah / Oh my, the soup’s delicious

1312
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:07,135
Ri-won / That’s crazy

1313
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:11,273
Min-woo / Tastes kinda like there's crab in it
Ri-won / It’s so good

1314
01:10:14,943 --> 01:10:16,845
Ri-won / It’s seriously delicious

1315
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,573
Hee-young / The reaction—mmm!

1316
01:10:21,583 --> 01:10:23,919
Ri-won / Are you a chef or something?

1317
01:10:23,952 --> 01:10:25,921
Ri-won / Was that a secret? You’re a chef, huh?

1318
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:30,659
Mi-rang / Isn’t it spicy?

1319
01:10:30,692 --> 01:10:31,760
Min-woo / Which one?
Da-gyo / Yeah

1320
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:35,864
Min-woo / No one asked me, but I’m answering anyway

1321
01:10:57,385 --> 01:11:01,423
Mi-rang / Why does everyone feel so down today?

1322
01:11:01,623 --> 01:11:02,414
Hee-young / We’re tired

1323
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:02,848
Jin-ah / Exhausted

1324
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:06,318
Min-woo / I look happy and full right now though?

1325
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:09,664
Jin-ah / Or maybe we’re just relaxed
Ri-won / I’m just savoring it

1326
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:12,190
Ri-won / The seasoning’s just right

1327
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,025
Jin-ah / Yeah, it was cold earlier, but also...

1328
01:11:14,035 --> 01:11:19,441
Jin-ah / Having a hot, clear soup for lunch like this...

1329
01:11:36,491 --> 01:11:39,818
Da-gyo / To make memories

1330
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:43,431
Da-gyo / It looks so pretty when you transfer it to your phone later
Hee-young / Yeah, I love digital camera photos

1331
01:11:47,002 --> 01:11:48,637
Hee-young / Aw, cute

1332
01:11:49,704 --> 01:11:53,698
Da-gyo / Maybe one day we’ll post this on Instagram

1333
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:55,100
Da-gyo / Oh but the flash is too...

1334
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,811
Da-gyo / It’s prettier without the flash

1335
01:11:57,812 --> 01:11:59,971
Da-gyo / This one really came out with that film vibe

1336
01:11:59,981 --> 01:12:00,782
Da-gyo / I’ll take one of you too

1337
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:06,621
Hee-young / Like this kind of feel

1338
01:12:13,428 --> 01:12:14,586
Hee-young / It’s cute!

1339
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:15,997
Da-gyo / You’re right, it looks cute up close

1340
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:27,309
Hee-young / My hair...

1341
01:12:27,442 --> 01:12:28,243
Da-gyo / What? It looks fine!

1342
01:12:29,377 --> 01:12:30,802
Da-gyo / You can just edit stuff like that

1343
01:12:30,812 --> 01:12:32,314
Hee-young / But all of this becomes a memory

1344
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:33,481
Hee-young / Why is my hair like this?
