1
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,579
Cute

2
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,281
I want a romantic kind of relationship

3
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,017
Something very natural

4
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,764
I want a relationship that's loving and confidently shown

5
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,769
Sometimes like family, sometimes like friends

6
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:40,807
I want to experience a sweet and beautiful relationship

7
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:45,644
Someone I can seriously imagine a future with

8
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:48,213
That's the kind of person I want to meet

9
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:51,084
There's someone I really like

10
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,387
I want to create good memories together

11
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:59,616
I feel like I might miss out on the love of my life

12
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,694
I came because I didn’t want any regrets

13
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,932
I want to be more confident in myself

14
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:10,503
And I came here to find true love

15
00:02:34,587 --> 00:02:36,346
I’m going to make her truly happy

16
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,025
That determination is so strong

17
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:42,795
I want a relationship with no question marks

18
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:47,533
People often say my eyes smile when I laugh

19
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:52,538
I want to have a romantic love in Jeju Island

20
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,276
I’ll make sure you never regret meeting me

21
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:59,011
I’ll always keep you happy

22
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,781
I’m going to give it my all until the end

23
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:04,917
To win her heart

24
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,921
No backing down

25
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,014
The way someone looks at me?

26
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,693
I think I’m really drawn to that

27
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:18,530
A good scent also makes someone more attractive to me

28
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:22,635
We’re absolutely meant to meet

29
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,859
I’m the type who falls at first sight

30
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,651
I never send mixed signals

31
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,353
I’ll do everything I can

32
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:32,998
I’m the kind who fights to win

33
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,490
People say I look chic

34
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,102
And very feminine at first

35
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:40,373
But actually I’m really easygoing inside

36
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,109
I often hear I’m not what I seem

37
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,705
People say I look small and cute at first glance

38
00:05:48,715 --> 00:05:49,906
Like a little fairy

39
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,508
I like the kind you can hold close in your arms

40
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,753
That’s my type

41
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,978
If I had a rival

42
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,724
I think it’d actually be fun

43
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,760
Seeing the person I like smile

44
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,795
That’s what love is for me

45
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,126
Ri-won / The house is so pretty

46
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:37,296
Ri-won / I was really excited

47
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,771
I’m going to make her truly happy

48
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,783
That determination is so strong

49
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,642
People often say my eyes smile when I laugh

50
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:03,212
I'm going to give it my all until the end

51
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,014
The way someone looks at me?

52
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,527
That kind of thing really draws me in

53
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,053
Ri-won / Everyone's voices are slightly different

54
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:14,033
Ri-won / And I feel like some personalities are starting to show too

55
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,536
Ri-won / I was really excited wondering who else would come

56
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,972
Ri-won / That anticipation was huge for me

57
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,010
Ri-won / I'm thirsty...

58
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,626
Ri-won / Hello

59
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,484
Ri-won / Nice to meet you

60
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,685
Hello

61
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:19,265
Ri-won / I think you should read this

62
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,338
Ri-won / I... I can't say my name

63
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,474
Are you here alone?
Ri-won / I... I... my name...

64
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:31,711
Ri-won / Yeah... I'm alone... I came alone (?)

65
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,228
Ri-won / You looked so good I kind of froze

66
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,797
Ri-won / I think I was a little stiff because you were unexpectedly stunning

67
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,668
Ri-won / I guess we have to wait for everyone to arrive

68
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,747
Hee-young / So we can say names now

69
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:08,847
Ri-won / Your name?

70
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:10,182
Ri-won / Your name?
Hee-young / I'm Park Hee-young

71
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,674
Ri-won / I'm Ri-won

72
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,352
Ri-won / I'm Kim Ri-won

73
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,111
Ri-won / Hee-won?

74
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:16,679
Hee-young / Hee-young
Ri-won / Hee-young

75
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,359
Ri-won / Nice to meet you, Hee-young

76
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,989
People often say I look cold or intense at first

77
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,734
I hear that a lot

78
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,870
But when people meet me in person

79
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,973
They say I'm brighter and more gentle than expected

80
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,743
My charm is in how brightly I smile

81
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,368
What kind of love?

82
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:43,649
I’ve been curious or interested at first sight

83
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:47,119
But I don't think I've truly fallen in love at first sight

84
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,512
For me, the more I get to know someone

85
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:53,025
The more deeply I fall in love

86
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,928
I’m really drawn to people who are mature and strong inside

87
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,963
That's what attracts me most

88
00:09:57,963 --> 00:10:00,733
If I meet someone, I want us to talk about the future together

89
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,601
To dream of what's ahead

90
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:07,239
I want a relationship that's fun and comfortable

91
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,812
Ri-won / It's not too cold today, right?

92
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,023
Ri-won / It's not too cold today, right?
Hee-young / No, it’s really nice

93
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:25,524
Ri-won / Okay

94
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:33,799
Ri-won / But if we can’t share anything except our names, what do we talk about?

95
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,936
Ri-won / There’s not much to talk about if we can’t share info

96
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,870
Ri-won / There’s not much to talk about if we can’t share info
Hee-young / Yeah, just names

97
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,841
Hee-young / What’s your name’s Chinese characters?

98
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,212
Hee-young / What does your name mean in Chinese characters?

99
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,738
Ri-won / It’s Ri for village and Won for carriage shaft

100
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,350
Ri-won / So my friends tease me by calling me 'village chief

101
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,754
Hee-young / Village chief...

102
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:58,057
Ri-won / What does your name mean, Hee-young?

103
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:03,863
Hee-young / Hee as in shining bright (熙), Young as in glorious (榮)

104
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,267
Ri-won / Oh~ that’s a nice meaning

105
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,202
Hee-young / My grandfather gave it to me

106
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,572
Hee-young / But seriously, we can only talk about names

107
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,040
Ri-won / We really have to talk clichés

108
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,044
Ri-won / Jeju has such beautiful scenery

109
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:22,248
Ri-won / This place even has a pool

110
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,349
Ri-won / It’s really nice

111
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,184
Hee-young / There's a pool?

112
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,520
Ri-won / Yeah, there’s a pool here

113
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,058
Ri-won / Did you bring a swimsuit?

114
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,960
Ri-won / Did you bring a swimsuit?
Hee-young / Yeah

115
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,496
Ri-won / Is it a bikini?

116
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,398
Hee-young / ...Yeah

117
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,194
Hee-young / But I’m shy

118
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,729
Hee-young / I’m a Confucian girl, you know

119
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,408
Hee-young / So I’m going to cover up on top

120
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:53,812
Hee-young / This is fun

121
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,339
Hee-young / She talked to me so comfortably and kindly

122
00:11:57,349 --> 00:12:01,820
Hee-young / It was really fun and gave me butterflies

123
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:06,759
Hee-young / I got excited because someone so nice was here

124
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,969
My style is when I discover someone’s charm

125
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,271
It’s like a light turns on in my heart

126
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,807
And I fall for them all at once

127
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,312
When I see a moment that shows their unique charm

128
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:28,981
That’s when I start to like them more

129
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,387
I like people with pretty hands

130
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,790
There’s something sexy about watching hands

131
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,427
I think a bright personality really suits me

132
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:46,432
My ideal type is someone with long hair and a cute vibe

133
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,658
As long as the age gap isn’t huge, I don’t mind

134
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,604
I’m okay with it unless it’s like a 12-year gap

135
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:55,874
My charm point is how caring I am

136
00:12:55,874 --> 00:13:00,713
I’m thoughtful and can take good care of someone

137
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,020
If I end up in a love triangle

138
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,223
I’ll do my absolute best

139
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,860
And give my all to win

140
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,669
Ri-won / Oh, someone’s here

141
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,308
Hee-young / Oh no... when she comes...

142
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,444
Hee-young / How should we greet her?

143
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,553
Ri-won / Should we go meet her?

144
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,593
Seo-yeon / Hello

145
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:57,993
Ri-won / Your name is...?

146
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,529
Ri-won / We can’t say anything except names right now

147
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,497
Seo-yeon / Oh really?

148
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,877
Ri-won / Yeah, they told us not to say anything but our names

149
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:08,247
Seo-yeon / I’m Seo-yeon

150
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,384
Hee-young / Your last name is Seo...?

151
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,120
Seo-yeon / I'm Kim Seo-yeon

152
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,691
Ri-won / I'm Kim Ri-won

153
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,749
Seo-yeon / Kim Ri-won?

154
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:21,794
Hee-young / I'm Park Hee-young

155
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:23,319
Hee-young / I'm Park Hee-young
Seo-yeon / Hee-yeon? Park Hee-yeon?

156
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,253
Hee-young / It's "Young"

157
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:24,830
Seo-yeon / Hee-young?

158
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,366
Seo-yeon / Nice to meet you

159
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,168
Hee-young / Nice to meet you too

160
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,805
Ri-won / As soon as Seo-yeon showed up

161
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:36,008
Ri-won / Her smile was so pretty

162
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,943
Ri-won / I really liked that

163
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:41,080
Ri-won / I think I thought, I’m glad I came here

164
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,450
Seo-yeon / You’re both so pretty

165
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,218
Seo-yeon / When our eyes met

166
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:50,112
Seo-yeon / That moment I thought, this is it

167
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,358
Seo-yeon / It was all so new and I got nervous

168
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:55,818
Seo-yeon / Then suddenly I felt super hyped

169
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,164
Seo-yeon / I was really fluttering

170
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,190
Seo-yeon / This place is so pretty though

171
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,458
Hee-young / It’s gorgeous

172
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,535
Seo-yeon / Seriously

173
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:06,638
Seo-yeon / Since we can't share info

174
00:15:06,638 --> 00:15:08,364
Seo-yeon / Small talk is really hard

175
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,643
Ri-won / But it's a bit better with one more person

176
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,433
Ri-won / Right?

177
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,944
Ri-won / That pressure though... haha

178
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:16,448
Ri-won / We were practically squeezing out words to say

179
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,351
Ri-won / We ran out of things to talk about so suddenly Hee-young asked

180
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,787
Ri-won / What her name means in Chinese characters

181
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,890
Hee-young / I mean, that’s all we could ask

182
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,627
Seo-yeon / So we can’t even talk about things like MBTI?

183
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,318
Ri-won / I don’t think so...?

184
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:33,565
Ri-won / They said absolutely no info except names

185
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,768
Hee-young / Did you read that thing?

186
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,202
Seo-yeon / No

187
00:15:38,303 --> 00:15:41,039
Seo-yeon / Morning duty by random draw?

188
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,711
Hee-young / I think we decide who cooks by drawing lots

189
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:47,746
Ri-won / But seriously

190
00:15:48,112 --> 00:15:50,615
Ri-won / Isn’t that just a disguised flirting setup?

191
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,819
Ri-won / Like cooking breakfast together just the two of you...

192
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,144
Seo-yeon / But if it’s random

193
00:15:56,154 --> 00:16:00,025
Seo-yeon / And someone can’t cook

194
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:01,893
Seo-yeon / That could cause tension, right?

195
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:06,665
Seo-yeon / I haven’t cooked in like a year

196
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:11,126
Ri-won / If we just look up a recipe online and cook together

197
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,972
Ri-won / I can’t cook either, so we’d manage

198
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:16,975
Hee-young / As long as it’s edible, we’re good

199
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:17,376
Seo-yeon / True

200
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,580
Ri-won / Did you bring a swimsuit?

201
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,505
Seo-yeon / Of course

202
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,250
Seo-yeon / Oh but swimming, I...

203
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,818
Seo-yeon / I'm like a freshwater snail(?)

204
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:29,555
Hee-young / A freshwater snail?
Ri-won / Do you like that?

205
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:32,156
Seo-yeon / I just like sticking around in the water

206
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,326
Seo-yeon / More than swimming, just being still in the water

207
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,627
Hee-young / Like dipping your feet in?

208
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:38,730
Ri-won / Uh... what was it...

209
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,365
Ri-won / Bikini?

210
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:41,966
Seo-yeon / No, I’m actually very conservative

211
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,193
Ri-won / A one-piece swimsuit?

212
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:46,294
Seo-yeon / Yes, that’s right

213
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:47,472
Seo-yeon / Yes, that’s right
Ri-won / I think it’ll suit you

214
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,340
Seo-yeon / Are you wearing a bikini?

215
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,441
Ri-won / Oh yes, I am

216
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,799
Seo-yeon / Whoa really?

217
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,778
Ri-won / Yeah, even here I’m in a bikini...

218
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,482
Hee-young / You must really like bikinis

219
00:16:57,482 --> 00:17:00,151
Hee-young / You even gave a thumbs up earlier

220
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:09,327
Ri-won / I think the fourth person should hurry up and come

221
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:18,370
Oh mama~

222
00:17:24,876 --> 00:17:25,677
Hwit

223
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,446
Ugh so heavy

224
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,832
Finally...!

225
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:52,036
Seo-yeon / She’s here~
Ri-won / Fourth! The fourth one

226
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,179
Hello

227
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:09,287
Should I just sit here?

228
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:10,722
Should I just sit here?
Ri-won / Yeah

229
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,132
Ri-won / We can’t say anything except our names

230
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:21,966
Ah okay

231
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:25,737
Hee-young / There are also house rules over there

232
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:30,164
I think I’m like a “pet-like cat” personality

233
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:32,533
When I want to get close to someone

234
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:35,637
I open my heart completely, just to that person

235
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,450
My friends say it feels like being chosen

236
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,787
I’ve heard that a lot, so I think I’m that type

237
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,589
When I’m in love, I become most honest

238
00:18:44,589 --> 00:18:47,359
And probably the most bold too

239
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:51,963
I want my partner to be someone
who can give me the biggest comfort

240
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:54,532
And a sense of relief

241
00:18:54,532 --> 00:18:57,536
Then I think I’d be a lot happier

242
00:18:57,535 --> 00:18:59,971
I like people with a kind appearance

243
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:04,075
And someone with a strong, firm body

244
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,378
When I meet someone I like

245
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,414
I want to experience the relationship I’ve always dreamed of

246
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,950
A relationship where we can seriously imagine a future together

247
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,651
That’s the kind of love I want

248
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,317
Hee-young / What’s your name?

249
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:25,163
Jin-ah / I’m Jin-ah, Kim Jin-ah

250
00:19:26,664 --> 00:19:28,767
Ri-won / So that was her voice earlier

251
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:32,970
Ri-won / That soft, moist voice… like a news anchor

252
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:33,539
Jin-ah / No, not at all

253
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:36,808
Seo-yeon / You remember all that?

254
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,544
Ri-won / Yeah, there was one voice that really stuck with me

255
00:19:40,211 --> 00:19:41,746
Hee-young / Could you tell us your name one more time?

256
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:42,814
Hee-young / Could you tell us your name one more time?
Jin-ah / I’m Kim Jin-ah

257
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:45,006
Ri-won / Your name really suits you

258
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:46,574
Ri-won / And it goes well with your short hair too

259
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:48,753
Jin-ah / This is actually my first time cutting it this short

260
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:50,254
Jin-ah / I used to have really long hair

261
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:51,790
Jin-ah / Like, super long

262
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:54,626
Seo-yeon / Short hair really suits you

263
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,484
Jin-ah / I look so round though

264
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:58,596
Jin-ah / I look so round though
Ri-won / But that’s your charm, isn’t it?

265
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:02,333
Jin-ah / You know those round pea plushies from Daiso?

266
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:03,669
Jin-ah / Everything's round...

267
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,593
Ri-won / I don’t know them but that sounds cute

268
00:20:05,603 --> 00:20:08,339
Jin-ah / I get them as gifts a lot

269
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:09,541
Jin-ah / Because I’m so round

270
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:14,912
Hee-young / Are they saying you look like one...?

271
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:20,652
Hee-young / Your voice is so soft and calm

272
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:24,455
Hee-young / I think that’s when I started to feel a bit excited

273
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:27,225
Ri-won / You really sound like a news anchor

274
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,484
Ri-won / You really sound like a news anchor
Jin-ah / No way, but thank you

275
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:41,372
Jin-ah / Wait, wait

276
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:43,074
Jin-ah / You were just smiling like that

277
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,443
Ri-won / She has such a smiley face

278
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:46,801
Ri-won / Like a happy puppy

279
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:47,802
Seo-yeon / Huh? A puppy?

280
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:49,480
Ri-won / No, I said happy puppy!

281
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:58,056
Jin-ah / Seo-yeon has features that really suit a bright smile

282
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,992
Jin-ah / And she gave such a pretty one

283
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:05,119
Jin-ah / I thought Hee-young wouldn’t smile much

284
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:06,988
Jin-ah / But her eye smile was so lovely

285
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:09,233
Jin-ah / That moment kind of stayed with me

286
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:13,437
Jin-ah / I just thought, her eye smile is really beautiful

287
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:15,329
Jin-ah / There were so many cats on the street

288
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:16,464
Jin-ah / I actually have cats

289
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:17,442
Ri-won / Me too

290
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,143
Jin-ah / I have two

291
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:18,966
Jin-ah / Two cats
Ri-won / Me too

292
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,178
Jin-ah / You do too?

293
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:25,316
Hee-young / Do you have a cat?

294
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,385
Seo-yeon / I have a dog back at my parents’

295
00:21:27,752 --> 00:21:29,010
Ri-won / You do look like a dog person

296
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,720
Jin-ah / True

297
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:30,922
Hee-young / Yeah, dog face type

298
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:35,393
Ri-won / Cat type, dog type

299
00:21:36,093 --> 00:21:38,162
Ri-won / Ca... cat type?

300
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:41,166
Hee-young / Pea plush type!

301
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:44,902
Ri-won / Kind of a bunny face?

302
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,871
Jin-ah / People say I’m a mix of everything

303
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:48,262
Jin-ah / Half dog, half cat, apparently

304
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:50,241
Jin-ah / Half dog, half cat
Ri-won / So you’re a puppy-cat type then

305
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:51,943
Jin-ah / You definitely look like a puppy type

306
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,014
Jin-ah / Ri-won, you’re totally a bunny

307
00:21:56,013 --> 00:21:57,638
Ri-won / Yeah, I get that a lot

308
00:21:57,648 --> 00:21:59,207
Ri-won / I get cat or bunny most often

309
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:00,218
Ri-won / Cat-bunny?

310
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:02,487
Jin-ah / And Hee-young is kind of...

311
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,511
Jin-ah / Like Pocahontas?

312
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:04,946
Hee-young / Pocahontas?

313
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:05,790
Ri-won / What’s that?

314
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:08,260
Ri-won / Disney?

315
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:09,994
Jin-ah / A strong and independent Disney type

316
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:15,067
Hee-young / I like that

317
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:19,137
Ri-won / That outfit is so intense and cool

318
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:21,038
Ri-won / You’ve got serious presence

319
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,875
Ri-won / I thought you might work in fashion

320
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,410
Jin-ah / People who dress well

321
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,944
Jin-ah / Often wear dark colors like that

322
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:31,015
Jin-ah / That’s my fashion dream, but I’ve never pulled it off

323
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:32,351
Ri-won / Not just anyone could pull it off

324
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,518
Ri-won / Not just anyone could pull it off
Hee-young / Let’s do it together

325
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:36,520
Ri-won / I don’t think I could pull it off

326
00:22:36,787 --> 00:22:40,659
Hee-young / I’ve actually never dressed like this before

327
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:58,399
Ri-won / Oh? Isn’t someone coming?

328
00:22:58,409 --> 00:22:59,510
Seo-yeon / Someone’s here~

329
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:15,059
Am I the only one who looks huge?

330
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,935
Hello

331
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,140
Hello

332
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,875
Should I leave my slippers on?

333
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,285
Hello

334
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,822
Hello

335
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:48,392
Nice to meet you

336
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,834
Jin-ah / Ah the chair... is it uncomfortable?

337
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,635
Seo-yeon / No, I’m comfortable

338
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,171
Jin-ah / I was worried you might be uncomfortable...

339
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:15,554
If I had to describe myself in one phrase, I’d say “a serious bulldozer”

340
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:19,691
I don’t think how long you’ve known someone really matters

341
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:23,027
I want a romantic relationship

342
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:27,398
When I want to get close to someone

343
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:31,402
I get super affectionate

344
00:24:31,402 --> 00:24:35,339
Even if just one person has a crush on me

345
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:36,874
Isn’t that a good thing?

346
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:42,079
I’m really drawn to pure and innocent-looking women

347
00:24:42,947 --> 00:24:45,383
When I like someone, I go straight for them

348
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,220
I want to be 100% honest with my feelings

349
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:52,623
If I like someone, I’ll keep saying I like them to the end

350
00:24:52,623 --> 00:25:00,365
Someday, maybe I’ll meet someone I can call unnie

351
00:25:08,939 --> 00:25:10,474
Hee-young / What’s your name?

352
00:25:10,975 --> 00:25:13,911
Han-kyul / I’m Jeong Han-kyul

353
00:25:14,178 --> 00:25:15,646
Hee-young / Han-kyul

354
00:25:16,747 --> 00:25:18,349
Ri-won / Han-kyul

355
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,386
Ri-won / I think I was really fluttering

356
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:23,921
Ri-won / I knew right away when I heard the voice I liked

357
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:25,490
Ri-won / It was Han-kyul

358
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,760
Ri-won / Something about being drawn to her gaze, I think?

359
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:32,286
Ri-won / There’s this energy in her voice

360
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:35,256
Ri-won / I felt like she’s totally my type

361
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:39,837
Ri-won / She gave off a quiet and introverted vibe

362
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:42,373
Seo-yeon / I’m Kim Seo-yeon

363
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:44,108
Han-kyul / Seo-yeon...

364
00:25:44,108 --> 00:25:46,511
Hee-young / I’m Park Hee-young

365
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,813
Ri-won / I’m Kim Ri-won, Ri-won

366
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,949
Hee-young / Do you think you can remember all this?

367
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:53,407
Han-kyul / I’m good at remembering names

368
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:54,552
Han-kyul / I’m good at remembering names
Hee-young / Oh really?

369
00:25:55,953 --> 00:26:00,358
Han-kyul / The one who caught my eye the most was Hee-young

370
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:02,427
Han-kyul / She has a great figure

371
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,363
Han-kyul / And very unique features

372
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:10,401
Han-kyul / I was really drawn to that

373
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:20,011
Ri-won / I want to hear Han-kyul’s voice

374
00:26:20,244 --> 00:26:21,246
Han-kyul / Okay

375
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:27,018
Han-kyul / I get really awkward when I talk at first meetings

376
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:31,556
Han-kyul / So I try to hold back a bit at the start

377
00:26:32,323 --> 00:26:35,560
Han-kyul / When I first meet someone

378
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,996
Han-kyul / I don’t like to share too much about myself

379
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:42,323
Han-kyul / I want to get a feel for the person first

380
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:45,436
Han-kyul / And when I’m with a group, I tend to stay quiet

381
00:26:45,436 --> 00:26:47,872
Han-kyul / I’ve decided that’s better

382
00:26:49,273 --> 00:26:53,444
Seo-yeon / Han-kyul, you kind of seem like a writer

383
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:57,071
Han-kyul / I can’t reveal that just yet

384
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:59,250
Ri-won / Whoa, so strict! You’re totally a T!

385
00:26:59,683 --> 00:27:01,152
Ri-won / Your MBTI must be T! Just guessing

386
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,655
Ri-won / I think you're probably an I and a T

387
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,644
People always say I give a good first impression

388
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,647
They say I'm pretty too

389
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:33,785
Before getting close, I try to initiate conversation a lot

390
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:37,054
I try to help set the tone and keep the vibe up

391
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:40,058
I really wanted to meet people

392
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:43,827
And get to know them deeply, so I applied

393
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,955
When I like someone, I tend to make it obvious

394
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:49,957
Even if someone likes me

395
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:54,138
If I don’t like them back, I won’t develop feelings

396
00:27:54,538 --> 00:28:00,077
As for older women, I think I’m okay with up to a 10-year gap

397
00:28:00,077 --> 00:28:02,813
I want to meet someone I can seriously picture a future with

398
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:06,050
Someone I can think about the long term with

399
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,845
Ri-won / Oh? Isn’t someone coming?

400
00:28:41,185 --> 00:28:43,054
Ri-won / Or maybe not...?

401
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,489
Ri-won / Should I go check?

402
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:49,860
Ri-won / Oh! She's here

403
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:54,399
Hee-young / She's here?

404
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:56,534
Hee-young / She's here?
Ri-won / Yes, she is

405
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:00,905
Jin-ah / She must’ve been really surprised

406
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,197
Ri-won / She was so shocked—her eyes were already big

407
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:04,375
Ri-won / But they got even bigger

408
00:29:08,312 --> 00:29:10,348
Hello

409
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:13,117
Hello

410
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,558
Jin-ah / Hello

411
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:21,759
Jin-ah / Hello
Da-gyo / Hello

412
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,760
Ri-won / Nice to meet you

413
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,929
Ri-won / We’re only allowed to say our names

414
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:28,799
Da-gyo / Ah, hold on, let me take this jacket off first

415
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,736
Ri-won / Oh~ You smell so nice

416
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:35,372
Ri-won / Right? The scent is really nice

417
00:29:35,372 --> 00:29:37,565
Ri-won / Right? The scent is really nice
Da-gyo / It’s just hot

418
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,489
Da-gyo / Have you all said your names?

419
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,392
Seo-yeon / Yeah, we’ve all said ours

420
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:56,961
Da-gyo / I'm Park Da-gyo

421
00:29:57,828 --> 00:29:59,797
Da-gyo / Park Da-gyo

422
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:11,342
Da-gyo / From the start, Han-kyul was sitting quietly

423
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:15,446
Da-gyo / But we kept making eye contact

424
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,314
Da-gyo / Even though we just met

425
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:19,616
Da-gyo / I wondered… is she flirting with me?

426
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,360
Da-gyo / Um, can I get some water?

427
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,996
Da-gyo / Um, can I get some water?
Jin-ah / Want sparkling water? I haven’t opened it

428
00:30:31,995 --> 00:30:33,831
Da-gyo / Thank you

429
00:30:43,674 --> 00:30:46,110
There was this voice that said she wants a love with no question marks

430
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,648
It was so confident, it really stood out to me

431
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:53,283
And I wanted to meet her

432
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:10,902
Ri-won / I think someone just arrived… or not?

433
00:31:19,176 --> 00:31:20,611
Jin-ah / Ohh, hello!

434
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:27,084
Hee-young / Hello

435
00:31:27,084 --> 00:31:30,120
Ri-won / You must be the very last one

436
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:45,069
People say I seem cold or chic at first

437
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:51,475
But I’m actually super playful and affectionate once you get to know me

438
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:53,710
When someone takes good care of me

439
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,813
I tend to like them more

440
00:31:55,813 --> 00:32:00,317
I’ve always fallen in love at first sight

441
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:03,220
My ideal type is someone kind, who takes care of herself

442
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,989
And has a pretty smile

443
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,857
I like pretty women

444
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:12,863
If I truly love someone, I’d want to get married

445
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:18,069
I think I’d show more affection to someone I like

446
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:24,675
I want a relationship where we can build a future together

447
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,386
Mi-rang / I’m Kim Mi...ra...ng

448
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,157
Mi-rang / Kim Mi-rang

449
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:42,693
Da-gyo / Rang? Ohh~

450
00:32:43,827 --> 00:32:44,728
Mi-rang / Da-gyo

451
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:48,366
Mi-rang / She looked graceful

452
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:52,393
Mi-rang / I thought, she’s kind of my type

453
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,273
Da-gyo / The people who stood out most to me physically

454
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,331
Da-gyo / Were Hee-young and Mi-rang

455
00:32:57,341 --> 00:33:00,701
Da-gyo / They were the first ones who caught my eye

456
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:03,313
Ri-won / No one here knows each other, right?

457
00:33:04,381 --> 00:33:06,016
Ri-won / I don’t know anyone at all

458
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,186
Da-gyo / Me neither

459
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,720
Mi-rang / I do

460
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:13,146
Jin-ah / Oh really?

461
00:33:13,156 --> 00:33:15,292
Ri-won / I had a feeling! That’s why I asked

462
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:16,127
Jin-ah / YouTube?

463
00:33:16,126 --> 00:33:17,217
Jin-ah / YouTube?
Mi-rang / Yeah

464
00:33:17,227 --> 00:33:19,520
Mi-rang / I even followed her on Instagram

465
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,754
Jin-ah / Oh really?

466
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:21,665
Jin-ah / Oh my gosh

467
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,940
Jin-ah / I think your ears are turning red right now

468
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:32,076
Hee-young / They’re all red

469
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,779
Hee-young / It’s not like we really know each other

470
00:33:34,812 --> 00:33:36,480
Hee-young / More like an acquaintance

471
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:39,216
Mi-rang / I know her, but she probably doesn’t know me

472
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,485
Jin-ah / Then you probably know what she does too?

473
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,756
Ri-won / Announcer! I think she’s an announcer

474
00:33:46,624 --> 00:33:48,459
Jin-ah / Well, we’ll see...

475
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,008
Ri-won / Oh, roommates!?

476
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:09,881
Seo-yeon / Oh, roommates!?

477
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,384
Jin-ah / Honestly, I want to share a room with someone I like

478
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:15,986
Jin-ah / I think my charm shows more

479
00:34:15,986 --> 00:34:18,388
Jin-ah / When I’m one-on-one with someone

480
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,327
Hee-young / Honestly, I’d prefer a single room

481
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:24,695
Hee-young / But if it’s with someone I like

482
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,331
Hee-young / Or someone I can talk comfortably with

483
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,300
Hee-young / Then a shared room would be fine too

484
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,529
Mi-rang / I like being around people

485
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,475
Mi-rang / So I never want to stay in a single room

486
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:40,878
Mi-rang / I’d want a double or triple room

487
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,785
Hee-young / Can we look around now?

488
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:55,059
Jin-ah / Since this is room #1, should we look around first then decide?

489
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,296
Sounds good

490
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,031
Let’s go!

491
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:46,644
I really love this kind of thing

492
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:51,482
Feels like we’ll be close

493
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,386
We should wear these properly

494
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,395
You must watch TikTok a lot

495
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:05,495
No I don’t

496
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,064
I don’t even have TikTok

497
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:09,566
But that one’s just so famous

498
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:19,943
Ah~ It’s right next door

499
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,645
So close

500
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,855
The kitchen is so pretty

501
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,691
It’s the same layout here anyway

502
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,327
But this one definitely feels more spacious

503
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,267
I like this room

504
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,803
I want to sleep here

505
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,185
So cute

506
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,253
Ri-won / So cozy

507
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:07,190
Jin-ah / It’d be so nice here with someone you like

508
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,293
Ri-won / I want this one

509
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,996
Seo-yeon / I think I’d be too shy

510
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,335
Oh the kitchen is so pretty

511
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,938
This one really is more spacious

512
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,673
Should we head back?

513
00:37:29,279 --> 00:37:32,282
Mi-rang / Should we decide the order first?

514
00:37:32,282 --> 00:37:35,685
Jin-ah / Anyone really sure about where they want to stay?

515
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,612
Da-gyo / Or someone you clearly want to room with?

516
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:43,727
Ri-won / Ah we’ve barely met and now this...

517
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,296
Mi-rang / Can I go first then?

518
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:47,798
Mi-rang / If no one else can decide?

519
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,567
Ri-won / Go ahead, that sounds good

520
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:57,608
Mi-rang / I thought I’d feel more comfortable

521
00:37:57,607 --> 00:37:58,875
Mi-rang / Choosing first and being chosen

522
00:37:58,875 --> 00:38:01,311
Mi-rang / So I wrote my name down first

523
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,816
Seo-yeon / I want to be on the first floor too

524
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:06,717
Mi-rang / First floor?

525
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:07,451
Seo-yeon / Yeah, Seo-yeon

526
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,525
Jin-ah / I’ll take Room #1

527
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,965
Hee-young / Then I’ll go there too

528
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,300
Mi-rang / Here?

529
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:30,908
Ri-won / I’m actually kind of drawn to the attic room upstairs

530
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,183
Da-gyo / Do you have a place you want?

531
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,485
Han-kyul / I’ll just take whatever’s left

532
00:38:42,453 --> 00:38:45,255
Da-gyo / Then I’ll take the second floor

533
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,992
Da-gyo / Oh wait, no—I’ll take this one

534
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:04,508
Han-kyul / You don’t mind... do you?

535
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:21,892
This one's perfect

536
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,199
Mi-rang / Which side do you want to sleep on?

537
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:30,100
Mi-rang / Which side do you want to sleep on?
Seo-yeon / I don’t mind

538
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,035
Seo-yeon / I’ll take this side

539
00:39:31,034 --> 00:39:33,637
Mi-rang / Okay, I’ll take this one then

540
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:35,505
Mi-rang / I think this room is the best one honestly

541
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,007
Seo-yeon / I agree

542
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,275
Mi-rang / No matter where you go, the layout...

543
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:39,109
Mi-rang / No matter where you go, the layout...
Seo-yeon / Yeah, exactly

544
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,245
Seo-yeon / We should definitely unpack now...

545
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:43,547
Seo-yeon / We should definitely unpack now...
Mi-rang / Want me to bring the suitcase...

546
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,850
Seo-yeon / Huh? No it’s okay
Mi-rang / Your name’s Ri-won?

547
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:49,719
Mi-rang / Just tear this part off when you leave

548
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,455
Seo-yeon / Oh you used Coupang for this?

549
00:39:51,454 --> 00:39:53,324
Seo-yeon / That one belongs to Ri-won...

550
00:39:53,323 --> 00:39:54,625
Mi-rang / Isn’t it Ri-won’s?

551
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:55,926
Mi-rang / Oh right? That’s your name?

552
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,551
Seo-yeon / Me?

553
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,429
Seo-yeon / I’m Seo-yeon

554
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:01,622
Mi-rang / I’m so sorry

555
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:05,025
Mi-rang / Ah, here you are, Seo-yeon
Seo-yeon / That hurt a little...

556
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:07,872
Mi-rang / I’m sorry

557
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,007
Mi-rang / This is too funny

558
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:11,475
Seo-yeon / Thank you

559
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,644
Seo-yeon / Mi-rang is honestly

560
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:17,781
Seo-yeon / More clumsy than I expected, but it’s cute

561
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:21,985
Seo-yeon / I’m really happy with her as my roommate

562
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:27,124
Ri-won / Han-kyul, do you have a side you want to take?

563
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,983
Han-kyul / Are the hangers different?

564
00:40:29,993 --> 00:40:32,930
Ri-won / I just have a lot of stuff to hang over here

565
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:33,921
Han-kyul / Then take this side

566
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,633
Ri-won / Thank you

567
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:37,624
Han-kyul / I’ll take this bed then

568
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:39,603
Ri-won / Yeah, sounds good

569
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:43,073
Han-kyul / It feels pretty cozy

570
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,543
Ri-won / I told you this room was nice

571
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:48,778
Ri-won / Of course the others are great too

572
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:52,916
Ri-won / But this one has a certain vibe that’s just unique to it

573
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,828
Han-kyul / If I knew they had things like wet wipes stocked here

574
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:08,065
Han-kyul / I would’ve packed lighter—I brought everything

575
00:41:08,832 --> 00:41:10,500
Ri-won / INTJ!

576
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,504
Han-kyul / Should I really be this exposed?

577
00:41:13,503 --> 00:41:16,306
Ri-won / I just really love MBTI stuff

578
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,374
Han-kyul / Oh, you like it?

579
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:19,933
Ri-won / Yeah, I can usually tell just by looking

580
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:21,045
Han-kyul / You’re like an expert...

581
00:41:21,044 --> 00:41:23,236
Ri-won / Yeah, I get a feel for it

582
00:41:23,246 --> 00:41:27,917
Han-kyul / Then you should switch careers!

583
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,376
Ri-won / Switch careers?

584
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:31,855
Han-kyul / Into something MBTI-related

585
00:41:31,855 --> 00:41:35,358
Ri-won / What I was worried about is...

586
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:37,984
Ri-won / One of the traits I look for in an ideal type

587
00:41:37,994 --> 00:41:39,530
Ri-won / I like people who are “I” types

588
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:42,432
Han-kyul / Oh? Can I ask why?

589
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,868
Ri-won / I don’t know, I’m just drawn to introverts

590
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:45,559
Ri-won / They’re cute

591
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:47,026
Han-kyul / Are you an extrovert?

592
00:41:47,036 --> 00:41:48,228
Ri-won / Yeah, I am

593
00:41:48,238 --> 00:41:49,873
Ri-won / I mean, you can totally tell right?

594
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,209
Han-kyul / You know that meme? Have you seen it?

595
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:55,045
Han-kyul / Extrovert face vs. introvert face

596
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:58,338
Han-kyul / The eyes are kind of like…

597
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:01,718
Han-kyul / Like they could kill you—in a good way though

598
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,989
Ri-won / You’re so cute seriously…

599
00:42:04,988 --> 00:42:07,581
Ri-won / I hope this doesn’t sound rude, but

600
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:11,394
Ri-won / She gives off the vibe of a brave little kitten

601
00:42:11,895 --> 00:42:16,499
Han-kyul / Maybe she's someone who suits me well? I hope so

602
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,349
Da-gyo / I feel like I don’t even need to hang my clothes

603
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,708
Jin-ah / Same here, I’m only taking out what I’ll wear the next day

604
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,887
Da-gyo / I think I can just open the suitcase as I go and wear stuff

605
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,457
Jin-ah / If I hang things up it’s gonna turn into chaos

606
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,359
Jin-ah / Like a total mess I can’t clean up

607
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,330
Da-gyo / Did you plan what to wear on day two and day three?

608
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,030
Da-gyo / Did you plan it out?

609
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,564
Da-gyo / Did you plan it out?
Jin-ah / Nope

610
00:42:47,564 --> 00:42:48,155
Da-gyo / Thought so

611
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:50,701
Jin-ah / I just thought about it roughly, it’s all in my head

612
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:55,505
Da-gyo / But honestly, this is so different from what I imagined

613
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:56,606
Hee-young / The people?

614
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:57,074
Da-gyo / Yeah

615
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:57,698
Da-gyo / Yeah
Jin-ah / Me too

616
00:42:57,708 --> 00:43:00,844
Da-gyo / Totally different from the image I had in mind

617
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:03,804
Jin-ah / When I heard their voices I was already like "ah..."

618
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:05,338
Da-gyo / "Ah..."? Really?

619
00:43:05,348 --> 00:43:07,017
Hee-young / What’s that “ah...” mean? Disappointed?

620
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,742
Hee-young / Was it disappointment?
Jin-ah / It’s just... “ah...”

621
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,655
Da-gyo / Can I sit on the bed with my clothes on?

622
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:13,490
Jin-ah / Of course

623
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:16,226
Jin-ah / Then I’d like to declare something—I'd like to sleep here

624
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,429
Jin-ah / I sometimes can't sleep well in unfamiliar places

625
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,553
Jin-ah / So I try going outside

626
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:20,354
Jin-ah / I go for morning walks, you know?

627
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,331
Jin-ah / I go for morning walks
Hee-young / Like walking back and forth?

628
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:23,567
Jin-ah / Yeah like a grandma
Hee-young / Like back and forth like that

629
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:27,804
Da-gyo / I was shocked by how nice the house is

630
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:29,839
Da-gyo / I didn’t know each place would have a pool

631
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,231
Hee-young / Right

632
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:32,909
Da-gyo / I really love water

633
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:34,310
Jin-ah / Me too, I’m like a seal

634
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,578
Da-gyo / A seal? You good at swimming?

635
00:43:35,578 --> 00:43:38,982
Jin-ah / Yeah I can swim underwater with my eyes open

636
00:43:38,982 --> 00:43:39,706
Da-gyo / Really?

637
00:43:39,716 --> 00:43:41,274
Jin-ah / But I can’t wear lenses then

638
00:43:41,284 --> 00:43:42,686
Da-gyo / If I’d known it was that nice

639
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:45,055
Da-gyo / I would’ve brought a floatie or something

640
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:47,490
Da-gyo / I can’t swim though

641
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,060
Jin-ah / I should lay out just what I’ll wear tomorrow

642
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,361
Hee-young / Oh what should I wear tomorrow?

643
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:52,996
Jin-ah / This is the darkest outerwear I brought

644
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:55,031
Jin-ah / This one right here

645
00:43:55,031 --> 00:43:56,533
Hee-young / Really?

646
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,835
Jin-ah / Want me to show you? Look, this is my outerwear

647
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:00,270
Hee-young / We're literally black and white

648
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:00,637
Hee-young / We’re literally black and white
Jin-ah / Right?

649
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:01,738
Hee-young / Seriously, we’re total black and white opposites
Jin-ah / Right?

650
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:04,364
Da-gyo / Your styles are like complete opposites

651
00:44:04,374 --> 00:44:06,843
Jin-ah / But my ideal type is this kind of cool woman

652
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,947
Da-gyo / You know your ideal type is usually the opposite of you, right?

653
00:44:10,947 --> 00:44:14,517
Jin-ah / I’ve always wanted sexy and cool women

654
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:17,177
Jin-ah / And when I say “Aren’t I kind of sexy and cool too?”

655
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:21,291
Jin-ah / My subscribers have been claiming I’m sexy and cool for 10 years

656
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:26,686
Da-gyo / Everyone’s so chill and we all get along

657
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:29,332
Da-gyo / We’re even having some deep conversations

658
00:44:29,332 --> 00:44:32,369
Hee-young / The three of us ended up as roommates

659
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,328
Hee-young / And naturally started talking a lot

660
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,332
Hee-young / They made me feel really at ease

661
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,511
Hee-young / I feel like I’ve opened up a lot just in one day

662
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:51,979
Mi-rang / I brought a padded jacket thinking Jeju would be really cold

663
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,091
Seo-yeon / But if you wear that on a date

664
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,915
Seo-yeon / It might not look that cute

665
00:44:55,926 --> 00:44:57,895
Mi-rang / Oh really?

666
00:44:57,895 --> 00:45:01,265
Mi-rang / I brought two options—one cute and dressed up

667
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:05,902
Mi-rang / And the other more casual, so I can decide later

668
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:16,736
Mi-rang / It’s a little weird organizing stuff with someone I just met

669
00:45:16,746 --> 00:45:20,316
Mi-rang / The vibe is... haha

670
00:45:22,952 --> 00:45:24,587
Mi-rang / Honestly speaking

671
00:45:24,587 --> 00:45:26,413
Mi-rang / If someone I like is right next to me

672
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,525
Mi-rang / I get more nervous

673
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,728
Mi-rang / Since we all don’t really know each other yet

674
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,197
Mi-rang / I just wanted someone I feel comfortable around

675
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:35,232
Mi-rang / That was the biggest thing for me

676
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:41,204
Mi-rang / Take a break, you must be tired

677
00:45:41,204 --> 00:45:44,974
Seo-yeon / Ugh, I’m dying

678
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:47,911
Seo-yeon / Mi-rang, do you already like someone?

679
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,614
Mi-rang / Me? I think I might

680
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:51,572
Seo-yeon / Really?

681
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,616
Mi-rang / Yeah, but I mean it’s still the first day

682
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:54,408
Seo-yeon / Whoa

683
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:58,188
Mi-rang / Yeah, but I mean it’s still the first day

684
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:03,193
Seo-yeon / Right, I mean just seeing someone once...

685
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:04,995
Seo-yeon / I mean, it's not love yet, right?

686
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:05,595
Seo-yeon / It's not love yet, right?
Mi-rang / Just interest?

687
00:46:05,595 --> 00:46:09,633
Seo-yeon / Yeah, even just having some interest is already something

688
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:10,923
Mi-rang / Do you have someone in mind?

689
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:12,635
Seo-yeon / Yeah, I do

690
00:46:12,635 --> 00:46:14,203
Mi-rang / Wow, everyone’s lucky today

691
00:46:14,203 --> 00:46:16,706
Seo-yeon / Can you believe it?

692
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:19,175
Mi-rang / I was seriously worried I wouldn’t like anyone

693
00:46:19,175 --> 00:46:19,700
Seo-yeon / Me too

694
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,167
Seo-yeon / Me too
Mi-rang / Are your standards high?

695
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:25,214
Seo-yeon / No, it’s not that my standards are that high...

696
00:46:25,214 --> 00:46:29,309
Seo-yeon / It’s just that there weren’t really many people like that around me

697
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,054
Mi-rang / You mean meeting that kind of person?

698
00:46:31,454 --> 00:46:32,980
Seo-yeon / Yeah, exactly

699
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:33,813
Seo-yeon / Yeah, exactly
Mi-rang / How many times?

700
00:46:33,823 --> 00:46:36,793
Seo-yeon / Yeah, so

701
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,496
Seo-yeon / I was really worried there might not be anyone I liked

702
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:43,400
Seo-yeon / I mean like... that there wouldn’t be anyone who’s my type

703
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:46,192
Mi-rang / Since we don’t know everyone’s personalities yet

704
00:46:46,202 --> 00:46:48,404
Mi-rang / That’s what I’m most curious about

705
00:46:49,605 --> 00:46:53,977
Seo-yeon / Are you the type who thinks personality is super important?

706
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:57,280
Mi-rang / Yeah, I think that might be pretty important too

707
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,715
Mi-rang / I mean, someone might like long hair

708
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:01,285
Mi-rang / Or have a specific preference like that

709
00:47:02,552 --> 00:47:05,021
Seo-yeon / Do you prefer older or younger partners?

710
00:47:05,021 --> 00:47:08,524
Mi-rang / I used to like older ones

711
00:47:08,524 --> 00:47:10,283
Mi-rang / But there aren’t many older ones around now

712
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:12,428
Mi-rang / So I’ve only been meeting younger ones lately

713
00:47:12,428 --> 00:47:15,599
Mi-rang / And I think they have their own charm too

714
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,071
Seo-yeon / Mine’s a secret

715
00:47:22,572 --> 00:47:25,875
Mi-rang / Ugh you’re annoying, I always say everything

716
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,416
Seo-yeon / This is fun

717
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,842
Mi-rang / But I feel like the others in different rooms

718
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,654
Mi-rang / Are probably getting their faces ready

719
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:40,380
Mi-rang / Should I put makeup on? Ugh, so annoying

720
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:45,329
Seo-yeon / We’re not even going to care later anyway...

721
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,863
Seo-yeon / Oh? Am I a realist?

722
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:50,133
Seo-yeon / Yeah, I’m definitely a realist

723
00:47:55,371 --> 00:47:57,464
Han-kyul / What’s that? The pink thing?

724
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:58,375
Han-kyul / What’s that pink thing?

725
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,812
Han-kyul / What’s that pink thing?
Ri-won / It’s a neck massager

726
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:02,635
Han-kyul / Whoa

727
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:07,250
Han-kyul / The space here is small, which could be a downside

728
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,809
Han-kyul / But maybe it’s actually a plus too

729
00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:11,187
Ri-won / I like it though

730
00:48:11,187 --> 00:48:12,722
Ri-won / It’s cozy and nice

731
00:48:15,124 --> 00:48:16,916
Han-kyul / Since the person I’m sharing with likes it

732
00:48:16,926 --> 00:48:19,686
Han-kyul / I’ll like it too

733
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,870
Han-kyul, come down

734
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:32,608
Han-kyul / You’re both so fair-skinned

735
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:35,078
Ri-won / But the vibe is totally different, like a puppy look

736
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,080
Ri-won / A classic puppy type

737
00:48:38,714 --> 00:48:40,140
Han-kyul / It really feels like

738
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,143
Han-kyul / Like this part of the house smells like strawberry milk

739
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:44,745
Ri-won / Strawberry milk hahaha

740
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:45,722
Ri-won / Strawberry

741
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:46,723
Ri-won / Milk

742
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:48,158
Strawberry milk

743
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:53,397
Han-kyul / You two kind of give off whipped cream cake vibes

744
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:57,167
Ri-won / You feel like espresso, Han-kyul

745
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,503
Han-kyul / Thank you

746
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:00,570
Ri-won / You’re kind of what I go for, right?

747
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:00,937
Ri-won / That’s what I go for, right?
Han-kyul / Yeah

748
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,438
Ri-won / That kind of vibe?
Han-kyul / Yeah

749
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:07,844
Han-kyul / I actually drink decaf more often though

750
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:10,604
Ri-won / Why? Do you get like this if you drink caffeine?

751
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:14,251
Han-kyul / I don’t really like that “heightened” feeling

752
00:49:14,517 --> 00:49:16,720
Ri-won / So you prefer calm vibes, huh?

753
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,613
Han-kyul / I do like the taste of caffeinated coffee though

754
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:23,416
Han-kyul / But after I drink it, I weirdly get hyper

755
00:49:23,426 --> 00:49:25,652
Han-kyul / And I start talking a lot, nonstop

756
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:28,798
Ri-won / Wow, I really want to see Han-kyul tipsy one day

757
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,258
Han-kyul / When I get tipsy, I’m kind of...

758
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:34,271
Seo-yeon / I feel like you'd actually be hilarious

759
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,796
Ri-won / I really want to see it

760
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,575
Ri-won / Someone who doesn’t like being uncomposed

761
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,477
Ri-won / Seeing them drunk? I couldn’t handle it

762
00:49:40,476 --> 00:49:43,012
Han-kyul / Someone who doesn’t like to be uncomposed...

763
00:49:43,012 --> 00:49:45,181
Han-kyul / That’s not really me though

764
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:50,420
Ri-won / You’re just pretty, that’s all~

765
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:56,158
Han-kyul / So you just tell pretty people they’re pretty, huh?

766
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,129
Ri-won / I don’t say that to just anyone, you know?

767
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:02,899
Han-kyul / You two are like... natural compliment machines, huh?

768
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:04,501
Ri-won / I mean, I am good at complimenting

769
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,102
Ri-won / But I can’t say anything I don’t mean

770
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,138
Ri-won / I can’t call someone pretty if I don’t think so

771
00:50:08,137 --> 00:50:09,372
Ri-won / I just can’t

772
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,475
Han-kyul / I’ll believe you

773
00:50:12,475 --> 00:50:15,811
Han-kyul / I think you’re both genuinely beautiful

774
00:50:15,811 --> 00:50:18,838
Ri-won / And I genuinely mean it too, beautiful and beautiful

775
00:50:18,848 --> 00:50:21,985
Ri-won / I genuinely mean it too, beautiful and beautiful
Han-kyul / Everyone’s beautiful

776
00:50:26,122 --> 00:50:27,056
Ri-won / But really, visually

777
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:29,216
Ri-won / Everyone looks better than I expected

778
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:32,719
Ri-won / I got here first and saw everyone

779
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:34,965
Ri-won / I was like “Whoa?” “Wait, what?” over and over

780
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:38,124
Han-kyul / What were you expecting then?

781
00:50:38,134 --> 00:50:40,771
Ri-won / Honestly, I didn’t have high expectations

782
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:43,139
Han-kyul / Why not?

783
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,543
Ri-won / Because I know... how hard it is

784
00:50:47,543 --> 00:50:48,444
Ri-won / For LGBTQ folks

785
00:50:48,444 --> 00:50:50,046
Ri-won / To be on a show like this

786
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,550
Ri-won / With the restrictions around jobs and stuff

787
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,084
Ri-won / And how people see us

788
00:50:55,084 --> 00:50:58,354
Ri-won / I mean I look like a total hetero woman

789
00:50:58,354 --> 00:51:01,324
Ri-won / All dolled up and sparkly and whatever

790
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:04,794
Ri-won / I just wish those stereotypes would go away

791
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:08,131
Ri-won / Because your appearance has nothing to do with

792
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:10,499
Ri-won / What kind of person you're attracted to

793
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,924
Han-kyul / I really get what you mean

794
00:51:11,934 --> 00:51:13,760
Han-kyul / And honestly, that mindset is so cool

795
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:17,574
Ri-won / That’s why even if it’s uncomfortable, I choose to dress like this

796
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,809
Han-kyul / You go even further with it

797
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:22,745
Han-kyul / I’m kind of touched right now

798
00:51:22,745 --> 00:51:24,737
Ri-won / I came here to fall in love

799
00:51:24,747 --> 00:51:27,451
Seo-yeon / We all came here to fall in love

800
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:29,085
Han-kyul / We did come here for love, but...

801
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:31,220
Han-kyul / We’re being brave—putting ourselves out there for love

802
00:51:32,121 --> 00:51:33,556
Actually…

803
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:36,526
What was that? Did something come?

804
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:48,705
Ri-won / A message of the heart…

805
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:19,603
Ri-won / Notes feel a little more mysterious than calls

806
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:22,361
Ri-won / That makes it more fun somehow

807
00:52:24,507 --> 00:52:28,735
Seo-yeon / Send a note anonymously to the person

808
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:31,771
Seo-yeon / Who made the best first impression on you

809
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,107
Jin-ah / Anonymously?

810
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:36,409
Jin-ah / The pink one is too obvious

811
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:41,658
Jin-ah / The hot pink one stands out way too much haha

812
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:48,955
Hee-young / It’s been so long since I expressed my feelings like this

813
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,357
Hee-young / It made my heart flutter

814
00:52:51,367 --> 00:52:55,762
Han-kyul / I wrote it like I was under a spell, in admiration

815
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,797
Han-kyul / Like I was dreaming of someone

816
00:52:57,807 --> 00:53:00,000
Jin-ah / Usually handwritten letters are for

817
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,412
Jin-ah / People you're really close with

818
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:03,670
Jin-ah / Or know well

819
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,573
Jin-ah / But this time, writing a note to someone I barely know

820
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:11,044
Jin-ah / It felt… kind of new

821
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,846
Jin-ah / A totally new feeling

822
00:53:13,923 --> 00:53:17,116
Da-gyo / I didn’t write to the person I first liked

823
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:19,352
Da-gyo / But to someone I felt reached out to me first

824
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:23,256
Da-gyo / Someone I thought made the first move

825
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:27,627
Mi-rang / When I write letters, I usually think it over deeply

826
00:53:27,636 --> 00:53:30,162
Mi-rang / And rewrite them neatly on real stationery

827
00:53:30,172 --> 00:53:33,199
Mi-rang / But we’ve only just met this time

828
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:37,237
Mi-rang / So I kept it short and simple

829
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:40,083
Mi-rang / I don’t think I expressed 100% of what I feel

830
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:16,442
Jin-ah / What if no one wrote me one?

831
00:54:16,452 --> 00:54:18,811
Hee-young / That’s possible

832
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:19,789
Da-gyo / Wait, but

833
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,457
Da-gyo / Are we checking this in front of everyone?

834
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:27,097
Mi-rang / I didn’t…

835
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,098
Mi-rang / I didn’t write one?

836
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:38,941
Mi-rang / Was this a practice run or something?

837
00:54:54,523 --> 00:54:55,858
Mi-rang / Wait, what?

838
00:55:34,997 --> 00:55:38,891
Seo-yeon / Honestly, I didn’t expect to get one—because

839
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:41,527
Seo-yeon / Since we met,

840
00:55:41,537 --> 00:55:45,642
Seo-yeon / No one really gave me any kind of signal

841
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:19,532
Seo-yeon / If I had to guess who voted for me

842
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,834
Seo-yeon / I’d say Ri-won or Jin-ah

843
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:24,003
Seo-yeon / Judging from the hearts I saw

844
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:28,317
Seo-yeon / That’s just my speculation

845
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,615
To. Ri-won

846
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:02,051
Thanks for asking about my perfume today

847
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:05,555
It made me feel like putting it on was worth it

848
00:57:06,288 --> 00:57:07,647
Ri-won / Da-gyo, what perfume are you wearing?

849
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:08,958
Ri-won / Da-gyo, what perfume are you wearing?
Da-gyo / My perfume?

850
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,952
Da-gyo / Did you like it?

851
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:14,097
Ri-won / Yes

852
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,258
Da-gyo / You came out to greet me right when I opened the door

853
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,460
Da-gyo / I didn’t change rooms with bad intentions

854
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:23,095
Da-gyo / Please don’t take it the wrong way

855
00:57:23,105 --> 00:57:26,065
Ri-won / That was you, Da-gyo? But honestly,

856
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:30,169
Ri-won / I'd rather get chosen by one person I really like

857
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:34,416
Ri-won / Than be picked by a bunch of people I’m not into

858
00:57:34,683 --> 00:57:37,787
Da-gyo / I’ll watch from here then

859
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:44,894
Da-gyo / I thought there’d be nothing, so I was really surprised

860
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:48,564
Da-gyo / I thought I’d just been quiet...

861
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,938
To. Da-gyo

862
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:59,375
You're quieter than the others, which makes me want to get to know you more!

863
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:03,246
You’re beautiful

864
00:58:03,245 --> 00:58:04,937
Da-gyo / I knew right away who it was

865
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:08,107
Da-gyo / As soon as I saw the note, I could just tell

866
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,643
Da-gyo / The image popped up in my head—Han-kyul

867
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,321
Da-gyo / That’s what I thought immediately

868
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:29,996
Han-kyul / When I opened the note box

869
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:34,066
Han-kyul / There wasn’t a single one for me

870
00:58:34,076 --> 00:58:38,237
Han-kyul / I was just going to move on calmly because

871
00:58:38,247 --> 00:58:42,175
Han-kyul / I figured someone has to fill the nerd role

872
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,110
Han-kyul / That’s what I told myself

873
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:47,847
Han-kyul / Like, I guess I’ll just coast through quietly

874
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,059
Han-kyul / That’s how I felt...

875
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,462
Where am I going?

876
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:55,365
Then I’ll just watch from here too

877
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:06,899
Jin-ah / As soon as I saw the handwriting on the note

878
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:10,103
Jin-ah / It looked like the handwriting of someone I admire

879
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,538
Jin-ah / A mature vibe—maybe Han-kyul or Hee-young?

880
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:17,587
Jin-ah / That’s what came to mind when I looked at it

881
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:37,162
Hee-young / I was honestly so shocked

882
00:59:37,172 --> 00:59:38,798
Hee-young / I really didn’t get it

883
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:44,614
Hee-young / Like, we never even interacted—why me?

884
00:59:48,951 --> 00:59:53,055
Hee-young / I seriously have no clue who it was. I mean it

885
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:55,425
Seo-yeon / You have really pretty eyes

886
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,061
Seo-yeon / I’d like to get to know you better

887
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:00,296
Seo-yeon / Nice to meet you

888
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:04,299
Seo-yeon / I wrote my note to Park Hee-young

889
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,536
Han-kyul / To. Hee-young

890
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:09,038
Han-kyul / Even when we were all together at first

891
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:14,877
Han-kyul / I could barely look at anyone else… Like 99.9% you haha

892
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:17,346
Jin-ah / Dear Hee-young

893
01:00:17,346 --> 01:00:19,248
Jin-ah / I’m really shy

894
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:22,285
Jin-ah / So I usually can’t hold eye contact

895
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:25,177
Jin-ah / But your sharp gaze really struck me

896
01:00:25,187 --> 01:00:29,025
Jin-ah / It left a lingering impression

897
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:42,037
Hee-young / Oh my god

898
01:01:11,767 --> 01:01:15,037
Mi-rang / This is such a thrill

899
01:01:18,874 --> 01:01:21,234
Mi-rang / But I wasn’t shocked or anything

900
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:24,747
Mi-rang / I’ll just win them over

901
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:32,188
We messed up

902
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,094
Wow I'm really curious

903
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:39,495
Wow I'm seriously curious

904
01:01:39,495 --> 01:01:42,120
Jin-ah / Why? Are you getting tons of attention?

905
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:43,188
Jin-ah / Why? Are you super popular or something?
Da-gyo / What is it?

906
01:01:43,198 --> 01:01:46,692
Hee-young / What are we supposed to do with this?

907
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:48,194
Jin-ah / This is so fun though

908
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,706
Jin-ah / What are we supposed to do? What is this?

909
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,207
Da-gyo / Right?

910
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:54,800
Jin-ah / I'm basically just a viewer right now

911
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:57,180
Jin-ah / Watching Hee-young react, then Da-gyo

912
01:01:57,179 --> 01:02:00,405
Jin-ah / It’s like I’m watching a VCR and commenting like a panelist

913
01:02:00,415 --> 01:02:03,652
Jin-ah / Da-gyo looks at me from over there

914
01:02:03,652 --> 01:02:05,645
Jin-ah / And makes gestures like this

915
01:02:05,655 --> 01:02:08,680
Hee-young / Wait, you could actually see that from here?

916
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:12,351
Jin-ah / Da-gyo is doing this right now

917
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,729
Jin-ah / This is so funny

918
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:18,067
Hee-young / So, wanna go on a date?

919
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:21,037
Hee-young / So, are we dating now?

920
01:02:30,746 --> 01:02:34,440
Jin-ah / I really think they’re determined to make someone happy

921
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,543
Jin-ah / I want a relationship without question marks

922
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:40,780
Seo-yeon / People often say I have pretty eye smiles when I laugh

923
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:44,917
Seo-yeon / I want a romantic love here in Jeju

924
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:48,554
Ri-won / I fall at first sight, and I never leave someone confused

925
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:54,103
Ri-won / I’ll always make sure you never regret meeting me

926
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,396
Hee-young / I’m going to give it my all till the very end

927
01:02:57,406 --> 01:03:00,366
Hee-young / To win them over

928
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,935
Hee-young / No backing down

929
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:06,906
Han-kyul / The way someone looks at me—that gaze really draws me in

930
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:11,176
Han-kyul / Once I’m sure of someone, I go all in

931
01:03:11,186 --> 01:03:15,081
Da-gyo / My charm point is the kind of gaze that draws people in

932
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:18,817
Da-gyo / When someone smells good, my interest goes up

933
01:03:18,827 --> 01:03:23,488
Mi-rang / Once I fall for someone, whether it's a year or two

934
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:26,335
Mi-rang / It’s inevitable—she’ll end up dating me
