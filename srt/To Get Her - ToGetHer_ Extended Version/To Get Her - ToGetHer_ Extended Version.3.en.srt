1
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,533
Ri-won / Something’s here

2
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:14,346
Again? Again?

3
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:42,176
Jin-ah / The one I'm most curious about right now...

4
00:00:42,246 --> 00:00:44,459
Ri-won / I’m curious...

5
00:00:51,499 --> 00:00:55,539
Da-gyo / I usually revise and think for a long time

6
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:58,169
Da-gyo / I'm someone who puts a lot of thought into my words

7
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:01,049
Da-gyo / But with the note I had to write and send right away

8
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:03,369
Da-gyo / I had to write it in a more straightforward way

9
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:05,699
Da-gyo / So I think it’s a bit regretful I couldn’t express more

10
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,889
Han-kyul / I think the recipient’s feelings

11
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:12,129
Han-kyul / Aren’t something I can control

12
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:14,529
Han-kyul / Or even predict

13
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:17,769
Han-kyul / So I just wanted to be honest with my feelings

14
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:19,769
Han-kyul / Say what I wanted to say

15
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,809
Han-kyul / And leave behind what I wanted to convey

16
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,557
Han-kyul / That was the biggest thing for me

17
00:01:25,746 --> 00:01:30,376
Ri-won / It’s only the first day, but

18
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:31,776
Ri-won / I think I’ve already made up my mind

19
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:36,102
Ri-won / I’m just going to go for it, I like cute people

20
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,188
Mi-rang / It's not clear yet

21
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:41,238
Mi-rang / But I think it’s going to change

22
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:44,588
Seo-yeon / It’s a different person from the first impression vote

23
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:46,748
Seo-yeon / At dinner we had a bit of a conversation

24
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:50,908
Seo-yeon / I chose someone I shared a lot in common with

25
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:52,228
Seo-yeon / I saw a brighter side of them

26
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,868
Seo-yeon / I wanted to get to know them more

27
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:56,428
Seo-yeon / I saw that side of them

28
00:01:56,438 --> 00:01:58,118
Seo-yeon / So that’s why I made that choice

29
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:04,068
Hee-young / Even just me writing it down

30
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:05,868
Hee-young / Could be a burden, right? So

31
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:07,588
Hee-young / I wondered if I should write about someone else?

32
00:02:07,598 --> 00:02:10,388
Hee-young / I thought a lot about that...

33
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,518
Jin-ah / Curious...

34
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:30,378
Hee-young / You told me to fix my hair, right?

35
00:02:31,578 --> 00:02:33,178
Da-gyo / Sounds like chaos

36
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:35,898
Da-gyo / A message came

37
00:02:36,098 --> 00:02:36,728
Jin-ah / Me?

38
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:38,178
Hee-young / I think everyone’s got one now

39
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:51,968
Mi-rang / Again?

40
00:02:51,978 --> 00:02:53,978
Seo-yeon / I don’t really want to open it

41
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:17,248
Han-kyul / Rather than write it all out in detail

42
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:21,088
Han-kyul / I thought about the lyrics of this song

43
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:26,488
Han-kyul / And wanted to say ‘this was the impression I had of you’

44
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,938
Han-kyul / So I just left the song title

45
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,178
Da-gyo / Uh... what is this?

46
00:03:38,898 --> 00:03:40,208
Seo-yeon / To. Da-gyo

47
00:03:40,218 --> 00:03:41,568
Seo-yeon / I like your pretty smile

48
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:42,728
Seo-yeon / It's so lovely

49
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:44,538
Seo-yeon / I want to get to know you more

50
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:51,808
Da-gyo / One sounds like it’s from Han-kyul

51
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:53,408
Da-gyo / And the other one feels like Mi-rang

52
00:03:53,418 --> 00:03:58,688
Da-gyo / After dinner when we were coming back to our room it was cold

53
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:02,448
Da-gyo / And the two of them both offered to lend me a coat

54
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,768
Da-gyo / So they each went to their rooms

55
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:07,128
Da-gyo / But Mi-rang was a bit quicker

56
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:08,928
Da-gyo / So I ended up wearing Mi-rang’s coat

57
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:10,048
Da-gyo / And seeing that

58
00:04:10,058 --> 00:04:13,492
Da-gyo / I’m thinking maybe it was Mi-rang?

59
00:04:42,553 --> 00:04:43,583
Dear. Mi-rang

60
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:45,583
It’s just that...

61
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:47,263
I feel like if we talk one-on-one,

62
00:04:47,273 --> 00:04:49,903
we could really get to know each other better

63
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,664
So I'm curious hehe

64
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:10,518
Mi-rang / Huh?!

65
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:14,118
Mi-rang / Ahaha!

66
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:17,388
Mi-rang / Oh~

67
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:18,268
Seo-yeon / Do you know who it is?

68
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:18,788
Mi-rang / Huh?

69
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:19,798
Seo-yeon / Do you know who it is?

70
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:25,908
Mi-rang / I think I do...

71
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:27,118
Mi-rang / Or maybe not?

72
00:05:28,398 --> 00:05:30,748
Mi-rang / This drawing looks like a suitcase though?

73
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:32,158
Seo-yeon / Oh?

74
00:05:34,678 --> 00:05:36,478
Mi-rang / Oh, maybe not?

75
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,228
Mi-rang / Ahaha seriously...

76
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:42,518
Mi-rang / I have no idea, I really don’t know

77
00:05:46,798 --> 00:05:48,108
Mi-rang / I really don’t know

78
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:51,268
Mi-rang / In our room, Seo-yeon’s suitcase

79
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:53,988
Mi-rang / Is blue and pink like that

80
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:57,548
Mi-rang / And the note had that drawn on it

81
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,348
Mi-rang / So I thought it was from Seo-yeon

82
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,158
Mi-rang / But she seemed totally clueless

83
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:04,897
Seo-yeon / But honestly, I really have no idea who it is either

84
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:12,188
Seo-yeon / Now you know why I kept looking at it earlier?

85
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:13,638
Seo-yeon / Why I kept checking that note

86
00:06:14,998 --> 00:06:17,148
Mi-rang / I keep looking at it too

87
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:20,188
Mi-rang / I mean I’m happy I got a note, but also

88
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:23,428
Mi-rang / I think it’s the content inside that made me happier

89
00:06:23,438 --> 00:06:27,228
Mi-rang / The lines that were crossed out were witty

90
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:30,790
Mi-rang / And the suitcase drawing was clever and cute

91
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:44,443
Mi-rang / If it were about who I’m interested in, I would’ve written down Hee-young

92
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:47,295
Jin-ah / But since it asked who I’m curious about

93
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:51,415
Jin-ah / Mi-rang already knew who I was

94
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:54,695
Jin-ah / I figured she could tell me more about Jin-ah as a girlfriend

95
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,175
Jin-ah / Even if she didn’t know me well

96
00:06:57,185 --> 00:06:59,295
Jin-ah / Seo-yeon was speaking very curiously

97
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:01,655
Jin-ah / About Mi-rang

98
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:04,535
Jin-ah / So I think I also became curious about her unique charm

99
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:07,575
Jin-ah / That’s why I initially wrote ‘I’m curious in many ways’

100
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:10,095
Jin-ah / But then deleted it because it felt vague

101
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:12,775
Jin-ah / So I erased it because it felt too unclear

102
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:15,785
Jin-ah / I deleted it because it felt vague

103
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:33,288
Hee-young / To. Jin-ah

104
00:07:33,298 --> 00:07:37,128
Hee-young / I had so many questions but didn’t get to ask them today

105
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:38,928
Hee-young / Let’s try to figure them out next time

106
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:40,848
Mi-rang / To. Jin-ah

107
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:45,058
Mi-rang / I’m curious if your heart fluttered on today’s date

108
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:47,728
Mi-rang / When we played the question game

109
00:07:47,738 --> 00:07:51,888
Mi-rang / I feel like we kept making eye contact here and there

110
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:54,928
Mi-rang / I thought, ‘I want to go on a date with Jin-ah’

111
00:07:54,938 --> 00:07:56,928
Mi-rang / ‘I want to talk one-on-one with her’

112
00:07:56,938 --> 00:07:59,618
Mi-rang / So I just chose Jin-ah...

113
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:03,441
Jin-ah / One person I can guess, the other I can’t

114
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,481
Jin-ah / On the note I first sent to Hee-young

115
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:06,441
Jin-ah / There were flowers

116
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,681
Jin-ah / So I thought, ‘Oh, this is from Hee-young!’

117
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:09,841
Jin-ah / But the other one

118
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:11,441
Jin-ah / I have no idea who it’s from

119
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:14,001
Jin-ah / It was written in blue ink

120
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:16,841
Jin-ah / Mi-rang definitely knows I like pink

121
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:17,961
Jin-ah / She definitely knows that

122
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:20,931
Jin-ah / So I really have no clue

123
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,242
Hee-young / After going on the date it felt like a set formula

124
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:47,522
Hee-young / Everyone was just following that

125
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:49,162
Hee-young / Who would’ve dared to write anything?

126
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:51,812
Hee-young / I already assumed it was a given outcome

127
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,242
Hee-young / I felt a mix of relief from not getting one

128
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:57,452
Hee-young / And disappointment at the same time

129
00:08:57,932 --> 00:08:58,882
Jin-ah / For me

130
00:08:58,892 --> 00:08:59,922
Jin-ah / Since it was about curiosity

131
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:03,162
Jin-ah / I thought this note was different from a note of interest

132
00:09:03,172 --> 00:09:06,322
Jin-ah / But after not sending it

133
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:08,452
Jin-ah / It actually hurt a little

134
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,362
Jin-ah / While opening the notes

135
00:09:10,372 --> 00:09:12,642
Jin-ah / I realized I actually do have feelings

136
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,722
Jin-ah / Not sending one to this person

137
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:16,892
Jin-ah / Was bothering me this much

138
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:41,155
Seo-yeon / I couldn’t read the signal that someone had feelings for me

139
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,355
Seo-yeon / So I didn’t really expect anything

140
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,635
Seo-yeon / I had no expectations so

141
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:48,075
Seo-yeon / When I first received one, I was surprised

142
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:53,765
Seo-yeon / But the second time, I wasn’t really affected

143
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:13,243
Ri-won / To. Han-kyul

144
00:10:13,253 --> 00:10:16,203
Ri-won / Why don’t you like being called a baby?

145
00:10:16,213 --> 00:10:20,083
Ri-won / I feel like things are going in an unexpected direction

146
00:10:20,093 --> 00:10:22,573
Ri-won / You’re definitely charming!

147
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:25,163
Han-kyul / When I opened the first letter,

148
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:27,763
Han-kyul / the person who called me a baby

149
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:30,283
Ri-won / was only Ri-won

150
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:33,613
Han-kyul / so I could tell right away it was from her

151
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:39,173
Ri-won / Do you have one?

152
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:43,603
Ri-won / Oh, you do!

153
00:10:43,613 --> 00:10:44,963
Ri-won / How many?

154
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:45,923
Han-kyul / Two

155
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:47,693
Ri-won / Ooh~ Popular girl

156
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:50,163
Ri-won / But someone else wrote one too, besides me

157
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:52,958
Ri-won / I’m curious who it was, besides me

158
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,808
Da-gyo / To. Han-kyul

159
00:10:54,818 --> 00:10:57,768
Da-gyo / Thanks for expressing yourself a lot during dinner

160
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:00,408
Da-gyo / It was only the first day so we couldn’t talk much

161
00:11:00,418 --> 00:11:01,738
Da-gyo / Let’s get to know each other more

162
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:06,528
Da-gyo / I think I wrote this with the thought that

163
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:07,498
Da-gyo / I should return the feelings of someone who came to me directly

164
00:11:09,698 --> 00:11:11,568
Han-kyul / Just the handwriting...

165
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:14,168
Han-kyul / I couldn’t even recognize the handwriting

166
00:11:14,178 --> 00:11:15,728
Han-kyul / Maybe I gave too many compliments

167
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:17,728
Han-kyul / To too many people?

168
00:11:17,738 --> 00:11:20,128
Han-kyul / I suddenly felt regret

169
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,888
Han-kyul / The moment I got the note

170
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:24,808
Han-kyul / I started getting confused and felt regret

171
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:30,162
Han-kyul / Maybe I should’ve just gone straight for the one person I was most drawn to

172
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:00,336
Ri-won / Getting zero votes is painful

173
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:01,896
Han-kyul / I got zero at first too

174
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:03,666
Ri-won / Shocking!

175
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,616
Ri-won / I was really disappointed, still am honestly

176
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,096
Ri-won / It’s just... I didn’t get one from you, that’s what I’m sad about

177
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:13,706
Ri-won / Because you knew I sent one to you

178
00:12:20,498 --> 00:12:23,888
Mi-rang / Ugh I really don’t know who it is

179
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:26,608
Mi-rang / I have no clue at all, seriously

180
00:12:26,618 --> 00:12:28,338
Seo-yeon / I didn’t get one this time

181
00:12:29,138 --> 00:12:30,858
Seo-yeon / I didn’t get one this time

182
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:35,408
Mi-rang / But who knows, things will keep changing

183
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:36,568
Mi-rang / It keeps changing

184
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:40,728
Seo-yeon / Right? And the notes...

185
00:12:40,738 --> 00:12:42,808
Seo-yeon / They might not come, then they come again

186
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:46,168
Seo-yeon / Then they come, then stop again—stuff like that

187
00:12:46,178 --> 00:12:49,538
Mi-rang / Just think of them like bills in the mail

188
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,528
Mi-rang / Stay relaxed

189
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:57,728
Mi-rang / But you know, Seo-yeon, earlier you said

190
00:12:57,738 --> 00:13:00,848
Mi-rang / You were quiet because you had a lot on your mind

191
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:04,408
Mi-rang / So others might’ve felt unsure and thought

192
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:07,448
Mi-rang / ‘Maybe she’s not interested in me’

193
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,848
Mi-rang / Thinking like that, and then...

194
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:10,408
Mi-rang / That could’ve happened

195
00:13:10,418 --> 00:13:12,568
Seo-yeon / Oh that makes sense

196
00:13:12,578 --> 00:13:16,648
Seo-yeon / That’s really not what I meant, it’s just...

197
00:13:16,658 --> 00:13:19,288
Seo-yeon / That’s just how I am

198
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,368
Seo-yeon / I think I came here with so much

199
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:24,818
Seo-yeon / Intention and emotional investment

200
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:27,728
Seo-yeon / That’s probably why I’m like this now

201
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:30,088
Mi-rang / If you get too anxious

202
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:32,288
Mi-rang / Things might not go well even if they could

203
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:34,218
Mi-rang / So just go slow

204
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:38,168
Seo-yeon / I really like people who are cute

205
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:42,408
Seo-yeon / But when they also seem reliable and mature

206
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:44,928
Seo-yeon / There’s this underlying cuteness too

207
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:46,528
Seo-yeon / Like a bit clumsy

208
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:48,808
Seo-yeon / But also when I felt like I was faltering

209
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:51,448
Seo-yeon / They were there to hold me steady

210
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:56,648
Seo-yeon / So in that moment, I think I was like, ‘Oh?!’

211
00:13:56,658 --> 00:13:59,538
Seo-yeon / I seem like I fall for people quickly, don’t I?

212
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,728
Da-gyo / How are we sleeping tonight?

213
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:05,258
Da-gyo / I’ll ask Jin-ah when she comes in later

214
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:09,088
Da-gyo / I’ll go with whatever you two decide

215
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,008
Hee-young / But isn’t that kind of too...

216
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,608
Da-gyo / Right, that’s why...

217
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:16,218
Da-gyo / I’m fine with sleeping between you two

218
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:17,608
Hee-young / The three of us together?

219
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:19,168
Da-gyo / Even though we had a date today

220
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:20,328
Da-gyo / It’s still just the beginning

221
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:22,328
Da-gyo / Maybe one of us doesn’t want to take it that far yet

222
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:24,648
Da-gyo / But the mood could pressure it that way

223
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:25,888
Da-gyo / You know what I mean?

224
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,128
Hee-young / Yeah, I get it...

225
00:14:27,138 --> 00:14:29,458
Da-gyo / Nothing’s been decided yet

226
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:31,408
Hee-young / If it feels too forced

227
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:34,488
Hee-young / I start to feel uncomfortable

228
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,258
Hee-young / And the other person might too

229
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:40,498
Hee-young / If we end up even sharing a bed in that situation, it’s just too...

230
00:14:41,258 --> 00:14:43,338
Hee-young / It’s not like even a full day has passed

231
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:51,608
Hee-young / I just came back from being with someone

232
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:54,618
Hee-young / and haven’t really talked to anyone else

233
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:57,688
Hee-young / So I honestly don’t know what to do now

234
00:14:57,698 --> 00:14:59,648
Hee-young / There were a lot of limitations on the date today

235
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:01,208
Hee-young / I couldn’t get my questions answered

236
00:15:01,218 --> 00:15:03,578
Hee-young / I’m still curious, but...

237
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:07,328
Hee-young / I want to be a little more cautious

238
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:09,848
Hee-young / but it feels like there are no options

239
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:11,568
Da-gyo / Right, because you came in late

240
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,138
Da-gyo / You only did that game just now

241
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:19,138
Hee-young / What do I do about the bed...

242
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,528
Hee-young / What should I do?

243
00:15:21,538 --> 00:15:25,138
Hee-young / I didn’t think all this would happen in the meantime

244
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:33,458
Da-gyo / I really don’t know
Hee-young / This is hilarious

245
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:38,233
Han-kyul / First impressions were so hard

246
00:15:38,393 --> 00:15:41,233
Ri-won / But that’s really just because it was the first impression

247
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:45,143
Ri-won / Mine has changed

248
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,743
Mi-rang / Mine too

249
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:48,393
Ri-won / It changed?
Han-kyul / Yeah

250
00:15:48,673 --> 00:15:53,543
Han-kyul / At first, I was 100% just judging

251
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:56,263
Han-kyul / based on how people looked from afar

252
00:15:56,273 --> 00:15:59,103
Han-kyul / because we only had like 30 minutes or an hour

253
00:15:59,113 --> 00:16:02,793
Han-kyul / But after sending the letter and taking a closer look

254
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:08,343
Han-kyul / I could see more clearly what matched my taste

255
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:12,823
Han-kyul / During the first impression letter, I was overwhelmed and felt distant

256
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,343
Han-kyul / So I couldn’t really

257
00:16:15,353 --> 00:16:19,753
Han-kyul / see each person’s face or charm in detail

258
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:25,513
Han-kyul / I was just going off of the vibe I got in the moment

259
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:30,983
Mi-rang / It’s important to look at the inside too, not just the outside

260
00:16:30,993 --> 00:16:32,703
Ri-won / I think that’s really important too

261
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:34,663
Ri-won / Honestly,

262
00:16:34,673 --> 00:16:38,023
Ri-won / I first picked someone because of their looks

263
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,543
Ri-won / I picked who I liked the most visually

264
00:16:39,553 --> 00:16:42,353
Ri-won / It’s not that I disliked the others

265
00:16:42,713 --> 00:16:44,463
Ri-won / But once I actually talked with them

266
00:16:44,473 --> 00:16:47,383
Ri-won / I felt like they weren’t quite the type I was looking for

267
00:16:47,393 --> 00:16:48,783
Ri-won / So my pick changed

268
00:16:48,793 --> 00:16:52,393
Han-kyul / I have this thing—if someone likes movies, I feel drawn to them

269
00:16:54,073 --> 00:16:56,783
Han-kyul / Even if they’re not my type visually

270
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:58,983
Ri-won / Like cinephiles and all that

271
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:02,463
Ri-won / Do you know the movie *Blind*?

272
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:05,233
Han-kyul / Yeah, the one with the blind woman

273
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:06,383
Ri-won / And the blind man

274
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:07,703
Han-kyul / Oh! The blind guy, right

275
00:17:07,713 --> 00:17:09,263
Ri-won / You know *Blind*?

276
00:17:09,273 --> 00:17:10,543
Han-kyul / Of course

277
00:17:10,553 --> 00:17:11,783
Ri-won / You really love movies, huh

278
00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:13,063
Han-kyul / The old woman with white hair is in it

279
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,103
Ri-won / Who reads books to him

280
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:14,623
Han-kyul / And then...

281
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,633
Ri-won / You remember the ending?

282
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,223
Ri-won / The icicle

283
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:18,193
Han-kyul / I remember

284
00:17:19,553 --> 00:17:20,543
Han-kyul / Is that your all-time favorite movie?

285
00:17:20,553 --> 00:17:21,943
Ri-won / Same here

286
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:22,783
Han-kyul / Really?

287
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:23,423
Ri-won / Yeah

288
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:27,623
Ri-won / *Blind* and a few others I really like

289
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:29,063
Ri-won / I think I like movies like that

290
00:17:29,073 --> 00:17:30,313
Ri-won / The quiet kind?

291
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:32,503
Ri-won / You keep

292
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:36,063
Ri-won / talking about movies and music

293
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:39,263
Ri-won / So it kind of feels like I’m talking to a critic

294
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:41,103
Ri-won / It gives off that vibe

295
00:17:41,113 --> 00:17:42,823
Ri-won / But I just think it’s cute

296
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,233
Ri-won / I find it cute

297
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,583
Ri-won / I really liked the time we had earlier

298
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:49,143
Han-kyul / Which time...?

299
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:50,383
Ri-won / The time we talked a lot

300
00:17:50,393 --> 00:17:53,063
Han-kyul / Yeah, it was fun

301
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,953
Ri-won / I got to understand your view on dating

302
00:17:57,513 --> 00:18:00,273
Ri-won / Do you like receiving arm pillows? Or giving them?

303
00:18:00,593 --> 00:18:01,983
Han-kyul / Me? Arm pillows...

304
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:03,823
Han-kyul / I absolutely can’t

305
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,583
Ri-won / Really?

306
00:18:04,593 --> 00:18:06,303
Han-kyul / I can never lie on someone’s arm

307
00:18:06,313 --> 00:18:07,953
Ri-won / Is it uncomfortable?

308
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:11,543
Han-kyul / It’s more like, when someone

309
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:13,103
Han-kyul / is holding out for me, enduring something

310
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:14,383
Han-kyul / That feeling...

311
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,783
Han-kyul / stresses me out

312
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:18,943
Ri-won / But what if the other person is enjoying it? Like they’re really happy

313
00:18:18,953 --> 00:18:20,903
Han-kyul / If they truly say they’re enjoying it

314
00:18:20,913 --> 00:18:23,063
Han-kyul / and make it obvious

315
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:25,943
Han-kyul / and they’re really open about it, then I’m fine with it

316
00:18:25,953 --> 00:18:28,743
Han-kyul / Like, “I like you so much

317
00:18:28,753 --> 00:18:29,703
Han-kyul / that I want to do this,”

318
00:18:29,713 --> 00:18:32,183
Han-kyul / if they say something like that,

319
00:18:32,193 --> 00:18:33,663
Han-kyul / I’d really like that

320
00:18:33,673 --> 00:18:35,903
Han-kyul / But I’ve never met anyone

321
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:38,143
Han-kyul / who’s liked me that openly

322
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:38,743
Ri-won / Why not?

323
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:40,983
Han-kyul / I’ve always been the one who liked them

324
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:41,743
Ri-won / Really?

325
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:46,103
Han-kyul / I don’t really have a desire to receive anything

326
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:50,223
Han-kyul / and when someone does something for me, I can’t handle it

327
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,943
Han-kyul / It’s not that I hate it

328
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:56,303
Han-kyul / but just knowing they’re spending their time on me

329
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:58,423
Han-kyul / makes me feel so guilty

330
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:00,993
Ri-won / Feels like you’re in their debt, huh?

331
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:04,223
Ri-won / That’s because you’re kind at heart, genuinely kind

332
00:19:04,233 --> 00:19:05,303
Ri-won / You’re really kind deep down

333
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:07,623
Mi-rang / I used to be like that too

334
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:10,943
Mi-rang / Feeling burdened by receiving things

335
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:13,583
Mi-rang / But now I don’t think that way anymore

336
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:16,743
Mi-rang / It’s just about giving and receiving equally

337
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:19,343
Mi-rang / I think if you meet someone who’s expressive

338
00:19:19,353 --> 00:19:21,743
Mi-rang / you’d be a good match

339
00:19:21,753 --> 00:19:23,183
Ri-won / You're kind of like a baby cat

340
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:24,863
Mi-rang / Someone who's gentle and good with words

341
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:26,993
Ri-won / A baby cat...

342
00:19:27,273 --> 00:19:31,433
Ri-won / Han-kyul still seems kind of pure?

343
00:19:32,313 --> 00:19:36,383
Ri-won / Like the kind of innocence that only younger people have

344
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:38,233
Ri-won / I felt that from you a bit

345
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:41,473
Ri-won / Do you like receiving or giving arm pillows?

346
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:42,633
Mi-rang / Me?

347
00:19:42,953 --> 00:19:45,863
Mi-rang / Honestly, I’m 50/50 on this

348
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:46,743
Ri-won / You like both?

349
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:49,023
Mi-rang / It feels weird if I’m always the one giving

350
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:50,233
Ri-won / True

351
00:19:52,073 --> 00:19:54,663
Mi-rang / And if I only receive, that doesn’t feel right either

352
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:58,663
Han-kyul / You seem like the most easygoing dating style

353
00:20:00,153 --> 00:20:03,353
Ri-won / The most mature

354
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,503
Han-kyul / Yeah, like a real grown-up

355
00:20:06,513 --> 00:20:08,143
Han-kyul / From the way you talked to me,

356
00:20:08,153 --> 00:20:11,073
Han-kyul / you were the kindest

357
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:14,073
Han-kyul / and the warmest

358
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:16,063
Han-kyul / You gave off a dependable vibe

359
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:17,983
Mi-rang / But I’m also pretty clumsy...

360
00:20:17,993 --> 00:20:20,743
Ri-won / That’s part of your charm
Han-kyul / It is charming

361
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,503
Ri-won / After getting to know you, Mi-rang,

362
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:26,023
Ri-won / you seem like such a good person

363
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:28,500
Han-kyul / I feel the same way about both of you

364
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Ri-won / You need to spend time to really see someone

365
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:36,105
Hee-young / Did something happen while I was gone?

366
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:38,785
Hee-young / Can someone spill the tea?

367
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:41,935
Seo-yeon / We talked over dinner

368
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:44,695
Seo-yeon / Like, if we could re-vote on first impressions

369
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:47,855
Seo-yeon / Would you change who you picked?

370
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:48,865
Seo-yeon / That kind of stuff

371
00:20:49,305 --> 00:20:51,135
Jin-ah / But for me, it kind of felt like

372
00:20:51,145 --> 00:20:55,015
Jin-ah / That question is kind of risky

373
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:58,415
Jin-ah / Because depending on how the person I like answers

374
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:02,785
Jin-ah / I feel like I just start wavering

375
00:21:03,105 --> 00:21:05,895
Jin-ah / Actually, the more I like someone

376
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:08,855
Jin-ah / I think I get a bit petty early on

377
00:21:08,865 --> 00:21:13,095
Jin-ah / Because I want them to like me just as much

378
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,585
Jin-ah / But still, if...

379
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,895
Jin-ah / If I hear them say "My first impression changed"

380
00:21:17,905 --> 00:21:22,105
Jin-ah / Especially from someone I like

381
00:21:22,305 --> 00:21:25,705
Jin-ah / I start overthinking like crazy

382
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:29,255
Hee-young / But isn’t it better for that to happen early on?

383
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:31,175
Jin-ah / Yeah, that’s definitely better

384
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:34,255
Hee-young / It’s something you can understand

385
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:36,095
Hee-young / It feels more natural

386
00:21:36,105 --> 00:21:38,415
Seo-yeon / Better than switching it up later on?

387
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:41,455
Hee-young / Yeah, after everything has already built up

388
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:44,015
Jin-ah / Like hearing everything and then being like “meh”?

389
00:21:44,025 --> 00:21:46,175
Hee-young / Not quite that

390
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:47,615
Hee-young / But it's important

391
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,295
Hee-young / Also, giving too much certainty too soon

392
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:51,415
Hee-young / That can also be problematic, I think

393
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:54,105
Jin-ah / Like “what do you even know?” kind of feeling?

394
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:55,295
Hee-young / Yeah, stuff like that

395
00:21:55,305 --> 00:21:59,055
Hee-young / Everyone’s boiling point is different, right?

396
00:21:59,065 --> 00:22:01,625
Jin-ah / Is that it? Am I just being like that?

397
00:22:01,905 --> 00:22:04,135
Jin-ah / I mean I get it, of course I get it

398
00:22:04,145 --> 00:22:06,375
Jin-ah / Of course I understand how that feels

399
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:07,895
Jin-ah / But the fact that it’s coming up

400
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:08,855
Jin-ah / That it’s surfacing now

401
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:10,735
Jin-ah / I guess she just doesn’t really like me

402
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:15,615
Hee-young / It’s just like something you didn’t really have to say out loud

403
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:19,335
Hee-young / But saying that in front of everyone like that

404
00:22:19,345 --> 00:22:21,695
Hee-young / even the person who was picked

405
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:23,985
Hee-young / could still feel sad about it

406
00:22:24,265 --> 00:22:27,615
Jin-ah / It just feels like the connection started half-heartedly

407
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:31,385
Jin-ah / That feeling… yeah, it really felt like that

408
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:33,124
Seo-yeon / But honestly, with first impressions

409
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:36,346
Seo-yeon / Because it’s possible to like more than one person

410
00:22:36,352 --> 00:22:38,702
Seo-yeon / I had more than one

411
00:22:38,712 --> 00:22:39,622
Jin-ah / Really?

412
00:22:39,632 --> 00:22:41,902
Hee-young / So yeah, I get where it comes from

413
00:22:41,912 --> 00:22:44,782
Jin-ah / Maybe I didn’t know... I didn’t have that

414
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:47,472
Seo-yeon / You only had one?

415
00:22:49,152 --> 00:22:51,502
Jin-ah / It’s not that I could only see that one person

416
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:53,862
Jin-ah / That person was just there

417
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,822
Jin-ah / But I couldn’t really see anyone else

418
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,662
Jin-ah / That was kind of surprising

419
00:22:57,672 --> 00:23:02,782
Jin-ah / Like, if I could see others, I’d have options too

420
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:04,592
Jin-ah / But I just didn’t see them

421
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:11,955
Seo-yeon / Do you think your feelings won’t change?

422
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:13,435
Jin-ah / I think it’s just my personality

423
00:23:13,445 --> 00:23:15,915
Jin-ah / And since we only have limited time

424
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:18,915
Jin-ah / If I try to get to know everyone

425
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:20,995
Jin-ah / I’d have to give up on getting to know one person deeply

426
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:22,475
Jin-ah / I’d have to sacrifice that

427
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:26,005
Hee-young / Well, it’s just seven days…

428
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:28,235
Jin-ah / I think I was just a bit hurt

429
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:31,795
Jin-ah / I thought about why, and I think

430
00:23:31,805 --> 00:23:37,075
Jin-ah / I kept wondering if those conversations meant they were curious about someone else

431
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:39,195
Jin-ah / It just kept popping into my head

432
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:41,475
Jin-ah / Maybe it’s just a misunderstanding

433
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:43,605
Jin-ah / But it still hurt

434
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:45,755
Hee-young / I think there’s that too

435
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:47,675
Hee-young / We tend to assume others think like we do

436
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:49,395
Hee-young / That they’ll see things the same way

437
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:50,795
Hee-young / We project that onto others

438
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,115
Jin-ah / Right, and I really realized that today

439
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:55,915
Hee-young / It feels like that’s what was going on

440
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:58,795
Hee-young / Now it’s like, “Even if I’m not like that

441
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:00,235
Hee-young / someone else might be,” and

442
00:24:00,245 --> 00:24:02,555
Hee-young / if you start thinking from that perspective

443
00:24:02,565 --> 00:24:03,315
Jin-ah / Then everything feels okay

444
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:08,045
Jin-ah / Then everything feels okay
Hee-young / In the beginning, people go back and forth

445
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:12,035
Hee-young / As they get to know each other more and meet more

446
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:14,875
Hee-young / That’s when the deep connection really starts to matter

447
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:18,365
Hee-young / That’s when it becomes truly important

448
00:24:38,618 --> 00:24:41,048
Jin-ah / Excuse me

449
00:24:41,058 --> 00:24:41,735
Jin-ah / Is it okay?

450
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:44,111
Han-kyul / I’m too barefaced right now

451
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,029
Hee-young / Sleeping... are you actually asleep?

452
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,989
Han-kyul / Still asleep...

453
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:53,829
Jin-ah / That’s actually kind of rude

454
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:55,759
Jin-ah / Seriously, a little disrespectful

455
00:24:55,806 --> 00:24:57,631
Hee-young / Did you eat? Or are you going to?

456
00:24:57,641 --> 00:24:58,966
Han-kyul / Me? I’m not sure

457
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:01,875
Han-kyul / I’ll probably just grab something quick depending on the situation

458
00:25:01,885 --> 00:25:07,092
Hee-young / I’ll see what we have and try to make something

459
00:25:14,365 --> 00:25:15,008
Jin-ah / That was hilarious

460
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:18,839
Jin-ah / I seriously just committed a social offense

461
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,715
Hee-young / What’s even edible...

462
00:25:21,725 --> 00:25:24,409
Hee-young / But it’s breakfast, so there’s not much I can do

463
00:25:24,418 --> 00:25:26,975
Jin-ah / But seriously, plain toast without butter

464
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:30,009
Hee-young / Oh? We’ve got eggs, bacon, bread

465
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:31,795
Jin-ah / There’s jam too
Hee-young / We’ve got jam

466
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:32,809
Jin-ah / There’s milk too

467
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:37,122
Hee-young / I went on a date yesterday and didn’t eat properly

468
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,104
Hee-young / I was so nervous during the date

469
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:40,475
Hee-young / I usually skip breakfast

470
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:43,782
Hee-young / But I felt like I needed to eat this morning

471
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:48,352
Hee-young / So I just tried making something with whatever we had

472
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:52,872
Mi-rang / What’s up with your chemistry?

473
00:25:54,745 --> 00:25:55,878
Why’s this broken?

474
00:26:02,705 --> 00:26:04,709
Mi-rang / What is glutathione good for?

475
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:08,149
Jin-ah / It helps with antioxidants and brightening your skin

476
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,882
Hee-young / It makes you fairer?

477
00:26:09,892 --> 00:26:12,855
Jin-ah / It’s good for skincare, anti-aging too

478
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:14,919
Jin-ah / Also helps with hangover recovery

479
00:26:19,265 --> 00:26:22,235
Hee-young / Is this a product plug?
`
480

480
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,015
Jin-ah / It’s because I ate it hehe

481
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:29,592
Jin-ah / It removes that fishy, chalky taste that enzymes usually have

482
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:42,008
Mi-rang / Mmm~ this is so good

483
00:26:42,018 --> 00:26:43,762
Mi-rang / Try it! Mmm this is really good

484
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,071
Mi-rang / I think it was something like that? Just now

485
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,699
Mi-rang / “Hee-young unnie, this one’s really good”

486
00:26:55,505 --> 00:26:57,945
Jin-ah / We really have to start taking care of ourselves now

487
00:27:02,145 --> 00:27:03,592
Jin-ah / This one’s good too?

488
00:27:08,145 --> 00:27:09,802
Mi-rang / Wait... that’s the one I was eating...

489
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:10,948
Jin-ah / I don’t want it

490
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:14,638
Jin-ah / I’m gonna have mine with sparkling water

491
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:42,009
Mi-rang / You’re here?

492
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:43,139
Da-gyo / Yep

493
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:46,889
Mi-rang / Da-gyo, you dressed so nicely

494
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:50,449
Mi-rang / It’s freezing outside today

495
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:53,939
Da-gyo / Outside? I know~ I dressed warm though

496
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:57,369
Mi-rang / The first thing I noticed this morning was Da-gyo

497
00:27:57,379 --> 00:28:00,459
Mi-rang / What she was wearing looked so good

498
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:05,569
Da-gyo / I heard you stayed up late last night?

499
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:06,889
Da-gyo / What time… Why were you up so late?

500
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:07,649
Mi-rang / Around 4 /30?

501
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:08,339
Da-gyo / 4 /30?!

502
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:11,579
Mi-rang / I was talking with Seo-yeon the whole time

503
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,249
Jin-ah / You two must really connect

504
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,449
Mi-rang / We were counseling each other...

505
00:28:17,459 --> 00:28:20,405
Da-gyo / It’s only the first night and they stayed up talking till 4AM?

506
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,799
Mi-rang / Should I go wake up Ri-won?

507
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:38,149
Seo-yeon / Who decided today’s breakfast duty?

508
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,669
Da-gyo / I have no idea, I think it was just whoever woke up early

509
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,239
Da-gyo / Thanks to whoever took the initiative

510
00:28:54,765 --> 00:28:56,728
Seo-yeon / Mmm~ this is delicious~

511
00:28:57,105 --> 00:28:58,945
Da-gyo / Is it good?
Seo-yeon / Yeah

512
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:08,815
Da-gyo / It’s delicious~

513
00:29:08,825 --> 00:29:12,895
Seo-yeon / Do you know who you’re going on a date with today?

514
00:29:12,905 --> 00:29:14,625
Da-gyo / No, I have no idea

515
00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:17,945
Seo-yeon / Who will it be? How will it be decided?

516
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:21,375
Da-gyo / I thought someone new might come in today

517
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,775
Seo-yeon / The mackerel will probably show up

518
00:29:22,785 --> 00:29:25,335
Seo-yeon / Probably after the date, a mackerel will appear

519
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:27,175
Seo-yeon / Since one person will be left out

520
00:29:27,185 --> 00:29:29,945
Da-gyo / One person left out? Because we’re an odd number?

521
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:35,655
Mi-rang / I’m the kind of person who

522
00:29:35,665 --> 00:29:37,935
Mi-rang / if I like someone

523
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:40,535
Mi-rang / I don’t approach them right away

524
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,095
Mi-rang / I take a step back

525
00:29:42,105 --> 00:29:44,815
Mi-rang / and just observe. I want to see them without pretense

526
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,655
Mi-rang / I want to see who they are naturally

527
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:51,625
Mi-rang / So I didn’t want to act like I liked someone from the beginning

528
00:29:53,065 --> 00:29:55,655
Seo-yeon / Have you decided who to go on a date with today?

529
00:29:55,665 --> 00:29:58,055
Seo-yeon / In your mind?
Da-gyo / In my mind? Not really

530
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:59,145
Seo-yeon / You haven’t decided?

531
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:01,135
Da-gyo / Have you?

532
00:30:01,145 --> 00:30:03,825
Seo-yeon / Hmm... there is someone I want to go with

533
00:30:05,785 --> 00:30:08,655
Da-gyo / I don’t know

534
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:09,735
Seo-yeon / But like...

535
00:30:09,745 --> 00:30:11,695
Seo-yeon / Is personality really important to you?

536
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:13,255
Da-gyo / Personality?

537
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:16,575
Da-gyo / It doesn’t really matter. I said that even when they first asked

538
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:17,895
Da-gyo / It doesn’t really matter to me

539
00:30:17,905 --> 00:30:19,985
Seo-yeon / Oh, I’m kind of like that too

540
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:22,415
Da-gyo / But I don’t know, it’s really hard for me

541
00:30:22,425 --> 00:30:24,655
Da-gyo / Yesterday was hard, and today too, if I had to choose now

542
00:30:24,665 --> 00:30:26,375
Da-gyo / If I had to choose someone now

543
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:29,025
Da-gyo / Honestly, I don’t know who I’d pick

544
00:30:30,505 --> 00:30:31,455
Da-gyo / Just...

545
00:30:31,465 --> 00:30:33,815
Seo-yeon / No one comes to mind?

546
00:30:33,825 --> 00:30:36,465
Da-gyo / No, there is... but I’m conflicted

547
00:30:37,345 --> 00:30:40,975
Da-gyo / Who do I want to get to know first

548
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:42,415
Da-gyo / It’s not just one person for me

549
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,255
Da-gyo / It’s not like that exactly

550
00:30:44,265 --> 00:30:45,695
Seo-yeon / Same here, not just one

551
00:30:45,705 --> 00:30:47,695
Da-gyo / Exactly

552
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:50,975
Da-gyo / You asking me these questions, Seo-yeon...

553
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:53,015
Da-gyo / Would you ask someone you’re not into?

554
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:53,855
Da-gyo / Or is it just...

555
00:30:53,865 --> 00:30:56,455
Da-gyo / Are all the girls just really nice to me?

556
00:30:56,465 --> 00:30:59,615
Da-gyo / Or is this some kind of flirting? I don’t know

557
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:04,935
Seo-yeon / For me, this was such a hard-earned first chance

558
00:31:04,945 --> 00:31:10,625
Seo-yeon / So I think Da-gyo was the biggest dilemma for me

559
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,052
Seo-yeon / If you could pick your date, would you?

560
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:20,082
Mi-rang / Yeah, I think I would want to

561
00:31:20,092 --> 00:31:20,922
Seo-yeon / With your first choice?

562
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:24,082
Mi-rang / Yeah, my first choice... but I really don’t know

563
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,802
Mi-rang / I feel like if I pick this person

564
00:31:25,812 --> 00:31:27,082
Mi-rang / they might give up on me

565
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:29,162
Mi-rang / If they have feelings for me

566
00:31:29,172 --> 00:31:30,002
Mi-rang / I feel like if I pick them

567
00:31:30,012 --> 00:31:31,522
Mi-rang / they might give up on me

568
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:33,482
Seo-yeon / Oh, I get that. I’ve felt that too

569
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:36,122
Seo-yeon / I feel similarly about both people I’m interested in

570
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:39,242
Mi-rang / I’m not sure if someone is exactly my type

571
00:31:39,252 --> 00:31:40,522
Mi-rang / but everyone here

572
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:41,722
Mi-rang / has their own unique charm

573
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:44,122
Mi-rang / and such different attractive qualities

574
00:31:44,132 --> 00:31:47,882
Seo-yeon / For now, I want to go with Da-gyo

575
00:31:47,892 --> 00:31:50,362
Seo-yeon / For now… yeah, Da-gyo, Da-gyo

576
00:31:50,372 --> 00:31:52,642
Mi-rang / Da-gyo?

577
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:54,042
Mi-rang / Was Da-gyo your first choice?

578
00:31:54,052 --> 00:31:55,562
Seo-yeon / At first, it was Hee-young

579
00:31:55,572 --> 00:31:57,602
Mi-rang / Oh right, it was Hee-young

580
00:31:57,612 --> 00:32:00,682
Seo-yeon / But after she came back from the date yesterday

581
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:03,042
Seo-yeon / I started to feel a bit unsettled

582
00:32:03,052 --> 00:32:05,242
Seo-yeon / And after talking a lot with Da-gyo in the evening

583
00:32:05,252 --> 00:32:08,042
Seo-yeon / I realized we really clicked and I liked her more

584
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:09,122
Seo-yeon / So yeah

585
00:32:09,132 --> 00:32:11,962
Seo-yeon / There were a lot of things we connected on

586
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,282
Mi-rang / Yesterday?

587
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:14,682
Seo-yeon / Yeah

588
00:32:14,692 --> 00:32:18,075
Mi-rang / Ah this is hard...

589
00:32:19,912 --> 00:32:22,582
Han-kyul / At this rate, I’m just going to sleep all day

590
00:32:22,592 --> 00:32:25,582
Ri-won / No! Wait, don’t you have someone you like?

591
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:27,942
Ri-won / Isn’t there someone you’re into, Han-kyul?

592
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:30,662
Han-kyul / Yeah but, how do I explain this...

593
00:32:30,672 --> 00:32:35,942
Han-kyul / There’s this kind of “ideal match” I picture in my head

594
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:37,502
Ri-won / And it doesn’t match?

595
00:32:37,512 --> 00:32:39,062
Han-kyul / I don’t know how to explain it

596
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:42,142
Han-kyul / Everyone’s so stunning, like a picture

597
00:32:42,152 --> 00:32:45,382
Han-kyul / Everyone here is so good-looking

598
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:47,022
Han-kyul / I feel like I don’t even belong in the frame

599
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:49,942
Ri-won / What are you talking about? You’re gorgeous, Han-kyul

600
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:51,822
Ri-won / Why would you say that?

601
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:54,262
Han-kyul / It just feels hard to live up to that

602
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,702
Han-kyul / Like what people say...

603
00:32:55,712 --> 00:32:59,462
Han-kyul / It feels like everyone here fits the "typical lesbian taste"

604
00:32:59,472 --> 00:33:01,422
Ri-won / Why should you have to fit that?

605
00:33:01,432 --> 00:33:04,872
Ri-won / As long as the person I like likes me back, that’s enough

606
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:05,742
Ri-won / Don’t you think?

607
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:08,022
Han-kyul / I think you’re right

608
00:33:08,032 --> 00:33:10,952
Han-kyul / But it’s not that easy

609
00:33:11,712 --> 00:33:15,542
Han-kyul / Even if hundreds of people like me

610
00:33:15,552 --> 00:33:17,462
Ri-won / If the one I like doesn’t like me back,

611
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:19,662
Ri-won / then it’s meaningless

612
00:33:19,672 --> 00:33:21,702
Han-kyul / That’s deep

613
00:33:21,712 --> 00:33:26,312
Han-kyul / You’re like a walking quote machine

614
00:33:26,912 --> 00:33:28,782
Ri-won / I feel like later on,

615
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:29,902
Ri-won / if I get feelings for someone

616
00:33:29,912 --> 00:33:31,142
Ri-won / and express them

617
00:33:31,152 --> 00:33:33,142
Ri-won / they might misunderstand

618
00:33:33,152 --> 00:33:35,462
Ri-won / Like “Huh? But she’s nice to everyone”

619
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,942
Ri-won / That person might...

620
00:33:37,952 --> 00:33:40,102
Ri-won / I’m being sincere, but they might get confused

621
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:41,902
Ri-won / I don’t want that, so...

622
00:33:41,912 --> 00:33:44,502
Han-kyul / I totally get what you mean

623
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:46,542
Han-kyul / Since we’re both women,

624
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:48,342
Han-kyul / the line between a compliment and flirting

625
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:50,382
Han-kyul / can be really blurry, and that’s kind of sad

626
00:33:50,392 --> 00:33:51,782
Ri-won / Yeah, that’s definitely true

627
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:54,542
Han-kyul / Even when I say something myself,

628
00:33:54,552 --> 00:33:57,822
Han-kyul / I’ll be like, “I hope they see this as flirting”

629
00:33:57,832 --> 00:34:00,422
Han-kyul / or “No, this is just a compliment,” but...

630
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:02,832
Han-kyul / the other person doesn’t know that

631
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:06,462
Han-kyul / They can’t pick up on it

632
00:34:06,472 --> 00:34:08,342
Ri-won / That’s why I try to make it super clear

633
00:34:08,352 --> 00:34:09,262
Ri-won / when I’m flirting

634
00:34:09,272 --> 00:34:10,232
Han-kyul / That’s cool

635
00:34:10,672 --> 00:34:12,222
Ri-won / Honestly, I don’t even know your age yet

636
00:34:12,232 --> 00:34:15,982
Ri-won / But I feel like you’re a lot younger than me

637
00:34:15,992 --> 00:34:18,942
Ri-won / And seeing this younger person

638
00:34:18,952 --> 00:34:22,502
Ri-won / trying so hard to act mature in this unfamiliar place...

639
00:34:22,512 --> 00:34:25,902
Ri-won / it just kind of... pulls at my heart

640
00:34:25,912 --> 00:34:28,862
Ri-won / I started caring, and now we’re roommates too

641
00:34:28,872 --> 00:34:31,622
Ri-won / I hear you talk a lot and all that

642
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:33,862
Ri-won / I don’t know, I just think...

643
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,347
Ri-won / you’re the one I find myself caring about the most

644
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:42,648
Jin-ah / Oh wow, she's coming in all bouncy

645
00:35:42,658 --> 00:35:44,368
Jin-ah / Oh wow, she's coming in all bouncy
Da-gyo / Oh? What the~ you're so cute

646
00:35:44,378 --> 00:35:45,568
Jin-ah / You know that kind of vibe?

647
00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:48,248
Jin-ah / That sassy type of charm

648
00:35:48,258 --> 00:35:49,248
Da-gyo / Your makeup’s gonna look great today

649
00:35:49,258 --> 00:35:52,618
Mi-rang / When I smile it cracks...

650
00:35:56,298 --> 00:35:57,538
Da-gyo / Being all coy

651
00:35:59,818 --> 00:36:01,088
Jin-ah / Oh? She’s embarrassed

652
00:36:01,098 --> 00:36:04,618
Jin-ah / She’s shy about doing her skincare

653
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:11,058
Da-gyo / Anyway, we have to decide on who’s doing dinner today

654
00:36:13,818 --> 00:36:14,978
Right on cue

655
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:17,808
Please choose two people for tonight’s dinner duty

656
00:36:17,818 --> 00:36:19,048
Random draw

657
00:36:19,058 --> 00:36:20,728
You can decide freely by playing a game

658
00:36:20,738 --> 00:36:21,888
Hee-young / A game?

659
00:36:21,898 --> 00:36:23,568
Mi-rang / Should we just do the crocodile game?

660
00:36:23,578 --> 00:36:24,568
Sounds good

661
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:26,168
Speed game!

662
00:36:26,178 --> 00:36:27,968
Mi-rang / Then how should we decide the order?

663
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:28,928
Da-gyo / Order?

664
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,448
Mi-rang / Last is the worst spot

665
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,568
Ri-won / Then how about we

666
00:36:32,578 --> 00:36:35,928
Ri-won / go in the order we woke up? What do you think?
Da-gyo / Sounds good

667
00:36:35,938 --> 00:36:38,698
Ri-won / Let the early birds have first pick

668
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:41,258
Da-gyo / This is scary

669
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:44,578
Ah I’m nervous

670
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:48,848
Mi-rang / We woke up at 4, didn’t we?

671
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:49,928
Jin-ah / No way

672
00:36:49,938 --> 00:36:51,368
Jin-ah / Seriously?

673
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:51,848
Da-gyo / Seriously

674
00:36:51,858 --> 00:36:52,648
Seo-yeon / You woke up at 4?

675
00:36:52,658 --> 00:36:54,538
Mi-rang / Because of the alarm sound

676
00:36:59,538 --> 00:37:00,328
Seo-yeon / Ah this is scary

677
00:37:00,338 --> 00:37:01,338
Da-gyo / It’s dragging out

678
00:37:03,898 --> 00:37:05,128
Mi-rang / We need to pick one more person

679
00:37:05,138 --> 00:37:07,048
Jin-ah / We have to go another round

680
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,808
Hee-young / Pick someone

681
00:37:08,818 --> 00:37:10,408
Ri-won / Yeah, go ahead and pick

682
00:37:10,418 --> 00:37:12,968
Mi-rang / Wouldn't that be too much pressure?

683
00:37:12,978 --> 00:37:14,728
Han-kyul / No no...

684
00:37:14,738 --> 00:37:16,248
Ri-won / Wanna do it with me?

685
00:37:16,258 --> 00:37:20,218
Ri-won / Since I got up late, do it with me

686
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:24,088
Ri-won / With me

687
00:37:24,098 --> 00:37:24,768
Ri-won / Okay

688
00:37:24,778 --> 00:37:26,088
Jin-ah / You're doing it?

689
00:37:26,098 --> 00:37:27,251
Jin-ah / Okay okay

690
00:37:31,246 --> 00:37:34,116
Ri-won / I just thought she might be having a hard time

691
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,036
Ri-won / That’s just what I thought

692
00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:37,316
Ri-won / And I thought this would be a chance

693
00:37:37,326 --> 00:37:38,476
Ri-won / to talk with Han-kyul a bit

694
00:37:38,486 --> 00:37:41,196
Ri-won / and get closer

695
00:37:41,206 --> 00:37:43,756
Han-kyul / I think you helped me

696
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:46,876
Han-kyul / Maybe I looked like I couldn’t handle it, so

697
00:37:46,886 --> 00:37:50,446
Han-kyul / I think you were trying to help me out

698
00:37:51,846 --> 00:37:52,636
Ri-won / Are you good at cooking?

699
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:54,076
Han-kyul / But there aren't really any ingredients

700
00:37:54,086 --> 00:37:55,036
Ri-won / But you know how to cook?

701
00:37:55,046 --> 00:37:56,516
Han-kyul / If we had ingredients...

702
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:58,916
Ri-won / Oh, ingredients? Should I go buy some?

703
00:37:58,926 --> 00:38:03,526
Ri-won / I can drive, so if we can rent a car...

704
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:08,436
Han-kyul / Why do you keep treating me...

705
00:38:08,446 --> 00:38:10,596
Han-kyul / like such a baby...

706
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:13,076
Ri-won / Oh! I’m sorry, you didn’t like it?

707
00:38:13,086 --> 00:38:16,436
Han-kyul / No, I didn’t hate it, it’s not that... It’s just—

708
00:38:16,446 --> 00:38:19,076
Han-kyul / I’m not sure how to react

709
00:38:19,086 --> 00:38:21,516
Ri-won / Ah, you’re not used to it

710
00:38:21,526 --> 00:38:24,686
Han-kyul / I’m like, what is this? Like, am I...

711
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,196
Ri-won / I think everyone sees you as cute, Han-kyul

712
00:38:27,206 --> 00:38:28,916
Han-kyul / Nooo

713
00:38:28,926 --> 00:38:32,596
Ri-won / You don’t want to be seen as cute?

714
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:37,076
Han-kyul / Because if you’re cute, then...

715
00:38:37,086 --> 00:38:39,556
Han-kyul / people don’t see you as a romantic option

716
00:38:39,566 --> 00:38:40,596
Han-kyul / If they think you’re *too* cute

717
00:38:40,606 --> 00:38:42,596
Ri-won / Oh really?

718
00:38:42,606 --> 00:38:44,676
Ri-won / Is that how people usually see it?

719
00:38:44,686 --> 00:38:47,246
Han-kyul / I think that’s how it usually goes...

720
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:56,476
Seo-yeon / No, it’s 100%

721
00:38:56,486 --> 00:38:59,076
Seo-yeon / I’ve been watching Ri-won carefully

722
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,396
Seo-yeon / And yesterday, with the conversation cards...

723
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:02,606
Seo-yeon / During the card talk too

724
00:39:02,846 --> 00:39:03,516
Mi-rang / With Han-kyul?

725
00:39:03,526 --> 00:39:06,116
Seo-yeon / She kept asking questions to Han-kyul

726
00:39:06,126 --> 00:39:08,916
Mi-rang / Oh really? But to me, those two...

727
00:39:08,926 --> 00:39:09,756
Mi-rang / Their personalities don’t match... I don’t see the pull...

728
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:14,836
Seo-yeon / Right? They don’t really seem compatible, do they?

729
00:39:14,846 --> 00:39:16,396
Seo-yeon / Right? Not at all, right?

730
00:39:16,406 --> 00:39:18,836
Mi-rang / Maybe it’s just because they’re rooming together

731
00:39:18,846 --> 00:39:23,036
Seo-yeon / Yeah, they’re roommates, and also

732
00:39:23,046 --> 00:39:25,636
Seo-yeon / When Han-kyul picked something,

733
00:39:25,646 --> 00:39:27,116
Seo-yeon / Ri-won just jumped on it

734
00:39:27,126 --> 00:39:29,236
Seo-yeon / She just pounced on it, like that

735
00:39:29,246 --> 00:39:30,686
She really jumped on it

736
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:36,446
Seo-yeon / When I saw that, I kind of became sure

737
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:38,756
Mi-rang / This is fun

738
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:40,316
Seo-yeon / Right?

739
00:39:40,326 --> 00:39:42,556
Mi-rang / I seriously have no idea how this is going to go

740
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:43,796
Seo-yeon / I feel the same

741
00:39:43,806 --> 00:39:46,556
Mi-rang / I honestly thought those two wouldn’t match at all

742
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:48,646
Seo-yeon / But lowkey, they kind of work?

743
00:39:49,078 --> 00:39:53,708
Da-gyo / I’m just confused about something
Jin-ah / Oh I want to hear this

744
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:56,308
Da-gyo / I’ve got something like this

745
00:39:56,318 --> 00:39:57,348
Jin-ah / Tell me tell me

746
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:01,548
Da-gyo / Yesterday was our first day, right?

747
00:40:01,558 --> 00:40:04,028
Da-gyo / So when I sent the message, to be honest

748
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:06,308
Da-gyo / it wasn’t like I was really into that person

749
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:08,588
Da-gyo / not like I had strong feelings or anything

750
00:40:08,598 --> 00:40:10,548
Da-gyo / I just sent it to someone who had

751
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:13,148
Da-gyo / shown interest in me first, I guess?

752
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:14,228
Hee-young / They must’ve made a move in the meantime

753
00:40:14,238 --> 00:40:16,108
Jin-ah / Really?

754
00:40:16,118 --> 00:40:17,668
Da-gyo / So now I feel like everyone

755
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:19,468
Da-gyo / I was telling Seo-yeon this earlier too

756
00:40:19,478 --> 00:40:20,788
Da-gyo / I’m just so confused now

757
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:22,188
Da-gyo / Every little gesture

758
00:40:22,198 --> 00:40:24,308
Da-gyo / I keep wondering “Are they flirting with me?”

759
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:25,988
Da-gyo / That's how I take everything

760
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:27,268
Da-gyo / and I think that’s the problem

761
00:40:27,278 --> 00:40:28,228
Jin-ah / That’s a real dilemma

762
00:40:28,238 --> 00:40:32,428
Da-gyo / I feel like I’m misunderstanding everything

763
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:33,108
Hee-young / You think you’re imagining it?

764
00:40:33,118 --> 00:40:34,548
Jin-ah / But in which moments though?

765
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,988
Jin-ah / How do you even tell flirting apart from kindness?

766
00:40:36,998 --> 00:40:38,628
Da-gyo / Exactly, that’s what makes it so hard

767
00:40:38,638 --> 00:40:40,348
Da-gyo / In here, for me...

768
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:44,348
Da-gyo / Normally... when I meet someone

769
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:46,948
Da-gyo / I know exactly, 'this is someone dating a woman'

770
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:49,068
Da-gyo / and we meet one-on-one

771
00:40:49,078 --> 00:40:50,308
Da-gyo / and start with romantic feelings

772
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:51,428
Da-gyo / That’s the only situation I’ve had

773
00:40:51,438 --> 00:40:54,748
Jin-ah / Where you’re sure the other person likes someone like you

774
00:40:54,758 --> 00:40:57,148
Jin-ah / and you’re sure they like women

775
00:40:57,158 --> 00:40:59,948
Da-gyo / When you both already have mutual interest or attraction

776
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,748
Da-gyo / and something about them is appealing

777
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:04,228
Da-gyo / It’s rare to meet someone naturally like that

778
00:41:04,238 --> 00:41:05,268
Da-gyo / It hasn’t really happened

779
00:41:05,278 --> 00:41:08,388
Da-gyo / But here, it’s such a unique situation

780
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:09,868
Da-gyo / Everyone here likes women

781
00:41:09,878 --> 00:41:10,388
Hee-young / Right, it's the first time

782
00:41:10,398 --> 00:41:11,148
Hee-young / Yeah, it’s the first time
Da-gyo / It’s my first time too

783
00:41:11,158 --> 00:41:15,628
Da-gyo / So now I don’t know—like, are their actions

784
00:41:15,638 --> 00:41:17,908
Da-gyo / just friendly like a friend?

785
00:41:17,918 --> 00:41:19,748
Da-gyo / Are they just being nice?

786
00:41:19,758 --> 00:41:20,988
Da-gyo / Are they smiling at me like that

787
00:41:20,998 --> 00:41:22,228
Da-gyo / and touching me like that

788
00:41:22,238 --> 00:41:24,548
Da-gyo / and saying those things because it means something?

789
00:41:24,558 --> 00:41:28,108
Da-gyo / Does it mean something, or is it just my mind playing tricks?

790
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,468
Da-gyo / Is there a hidden message?

791
00:41:29,478 --> 00:41:31,028
Da-gyo / Or am I just reading too much into it?

792
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:33,028
Hee-young / Then it just means that person is on your mind

793
00:41:33,038 --> 00:41:33,948
Hee-young / What they say sticks with you

794
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,268
Hee-young / You start assigning meaning to their words

795
00:41:36,278 --> 00:41:38,028
Da-gyo / Yeah, you're right

796
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:40,828
Da-gyo / That might be it

797
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:42,868
Da-gyo / The person I’m thinking about...

798
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:44,548
Da-gyo / The one I want to date

799
00:41:44,558 --> 00:41:46,748
Da-gyo / The one I want to get to know more

800
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:48,108
Da-gyo / There are two...

801
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:49,948
Da-gyo / There are two people

802
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:51,678
Da-gyo / and I’m confused between the two

803
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:13,849
Han-kyul / The feeling of wishing she were like my older sister

804
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:17,059
Han-kyul / That vibe just clicks perfectly

805
00:42:17,437 --> 00:42:19,547
Seo-yeon / Just take care of each other and be cared for a little

806
00:42:19,657 --> 00:42:21,207
Seo-yeon / Isn’t that enough?

807
00:42:21,217 --> 00:42:24,447
Mi-rang / True... but Ri-won is just too...

808
00:42:24,457 --> 00:42:28,367
Da-gyo / Let’s not overlook the obvious facts

809
00:42:28,377 --> 00:42:30,847
Hee-young / Right, exactly!

810
00:42:30,857 --> 00:42:33,337
Hee-young / If that’s true, don’t ignore it

811
00:43:09,684 --> 00:43:12,164
Da-gyo / Right now we can't really speak freely

812
00:43:12,484 --> 00:43:14,444
Hee-young / Just get to know each other naturally

813
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:17,364
Jin-ah / Because it can’t be forced?

814
00:43:31,804 --> 00:43:34,634
Hee-young / We were chatting and then suddenly the bell rang

815
00:43:34,644 --> 00:43:35,914
Hee-young / So we were like, ‘I think we have to go’

816
00:43:35,924 --> 00:43:37,004
Hee-young / and went downstairs...

817
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,124
What? What is it?

818
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,310
Da-gyo / I opened the door, and then...

819
00:43:50,663 --> 00:43:54,860
Da-gyo / She was so glamorous, I think I was really surprised

820
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,870
Da-gyo / Oh, so this is why she's the catfish

821
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,190
Hello

822
00:44:00,203 --> 00:44:04,020
Hee-young / This person I’ve never seen before was super tall and kind of...

823
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,060
Hee-young / Someone intimidating just walked in

824
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:09,830
Hee-young / We haven’t had anyone intimidating so far, so that’s how it felt

825
00:44:11,797 --> 00:44:14,620
Da-gyo / Hello

826
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:15,940
Jin-ah / Hello

827
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,420
Hello

828
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:21,100
I was most curious about what kind of people would be here

829
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:24,420
And also imagining what I might be able to do there

830
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,620
That made me feel really excited

831
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,750
Nice to meet you

832
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,700
Hee-young / Another short-haired person

833
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,340
Jin-ah / Oh you're right

834
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:35,910
Da-gyo / Yeah, true

835
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,950
Da-gyo / Please have a seat here

836
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:59,040
Da-gyo / She's really tall, has an amazing figure

837
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:00,960
Da-gyo / and has a very chic image

838
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,320
Da-gyo / Compared to the others here so far

839
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,040
Da-gyo / she gives off a completely different vibe

840
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:04,760
Da-gyo / Why is she sitting there?

841
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:05,680
Jin-ah / Well, Hee-young is sitting here

842
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:06,800
Da-gyo / We came to sit over here

843
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,480
Jin-ah / When I first came yesterday

844
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:10,400
Jin-ah / it was Da-gyo, right?

845
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:12,480
Jin-ah / When Da-gyo came in here

846
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:15,520
Jin-ah / We were so awkward with each other, just sighing...

847
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:17,080
Jin-ah / But now we’re sharing a room

848
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,680
Oh really?

849
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:20,930
Da-gyo / It’s just the three of us in our room

850
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:22,400
There are others too?

851
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:24,360
Jin-ah / Yeah, they’re in the next room

852
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:25,640
Jin-ah / Should I go get Da-gyo?

853
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,040
Jin-ah / You seem really excited?

854
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,080
Jin-ah / Can’t stay still, huh?

855
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:28,760
Jin-ah / Go ahead

856
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,600
Da-gyo / I'm so curious what the reaction will be, my face turned red

857
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:34,080
Da-gyo / I’ll go bring them

858
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,080
Jin-ah / Her face really turned red

859
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:40,960
I was imagining it would be super awkward and tense, but

860
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:43,240
the vibe was actually really comfortable

861
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,400
To be honest, I was a bit disappointed

862
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,490
I was hoping they hadn’t gotten close yet

863
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:51,760
Da-gyo / Are you all ready?

864
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:52,680
Ri-won / Yes!

865
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:53,560
Da-gyo / Oh no

866
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:54,850
Ri-won / Why? What is it?

867
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:56,890
Da-gyo / Someone new arrived

868
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,320
Seo-yeon / What did you say?

869
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,770
Ri-won / I think the catfish(new cast) is here

870
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,760
Mi-rang / She came to the room?

871
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,210
Da-gyo / I opened the door for her

872
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:05,650
Ri-won / Let’s go, let’s go

873
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,760
Seo-yeon / Is she pretty?

874
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,573
Da-gyo / Are you asking if she's pretty?

875
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:13,569
Ri-won / Of course it’ll look cute, it’s a catfish~

876
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:15,489
Ri-won / Why is asking if it’s cute so funny?

877
00:46:15,499 --> 00:46:16,929
Ri-won / You sound like an old man

878
00:46:16,939 --> 00:46:18,609
Ri-won / Hurry up, I’m so curious!

879
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:19,489
Da-gyo / You really are?

880
00:46:19,499 --> 00:46:22,089
Ri-won / Run, run!

881
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:24,769
Ri-won / I’m dying of curiosity

882
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:28,499
Da-gyo / Everyone’s super curious

883
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:35,809
Ri-won / They said someone new arrived, right?

884
00:46:35,819 --> 00:46:37,289
Jin-ah / It’s you, Ri-won, you’re the new one

885
00:46:37,299 --> 00:46:40,409
Ri-won / Hello~

886
00:46:40,419 --> 00:46:42,169
Jin-ah / Your hair looks nice

887
00:46:42,179 --> 00:46:44,049
Ri-won / I got it done

888
00:46:44,059 --> 00:46:45,776
Ri-won / Nice to meet you

889
00:46:47,897 --> 00:46:50,297
Seo-yeon / Hello

890
00:46:56,017 --> 00:46:58,457
Ri-won / Why do you like Mi-rang?

891
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,727
Ri-won / Mi-rang

892
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:01,727
Ri-won / Why do you like her?

893
00:47:01,737 --> 00:47:02,927
Jin-ah / Even your face...

894
00:47:02,937 --> 00:47:05,977
Ri-won / You're losing control of your expression, Mi-rang

895
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:13,887
Min-woo / Hello, I’m Son Min-woo

896
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:14,647
Song Min-woo?

897
00:47:14,657 --> 00:47:15,647
Min-woo / Son Min-woo

898
00:47:15,657 --> 00:47:16,977
Jin-ah / Son Min-woo

899
00:47:23,097 --> 00:47:25,087
Min-woo / People often say my first impression

900
00:47:25,097 --> 00:47:27,607
Min-woo / is that I look cold

901
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:28,687
Min-woo / So

902
00:47:28,697 --> 00:47:31,447
Min-woo / people might find me hard to approach at first

903
00:47:31,457 --> 00:47:33,967
Min-woo / Some even think I wouldn’t respond to them

904
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:36,057
Min-woo / But actually, I’m really sensitive

905
00:47:36,497 --> 00:47:38,247
Min-woo / I can quickly pick up on how others feel

906
00:47:38,257 --> 00:47:42,537
Min-woo / That’s probably one of my strengths

907
00:47:42,937 --> 00:47:45,527
Min-woo / I like people who like me

908
00:47:45,537 --> 00:47:48,207
Min-woo / If I don’t like someone...

909
00:47:48,217 --> 00:47:50,287
Min-woo / even if they offered me a billion won

910
00:47:50,297 --> 00:47:53,337
Min-woo / I wouldn't want to spend even a moment at a cafe with them

911
00:47:54,017 --> 00:47:55,807
Min-woo / I get super jealous

912
00:47:55,817 --> 00:47:59,137
Min-woo / "I’ll lock you in the prison of me forever"

913
00:47:59,777 --> 00:48:02,327
Min-woo / I don’t want love to cause conflict

914
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,727
Min-woo / I want love to help us

915
00:48:03,737 --> 00:48:05,697
Min-woo / support each other through everything

916
00:48:06,457 --> 00:48:08,127
Min-woo / A love like in dramas

917
00:48:08,137 --> 00:48:10,577
Min-woo / That’s what I want to create

918
00:48:18,457 --> 00:48:20,927
Da-gyo / Should we introduce ourselves one by one?

919
00:48:20,937 --> 00:48:23,017
Da-gyo / I’m Park Da-gyo

920
00:48:23,297 --> 00:48:24,527
Min-woo / Park Da-gyo?

921
00:48:24,537 --> 00:48:26,247
Da-gyo / Yes, that’s right

922
00:48:26,257 --> 00:48:28,087
Jin-ah / I’m Kim Jin-ah

923
00:48:28,097 --> 00:48:29,607
Min-woo / Kim Jin-ah?

924
00:48:29,617 --> 00:48:30,887
Hee-young / I’m Park Hee-young

925
00:48:30,897 --> 00:48:32,177
Min-woo / Park Hee-young

926
00:48:32,617 --> 00:48:34,207
Seo-yeon / I’m Kim Seo-yeon

927
00:48:34,217 --> 00:48:36,186
Min-woo / Kim Seo-yeon

928
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:37,489
Ri-won / I'm Kim Ri-won

929
00:48:37,499 --> 00:48:38,939
Min-woo / Ah, Ri-won, got it

930
00:48:38,943 --> 00:48:40,773
Han-kyul / I’m Jeong Han-kyul

931
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:43,063
Min-woo / Jeong Han-kyul?

932
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,733
Mi-rang / Mi-rang...

933
00:48:47,743 --> 00:48:49,053
Mi-rang / Kim Mi-rang

934
00:48:49,063 --> 00:48:50,423
Hee-young / What was that hahaha

935
00:48:51,023 --> 00:48:52,213
Min-woo / Kim Mi-rang...

936
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,463
Min-woo / You must be really shy

937
00:48:58,543 --> 00:49:03,453
Min-woo / Since I’m joining in the middle

938
00:49:03,463 --> 00:49:05,063
Min-woo / someone will have to head out first

939
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:14,170
Min-woo / Han-kyul, please get ready

940
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:16,570
Min-woo / Han-kyul, please get ready

941
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:17,994
Han-kyul / Me?

942
00:49:17,973 --> 00:49:20,083
Ri-won / What do you mean?

943
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:21,853
Min-woo / I think you should go get ready for your date

944
00:49:21,856 --> 00:49:23,776
Jin-ah / Ah~ you scared me

945
00:49:25,704 --> 00:49:26,567
Ri-won / I was so surprised
Han-kyul / I thought I got eliminated

946
00:49:26,577 --> 00:49:29,140
Hee-young / Thought it was a survival show

947
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,534
Ri-won / I was so shocked

948
00:49:30,544 --> 00:49:32,623
Hee-young / Was this Squid Game?

949
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:36,750
Mi-rang / I’m actually curious how she made her choice

950
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,866
Min-woo / I picked in about three seconds

951
00:49:49,876 --> 00:49:51,906
Min-woo / Han-kyul had this aura

952
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:54,506
Min-woo / Something that radiated on her own

953
00:49:54,516 --> 00:49:59,106
Min-woo / And her eyes were really pretty

954
00:49:59,116 --> 00:50:01,596
Min-woo / Especially when she blinked from the side

955
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:16,256
Ri-won / So, you chose Han-kyul earlier

956
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:19,346
Ri-won / Are you open to choosing someone else next time?

957
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:23,833
Min-woo / Let’s just wait and see when the time comes

958
00:50:23,866 --> 00:50:26,056
Ri-won / So there’s a chance you’ll keep choosing Han-kyul?

959
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:29,586
Da-gyo / Wait, you just got here!

960
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:33,736
Ri-won / I seriously didn’t expect you to pick Han-kyul

961
00:50:33,746 --> 00:50:36,176
Ri-won / But then you did, and I was like—

962
00:50:36,186 --> 00:50:40,466
Ri-won / “What’s going on?” That kind of thought

963
00:50:41,186 --> 00:50:42,976
Ri-won / Like, why Han-kyul of all people?

964
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:45,896
Ri-won / That’s what crossed my mind

965
00:50:45,906 --> 00:50:49,266
Ri-won / From what I see, Min-woo

966
00:50:50,586 --> 00:50:53,656
Ri-won / you’re either an ENTP or ENFP

967
00:50:53,666 --> 00:51:00,096
Ri-won / but right now, aren’t you kind of pretending to be more feminine?

968
00:51:00,106 --> 00:51:02,546
Min-woo / What are you even talking about?

969
00:51:05,466 --> 00:51:07,986
Hee-young / This is fun hahaha

970
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:10,776
Jin-ah / We’re like occasional viewers now

971
00:51:10,786 --> 00:51:13,626
Ri-won / That’s why I’m so glad Min-woo’s here

972
00:51:13,986 --> 00:51:15,306
Ri-won / I really am

973
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:19,293
Min-woo / Are you all set?

974
00:51:19,303 --> 00:51:20,160
Han-kyul / Yes

975
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:23,240
Min-woo / It’s cold, are you okay?

976
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,730
Min-woo / Then the rest...

977
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,388
Min-woo / Those who are staying behind get a gift

978
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:30,890
Ri-won / That sounds great

979
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:33,770
Jin-ah / A good person~

980
00:51:38,817 --> 00:51:40,407
Ri-won / Are they getting married now?

981
00:51:40,417 --> 00:51:42,047
Ri-won / Is it a wedding gift?

982
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:44,087
Da-gyo / Have a good time

983
00:51:44,097 --> 00:51:45,047
Ri-won / Take care

984
00:51:45,057 --> 00:51:47,537
Jin-ah / Have fun on your date

985
00:51:58,390 --> 00:51:58,887
Min-woo / You can get in

986
00:51:58,897 --> 00:52:01,958
Min-woo / You can get in
Han-kyul / Here?

987
00:52:07,297 --> 00:52:08,777
Han-kyul / Aren’t you cold?

988
00:52:09,257 --> 00:52:11,217
Min-woo / I am cold

989
00:52:13,177 --> 00:52:15,177
Route 1 — Coastal Road

990
00:52:18,577 --> 00:52:19,567
Min-woo / Do you have your seatbelt on?

991
00:52:19,577 --> 00:52:23,858
Han-kyul / Yes, I’m buckling up now

992
00:52:29,177 --> 00:52:31,417
Min-woo / Ready to go?

993
00:52:37,897 --> 00:52:41,247
Min-woo / Is that hail or rain?

994
00:52:41,257 --> 00:52:43,600
Han-kyul / Are you asking if it’s hail?

995
00:52:43,586 --> 00:52:47,077
Han-kyul / Wouldn’t hail fall more like plop-plop?

996
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:48,870
Min-woo / Yeah I mean...

997
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,500
Min-woo / This is my first time seeing snow in Jeju

998
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:57,550
Han-kyul / Me too

999
00:52:59,581 --> 00:53:03,100
Min-woo / I’ve never seen snowflakes blowing like this before

1000
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:04,310
Min-woo / It’s my first time

1001
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:10,100
Han-kyul / But in Seoul, did you see how the first snow fell like a snowstorm?

1002
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:11,940
Han-kyul / It was really heavy

1003
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:19,070
Han-kyul / But here, it’s more like it’s softly drifting down

1004
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:23,060
Min-woo / I don't think anything will be more memorable than seeing snow in Jeju

1005
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:26,550
Min-woo / Nothing else will top this

1006
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:36,310
Min-woo / Going on a drive right after moving in made it all feel real

1007
00:53:36,743 --> 00:53:38,933
Min-woo / That's when it hit me

1008
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,413
Min-woo / I really came to Jeju

1009
00:53:40,423 --> 00:53:42,703
Min-woo / And there's someone next to me now

1010
00:53:54,757 --> 00:53:58,147
Min-woo / The sun is out but it’s snowing

1011
00:53:58,157 --> 00:53:59,637
Min-woo / What a mysterious country

1012
00:54:00,997 --> 00:54:05,467
Han-kyul / But how did I end up being the one to come with you?

1013
00:54:05,477 --> 00:54:08,077
Han-kyul / What kind of system was it?

1014
00:54:08,797 --> 00:54:09,507
Min-woo / System?

1015
00:54:09,517 --> 00:54:10,227
Han-kyul / Yeah

1016
00:54:10,237 --> 00:54:12,877
Min-woo / There wasn’t one. I just went with my gut

1017
00:54:13,397 --> 00:54:16,187
Han-kyul / You had to choose just from the first glance?

1018
00:54:16,197 --> 00:54:18,907
Han-kyul / Right after we all introduced ourselves?

1019
00:54:18,917 --> 00:54:20,787
Min-woo / Yeah, when I said hello—that was it

1020
00:54:20,797 --> 00:54:23,037
Min-woo / I didn’t know who was there until that moment

1021
00:54:23,877 --> 00:54:27,267
Min-woo / Your face was just the most my style

1022
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:30,197
Han-kyul / I honestly thought I was getting sent home

1023
00:54:31,317 --> 00:54:34,587
Han-kyul / I was mentally packing my suitcase

1024
00:54:34,597 --> 00:54:36,667
Han-kyul / Because before that

1025
00:54:36,677 --> 00:54:39,507
Han-kyul / I did get a note last night, but

1026
00:54:39,517 --> 00:54:43,107
Han-kyul / During the first impressions vote, I didn’t get a single vote

1027
00:54:43,117 --> 00:54:43,987
Han-kyul / So I was kind of down...

1028
00:54:43,997 --> 00:54:46,547
Min-woo / You didn’t get a single vote in the first round?

1029
00:54:46,557 --> 00:54:52,627
Han-kyul / I felt left out since last night

1030
00:54:52,637 --> 00:54:55,827
Han-kyul / While everyone else was getting closer

1031
00:54:55,837 --> 00:54:58,067
Han-kyul / I couldn’t really build that closeness

1032
00:54:58,077 --> 00:55:02,877
Han-kyul / I was getting ready for bed and just didn’t connect with anyone

1033
00:55:03,197 --> 00:55:05,387
Min-woo / So when I called your name

1034
00:55:05,397 --> 00:55:06,627
Min-woo / You thought you were going home?

1035
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,437
Han-kyul / Yeah

1036
00:55:11,037 --> 00:55:17,507
Han-kyul / So it was a real surprise that you actually chose me

1037
00:55:17,517 --> 00:55:19,387
Min-woo / I picked you because I liked you

1038
00:55:19,397 --> 00:55:22,277
Han-kyul / Really? Oh my gosh...

1039
00:55:24,637 --> 00:55:29,197
Han-kyul / I honestly don’t know what to do with myself...

1040
00:55:30,157 --> 00:55:32,437
Han-kyul / What kind of type do you usually like?

1041
00:55:32,557 --> 00:55:33,757
Min-woo / Me?
Han-kyul / Yeah

1042
00:55:36,957 --> 00:55:42,587
Min-woo / I like distinct features

1043
00:55:42,597 --> 00:55:46,317
Min-woo / And I tend to like monolids or partial double eyelids

1044
00:55:48,317 --> 00:55:50,747
Han-kyul / I think I have partial double eyelids

1045
00:55:50,757 --> 00:55:55,747
Min-woo / You look the most like an actress out of everyone

1046
00:55:55,757 --> 00:55:57,907
Han-kyul / Oh you’re flattering me

1047
00:55:57,917 --> 00:56:04,357
Min-woo / But your whole vibe really resonated with me...

1048
00:56:07,236 --> 00:56:09,807
Han-kyul / Honestly, when someone says that

1049
00:56:09,817 --> 00:56:13,308
Han-kyul / I never know how to react

1050
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:14,787
Min-woo / Just go with what you feel

1051
00:56:14,797 --> 00:56:19,350
Min-woo / Just go with what you feel
Han-kyul / I should respond but I freeze up

1052
00:56:19,797 --> 00:56:21,717
Han-kyul / I really do that

1053
00:56:22,037 --> 00:56:23,540
Min-woo / It’s okay to freeze up

1054
00:56:25,637 --> 00:56:28,357
Han-kyul / I’ve been so awkward this whole time

1055
00:56:28,877 --> 00:56:33,667
Han-kyul / Like I’m wondering if it’s okay to be this awkward

1056
00:56:33,677 --> 00:56:35,707
Han-kyul / I was super clumsy

1057
00:56:35,717 --> 00:56:39,227
Han-kyul / At first, my impression of Min-woo

1058
00:56:39,237 --> 00:56:42,987
Han-kyul / was that he seemed out of reach

1059
00:56:42,997 --> 00:56:45,547
Han-kyul / Totally opposite of me

1060
00:56:45,557 --> 00:56:47,547
Han-kyul / Very composed

1061
00:56:47,557 --> 00:56:49,837
Han-kyul / Clean and neat

1062
00:56:50,517 --> 00:56:53,387
Han-kyul / So when he said he chose me

1063
00:56:53,397 --> 00:56:58,237
Han-kyul / I was honestly shocked. In a refreshing way

1064
00:57:00,197 --> 00:57:04,227
Min-woo / Looks like this is the coastal road

1065
00:57:04,237 --> 00:57:06,597
Han-kyul / Coastal road

1066
00:57:11,757 --> 00:57:13,677
Min-woo / Should we stop and take a look?

1067
00:57:14,277 --> 00:57:15,867
Min-woo / Whoa this is insane!

1068
00:57:15,877 --> 00:57:18,397
Han-kyul / Wow it feels so open

1069
00:57:19,797 --> 00:57:22,597
Min-woo / It’s seriously so beautiful

1070
00:57:26,197 --> 00:57:29,267
Min-woo / I haven’t seen the sea look this sky-blue in ages

1071
00:57:29,277 --> 00:57:30,787
Min-woo / Hey, is that a stingray?

1072
00:57:30,797 --> 00:57:32,037
Han-kyul / Where?

1073
00:57:32,717 --> 00:57:36,077
Min-woo / Something huge and black just came up

1074
00:57:37,797 --> 00:57:39,627
Min-woo / Over there, look

1075
00:57:39,637 --> 00:57:41,677
Min-woo / Just kidding haha

1076
00:57:45,517 --> 00:57:47,867
Han-kyul / I seriously looked for it

1077
00:57:47,877 --> 00:57:49,867
Min-woo / But it's really beautiful, right?

1078
00:57:49,877 --> 00:57:54,707
Han-kyul / It’s been a long time since I saw such a wild ocean

1079
00:57:54,717 --> 00:57:56,507
Han-kyul / It’s been a while

1080
00:57:56,517 --> 00:58:01,307
Min-woo / Just seeing the sea like this...

1081
00:58:01,317 --> 00:58:03,587
Min-woo / and maybe a stingray too, it’s nice

1082
00:58:03,597 --> 00:58:05,387
Min-woo / I want to take a picture of this

1083
00:58:05,397 --> 00:58:08,157
Han-kyul / Me? Please take one

1084
00:58:09,957 --> 00:58:11,957
Min-woo / With the sea in the background

1085
00:58:14,477 --> 00:58:16,227
Min-woo / I could tell how nervous she was...

1086
00:58:16,237 --> 00:58:18,947
Min-woo / And I could see she felt a bit small

1087
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:22,907
Min-woo / She’s so pretty, I wondered why she seemed to lack confidence

1088
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:25,147
Min-woo / I wanted to give her more confidence

1089
00:58:25,157 --> 00:58:27,547
Min-woo / I approached her with that feeling

1090
00:58:27,557 --> 00:58:29,317
Min-woo / Like a romantic interest

1091
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:34,237
Min-woo / It's not the camera’s fault

1092
00:58:35,717 --> 00:58:37,027
Han-kyul / So you’re saying it’s my face that’s the problem...

1093
00:58:37,037 --> 00:58:38,557
Han-kyul / So you’re saying it’s my face that’s the problem...
Min-woo / Oh look! A stingray!

1094
00:58:40,757 --> 00:58:44,027
Han-kyul / You got me once, and now again

1095
00:58:44,037 --> 00:58:46,997
Han-kyul / You’re too good at lying straight-faced

1096
00:58:49,757 --> 00:58:52,397
Min-woo / This was satisfying

1097
00:59:00,957 --> 00:59:02,747
Min-woo / Thanks to you, I got to see the sea

1098
00:59:02,757 --> 00:59:06,347
Han-kyul / Why are you thanking me?

1099
00:59:06,357 --> 00:59:09,917
Min-woo / It’s because of you

1100
00:59:12,397 --> 00:59:15,557
Min-woo / That’s basalt. Basalt

1101
00:59:16,597 --> 00:59:20,637
Min-woo / Did you know Jeon Hyun-moo made that rock?

1102
00:59:20,877 --> 00:59:22,877
Han-kyul / What??

1103
00:59:23,837 --> 00:59:27,357
Han-kyul / You like the more cryptic kinds of jokes, huh

1104
00:59:28,957 --> 00:59:32,147
Min-woo / Ah, you haven’t reached that level yet

1105
00:59:32,157 --> 00:59:35,437
Min-woo / I’ll serve you a heavy dose once we’re back

1106
00:59:36,597 --> 00:59:39,837
Han-kyul / It’s hard to digest... but I’ll try

1107
00:59:40,517 --> 00:59:46,667
Han-kyul / I’m not good at leading conversations

1108
00:59:46,677 --> 00:59:50,267
Han-kyul / So I’d been feeling a bit of pressure

1109
00:59:50,277 --> 00:59:52,907
Han-kyul / But the way you make me laugh or react to random things

1110
00:59:52,917 --> 00:59:57,107
Han-kyul / And respond to even the silly stuff

1111
00:59:57,117 --> 01:00:02,077
Han-kyul / That made me feel more comfortable

1112
01:00:03,157 --> 01:00:05,357
Min-woo / Should we head back?

1113
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:18,827
Min-woo / I have a lot of things I want to ask

1114
01:00:18,837 --> 01:00:22,997
Han-kyul / Ask away. I think it’ll be easier to talk

1115
01:00:24,824 --> 01:00:28,494
Han-kyul / if we’re sitting face to face in a cafe

1116
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:30,334
Han-kyul / It’ll flow more naturally there

1117
01:00:30,344 --> 01:00:32,254
Min-woo / Yeah, I’d like to ask more at the cafe

1118
01:00:32,264 --> 01:00:33,664
Han-kyul / Okay
