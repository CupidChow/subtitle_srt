1
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,806
Ri-won / Han-kyul, have you been staring at me a lot lately?

2
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:19,786
Han-kyul / Because you're pretty
Ri-won / Because I'm pretty?

3
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,380
Ri-won / Thanks, you're pretty too

4
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,514
Ri-won / I'm curious

5
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:28,595
Ri-won / Did you think I was supposed to like you?

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,454
Ri-won / Lately that keeps... I'm so curious about that

7
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,223
Han-kyul / Once we go back to reality

8
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,602
Han-kyul / I feel like it’ll all melt away like snow

9
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,638
Ri-won / My feelings?
Han-kyul / Just everything, not just that...

10
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:39,796
Ri-won / Everyone else too? Even when I see Mi-rang, it feels certain

11
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:40,830
Han-kyul / Mi-rang, Da-gyo, like that

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,400
Han-kyul / Except for the people who are really sure

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,435
Han-kyul / I think things will just fizzle out

14
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,304
Ri-won / Why? Maybe I could like you more

15
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:51,207
Ri-won / than Mi-rang likes Da-gyo

16
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,475
Ri-won / You never know

17
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,054
Han-kyul / When you put it that way

18
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:58,314
Ri-won / That soft, baby-like tofu vibe

19
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,850
Ri-won / Younger, fair skin

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,219
Ri-won / Personality-wise too

21
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:09,192
Ri-won / I'm all about INFP, INTP, INFJ, INTJ

22
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:13,263
Han-kyul / We only have younger and INTJ in common
Ri-won / But you have fair skin

23
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,697
Han-kyul / I don’t have fair skin

24
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,777
Han-kyul / It just looks like that because I’ve got makeup on

25
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:21,071
Ri-won / And personality-wise too

26
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,574
Ri-won / I like people who kind of need to be taken care of

27
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:27,210
Han-kyul / But then I feel like

28
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,345
Han-kyul / I’d have to be all like “mom”
Ri-won / What?

29
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:31,781
Han-kyul / Like I'd have to be this “mom” figure

30
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:34,050
Ri-won / That’s okay!
Han-kyul / It is?

31
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,019
Ri-won / I just like you, Han-kyul

32
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,720
Ri-won / It’s not like “I *have* to date Han-kyul!”

33
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,291
Ri-won / Or “I’m going to make Han-kyul mine no matter what”

34
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,160
Ri-won / I just like it when you smile

35
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,729
Ri-won / I just want to make you smile

36
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,965
Ri-won / And it doesn't matter what form that takes

37
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,567
Han-kyul / That makes no sense!

38
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:53,603
Ri-won / What doesn’t make sense?
Han-kyul / How can someone be like that?

39
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:54,037
Ri-won / I don’t know, it’s just

40
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:58,441
Ri-won / When I take care of someone like this

41
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,343
Ri-won / Love them, cherish them

42
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:04,124
Ri-won / It makes me so happy to see them happy

43
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,082
Han-kyul / But isn’t that a loss for you?

44
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,651
Ri-won / Why would it be? I’m happy doing it

45
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,154
Ri-won / I’m doing it for me

46
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,456
Ri-won / That’s what makes me happy

47
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,659
Han-kyul / So you’re just going to leave like that?
Ri-won / Yeah!

48
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,229
Han-kyul / Really? You won’t even look back?

49
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,441
Ri-won / Why? Why should I?

50
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,602
Han-kyul / What if there's a chance you don't expect?

51
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,338
Han-kyul / Are you completely sure about the rest?

52
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,140
Ri-won / Oh, sorry

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,243
Ri-won / They’re all attractive in their own ways

54
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:37,757
Ri-won / But my heart

55
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,849
Ri-won / just wants what it wants

56
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,185
Ri-won / I wouldn’t have come here

57
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,320
Ri-won / and forced myself to like someone if I didn’t

58
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,168
Ri-won / I wouldn’t have pushed it like that

59
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,894
Ri-won / That’s why it’s so amazing to me

60
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,862
Ri-won / Because you’re here, Han-kyul

61
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:53,796
Ri-won / I thought there wouldn’t be anyone

62
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:54,607
Ri-won / I’d be interested in

63
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,933
Ri-won / I really thought I wouldn’t find anyone

64
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:01,437
Ri-won / But because of you, Han-kyul

65
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,149
Ri-won / I’m glad I came

66
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,843
Han-kyul / It feels like a lie, it's so unreal

67
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,512
Ri-won / Have you never had someone

68
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,491
Ri-won / who loved you this much before?

69
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,283
Han-kyul / No
Ri-won / Why not?

70
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,627
Ri-won / Was there anyone like that at all?

71
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,219
Ri-won / Or did you just not meet them?

72
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,520
Han-kyul / There were only a few

73
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,555
Ri-won / Even though there were a few?

74
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,490
Ri-won / It just didn’t work out?

75
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,358
Han-kyul / No, there really wasn’t anyone

76
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,137
Ri-won / Really?

77
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,396
Ri-won / But I bet there’ll be tons from now on

78
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,641
Ri-won / So many people who will love you deeply

79
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,835
Han-kyul / I think I’m going to cry again

80
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:38,184
Ri-won / No wait, I’m sorry, hang on
Han-kyul / I feel so bad, I don’t know what to do

81
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,820
Ri-won / What do we do

82
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,379
Ri-won / I'm sorry, I'm really sorry

83
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,191
Ri-won / Don’t cry, don’t cry

84
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,919
Min-woo / What, did someone make a newborn cry?

85
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,522
Hee-young / Did the baby throw up for the first time?

86
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,557
Min-woo / What happened?
Hee-young / Look at her going, “What do we do about our baby?”

87
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,292
Hee-young / I’m seriously losing it

88
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,194
Hee-young / Wow, this is amazing!

89
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,096
Hee-young / She's such a romantic, seriously

90
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:03,967
Ri-won / No but really really

91
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:08,538
Han-kyul / I worked so hard to get the puffiness down
Ri-won / What? What did you say?

92
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,341
Ri-won / But even that is kind of cute, so what do I do

93
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,543
Ri-won / Even that’s kind of adorable

94
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,979
Ri-won / When you cry, I feel like crying too

95
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,258
Ri-won / Don’t cry

96
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:38,034
Han-kyul / I didn’t really want to talk

97
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,736
Han-kyul / about these kinds of things

98
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,137
Ri-won / Because you felt like you’d cry? These deep-down things?

99
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:43,539
Han-kyul / These things that feel like my lowest self

100
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,852
Han-kyul / About why I couldn’t be loved

101
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:50,880
Han-kyul / I didn’t want to talk about things like that

102
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,548
Seo-yeon / There's this thing called the daily tear quota

103
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,017
Seo-yeon / I said I wouldn't cry anymore today

104
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,519
Han-kyul / She made me cry

105
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,565
Han-kyul / I really wasn’t going to cry

106
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,493
Ri-won / Just another episode in a tough 20-year-old's growth diary

107
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,495
Ri-won / When Han-kyul started crying

108
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,931
Ri-won / I suddenly teared up too

109
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:10,333
Ri-won / I was surprised myself

110
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,202
Ri-won / I'm the type who cries when someone I like cries

111
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,581
Ri-won / That's just how I am

112
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:19,442
Ri-won / I thought, “Han-kyul's crying so now I’m crying too”

113
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,655
Ri-won / That thought itself felt so strange to me

114
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,481
Han-kyul / I still don’t know

115
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,783
Han-kyul / It feels like she's saying these things

116
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,085
Han-kyul / just to ease my mind

117
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,887
Han-kyul / If it were something I could logically accept

118
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,089
Han-kyul / I think I could believe it was sincere

119
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:35,758
Han-kyul / But it just sounds like some unicorn fantasy

120
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,794
Han-kyul / How could doing that make someone happy?

121
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,973
Han-kyul / I mean, I’m super grateful, of course

122
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,312
Ri-won / Love note?

123
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:04,687
Han-kyul / Among the anonymous notes I’ve received so far

124
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,966
Ri-won / Whoa hurry, go, hurry!

125
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,725
Hee-young / Is this the 'love note' thing?

126
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,692
Min-woo / I'm going!

127
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,605
Hee-young / Gasp! Oh my gosh!

128
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,608
Min-woo / This is gonna be fun

129
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,966
Ri-won / Hey, it's until 9, hurry!

130
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,234
Ri-won / There’s not much time left

131
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,536
Ri-won / 4 minutes left! 4 minutes!

132
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,316
Ri-won / Only 4 minutes! 4 minutes!

133
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,219
Hee-young / Oh no, only 4 minutes left

134
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:30,590
Mi-rang / What is it? I’m gonna go check

135
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,518
Ri-won / Oh it’s her!

136
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,153
Ri-won / The one who writes with her left hand, her!

137
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,321
Ri-won / You're dead meat!

138
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,533
Han-kyul / Aren’t you curious about the one with the “ㅋㅋ”?

139
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,125
Ri-won / I think I already get the “ㅋㅋ” one

140
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,228
Ri-won / I was just so curious about the one written in left hand

141
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,096
Ri-won / I debated between that and the “ㅋㅋ”

142
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:53,136
Ri-won / But then I thought “the left-hand one feels sneakier”

143
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:56,372
Ri-won / So I was like, “I *have* to find out who wrote this!”

144
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,452
Ri-won / And I picked that one and asked right away

145
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,545
Han-kyul / Ugh, I’m curious

146
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:05,615
Han-kyul / On the day I received two notes

147
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,649
Han-kyul / One was from Ri-won

148
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,927
Han-kyul / But the other one wasn’t

149
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,887
Han-kyul / That person just left one note

150
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,555
Han-kyul / And never sent another after that

151
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,233
Han-kyul / So I’ve been really curious who it was

152
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:18,337
Hee-young / Hurry hurry 3 minutes 3 minutes

153
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,530
Seo-yeon / Everyone's really in a rush

154
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,130
Hee-young / Huh?

155
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,732
Seo-yeon / Everyone's rushing

156
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,967
Hee-young / I really couldn't understand what it said

157
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,246
Hee-young / The sentence structure was so weird

158
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,407
Hee-young / 'What is this? Is it from a competitor trying to confuse me?'

159
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,209
Hee-young / I had one that made me think that

160
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,778
Hee-young / I really had no clue who it was from

161
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,157
Hee-young / So I ended up picking that one

162
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,892
Hee-young / Did you send yours?

163
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,651
Seo-yeon / I know everything

164
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,728
Hee-young / So you don’t need to send one?
 

165
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,286
Hee-young / So you don’t need to send one?
Seo-yeon / Yeah

166
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,421
Hee-young / Are you sure?

167
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,857
Seo-yeon / The first note was from Ri-won

168
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,126
Seo-yeon / She actually said it herself

169
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,695
Seo-yeon / And the second one was from Min-woo

170
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:55,298
Seo-yeon / He made it obvious in the note

171
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,468
Seo-yeon / I only got two notes in total

172
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,646
Seo-yeon / So there were none left to ask about

173
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,941
Jin-ah / There was really just one note I was curious about

174
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:05,685
Jin-ah / Just one

175
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,644
Jin-ah / The second note from the very first day

176
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,591
Jin-ah / I really had no idea who it was from

177
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,420
Min-woo / It was a note that said ‘Sleep well’

178
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,365
Min-woo / 'I hope you sleep peacefully' meant a lot to me

179
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,567
Min-woo / That really meant a lot to me

180
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,659
Jin-ah / Honestly I had big hopes

181
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,207
Min-woo / So I wanted to know who wrote that one the most

182
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,442
Min-woo / So I chose that note

183
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,208
Mi-rang / That drawing of the suitcase was so cute

184
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,744
Mi-rang / I thought it was from Jin-ah

185
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:45,324
Mi-rang / And I wanted to check if it really was from her

186
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,321
Han-kyul / That “let’s get to know each other more” thing—if

187
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,457
Han-kyul / it was from someone I was interested in

188
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,825
Han-kyul / I would’ve written a note today saying

189
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,727
Han-kyul / “Why didn’t you try to get to know me?”

190
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:00,897
Han-kyul / I’d totally call them out
Ri-won / Do it!

191
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:04,800
Han-kyul / Be like, “Why didn’t you try to get to know me?”

192
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,280
Han-kyul / It’s not fair
Ri-won / Exactly

193
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,373
Han-kyul / If it was someone I liked, I’d definitely confront them

194
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,008
Ri-won / Someone you liked? Hee-young?

195
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,719
Han-kyul / No way Hee-young would’ve written it to me

196
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,845
Ri-won / Da-gyo?

197
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,613
Han-kyul / But things are already pretty far along there

198
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,248
Han-kyul / There’s no way to change it now

199
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,783
Ri-won / That’s true

200
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:23,452
Han-kyul / It’s like she wasn’t “assigned” to me

201
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,688
Han-kyul / So when I tried to test the waters

202
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,099
Han-kyul / she shut it down right away

203
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,025
Han-kyul / Nope, never mind

204
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,962
Han-kyul / I like older women with short hair

205
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,608
Ri-won / Oh my god, you’re too funny

206
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,369
Hee-young / Making me wait like this

207
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,437
Seo-yeon / Everyone’s freaking out right now

208
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,638
Seo-yeon / It’s chaos

209
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:47,643
Hee-young / I’ve never waited this anxiously for someone to contact me

210
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,789
Hee-young / Ugh, just tell me already

211
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:53,416
Ri-won / Oh! It’s Han-kyul!

212
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,750
Han-kyul / Sh*t!

213
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,063
Ri-won / It’s Han-kyul!

214
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,859
Ri-won / Right? I told you it was her

215
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,096
Ri-won / I told you it was Da-gyo

216
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,066
Ri-won / Anyway go tell Da-gyo

217
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,168
Han-kyul / “Let’s get to know each other more,” then

218
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,970
Han-kyul / “Why didn’t you try to know me?”

219
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,038
Ri-won / Yeah, say that to Da-gyo

220
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,007
Han-kyul / But maybe she just

221
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,909
Han-kyul / didn’t have anyone to send the note to

222
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,278
Han-kyul / and just picked someone randomly

223
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,824
Han-kyul / If I say that, she might just be like, “So what?”

224
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,283
Ri-won / Whatever it is

225
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,185
Ri-won / if you say that, it’s cute

226
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,730
Han-kyul / I doubt she’ll think it’s cute

227
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,255
Ri-won / Of course she will! Da-gyo’s kind

228
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,067
Ri-won / She’ll probably explain it to you

229
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,526
Han-kyul / Should I ask her?

230
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:40,262
Han-kyul / Honestly, I was a bit frustrated at first

231
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,331
Han-kyul / But then I realized

232
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,511
Han-kyul / “Oh right, that note was written before I revealed my age!”

233
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,004
Han-kyul / So maybe she

234
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,906
Han-kyul / thought I was the same age or older

235
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,843
Han-kyul / That could’ve been why she wrote it

236
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,690
Han-kyul / Then I was like, “Oh, it was never gonna happen anyway” and felt better

237
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:01,450
Han-kyul / So I decided not to think too deeply about that note

238
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,295
Han-kyul / and just let it go

239
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,898
Ri-won / I was really surprised

240
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,434
Ri-won / Why does Jin-ah see me as a rival?

241
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,169
Ri-won / Jin-ah didn’t send a note to Han-kyul

242
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,937
Ri-won / but sent a “rival” note to me

243
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,874
Ri-won / And then called Han-kyul afterward

244
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:28,711
Ri-won / I really don’t understand what she meant by that

245
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,580
Ri-won / So on the day the rival note was sent

246
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,985
Ri-won / I was just curious who she wrote down as

247
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:38,921
Ri-won / the person she wanted to spend the night with

248
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,356
Ri-won / I’m really curious

249
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,590
Ri-won / who that was

250
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,705
Ri-won / Because I started wondering if that was connected somehow

251
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,041
Seo-yeon / Gasp it’s here!

252
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,143
Hee-young / Who is it?

253
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:58,084
Seo-yeon / Is it Mi-rang?

254
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:01,620
Hee-young / Oh my god!

255
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,205
Hee-young / That’s insane

256
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,508
Hee-young / Are you kidding me I never imagined that

257
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,169
Seo-yeon / Who is it now I’m curious

258
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,548
Seo-yeon / Who is it now I’m curious
Hee-young / Wow it’s beyond anything I imagined

259
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:30,806
Hee-young / What do I do?

260
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,352
Hee-young / What do I do?
Seo-yeon / Who is it to make you react like that

261
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,988
Hee-young / I seriously just

262
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,219
Seo-yeon / What an egg?

263
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,420
Hee-young / Ah...

264
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,332
Han-kyul / Why are you smiling like that?

265
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:47,933
Ri-won / I guess it's shocking.

266
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,770
Hee-young / Ah... that was fun

267
00:12:56,242 --> 00:13:00,646
Hee-young / I kept saying I didn’t understand what it meant
Seo-yeon / But now that you see it it makes sense?

268
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,605
Hee-young / But still it’s weird...

269
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,007
Hee-young / Yeah it’s still weird actually

270
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:05,818
Hee-young / Jin-ah

271
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:10,179
Seo-yeon / When... but when...
 

272
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,782
Seo-yeon / When... but when...
Hee-young / That time you know\...

273
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,627
Seo-yeon / What did it say?

274
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,931
Hee-young / 'Why was it so blurry anyway I’m sorry'

275
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,890
Hee-young / 'Since I keep being alone

276
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,768
Hee-young / it really hurts my heart...!'

277
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,626
Hee-young / What does that even mean?

278
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,729
Seo-yeon / Sorry I like you

279
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,730
Seo-yeon / I think it just meant sorry

280
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,607
Seo-yeon / Sorry

281
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,100
Hee-young / That’s why I didn’t know who it was

282
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,969
Hee-young / I ruled them out completely

283
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,504
Hee-young / Oh I see

284
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,650
Hee-young / I really tried to understand it

285
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,607
Hee-young / I did figure out who it was

286
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,776
Hee-young / but I still don’t understand it

287
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,422
Hee-young / What were they trying to say?

288
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,568
Jin-ah / I sent the second note on the first day

289
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,059
Jin-ah / to Mi-rang

290
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,694
Jin-ah / It’s such a shame

291
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:02,531
Jin-ah / You really shouldn’t miss the timing of love

292
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:08,013
Jin-ah / When you feel both curiosity and anxiety

293
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:11,807
Jin-ah / you just have to go for it without hesitation

294
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:15,811
Jin-ah / I’m disappointed I couldn’t do that

295
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,547
Jin-ah / but I think I learned something big

296
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:22,885
Jin-ah / So in the future when I fall in love again

297
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:29,859
Jin-ah / I won't let fear or hesitation hold me back anymore

298
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:34,273
Jin-ah / I’ll just go for it without any regrets

299
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,907
Min-woo / I kind of expected it

300
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,343
Min-woo / I figured it was someone who knew I have trouble sleeping

301
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,411
Min-woo / It wasn’t someone random

302
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,580
Min-woo / So I wasn’t totally shocked

303
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,983
Min-woo / But I wasn’t disappointed either

304
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,018
Min-woo / Still I was a little bummed it wasn’t Hee-young

305
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:01,033
Min-woo / I was a bit disappointed it wasn’t Hee-young

306
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,710
Da-gyo / I see

307
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,610
Mi-rang / This person never really

308
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,945
Mi-rang / showed anything on the outside

309
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,147
Mi-rang / You gave me two votes and showed your feelings

310
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,292
Mi-rang / I was really grateful

311
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,527
Mi-rang / It was the person I said I was a fan of

312
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,052
Mi-rang / I sent the first note

313
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,165
Mi-rang / and then I didn’t send another one after that

314
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,824
Mi-rang / So I thought they might feel more sad than sorry

315
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:37,303
Mi-rang / That thought crossed my mind

316
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,501
Should we do a face mask before bed?

317
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:49,972
Mi-rang / Love it Do it for me

318
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,885
Mi-rang / Stick it on for me~

319
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,944
Mi-rang / After coming back from the beach

320
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,289
Da-gyo / But the beach in the morning was really

321
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,091
Da-gyo / super windy

322
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,895
Mi-rang / The weather was great but the wind was too much

323
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,054
Da-gyo / Have you ever done this before?

324
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,655
Da-gyo / Has someone done this for you?

325
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:09,258
Mi-rang / No never

326
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,471
Da-gyo / My hands are shaking so much

327
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,806
Da-gyo / Trembling trembling

328
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,140
Da-gyo / I’m nervous

329
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:18,133
Da-gyo / I’ve never put a mask on someone before

330
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,112
Mi-rang / Oh really?

331
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,088
Mi-rang / The others are thin

332
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,657
Mi-rang / and kind of feel like wet wipes

333
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,660
Mi-rang / But this one is super dense and thick

334
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,771
Da-gyo / You can sleep with it on

335
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:49,341
Da-gyo / It's better if you leave it on for at least 3 hours

336
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,067
Da-gyo / They said it’s great as a sleeping pack

337
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:52,534
Da-gyo / Let’s sleep with it on tonight
 

338
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,946
Da-gyo / Let’s sleep with it on tonight
Mi-rang / Ah collagen

339
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:55,647
Da-gyo / How is it?

340
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,749
Mi-rang / It’s so good

341
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,307
Da-gyo / What are you talking about haha

342
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,410
Mi-rang / Anything’s good if it’s with you

343
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,654
Da-gyo / She says it’s all good haha

344
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,024
Mi-rang / Should I put one on you too?

345
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,835
Da-gyo / Oh you’re better at applying it than me

346
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,770
Mi-rang / How is it? Did I put it on well?

347
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,005
Mi-rang / Your skin looks really good

348
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,607
Da-gyo / I have this on and my skin looks good?

349
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,409
Mi-rang / Your skin looks really good

350
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,410
Mi-rang / It’s glowing

351
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,355
Da-gyo / If you sleep with this on your skin gets super hydrated

352
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,815
Mi-rang / It doesn't fall off even if I lie on my side now

353
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,627
Da-gyo / Then let’s sleep with it on tonight

354
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,220
Mi-rang / This is kind of exciting

355
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,398
Da-gyo / Why?

356
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:55,541
Da-gyo / It definitely feels different sleeping like this right?

357
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,446
Da-gyo / Were all your notes totally obvious?

358
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,814
Da-gyo / Did everyone make it clear in their writing?

359
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,139
Mi-rang / Yeah I mean yeah

360
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,051
Da-gyo / Oh really?

361
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,142
Mi-rang / What about you?

362
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,178
Da-gyo / I don’t think it was like that for me

363
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:13,816
Da-gyo / I just tried to match it based on my memory of the day

364
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,651
Da-gyo / It’s not like the handwriting gave it away

365
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,087
Da-gyo / Like ‘notice me!’ kind of notes

366
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,499
Da-gyo / The ones I got weren’t like that

367
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,503
Da-gyo / You’re not sleepy right?

368
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,533
Mi-rang / You can put your leg up

369
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:34,169
Da-gyo / Where? Here?

370
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,104
Mi-rang / Go ahead

371
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,371
Da-gyo / No...

372
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:37,773
Da-gyo / I can’t~

373
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,487
Mi-rang / Why? I actually really like it when someone puts their leg on me

374
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,046
Da-gyo / Really?

375
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:48,650
Da-gyo / But I’m really heavy

376
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,562
Mi-rang / Oh it’s fine

377
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:58,060
Mi-rang / Do you like physical affection?

378
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,974
Da-gyo / Why? Why are you asking?

379
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:06,135
Da-gyo / Are you asking because you like it?

380
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,005
Da-gyo / My ears are getting hot right now

381
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,618
Mi-rang / I...

382
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,893
Da-gyo / Why?

383
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:24,419
Mi-rang / You’re imagining things about us aren’t you?

384
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,565
Da-gyo / What are you saying I am not

385
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,689
Mi-rang / Got you

386
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,026
Da-gyo / No way what are you talking about

387
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,729
Da-gyo / You’re the one who started it with that question

388
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:37,276
Da-gyo / I wasn’t imagining anything like that

389
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:48,944
Da-gyo / You’re the one who got flustered huh?

390
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,024
Mi-rang / I imagined it...

391
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,035
Mi-rang / I mean touching the tummy should be fine right?

392
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,141
Da-gyo / What are you talking about

393
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:15,103
Mi-rang / Why are you so skinny

394
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:20,375
Mi-rang / Why are your ribs sticking out like that?

395
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,945
Da-gyo / It’s because I’m lying down

396
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:26,158
Mi-rang / You’re way too thin

397
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,697
Mi-rang / My mind’s going blank

398
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,492
Hee-young / But up until now

399
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,905
Hee-young / the timing of everything has been so oddly perfect

400
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:44,132
Hee-young / Like suddenly ending up on a date with Da-gyo

401
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,044
Hee-young / and then suddenly Seo-yeon taking Mi-rang

402
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,903
Hee-young / That's how things turned out

403
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,972
Hee-young / If not for that we probably still wouldn’t have known

404
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,050
Han-kyul / But can you tell me what happened

405
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,409
Han-kyul / between you and Jin-ah?

406
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,587
Han-kyul / With Jin-ah?

407
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,891
Han-kyul / The way I saw her it kind of felt like

408
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,051
Han-kyul / something shifted suddenly over the past few days

409
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,021
Han-kyul / She seemed kind of isolated from the group

410
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:09,658
Han-kyul / Like she felt she was excluding herself

411
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,026
Han-kyul / That was the impression I got

412
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,695
Han-kyul / And I thought, why should anyone have to feel that way

413
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,340
Han-kyul / That was on my mind too

414
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:23,538
Hee-young / I became her roommate and stayed with Da-gyo

415
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,651
Hee-young / She expressed her feelings to me very actively

416
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,175
Hee-young / And talked about her values, life philosophy

417
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:30,222
Hee-young / And her thoughts on marriage

418
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,182
Hee-young / But if someone changes or

419
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,817
Hee-young / if other people act the same way

420
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,263
Hee-young / She’d say she couldn’t do that and so on

421
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,532
Hee-young / And even then she kept getting zero votes

422
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,769
Hee-young / But she kept coming to me and saying things like that

423
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,327
Hee-young / So

424
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,973
Hee-young / I thought, ‘This person says one thing but acts another way’

425
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,132
Hee-young / So I just stayed quiet

426
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,778
Hee-young / I didn’t have a second choice

427
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,047
Hee-young / On day 3, they told us to write it in 5 minutes

428
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,006
Hee-young / So I just wrote it quickly

429
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:01,687
Hee-young / But she left the room making sarcastic remarks

430
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,578
Hee-young / Like, ‘Okay, because of you

431
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,490
Hee-young / I’m going on a date with someone else’

432
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,783
Hee-young / ‘I picked you’ she said, and mumbled stuff

433
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,685
Hee-young / And I was just speechless

434
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,930
Hee-young / If I had chosen Jin-ah

435
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:13,822
Hee-young / and we didn’t get matched for the date

436
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,534
Hee-young / then she was lying

437
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,692
Hee-young / And if it wasn’t a lie

438
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:20,472
Hee-young / and it changed because of the system

439
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,700
Hee-young / That’s possible it happens right?

440
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,145
Hee-young / But that attitude—I just can’t accept it

441
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:33,018
Hee-young / So I thought that and went karting

442
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,144
Hee-young / I didn’t feel like talking to her

443
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,246
Hee-young / I just focused on driving the kart

444
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:40,816
Hee-young / And whenever she came to talk

445
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,251
Hee-young / I would respond

446
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,820
Hee-young / She said she had a really hard time because of me

447
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,289
Hee-young / That her PTSD from being outcast came back

448
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,134
Hee-young / That she felt excluded by others because of me

449
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,025
Hee-young / That she was ignored

450
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,670
Hee-young / That it was too violent

451
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:56,098
Hee-young / She said my behavior toward her was violent

452
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,143
Hee-young / And that she wanted to leave

453
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:03,181
Hee-young / She said she felt like we weren’t communicating at all and that it was all one-sided

454
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,811
Hee-young / More than what Jin-ah said

455
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:13,759
Hee-young / I think I was more frustrated with myself

456
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,602
Han-kyul / I didn’t know anything, so I ended up looking like a fool?

457
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,605
Ri-won / You’re not a fool, it’s just...

458
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,474
Hee-young / Han-kyul was just being Han-kyul

459
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,444
Hee-young / No, Jin-ah was being Jin-ah

460
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:33,979
Hee-young / And Hee-young was being Hee-young

461
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,071
Han-kyul / I just couldn’t figure out what was going on

462
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,450
Han-kyul / So I think I just believed whatever she told me

463
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,714
Jin-ah / My mission is to talk with Han-kyul and Seo-yeon today or tomorrow

464
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,416
Jin-ah / I really want to have that conversation

465
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,352
Jin-ah / Because once I leave, it might be goodbye forever

466
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,020
Jin-ah / A final goodbye

467
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,965
Jin-ah / But I still have feelings

468
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:55,223
Jin-ah / For Han-kyul

469
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,625
Jin-ah / And for Seo-yeon, it’s more like

470
00:23:57,635 --> 00:24:00,861
Jin-ah / To borrow Mi-rang’s words

471
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:03,008
Jin-ah / It’s like walking coming outs liked me

472
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,409
Jin-ah / And I liked those people too

473
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,868
Jin-ah / So I’ve never gone through anything hard like that

474
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,403
Jin-ah / A one-sided crush on a hetero girl?

475
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,115
Jin-ah / I’ve never even had a one-sided love

476
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,907
Jin-ah / I’ve only ever been loved and dated

477
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,708
Jin-ah / So this is all unfamiliar to me

478
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,143
Jin-ah / Saying ‘I like you first’ or ‘Please like me’

479
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,310
Jin-ah / I’ve never done that before

480
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,411
Jin-ah / It’s not that I’m amazing or anything

481
00:24:17,421 --> 00:24:19,391
Jin-ah / I just never did it because I’m scared

482
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:20,415
Jin-ah / Because I get anxious

483
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,484
Jin-ah / So with Seo-yeon and Han-kyul

484
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,564
Jin-ah / I really want to have a deep one-on-one talk with them...

485
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,423
Jin-ah / This morning when I opened my eyes

486
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,402
Jin-ah / I thought, finally after tonight

487
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:33,371
Jin-ah / I can leave the house

488
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,629
Jin-ah / But this thought

489
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,365
Jin-ah / Isn’t just because I’m tired and want to escape

490
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,233
Jin-ah / That’s definitely not the only reason

491
00:24:39,243 --> 00:24:43,371
Jin-ah / I think I’ve grown a lot through this in many ways

492
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,874
Jin-ah / So when I go back outside with this experience

493
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:50,111
Jin-ah / I think I can live proudly and strongly

494
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:55,049
Jin-ah / As a lesbian in Korea

495
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:57,095
Jin-ah / I’ve even gained that kind of confidence

496
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,666
Hee-young / Min-woo!

497
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:03,425
Min-woo / Who are you?

498
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,093
Hee-young / It’s me, Hee-young

499
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:06,628
Hee-young / Can I borrow your eyelash curler?

500
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:07,395
Min-woo / Which one?

501
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:08,196
Hee-young / The curler!

502
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,597
Min-woo / Eyelash curler?

503
00:25:09,607 --> 00:25:11,510
Min-woo / Why did you get ready so fast?

504
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,644
Hee-young / I woke up early

505
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:15,413
Hee-young / Thanks

506
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:19,050
Min-woo / I’ll stop by later

507
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,457
Min-woo / I'm roommates with Jin-ah

508
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,115
Min-woo / But even so, just casually

509
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,729
Min-woo / coming to visit our dorm, Building 1

510
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,654
Min-woo / I take that as a positive sign

511
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,756
Min-woo / Maybe she doesn't dislike me that much

512
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,324
Min-woo / Maybe I’m on her mind

513
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,692
Min-woo / That’s enough for me

514
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,462
Min-woo / Even if there’s only a 10% chance

515
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:42,274
Min-woo / That’s all I need

516
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,806
Seo-yeon / Hee-young!

517
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:54,976
Seo-yeon / Hee-young, what brings you here?

518
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:56,645
Hee-young / I came to change clothes

519
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,622
Seo-yeon / Ah...

520
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,316
Hee-young / I'm short on time

521
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:03,451
Seo-yeon / Just one minute

522
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:08,633
Hee-young / 60, 59, 58, 57...

523
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,629
Seo-yeon / Haiso

524
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,074
Hee-young / Sorry

525
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,332
Hee-young / Thank you

526
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,444
Hee-young / So it was Seo-yeon!

527
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:23,271
Hee-young / I woke up early, totally ready for battle

528
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:27,475
Hee-young / I worked out, ate breakfast alone, picked my outfit

529
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,811
Hee-young / Tried guessing what kind of date mission we’d get

530
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:34,348
Hee-young / I figured it might be something like first-come-first-served

531
00:26:34,358 --> 00:26:37,686
Hee-young / So I sat by the shoe rack with my shoes on

532
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,631
Hee-young / Ready to run out right away

533
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,631
Seo-yeon / When I opened my eyes this morning

534
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,666
Seo-yeon / I thought since today’s the last day

535
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:55,880
Seo-yeon / I’d like to go on a date with Da-gyo

536
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:58,673
Seo-yeon / Because after today there won’t be another chance

537
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,142
Seo-yeon / So I won’t have any regrets

538
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,178
Seo-yeon / I want to s hare the feelings and words I haven’t been able to

539
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:07,025
Seo-yeon / And go on a date with Da-gyo

540
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,418
Ri-won / How are you feeling today compared to yesterday?

541
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:13,355
Han-kyul / Right now I feel like I’ve just been piling up embarrassing moments

542
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:15,056
Han-kyul / One after another

543
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:15,857
Ri-won / No, no

544
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:18,727
Ri-won / Everyone knows your age now

545
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,473
Ri-won / So I think they won’t think much of it

546
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,634
Ri-won / I kind of framed it that way for you

547
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,601
Ri-won / Don’t worry

548
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,237
Han-kyul / What would I have done without you

549
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,905
Ri-won / No, I’m here, really

550
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:33,775
Ri-won / I’m so glad we ended up as roommates

551
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,844
Han-kyul / Yeah, seriously

552
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,612
Ri-won / If we hadn’t been roommates

553
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:40,682
Ri-won / Would we have even had a chance to get close?

554
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,761
Han-kyul / I was really grateful

555
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,420
Ri-won / I think it was just like usual

556
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,456
Ri-won / I didn’t really talk about how I’d make my decision

557
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,735
Ri-won / I didn’t see the need to bring that up

558
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:55,830
Ri-won / I just told Han-kyul, “Do what you want to do”

559
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,210
Ri-won / “I’ll always support you and want you to feel comfortable”

560
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,185
Min-woo / Where are you headed?

561
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,543
Hee-young / You don’t know what’s going to happen today

562
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:12,279
Hee-young / I still don’t know how it’ll turn out either

563
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:15,583
Hee-young / But what if I go for a date and it’s with someone else?

564
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:18,286
Hee-young / How would you feel about that?

565
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,098
Min-woo / That’s your choice

566
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:21,566
Min-woo / You should figure out how you feel

567
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,191
Min-woo / And if you still want to explore it

568
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,827
Min-woo / Then that’s what’s real

569
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:28,530
Hee-young / I haven’t really had a chance

570
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,665
Hee-young / To date others like this until now

571
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:34,369
Min-woo / If you were holding back because of me

572
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,603
Min-woo / Then don’t

573
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,871
Min-woo / Just follow your heart

574
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,406
Min-woo / If you’re curious then go for it

575
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,574
Min-woo / It’s better to figure it out than to wonder

576
00:28:40,584 --> 00:28:43,311
Hee-young / I think the same, and I hoped you would too

577
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,245
Hee-young / I thought we’d be on the same page
 

578
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,448
Hee-young / I thought we’d be on the same page
Min-woo / We are

579
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,483
Hee-young / Still I was curious what you’d say

580
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:50,819
Min-woo / Me? Honestly I understood

581
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,187
Min-woo / Because if there’s still curiosity

582
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,132
Min-woo / You’re going to want to know

583
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:58,692
Min-woo / I’d probably be even more curious

584
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:01,306
Hee-young / Got it
Min-woo / Go for it!

585
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:04,532
Hee-young / He was like, ‘Go ahead but I’ll be the one who’s most curious’

586
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:06,377
Hee-young / That was kind of cool

587
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:10,305
Min-woo / Honestly, I didn’t feel great about it

588
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:14,842
Min-woo / Since I like her, it felt like I was giving permission out of politeness

589
00:29:14,852 --> 00:29:17,645
Min-woo / But I couldn’t really say ‘I hope you don’t go’

590
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:22,716
Min-woo / Because I hadn’t really made a strong move on her

591
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:27,265
Min-woo / Stopping her might have actually made things worse for me

592
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:31,603
Min-woo / Saying ‘I don’t want you to go’... I felt like

593
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,773
Min-woo / I should save that for later

594
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,533
Da-gyo / Unnie, peel it off for me

595
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:10,675
Mi-rang / Everything’s white except under your eyes
Da-gyo / Huh?! Really?

596
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,811
Da-gyo / No way! What the heck\~

597
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:16,581
Mi-rang / I’m not kidding It really does look brighter

598
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,057
Mi-rang / You can’t even tell

599
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,594
Da-gyo / I’m sleepy
Mi-rang / I’m super sleepy

600
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,264
Mi-rang / Are you going to sleep more?

601
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:37,936
Da-gyo / I don’t know I feel like I should get up

602
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,490
Mi-rang / I’m so tired

603
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:36,928
Mi-rang / Hello

604
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,463
Mi-rang / I had coffee here the other day

605
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,599
Mi-rang / It was so good I came back again

606
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:45,436
Mi-rang / Could I get two Americanos?

607
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,406
Mi-rang / And which beans do you recommend?

608
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,642
‘ISO 100’ is a nutty roast

609
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,111
If you like nutty flavors, go with ISO 100

610
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:58,439
Mi-rang / Then I’ll take two ISO 100s please

611
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:03,510
Mi-rang / And one matcha cracker and one salted cracker

612
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,990
Mi-rang / Also, I live in Seoul and I was wondering

613
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:08,383
Mi-rang / Can I take some back with me?

614
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,817
Mi-rang / Like beans or drip bags?

615
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,629
We have both beans and drip bags

616
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:13,665
Mi-rang / Oh you have drip bags too?

617
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,956
Mi-rang / Then I’d love some recommendations

618
00:32:15,966 --> 00:32:18,836
Right now we have four blends in drip bags

619
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,405
And a decaf option too

620
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,797
If you want something mild and not too strong

621
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,075
The ‘Rehearsal’ blend is good

622
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:32,884
Mi-rang / Then I’ll take one Rehearsal drip bag please

623
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,967
Your drinks are ready

624
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,335
Mi-rang / Thank you

625
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,279
Mi-rang / Park Da-gyo
Da-gyo / Yeah?

626
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,381
Da-gyo / Did you get something?

627
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:06,384
Mi-rang / Coffee and cake
Da-gyo / Cake

628
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,386
Mi-rang / Yeah cake

629
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,855
Da-gyo / I woke up and she had

630
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,825
Da-gyo / bought coffee and dessert It was seriously

631
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,383
Da-gyo / really touching

632
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:19,520
Da-gyo / Waking up together after sleeping next to each other

633
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,598
Da-gyo / It all felt so real

634
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,700
Da-gyo / Did you pick?
Mi-rang / Yeah

635
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,903
Mi-rang / I guess this is their signature item

636
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,705
Da-gyo / Which one do you like more?

637
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,841
Mi-rang / Want to split them and try both?

638
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:32,944
Mi-rang / I think this one’s more my style

639
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,680
Da-gyo / Do you usually like matcha?

640
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,119
Da-gyo / I really do

641
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,865
Da-gyo / So how was it?

642
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:55,366
Da-gyo / Sleeping together, I mean?

643
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,170
Da-gyo / We’re roommates but we don’t usually sleep in the same bed

644
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:05,299
Mi-rang / I felt butterflies sharing the same bed

645
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:09,514
Mi-rang / I couldn’t sleep! My heart was about to burst

646
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:14,007
Mi-rang / So I’m super sleepy right now

647
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:15,119
Mi-rang / What about you?

648
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:18,122
Da-gyo / Are you seriously asking me that?

649
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,461
Da-gyo / But yeah, for sure

650
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:25,763
Da-gyo / Sharing a room and sharing a bed are totally different

651
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:37,231
Da-gyo / In a way, it even felt kind of awkward overnight

652
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,277
Da-gyo / But overall I was really happy

653
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,945
Da-gyo / I wanted to go on a date with her

654
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,981
Da-gyo / And we did Even though we’re roommates

655
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:47,085
Da-gyo / Sleeping in the same bed is just different from sleeping separately

656
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,243
Da-gyo / I was curious what that would feel like

657
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,879
Da-gyo / It felt like a day where I could understand unnie’s heart more

658
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,926
Da-gyo / That’s what it was for me

659
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,102
Da-gyo / Ah this is so nice

660
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:07,105
Da-gyo / It’s relaxed even though it’s a busy day You know what I mean?
Mi-rang / Totally

661
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:10,041
Da-gyo / Being away from my phone and all

662
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:13,967
Da-gyo / And being in Jeju really puts some distance from everything

663
00:35:13,977 --> 00:35:15,202
Da-gyo / If this had been in the outskirts of Gyeonggi-do

664
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:18,005
Da-gyo / It wouldn’t have felt quite like this

665
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:21,052
Da-gyo / It wouldn’t feel this disconnected from everything

666
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,087
Da-gyo / So it feels easier to really dive into this

667
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,480
Da-gyo / Yeah I’m definitely more immersed

668
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,027
Da-gyo / Once this ends it’ll feel like I’ve just woken up from a dream

669
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:42,473
Da-gyo / At first it felt really long but it actually wasn’t at all

670
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:48,079
Da-gyo / It’s weird Kind of long if you say it’s long, short if you say it’s short

671
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,547
Mi-rang / If we were heading home today

672
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,049
Mi-rang / I think I’d feel super sad about it

673
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:54,285
Da-gyo / Then yeah it would feel too short

674
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,853
Da-gyo / Like really just...

675
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:14,128
Hee-young / I was the first to arrive and saw the card

676
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,630
Hee-young / But it wasn’t a first-come, first-served mission

677
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,209
Hee-young / So I was like, ah...

678
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,211
Hee-young / I sat there feeling a bit disappointed

679
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,407
Seo-yeon / Today is the final day at the ToGetHer House

680
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,143
Seo-yeon / There's a pool party planned for the evening

681
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,322
Seo-yeon / So no need to prepare dinner separately

682
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,659
Seo-yeon / Let’s all just enjoy our final dinner together comfortably

683
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,595
Seo-yeon / Oh! Since it’s a pool party—

684
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,020
Hee-young / Did you pack your swimsuit?

685
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,421
Seo-yeon / I did pack it, but...

686
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,455
Hee-young / What did you bring?

687
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:45,092
Seo-yeon / Something conservative
Hee-young / Really?

688
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,037
Seo-yeon / Is it hot?

689
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,463
Seo-yeon / Hot girl~

690
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,898
Hee-young / I don’t even know

691
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:52,300
Seo-yeon / Since there’s a pool

692
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,645
Seo-yeon / I did think, “Maybe we’ll swim?”

693
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,304
Seo-yeon / But I never expected

694
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:58,639
Seo-yeon / all 8 of us would be doing a full-on pool party

695
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:01,175
Seo-yeon / And the idea of putting on a swimsuit

696
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:05,513
Seo-yeon / made me feel shy and worried first

697
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:08,149
Seo-yeon / But at the same time, I was a little excited

698
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,896
Seo-yeon / It was a mix of both feelings

699
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,632
Jin-ah / Look at this

700
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:16,457
Min-woo / A pool party?

701
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,227
Min-woo / But since it’s a pool party—

702
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,262
Hee-young / Did everyone bring swimsuits?

703
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,930
Min-woo / Of course I did

704
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,099
Min-woo / And I didn’t bring just one

705
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:25,943
Hee-young / How many?

706
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,947
Min-woo / I’ve been waiting for the pool party
Jin-ah / She kept doing fashion shows

707
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,139
Hee-young / You did a swimsuit fashion show?

708
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:33,274
Min-woo / Me?

709
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:37,221
Min-woo / It’s the one time you can look your most attractive

710
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:39,890
Seo-yeon / So hot

711
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:40,758
Seo-yeon / Too hot!

712
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,263
Jin-ah / Why aren’t they here yet?

713
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:48,966
Hee-young / So was the bed last night a single or a double?

714
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:51,902
Min-woo / What does that matter?

715
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,707
Min-woo / They were alone together

716
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,300
Seo-yeon / When are they coming?
Min-woo / Even if it was a double, they probably slept like it was a single

717
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:02,703
Jin-ah / They’re not back yet? Since it’s our room they’re definitely not

718
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,649
Hee-young / Hey! Hey!
Seo-yeon / They’re here

719
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:07,251
Min-woo / Hello
Ri-won / What? They’re still not back?

720
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,588
Han-kyul / Hello

721
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,090
Min-woo / Han-kyul, your style keeps getting better!

722
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,362
Ri-won / Hmph, cute right?

723
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,790
Min-woo / Take a look at this card

724
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,093
Ri-won / What is it? Today is the last day of ToGetHer

725
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,706
Ri-won / Tonight there’s a pool...

726
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:29,930
Ri-won / Pool... Bikini!?

727
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,866
Min-woo / Aren’t you a little *too* excited?

728
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,502
Jin-ah / You liked it too

729
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:36,837
Ri-won / No cooking and I get to see bikinis?

730
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,840
Min-woo / That’s exactly what I thought

731
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,885
Ri-won / This is heaven

732
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,286
Min-woo / Literally heaven

733
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,744
Ri-won / It’s a harem! A harem!

734
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:44,555
Ri-won / They even feed you

735
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,515
Min-woo / Seriously, the last day really is a party

736
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,728
Ri-won / But why aren’t Da-gyo and Mi-rang here yet?

737
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,620
Ri-won / They’re so late, like I—

738
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,155
Ri-won / I thought they’d be here in the morning

739
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,991
Min-woo / Maybe they just haven’t arrived yet?

740
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,526
Min-woo / I went upstairs and they weren’t there

741
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,095
Ri-won / Then they really didn’t come
Hee-young / Did they go somewhere far?

742
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,474
Jin-ah / Maybe they just don’t feel like coming?

743
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,966
Min-woo / That must’ve been a really good date ticket

744
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:08,913
Ri-won / Wow! I’m actually super jealous now

745
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,614
Da-gyo / Are we Building 1?
 

746
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,851
Mi-rang / Building 1
Da-gyo / Thought so

747
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:18,589
Da-gyo / It’s just one day but I already got confused again

748
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:24,385
Hee-young / There you are
Mi-rang / Hello

749
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,897
Ri-won / Speak of the devil, and the tiger appears

750
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,966
Seo-yeon / Mi-rang came in first

751
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,423
Seo-yeon / I thought I’d feel upset

752
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:32,403
Seo-yeon / But the moment I saw her face I actually felt happy

753
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,805
Seo-yeon / Then Da-gyo came in little by little

754
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,198
Seo-yeon / And took the seat next to me and got settled

755
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,711
Seo-yeon / That’s when I think the negative feelings started creeping in

756
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,447
Min-woo / Mi-rang came back looking exhausted

757
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,583
Min-woo / It totally gave off that older-younger couple vibe

758
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,652
Min-woo / That kind of feeling

759
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:53,090
Da-gyo / We just... played games

760
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,726
Da-gyo / Wrote down questions and stuff like that

761
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,962
Da-gyo / And then in the evening

762
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,831
Mi-rang / The Mimi-Bibi couple came over

763
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,323
Mi-rang / And the four of us cooked together

764
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,268
Da-gyo / So it became a double date

765
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:07,538
Ri-won / That sounds so fun
Hee-young / Ah that kind of double date

766
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,775
Da-gyo / We chatted, ate, cooked together

767
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:11,899
Ri-won / None of that matters

768
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,244
Ri-won / Was there one bed or two?

769
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:16,003
Da-gyo / We were on the first floor It was a double

770
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:18,806
Ri-won / Did you sleep together? In the same bed?
Da-gyo / We slept together in the same bed.

771
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,484
Min-woo / A double king?

772
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:23,487
Mi-rang / We did face masks

773
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:26,090
Ri-won / Under the same blanket?
Da-gyo / Yeah we slept under the same blanket

774
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,884
Hee-young / Hearing all that, I actually felt relieved

775
00:40:30,894 --> 00:40:32,129
Hee-young / That they had a fun time

776
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,231
Hee-young / They said they shared a bed

777
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:37,134
Hee-young / But as their roommate I slept next to her more

778
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,036
Hee-young / And

779
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,438
Hee-young / It didn’t feel like

780
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:42,773
Hee-young / It was the kind of date with heart-fluttering moments

781
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,443
Hee-young / So I was relieved

782
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,968
Hee-young / Behold

783
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,804
Da-gyo / Oh, really?

784
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:50,938
Mi-rang / Whoa, I love it

785
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,684
Ri-won / Is it a bikini, a one-piece, or a monokini?

786
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,620
Da-gyo / Mine’s a bit more covered-up bikini
 

787
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:59,113
Da-gyo / A bit more covered-up bikini
Hee-young / A bit more covered-up bikini?

788
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,981
Da-gyo / What did you bring?

789
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,226
Da-gyo / Come on!

790
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,252
Hee-young / Me? Bikini, of course

791
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:06,821
Hee-young / Oh! You startled me!

792
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,700
Da-gyo / This is getting interesting
Ri-won / What’s with that nervous look?

793
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:13,694
Da-gyo / Hey!

794
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:15,072
Min-woo / I'm dying to know

795
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,501
Min-woo / I’m really curious what swimsuit Han-kyul

796
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,002
Min-woo / packed for today

797
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,905
Min-woo / I’m seriously most curious what her style would be
Ri-won / I know!

798
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:26,006
Han-kyul / Rash guard

799
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,252
Min-woo / Rash guard

800
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,911
Da-gyo / What about Seo-yeon and Jin-ah?

801
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:35,259
Seo-yeon / Mine’s like a monokini but with long sleeves

802
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:37,661
Da-gyo / And Jin-ah?

803
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,120
Jin-ah / I have one that’s very covered-up

804
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,322
Jin-ah / And one that’s barely hanging on

805
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,324
Ri-won / Let’s go with the barely hanging one

806
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,769
Ri-won / Let’s go with the barely hanging one, come on

807
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,239
Ri-won / Hold on
Mi-rang / My phone

808
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,374
Mi-rang / Let’s read it together

809
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:52,142
“Today is Day 6, the final 1-on-1 date”

810
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:57,181
“Please text the name of the person you want to date right now You’ll get to date in the order texts are received”

811
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,690
Jin-ah / Of course I texted Han-kyul

812
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:10,060
Jin-ah / I felt like we didn’t have enough time to get to know each other

813
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,896
Jin-ah / I didn’t want to leave

814
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,598
Jin-ah / With that sense of regret still lingering

815
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:24,130
Seo-yeon / When I saw the words ‘mandatory 1-on-1 date’

816
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,899
Seo-yeon / I immediately thought, ‘This is it!’

817
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:27,334
Seo-yeon / My fingers moved before I even realized

818
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:29,747
Seo-yeon / I didn’t even read the rest of the message

819
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,583
Seo-yeon / The moment I realized it was a chance

820
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,752
Seo-yeon / I sent Da-gyo’s name

821
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,655
Hee-young / Huh? wher's phone?

822
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,614
Hee-young / I couldn’t find my phone even though I was sure I had it

823
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,515
Hee-young / But then

824
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:45,229
Ri-won / Oh, not this person at this crucial moment.

825
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,988
Ri-won / You're just going to have to go on a date.

826
00:42:47,998 --> 00:42:49,089
Da-gyo / Exactly
Hee-young / Ah here it is

827
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,735
Hee-young / It was under the blanket
Ri-won / You hid it

828
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:52,770
Hee-young / You hid it, didn’t you?

829
00:42:52,803 --> 00:42:54,972
Seo-yeon / Me? I did?
Ri-won / Seo-yeon hid it

830
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,431
Ri-won / They said it’s first come, first served here

831
00:42:57,441 --> 00:43:00,277
Hee-young / Oh come on

832
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:01,879
Ri-won / You dummies

833
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:04,138
Hee-young / They said it’s first come, first served for the date

834
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:07,017
Hee-young / So I felt all rushed

835
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:10,354
Hee-young / But I already knew others would send Da-gyo’s name too

836
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:13,223
Hee-young / So I was already a little heartbroken

837
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:17,194
Hee-young / Then I found my phone late and

838
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,263
Hee-young / Sent Da-gyo’s name anyway

839
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:30,297
Ri-won / I sent it at this speed last time too

840
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:33,177
Ri-won / I saw it and sent it right away

841
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,569
Da-gyo / Ah, you're so consistent

842
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,380
Ri-won / Huh?

843
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,248
Da-gyo / I mean, you're such a consistent person
Hee-young / Totally, totally

844
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,575
Ri-won / You never kno—
Da-gyo / Because she sends it straight away like that

845
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,777
Ri-won / You never know though

846
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,145
Ri-won / She laughed at me

847
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,825
Ri-won / Hee-young laughed at me

848
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,260
Min-woo / Is there a time limit to send the message?

849
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,030
Ri-won / No just send it quickly

850
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:55,132
Min-woo / Why?
Da-gyo / Because it’s first come first served

851
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:56,634
Da-gyo / If multiple people send it to the same person

852
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,736
Da-gyo / The first one gets to go first

853
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,138
Min-woo / But maybe it’s better to go later

854
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,039
Ri-won / Can I do it later?

855
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:04,775
Min-woo / Since you get to go either way

856
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,543
Hee-young / It goes in order

857
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,839
Mi-rang / Oh so everyone gets a turn
Da-gyo / In order

858
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,808
Ri-won / I thought it was going to be another battle.
Da-gyo / I thought so too.

859
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,877
Da-gyo / You and I understood it the same way.

860
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,846
Ri-won / You're really quick too.

861
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,448
Min-woo / Calm down! It’s the last day

862
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,993
Da-gyo / Oh that’s what it meant!
Ri-won / I should’ve sent mine later

863
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,462
Da-gyo / Still can’t quite get the hang of it till the end

864
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,632
Ri-won / I thought it was a competition...

865
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:32,369
Min-woo / The reason I didn’t send the text right away was

866
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:35,706
Min-woo / If Hee-young was going on multiple dates

867
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:38,909
Min-woo / I wanted to be the last one

868
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,712
“Because the last one leaves the biggest impression”

869
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:56,226
Hee-young / I was waiting to talk to you yesterday

870
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,364
Hee-young / But you stayed out overnight

871
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,757
Da-gyo / I didn’t know either When I got there

872
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,035
Da-gyo / I thought we were going home

873
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,737
Da-gyo / I wasn’t thinking like that at all

874
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,072
Hee-young / I thought you packed to stay over

875
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,740
Da-gyo / If I’d known I would’ve packed properly

876
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,308
Da-gyo / I wouldn’t have been nervous

877
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,043
Da-gyo / Well I still would’ve been but anyway

878
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,545
Da-gyo / I got there and suddenly it was like

879
00:45:14,578 --> 00:45:17,347
Da-gyo / Huh? Wait what? And I just went with it

880
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:23,120
Hee-young / Anyway

881
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:24,922
Hee-young / I wanted to go on a date with you

882
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:27,124
Da-gyo / With me?

883
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,894
Hee-young / Last time you

884
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,319
Hee-young / You just came to tell me that

885
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,298
Hee-young / That wasn’t really a date

886
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:37,568
Hee-young / A real date is when both sides are ready

887
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,137
Da-gyo / Right

888
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:44,041
Hee-young / I came to let you know I’m ready

889
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,065
Da-gyo / Really?

890
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,667
Da-gyo / That’s what you were going to say yesterday?

891
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:47,968
Hee-young / Yeah

892
00:45:47,978 --> 00:45:50,581
Hee-young / But you didn’t show up

893
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,788
Hee-young / So yeah, whether it was a single or a double bed actually did matter

894
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:02,993
Da-gyo / I see

895
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,017
Da-gyo / Got it

896
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,796
Da-gyo / Good thing I wore black today...

897
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,490
Da-gyo / I mean, black’s fitting for the mood...

898
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,470
Hee-young / See? I told you to wear black

899
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,907
Hee-young / You okay?

900
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,442
Da-gyo / I’m good

901
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:20,177
Da-gyo / I kind of...

902
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,836
Hee-young / So does that mean everyone gets to have a one-on-one date before the dinner party?

903
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:24,004
Hee-young / One by one?

904
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:25,549
Da-gyo / Yeah something like that

905
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:28,118
Da-gyo / I’m not really sure

906
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,989
Hee-young / But what if too many people picked the same person?

907
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:35,526
Da-gyo / No idea
Hee-young / Would the date time be too short then?

908
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,361
Da-gyo / One day’s way too short

909
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,096
Hee-young / Or maybe you’ll have to choose?

910
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:42,366
Da-gyo / I really don’t know

911
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,268
Da-gyo / But they said it’s by order

912
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,370
Hee-young / Hurry and wrap it up then!

913
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:50,140
Da-gyo / I don’t really know\...

914
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,008
Da-gyo / But they said it’s by order

915
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,277
Da-gyo / So I think the texts will go in order

916
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,280
Hee-young / Yeah maybe that’s how it works

917
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,418
Hee-young / Got it?

918
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:05,189
Da-gyo / I’ll go get changed then
Hee-young / Yeah yeah go get ready

919
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,592
Hee-young / I literally ran over to say this

920
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,228
Hee-young / “Even if you go on dates with others, think of me”

921
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:14,264
Hee-young / Since she probably doesn’t know if she’s dating me or not

922
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,867
Hee-young / She has to know so she’ll wait for me

923
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,670
Hee-young / So that was kind of my...

924
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:22,673
Hee-young / My little strategy

925
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:24,441
Ri-won / What? Are you going on a date?

926
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,979
Ri-won / Are you going on a date? Did you get a message?
Hee-young / No, not yet—later

927
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:32,216
Hee-young / I’ll probably take a while, I sent mine pretty late

928
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:33,907
Hee-young / But Mi-rang sent hers even later than I did

929
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,909
Hee-young / She sent it even later

930
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,821
Ri-won / What’s with your outfit?
Hee-young / Your eyes...

931
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,756
Ri-won / No, I mean...

932
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,059
Hee-young / What, is it okay?

933
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,553
Hee-young / Huh?
Ri-won / I like it

934
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:47,654
Hee-young / You know, last time

935
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:49,656
Hee-young / When Da-gyo was walking around showing skin like crazy

936
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,492
Hee-young / I kept nagging her nonstop

937
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,294
Hee-young / Saying, “Appeal! Appeal!”

938
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,096
Hee-young / So clearly, she likes that kind of thing

939
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,908
Ri-won / Yeah, exactly

940
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:00,968
Hee-young / This is a calculated, tailored look

941
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,447
Ri-won / But, seriously, what’s with you?

942
00:48:05,749 --> 00:48:08,742
Ri-won / Your eyes...
Hee-young / You looked on purpose, didn’t you?

943
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:11,355
Ri-won / It was a knee-jerk reaction!

944
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:13,490
Hee-young / Control your eyeballs

945
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,849
Ri-won / Reflex! Reflex!

946
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:18,862
Hee-young / Look, I’m serious

947
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:22,823
Ri-won / I’m telling you, reflex

948
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:24,768
Ri-won / Seriously!

949
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:30,797
Hee-young / Look, as soon as it opens you look again!

950
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:31,775
Hee-young / Oh my god, this is hilarious!

951
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,978
Da-gyo / You look great

952
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,339
Mi-rang / You’re happy to be going on a date, huh?

953
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:41,318
Da-gyo / Of course

954
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:43,453
Mi-rang / But you didn’t expect this, right?
Da-gyo / Nope

955
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,024
Mi-rang / Are you supposed to spray that much?

956
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:51,495
Da-gyo / I...
Mi-rang / Toss your hair

957
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:57,200
Mi-rang / That good?

958
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:00,537
Mi-rang / I feel like I aged the moment I got here

959
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,605
Da-gyo / Right?

960
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:04,808
Mi-rang / “Right?”
Da-gyo / I mean me! Me not you

961
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,844
Da-gyo / No not you unnie I meant me

962
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,546
Da-gyo / I’m just agreeing

963
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,014
Mi-rang / “Right?”

964
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:20,891
Da-gyo / I meant me, not you I was the one who related

965
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,292
Mi-rang / You related

966
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:24,227
Da-gyo / I didn’t expect it to go this way

967
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,762
Mi-rang / Right

968
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,355
Mi-rang / So is this being done in order?

969
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:31,301
Mi-rang / Like by the order people sent the names?
Da-gyo / Maybe it is?

970
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,903
Da-gyo / I misunderstood it

971
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:36,907
Da-gyo / I thought we had to send it quickly
Mi-rang / I sent mine super fast too

972
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,465
Da-gyo / Really? You said you didn’t have your phone

973
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,166
Da-gyo / You said you didn’t have your phone

974
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:43,804
Mi-rang / I ran, found it, and sent it right away
Da-gyo / Oh wow

975
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,282
Da-gyo / I didn’t know that

976
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,150
Da-gyo / I see

977
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:51,077
Hee-young / I kind of want to go last

978
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:54,791
Seo-yeon / Why would you want to go last?

979
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,761
Hee-young / So she has to wait for my date

980
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,188
Seo-yeon / Foxy girl!

981
00:50:02,198 --> 00:50:04,334
Seo-yeon / Sly foxy

982
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:08,538
Hee-young / That’s why I just went and told her

983
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:11,098
Seo-yeon / Oh foxy

984
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,343
Seo-yeon / So foxy

985
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:20,083
Seo-yeon / The people I think who might’ve texted Da-gyo are

986
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,819
Seo-yeon / Mi-rang, me

987
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:26,790
Seo-yeon / And Hee-young came to mind

988
00:50:27,124 --> 00:50:29,159
Seo-yeon / And I think Da-gyo

989
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,162
Seo-yeon / Probably texted Hee-young

990
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,999
Seo-yeon / Yesterday Hee-young told me

991
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:40,437
Seo-yeon / That Da-gyo confessed she liked her

992
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,439
Seo-yeon / So I already kind of expected it

993
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:45,876
Seo-yeon / I had a good idea of how it would go

994
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:47,978
Seo-yeon / Why am I so nervous?

995
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:51,438
Hee-young / Huh? What?
Seo-yeon / Why am I so nervous?

996
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:53,006
Hee-young / Because it’s a date

997
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:56,053
Hee-young / You’re supposed to get nervous for real dates

998
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,954
Hee-young / It’s because you’re doing this by choice

999
00:50:57,988 --> 00:50:59,856
Hee-young / That’s why you’re nervous

1000
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,527
Hee-young / You’re seeing her face-to-face and expressing yourself for the first time right?

1001
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,063
Hee-young / Of course it’s nerve-racking

1002
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:08,221
Hee-young / But honestly I’m so proud of you

1003
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,191
Seo-yeon / But the thing is

1004
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:13,827
Seo-yeon / When something feels too good and nerve-wracking

1005
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:14,638
Seo-yeon / you kinda want to avoid it

1006
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:16,740
Seo-yeon / So a part of me doesn’t want to go on the date

1007
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:17,663
Hee-young / See? That’s why I keep pushing you like this

1008
00:51:17,673 --> 00:51:21,268
Hee-young / I really don’t want you to run away again

1009
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,413
Hee-young / I mean it

1010
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,248
Hee-young / Even though you’re technically my competition

1011
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:27,607
Hee-young / I’m still laying it all out for you

1012
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:28,475
Seo-yeon / True

1013
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:33,246
Seo-yeon / I’m here to overcome that part of me

1014
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,225
Seo-yeon / But still it’s driving me crazy

1015
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,484
Seo-yeon / Should I just act like a friend like I usually do?

1016
00:51:38,494 --> 00:51:39,496
Hee-young / No you should change it up

1017
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:40,152
Seo-yeon / Oh change it up?

1018
00:51:40,162 --> 00:51:42,399
Hee-young / You need to show a different side of yourself when it’s just the two of you

1019
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,423
Seo-yeon / Ah okay

1020
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:44,724
Hee-young / Like when you’re with everyone else

1021
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,736
Hee-young / I’m different too when it’s a group setting

1022
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,995
Hee-young / You need to show how you act when you like someone

1023
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:53,777
Hee-young / That “this is how I treat the person I like”

1024
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,978
Hee-young / This is your chance to show that

1025
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,313
Hee-young / Even to yourself

1026
00:51:57,047 --> 00:52:00,217
Seo-yeon / I’m so nervous my body feels itchy

1027
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,320
Hee-young / Want a massage?
Seo-yeon / No thanks

1028
00:52:03,353 --> 00:52:07,290
Hee-young / Rather than making a decision without knowing anything

1029
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:09,816
Hee-young / It’s good to talk with everyone you’re interested in

1030
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:12,662
Hee-young / And then follow your heart to the person you’re really drawn to

1031
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,866
Hee-young / I think that’s the best way to choose someone

1032
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:19,459
Hee-young / That’s why I’m treating Da-gyo

1033
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,128
Hee-young / With all the sincerity I can give right now

1034
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:23,874
Hee-young / I hope everyone does the same

1035
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:26,643
Hee-young / But today I’m actually a bit excited

1036
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,368
Seo-yeon / Excited?

1037
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:31,181
Hee-young / I waited for this too
Seo-yeon / Oh yeah that’s right

1038
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:34,384
Hee-young / I should go on a date today too

1039
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:37,754
Hee-young / That way I can really know how I feel

1040
00:52:40,857 --> 00:52:43,293
Hee-young / I need to do everything I can This is a war

1041
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:45,495
Hee-young / Mi-rang will go too right?

1042
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,364
Hee-young / She’ll probably give it her all too

1043
00:52:47,397 --> 00:52:50,757
Hee-young / We can’t ignore everything she’s shown so far

1044
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,602
Seo-yeon / What do you think Mi-rang’s doing right now?

1045
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:55,772
Seo-yeon / She must be super nervous... or like

1046
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:57,040
Seo-yeon / Low-key panicking

1047
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,901
Hee-young / I bet Da-gyo won’t say anything

1048
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,736
Hee-young / But I already got found out
Seo-yeon / She might say something though

1049
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,304
Hee-young / I was just super obvious about it

1050
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,918
Seo-yeon / But Mi-rang already knows how I feel too

1051
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,693
Hee-young / Nervous?
Seo-yeon / Nervous

1052
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,528
Seo-yeon / I admit it I’m nervous!

1053
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:19,829
Seo-yeon / I’m so nervous

1054
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,332
Seo-yeon / What do we do

1055
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,927
Ri-won / Did you send the message right away?

1056
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,595
Ri-won / Or did you think about it first?

1057
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,130
Han-kyul / I thought about it a bit

1058
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,365
Ri-won / Isn’t it a condition-based date today?

1059
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,134
Han-kyul / But if that’s the case

1060
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:35,635
Han-kyul / What happens if there’s overlap?

1061
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,147
Han-kyul / They said it goes in order

1062
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,805
Ri-won / Yeah, like one person goes first, and then

1063
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,784
Ri-won / the next person goes after, and so on

1064
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,842
Han-kyul / Really?

1065
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,844
Ri-won / We kept talking about that earlier, remember?

1066
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:47,047
Ri-won / That’s why I said, “Ah, I should’ve sent it later”

1067
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,359
Han-kyul / Then I guess it’s fine

1068
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,292
Ri-won / Oh... application complete

1069
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,928
Han-kyul / Whether I complete it or not

1070
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:04,264
Ri-won / Wait, why?

1071
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,266
Han-kyul / I’m in a petty mood now

1072
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:09,869
Ri-won / Why are you in a petty mood again after yesterday?

1073
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:12,138
Ri-won / You were feeling good

1074
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,340
Ri-won / Now you’re hurt

1075
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,841
Ri-won / and want to hide in your cave, huh?

1076
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,910
Han-kyul / Yeah, that’s right

1077
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,823
Ri-won / I know you so well, Han-kyul
Han-kyul / Yeah

1078
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:23,016
Han-kyul / I’m completely figured out now

1079
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:24,217
Ri-won / Good

1080
00:54:24,227 --> 00:54:26,820
Han-kyul / But what if one person gets like five messages?

1081
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,455
Ri-won / Then she’s gotta go through them in order

1082
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,390
Han-kyul / That person

1083
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,135
Han-kyul / is gonna have a rough day

1084
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,708
Da-gyo / I’m heading out!

1085
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,377
Mi-rang / Have fun
Jin-ah / Good luck

1086
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,703
Jin-ah / Oh they’re actually going one by one

1087
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,582
Jin-ah / That’s really...

1088
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,317
Mi-rang / She’s going first so

1089
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:50,253
Mi-rang / Maybe that means Da-gyo got the most texts

1090
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:54,958
Jin-ah / Cute! She’s putting in effort!

1091
00:54:56,092 --> 00:55:00,497
Min-woo / Is Da-gyo going on three dates today or what?

1092
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:08,228
Mi-rang / Anyway, Da-gyo was the first one to head out

1093
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,130
Mi-rang / And being first means

1094
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,999
Mi-rang / She probably got the most votes

1095
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,245
Mi-rang / Whether I was first or second

1096
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:17,881
Mi-rang / I knew I’d be going on a date with her no matter what

1097
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:20,016
Mi-rang / When we went on that date

1098
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:23,086
Mi-rang / I truly believed

1099
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,455
Mi-rang / That Da-gyo enjoyed our date more

1100
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:31,494
Ri-won / Are you two going together?

1101
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,455
Hee-young / No way...

1102
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:37,757
Ri-won / I mean, it could happen
Hee-young / Yeah, maybe it could

1103
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:40,260
Ri-won / You never know, it’s the last day
Hee-young / Yeah, maybe it could

1104
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,395
Hee-young / Don’t do that, don’t start with me

1105
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:43,997
Ri-won / I don’t even care though

1106
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:47,200
Ri-won / It’s funny you’re telling me not to say anything
Hee-young / I mean it, don’t start

1107
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,035
Hee-young / I know, I know

1108
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:50,647
Hee-young / I’m heading out

1109
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:57,477
Seo-yeon / But it’s not one couple at a time

1110
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:01,291
Seo-yeon / So I don’t think it’s just the two of them

1111
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:18,164
Ri-won / Oh! Is Mi-rang sleeping?

1112
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,176
Ri-won / Did you hear the news?
Mi-rang / What?

1113
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:23,803
Mi-rang / Huh? What news?

1114
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:27,006
Ri-won / Someone’s waiting to go on a date with you right now

1115
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,441
Mi-rang / Who?
Ri-won / You

1116
00:56:28,451 --> 00:56:31,287
Mi-rang / Oh, is that why you came?

1117
00:56:31,621 --> 00:56:33,613
Ri-won / I heard Hee-young declared war?

1118
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:35,081
Mi-rang / What are you talking about?

1119
00:56:35,091 --> 00:56:38,518
Ri-won / You know, the... the application thing

1120
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:39,452
Mi-rang / Oh really?

1121
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,187
Ri-won / She didn’t?
Mi-rang / I didn’t hear about that

1122
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:43,123
Ri-won / Weren’t you aware of it?

1123
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:44,290
Ri-won / Wait, but you knew, didn’t you?

1124
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,026
Ri-won / That Da-gyo was interested in Hee-young
Mi-rang / Yeah, I knew

1125
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:49,205
Ri-won / That’s why you wrote the rival card for Hee-young, right?

1126
00:56:49,506 --> 00:56:51,808
Mi-rang / Yeah
Ri-won / Exactly

1127
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:52,909
Mi-rang / Go on, then!

1128
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:01,351
Mi-rang / When it was just the two of us two days ago

1129
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:02,808
Mi-rang / Da-gyo and I had a heartfelt talk

1130
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:04,421
Mi-rang / And at that time

1131
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,257
Mi-rang / I told her not to go on a date with Hee-young

1132
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,025
Mi-rang / So I trusted Da-gyo

1133
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:12,662
Mi-rang / I was absolutely sure she would choose me
