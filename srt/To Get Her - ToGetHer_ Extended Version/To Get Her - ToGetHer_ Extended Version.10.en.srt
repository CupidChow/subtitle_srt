1
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,233
Da-gyo / Fortune favors the brave…

2
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:11,868
Mi-rang / Then from the front

3
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,814
Mi-rang / To the right...

4
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,441
Mi-rang / I'm seriously too scared to do this

5
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,011
Ri-won / When Da-gyo did this to me from the side

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,445
Ri-won / I ended up reacting even more

7
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,215
Da-gyo / I just meant like, ‘Let the brave one go first’

8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,249
Da-gyo / That’s all I was saying

9
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,284
Min-woo / The cutest person gets to pick first

10
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,219
Hee-young / The cutest?

11
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,231
Min-woo / Let’s go with the cutest picking first

12
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,801
Da-gyo / So… you mean yourself?

13
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:37,660
Jin-ah / Your butt is...

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,073
Jin-ah / Your butt is right in my face, isn’t it?

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,599
Ri-won / That’s intentional

16
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:43,533
Ri-won / Flirting! Flirting!

17
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,402
Jin-ah / Your butt was right in front of my eyes

18
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,670
Min-woo / Okay, here’s my question:

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,386
Min-woo / What was the most heartbreaking love in your life?

20
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,856
Min-woo / For me, it was my first love—my longest relationship

21
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,928
Min-woo / That was my most painful

22
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,365
Mi-rang / Why did it hurt?

23
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,491
Min-woo / Because I loved them the most

24
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,360
Hee-young / How long were you together?

25
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,262
Min-woo / Three years

26
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,164
Hee-young / That was your longest relationship?

27
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,008
Min-woo / Yeah

28
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,968
Min-woo / Alright, next cutest person, your turn

29
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,448
Min-woo / I’ll pick

30
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,421
Mi-rang / Ugh~ You caught a cold

31
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,825
Ri-won / I didn’t expect Hee-young to go for it

32
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,350
Ri-won / I think I caught a bug

33
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,596
Ri-won / The cuteness bug

34
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,667
Older by 10 years VS Younger by 10 years

35
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,830
Hee-young / Age doesn’t matter to me, so both are the same

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,764
Min-woo / But if you had to pick?

37
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,265
Da-gyo / If you had to choose one?

38
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:56,106
Hee-young / I guess older, because they’re more likely...

39
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,541
Hee-young / To be wise...

40
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,845
Hee-young / So I’ll go with older

41
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,380
Ri-won / Who’s the third cutest here?

42
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,658
Mi-rang / Me, obviously!

43
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:10,396
Ri-won / I knew you’d say that

44
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:20,730
Forgive a cheating partner VS Cheat and be forgiven

45
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,899
Mi-rang / I think I’d rather forgive a cheating partner

46
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,400
Mi-rang / That seems slightly better

47
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,204
Mi-rang / Cheating and then being forgiven...

48
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,406
Mi-rang / I’d be too guilty to stay with them
Mi-rang / I don’t think I could date that person because of the guilt

49
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,751
Mi-rang / I don’t think I could be in a relationship with them

50
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:35,211
Mi-rang / ‘Forgiving a partner who cheated on me’

51
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,813
Mi-rang / would be really hard for me too

52
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,815
Mi-rang / but even after thinking about it a lot

53
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,283
Mi-rang / I still like that person more

54
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,484
Mi-rang / and since it’s my own decision

55
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,130
Mi-rang / I don’t think I’d regret it

56
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,688
Ri-won / I feel the same

57
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,100
Ri-won / Everything feels the same

58
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,325
Ri-won / It’s exactly the same for me

59
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,529
Ri-won / I don’t want to leave a stain on my life

60
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:55,441
Ri-won / I don’t want to be someone who cheated

61
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,545
Ri-won / I want to be proud of myself

62
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,548
Han-kyul / I don’t care if my partner cheats

63
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,142
Ri-won / Do you enjoy self-torture?

64
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,343
Mi-rang / Why? Why?

65
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,312
Han-kyul / If I like someone

66
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,113
Han-kyul / I just think

67
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,358
Han-kyul / it’s already a gift that they’re willing to see me

68
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,517
Da-gyo / That’s how devoted you are...

69
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,885
Han-kyul / I want to leave

70
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,188
Han-kyul / all the choices to that person

71
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:21,324
Han-kyul / So I don’t care if they come after dating someone else

72
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,126
Han-kyul / Or even if they leave

73
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,628
Han-kyul / after dating someone else, it doesn’t matter

74
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,997
Han-kyul / That’s just how I feel

75
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,834
Jin-ah / Han-kyul’s answers are always so unexpected

76
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:35,004
Jin-ah / and I can never quite grasp what she means

77
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,708
Jin-ah / It’s like there’s a galaxy hidden in her words

78
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,744
Jin-ah / that makes me wonder ‘What does that mean?’

79
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:42,745
Jin-ah / ‘Huh? What is she saying?’

80
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,715
Jin-ah / ‘What kind of feelings led her to say that?’

81
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,352
Jin-ah / So I find it fascinating

82
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,798
Mi-rang / Next, someone cute?

83
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,057
Ri-won / The fourth cutest person

84
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,401
Da-gyo / Me!

85
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,761
Mi-rang / She flinched shyly
Hee-young / But it was cute

86
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,764
Da-gyo / I’m scared of picking

87
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:02,575
Da-gyo / Okay

88
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,281
Q. When did you realize your sexual identity and how did you feel?

89
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:12,909
Da-gyo / I went to all-girls middle and high schools

90
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,278
Da-gyo / Not that it really matters, but

91
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:18,948
Da-gyo / there were friends like that around me

92
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,584
Da-gyo / and even from a young age, my parents

93
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,188
Da-gyo / never told me that it was wrong or anything

94
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,824
Da-gyo / I didn’t grow up hearing that

95
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:31,761
Da-gyo / Then in high school, a friend confessed to me

96
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,364
Da-gyo / and I had my first relationship—with her

97
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,865
Da-gyo / So at that moment

98
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,901
Da-gyo / I realized, ‘Oh, I can date women too’

99
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,446
Da-gyo / I think that was the first time I knew

100
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,117
Da-gyo / Having that first relationship…

101
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,975
Da-gyo / What about the rest of you?

102
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,543
Da-gyo / I was really curious about this

103
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,912
Da-gyo / I’ll call on someone I’m curious about

104
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,325
Da-gyo / Who should I ask?

105
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,751
Da-gyo / I’m curious about everyone

106
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,186
Da-gyo / Can’t someone just volunteer?

107
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,056
Hee-young / I’ll share mine

108
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,802
Da-gyo / That’s so cool okay

109
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,897
Hee-young / I had no awareness at all…

110
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,232
Hee-young / I didn’t have prejudice

111
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,668
Hee-young / but I never really thought about myself

112
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,303
Hee-young / Then in high school

113
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,239
Hee-young / I dated a girl for the first time

114
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,641
Hee-young / and I realized I could date women too

115
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,277
Hee-young / Before that, I had a few short flings with guys

116
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,712
Hee-young / dated a bit

117
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:25,281
Hee-young / and I thought there was something wrong with me

118
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,217
Hee-young / When my friends watched dramas

119
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,997
Hee-young / they fell in love and dated so naturally

120
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,723
Hee-young / everyone seemed to date just fine

121
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,325
Hee-young / but I’d think ‘Why can’t I?’

122
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,160
Hee-young / ‘Why do I always end up breaking up

123
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,995
Hee-young / and not feel any of those emotions?’

124
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,064
Hee-young / ‘This must be my problem!’

125
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,899
Hee-young / But when I dated a girl

126
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,767
Hee-young / I was like ‘Huh? I’m actually good at this!’

127
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:49,105
Hee-young / ‘I miss her and everything’—that’s when I realized

128
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,017
Da-gyo / Anyone else want to share?

129
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,977
Mi-rang / I...
Da-gyo / Still can’t let go

130
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,081
Mi-rang / I liked girls ever since I was young

131
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:58,781
Hee-young / How young?

132
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,983
Mi-rang / I think since I was about six years old

133
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,086
Da-gyo / That kind of thing is so fascinating to me

134
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,722
Ri-won / That young and already aware of attraction?
Mi-rang / Huh?

135
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,591
Ri-won / She was already into someone at six

136
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,371
Ri-won / At that age, I was busy eating dirt

137
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,795
Mi-rang / Even when there were boys and girls

138
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:15,141
Mi-rang / I always wanted to take care of the girls

139
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,633
Mi-rang / You know how kids tease each other

140
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,002
Mi-rang / I used to do that too with girls

141
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,504
Mi-rang / Then in middle and high school

142
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,082
Mi-rang / I liked boys and girls at the same time

143
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,709
Mi-rang / Then until around 22 or 23

144
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,811
Mi-rang / I kept dating guys

145
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,346
Mi-rang / because I wanted to deny it

146
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:34,317
Mi-rang / that I liked girls…

147
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,586
Mi-rang / I thought, ‘Maybe it’s because I’ve never been intimate with a guy?’

148
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,354
Mi-rang / I thought about it a lot

149
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:42,769
Mi-rang / Then there was this guy I liked

150
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,695
Mi-rang / but every time he kept contacting me

151
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:46,729
Mi-rang / I hated it so much

152
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,530
Mi-rang / I liked him but hated it

153
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,364
Mi-rang / I liked him but hated it
Da-gyo / You liked him but hated it?

154
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:49,609
Mi-rang / Every morning, I hated it

155
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,068
Mi-rang / When he texted ‘Did you sleep well?’

156
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,002
Mi-rang / I hated it!

157
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,837
Jin-ah / It sets the mood for your whole day...

158
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,439
Mi-rang / I felt like I had to go along with it

159
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,275
Mi-rang / and that feeling kept building up

160
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,511
Mi-rang / I kept feeling that way and then

161
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,846
Mi-rang / a woman confessed to me

162
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,458
Mi-rang / and we started seeing each other

163
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,094
Mi-rang / I felt great, I was really happy

164
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,086
Mi-rang / So

165
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,587
Mi-rang / since then, I think I've only dated women

166
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,656
Mi-rang / all the way through

167
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,834
Ri-won / She found her own happiness

168
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:31,250
A partner who doesn’t match you in anything but looks VS one who matches perfectly in everything but looks

169
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,213
Da-gyo / That’s so hard

170
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,559
Mi-rang / So basically, are you a looks-first person or not

171
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,485
Jin-ah / If everything matches well

172
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:44,330
Jin-ah / I think they’d look pretty to me

173
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,799
Jin-ah / Really pretty

174
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,359
Jin-ah / I have two cats

175
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:55,198
Jin-ah / I picked up the younger one off the street

176
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,242
Jin-ah / and honestly, it was so ugly

177
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,135
Ri-won / All cats are cute though~

178
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,069
Jin-ah / But at some point

179
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,637
Jin-ah / my cat started looking so uniquely

180
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,872
Jin-ah / beautiful to me

181
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,440
Jin-ah / Through loving my cat

182
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,441
Jin-ah / I learned to love myself too

183
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:08,254
Jin-ah / Because even my unattractive sides are still me! So for my partner too

184
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,379
Jin-ah / I don’t think looks matter that much

185
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,981
Jin-ah / Though I do look at bodies a lot

186
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,659
Jin-ah / Let’s just say looks means the face for now

187
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:16,486
Jin-ah / That’s my answer

188
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,431
Han-kyul / I’ll choose the first one

189
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,155
Da-gyo / What’s the first one?

190
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,990
Mi-rang / A partner who doesn’t match you in anything but looks

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,326
Han-kyul / If someone matches me in everything but looks

192
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,972
Han-kyul / I think it’s enough to keep them as a friend...

193
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,765
Han-kyul / For now, I still feel that for a relationship

194
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,134
Han-kyul / there needs to be that physical kind of fluttering

195
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,004
Han-kyul / for me to really define it as love

196
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:39,619
Han-kyul / That’s the phase I’m at

197
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,645
Jin-ah / I’m swaying again

198
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,222
Jin-ah / Sway~

199
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:46,849
Ri-won / You’re getting convinced again

200
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,519
Han-kyul / The second option is so vague

201
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,088
Han-kyul / If that dopamine doesn’t kick in

202
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,589
Han-kyul / it’s even harder with same-sex relationships

203
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,292
Han-kyul / Like, ‘Are we best friends?’ ‘Is this friendship?’

204
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,794
Han-kyul / ‘Or are these romantic feelings?’

205
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,329
Han-kyul / For me, it’s really ambiguous

206
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,633
Han-kyul / So I strongly lean toward the first one

207
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,235
Jin-ah / I’m the complete opposite, for friends

208
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,204
Jin-ah / if just one core thing matches...

209
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,439
Jin-ah / We’re not gonna see each other every day anyway

210
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,408
Jin-ah / so even if nothing else matches

211
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,477
Jin-ah / when I need that one connection, that friend is enough

212
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:15,978
Jin-ah / But to me, a partner

213
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,680
Jin-ah / is sometimes my best friend

214
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,981
Jin-ah / sometimes my protector

215
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,283
Jin-ah / and sometimes like my baby

216
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:22,351
Jin-ah / So every piece matters a lot

217
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,719
Jin-ah / when it comes to my partner

218
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,924
Jin-ah / That’s why all those aspects need to align

219
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:29,402
Jin-ah / for me to truly love someone

220
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,527
Jin-ah / So it’s fascinating

221
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,406
Jin-ah / But your point is valid too sway~

222
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,399
Da-gyo / Seriously

223
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,435
Min-woo / So if they’re not your type physically

224
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,538
Min-woo / then there’s just zero chance at all?

225
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,339
Min-woo / For you, Han-kyul?

226
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:47,286
Han-kyul / I think that’s how it is when it comes to guys

227
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,046
Jin-ah / The excitement in your heart?

228
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,891
Da-gyo / Really? That much?

229
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,717
Da-gyo / That’s so interesting...

230
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,296
Hee-young / A silly question, wise answer!

231
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:01,724
Min-woo / I was just curious

232
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,659
Jin-ah / I think anyone would be curious

233
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,394
Mi-rang / Who hasn’t been picked yet?

234
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,729
Ri-won / You were going to pick Seo-yeon

235
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,208
Da-gyo / Careful, careful, it's shaking

236
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,213
Q. Which do you prefer—living together or marriage?

237
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,983
Seo-yeon / I prefer living together

238
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,076
Jin-ah / Why?

239
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,311
Seo-yeon / Marriage...

240
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:24,590
Seo-yeon / I’m someone who doesn’t plan to marry

241
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,116
Seo-yeon / But

242
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,918
Seo-yeon / you never know what’ll happen in life

243
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,229
Seo-yeon / That sounded too final

244
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,189
Jin-ah / Adding that makes it fine

245
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,867
Jin-ah / Yeah, saying that softens it

246
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,571
Mi-rang / Then please pick the next person you’re curious about

247
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,796
Seo-yeon / Da-gyo!

248
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,098
Da-gyo / Me?

249
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:45,234
Da-gyo / But in Korea, marriage isn’t legally recognized yet

250
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,235
Da-gyo / for us

251
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,871
Jin-ah / But you can still have a symbolic ceremony

252
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:50,573
Da-gyo / I mean, I think there needs to be

253
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:53,019
Da-gyo / some legal framework for it...

254
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,177
Da-gyo / Or at least that’s how I feel

255
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,680
Da-gyo / Like when getting a place together, you need newlywed loans

256
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,825
Da-gyo / Those legal things, you know

257
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:01,717
Hee-young / Like becoming each other’s legal guardian

258
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,720
Da-gyo / Yeah, I think things like that

259
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,165
Da-gyo / should be possible

260
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,157
Da-gyo / But they’re not right now

261
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,159
Da-gyo / But I still want to have a wedding

262
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,695
Jin-ah / I totally get that feeling

263
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,231
Da-gyo / Living together is basically marriage, right?

264
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,099
Jin-ah / Then that’s marriage

265
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:17,700
Da-gyo / Fine, I’ll go with marriage

266
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,436
Mi-rang / If marriage gets legalized, would you marry?

267
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,804
Da-gyo / Of course

268
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,617
Da-gyo / I want to get married

269
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,187
Mi-rang / I hope it gets legalized

270
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,590
Da-gyo / Next is Han-kyul!

271
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,297
Da-gyo / Well done

272
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:42,735
Partner searching their ex on Instagram vs searching 100 bikini pics

273
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,960
Ri-won / It's like finding out my girlfriend looked up her ex on Instagram

274
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,495
Ri-won / and I caught her doing it

275
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,397
Ri-won / versus her going wild

276
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,866
Ri-won / and searching 100 girls in bikinis

277
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,668
Hee-young / Why do you have to say “going wild”?

278
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,236
Ri-won / I mean, 100 is wild

279
00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,638
Ri-won / I could understand like 10

280
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,973
Ri-won / But 100 is just...

281
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:03,179
Han-kyul / If they're dating me, of course I’d hate the second one more

282
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,648
Han-kyul / Because if you're gonna look up 100 girls in bikinis

283
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,049
Han-kyul / I’d rather you just ask me

284
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,828
Han-kyul / to wear one for you

285
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,153
Han-kyul / But the first one doesn’t bother me at all

286
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,222
Han-kyul / People can randomly think of their ex

287
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,034
Ri-won / You've got a big heart

288
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:16,502
Da-gyo / That’s a tough one

289
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,697
Mi-rang / Someone else curious?

290
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,532
Mi-rang / Me?

291
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,366
Ri-won / Which one’s worse?

292
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:29,215
Mi-rang / I think I’d hate the ex search more

293
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,307
Hee-young / Why?

294
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,651
Mi-rang / I just hate the thought of it

295
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,811
Hee-young / She really hates it

296
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:36,879
Hee-young / Like really hates it
Da-gyo / That was genuine

297
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,380
Mi-rang / If you're over it, be over it

298
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,016
Mi-rang / If you’re searching, it feels like you still

299
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,218
Mi-rang / want to see them or something

300
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,486
Mi-rang / Just being curious about how they're doing

301
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,096
Mi-rang / I hate that

302
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:47,299
Ri-won / That was trigger button

303
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,491
Hee-young / But with bikinis

304
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,559
Hee-young / maybe it just means they want someone new

305
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:54,130
Mi-rang / I mean they watch porn too, so why not that?

306
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,564
Min-woo / Bikini girls are

307
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,167
Min-woo / way less likely to meet my girlfriend

308
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:02,171
Min-woo / But with an ex, there’s a deeper connection

309
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,316
Min-woo / So I think I hate the first one more too

310
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,174
Da-gyo / That’s true

311
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,509
Hee-young / Honestly, I hate the first one too

312
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,620
Ri-won / I hate the latter one more

313
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,914
Han-kyul / For me, the first one means nothing

314
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,983
Ri-won / I can understand the first one
Han-kyul / Even if someone dates their ex while dating me

315
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,218
Han-kyul / I don’t care

316
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,988
Da-gyo / What? Seriously!

317
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:19,989
Da-gyo / Why though?

318
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,759
Ri-won / Someone take care of her
Han-kyul / As long as I’m honest, that’s all I need!

319
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,662
Hee-young / Honest about what! Are you polyamorous?
Da-gyo / Wait, why? Why?

320
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:27,663
Mi-rang / If that’s what Han-kyul wants

321
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,498
Mi-rang / If that’s what she wants
Han-kyul / I only date people who truly

322
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,301
Han-kyul / feel like ‘I have to be with you’

323
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,537
Han-kyul / ‘I really love you’—only then I date

324
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,738
Han-kyul / So I just think

325
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,740
Han-kyul / they’re choosing to be with me

326
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,707
Han-kyul / I prefer when

327
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:41,076
Han-kyul / the other person has all the decision-making power

328
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,812
Han-kyul / I don’t like to control anything

329
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,948
Min-woo / But that’s how you feel comfortable, right?

330
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,483
Min-woo / That kind of relationship

331
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,653
Min-woo / You’ve been clear about preferring that

332
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,720
Min-woo / That’s why we keep getting surprised

333
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,523
Min-woo / But you’ve been saying the same thing over and over

334
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:58,060
Han-kyul / Yeah, I just like giving them all the control

335
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,273
Hee-young / So that’s like your self-description and appeal

336
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,210
Han-kyul / You could call it that, and I wouldn’t disagree

337
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:08,103
Min-woo / At first I was like, ‘Huh?’ hearing your answer

338
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:11,540
Min-woo / but I think maybe it's just your way of expressing things

339
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,844
Min-woo / and maybe it’s actually really pure

340
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,179
Min-woo / It’s not like you’re saying, ‘Go cheat on me’

341
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:21,917
Min-woo / Since I can interpret it positively, I think

342
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,787
Min-woo / I do find Han-kyul kind of charming

343
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,156
Ri-won / Let’s go back to the cute one

344
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,892
Ri-won / Back to the cute one again

345
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,193
Ri-won / What’s up with that mouth?

346
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,896
Ri-won / Did someone punch that mouth?

347
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:35,207
Ri-won / It’s sunken in

348
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:44,350
A partner who says ‘I love you’ all the time VS a partner who keeps asking to be told ‘I love you’

349
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,685
Min-woo / If I had to choose between the two

350
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,511
Min-woo / I’d rather have someone who always says ‘I love you’

351
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,322
Min-woo / That’s easier for me

352
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,749
Min-woo / Like... that’s their choice

353
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,718
Min-woo / I want to say it when I really feel it

354
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,153
Min-woo / when I truly feel love

355
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,156
Min-woo / I don’t want to say it because they expect it

356
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:04,493
Min-woo / I don’t like ‘I love you’ that comes from obligation

357
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,028
Min-woo / So I don’t expect it either

358
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,863
Min-woo / I give without expecting in return

359
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:09,598
Hee-young / That was beautifully said

360
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,333
Mi-rang / So well said

361
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,036
Min-woo / What about you, Han-kyul?

362
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:16,715
Han-kyul / I like both

363
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:24,156
Han-kyul / But if I had to choose

364
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,794
Han-kyul / I’d prefer someone who says ‘I love you’

365
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,120
Han-kyul / That’s better for me

366
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,456
Han-kyul / Asking to hear it feels like they don’t trust me

367
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,592
Ri-won / True, that's true

368
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,569
Ri-won / So deep

369
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,796
Han-kyul / It feels like they’re doubting me or something

370
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,600
Han-kyul / Like I’d start reflecting on myself because of it

371
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,481
Min-woo / What about you, Seo-yeon...?

372
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,175
Min-woo / I was just really curious

373
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,377
Seo-yeon / I prefer someone who asks to be loved...

374
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,145
Mi-rang / You like that more?

375
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:56,712
Seo-yeon / Yes

376
00:15:56,722 --> 00:16:00,416
Seo-yeon / I like someone who wants to receive my love

377
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,161
Seo-yeon / someone who desires it

378
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,956
Mi-rang / Here's how I think of it

379
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,592
Mi-rang / If someone says “I love you” too much

380
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,995
Mi-rang / then one day when they stop saying it

381
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,096
Mi-rang / I’ll start thinking

382
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,065
Mi-rang / “Why don’t they say it anymore?”

383
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,466
Mi-rang / It just messes with my head

384
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,935
Mi-rang / And when I hear ‘I love you’ once in a while

385
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,347
Mi-rang / it makes my heart flutter more

386
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,582
Hee-young / That’s such a real preference

387
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,441
Ri-won / Words have their limits

388
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,177
Ri-won / And I think the strongest one is “I love you”

389
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,412
Ri-won / But if I say it too often

390
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,215
Ri-won / It feels like my love...

391
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,184
Ri-won / Like, unless I could die for her

392
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,353
Ri-won / without even thinking twice

393
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,089
Ri-won / I don’t say “I love you”

394
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,225
Mi-rang / When someone says “Love me,” to me it feels like

395
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,494
Mi-rang / they’re asking me to put in more effort

396
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,528
Mi-rang / Like they're saying

397
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,897
Mi-rang / I’m lacking in something, in a roundabout way

398
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,666
Mi-rang / So I have a reason to try harder

399
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,312
Mi-rang / And I actually like that more

400
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,640
Hee-young / Ah, this is so nice

401
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,209
Ri-won / What is?

402
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,877
Hee-young / I want to gather again and do this all over

403
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,822
Ri-won / Huh? Something just came in

404
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,750
Now, one by one, reveal <Your Secret>

405
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,552
In the order of whose secret you're most curious about

406
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:11,397
Secret

407
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,008
Jin-ah / I was really excited

408
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,444
Jin-ah / because I was curious about others’ secrets too

409
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,780
Jin-ah / and we probably all thought

410
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,415
Jin-ah / it would have some kind of impact

411
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:43,419
Jin-ah / I was curious what kind of impact that would be for me

412
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,430
Jin-ah / how it would affect me

413
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,221
Mi-rang / Didn’t you say your age is the secret?

414
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,766
Ri-won / Yeah, my age is the secret

415
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,191
Mi-rang / I’m still curious, even now...

416
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:49,958
Jin-ah / I’m genuinely curious how old you two are

417
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,304
Jin-ah / I really am curious about your age
Mi-rang / Even though we’ve spent a few days together

418
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,707
Ri-won / Then should I go, and then Han-kyul?

419
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,968
Han-kyul / No, I want to go first!
Ri-won / Sure, you go first

420
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:03,305
Jin-ah / Now You can finally say it!
Ri-won / Han-kyul goes first

421
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:07,709
Ri-won / Isn’t that the bravest move?
Han-kyul / I was seriously so frustrated

422
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,755
Han-kyul / So for me, actually...

423
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,651
Ri-won / At most, she’s in her early 20s

424
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:19,188
Jin-ah / We were all assuming you were the youngest

425
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,357
Jin-ah / So we were wondering, “Just how young is she?”

426
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,502
Jin-ah / That’s what we were curious about

427
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,939
Han-kyul / I just turned 20

428
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,633
Jin-ah / Then what year were you born?

429
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,645
Han-kyul / Born in 2006!

430
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:37,973
Min-woo / That moment when everything makes sense

431
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,251
Hee-young / Suddenly it all adds up

432
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:44,446
Ri-won / I was shocked because someone born in 2006 felt way too young

433
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,282
Min-woo / I guessed maybe early 20s at most

434
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,319
Min-woo / But I didn’t expect 20 exactly

435
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,922
Han-kyul / Honestly, if I had known the other cast members’ ages

436
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,990
Han-kyul / beforehand

437
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,459
Han-kyul / I probably wouldn’t have kept it a secret

438
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,396
Han-kyul / So honestly, I really regretted it a lot

439
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,364
Han-kyul / After coming here

440
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,700
Han-kyul / I think I was the one who regretted it the most

441
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,534
Han-kyul / It was so frustrating

442
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:07,436
Jin-ah / That must’ve been so uncomfortable for you

443
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:10,806
Han-kyul / I kept thinking, if I wait until the last day to reveal it...

444
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,474
Han-kyul / “Wouldn’t that be even more stressful?”

445
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,977
Han-kyul / That’s what I kept thinking

446
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,624
Han-kyul / So I feel really relieved to say it now

447
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,251
Ri-won / It must’ve been so hard for you

448
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,253
Han-kyul / Now that I’ve said it

449
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,888
Han-kyul / I have nothing left to be afraid of

450
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,457
Han-kyul / Now I can fully own being the youngest, the baby

451
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,894
Han-kyul / and I feel like I can be more comfortable

452
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:35,197
Han-kyul / So honestly, I feel relieved

453
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,699
Han-kyul / I don’t care what people thought about it

454
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,169
Ri-won / But seriously, that took so much courage, didn’t it?

455
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:40,802
Da-gyo / Seriously

456
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,272
Min-woo / I would've just run away secretly

457
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,573
Min-woo / Secretly disappeared

458
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,507
Ri-won / I would’ve cried with a bottle in my hand

459
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,877
Han-kyul / But honestly, I don’t even think it was brave

460
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:53,882
Han-kyul / I just hope that coming out in this country

461
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,318
Han-kyul / won’t come with any risk

462
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,686
Han-kyul / That’s what I believe

463
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,555
Ri-won / For Han-kyul, this is just the beginning

464
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,056
Ri-won / Starting from the moment she came on here

465
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,458
Hee-young / Aww, our baby is so admirable

466
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,638
Ri-won / So admirable

467
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,675
Ri-won / So cool, seriously

468
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,401
Ri-won / At such a young age

469
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,303
Ri-won / To come out and decide to be on the show

470
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,604
Ri-won / I was really proud of her

471
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,015
Ri-won / And I wanted to cheer her on

472
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:21,109
Min-woo / Your intention was so kind, I was really moved

473
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,578
Min-woo / If I were 20

474
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,113
Min-woo / I don’t think I could’ve thought that way

475
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,759
Min-woo / If I ever get the chance to meet someone like you

476
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:32,864
Min-woo / I’d want to lead them gently and kindly

477
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,858
Jin-ah / You were so young, but that

478
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,928
Jin-ah / actually came across as maturity

479
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,663
Jin-ah / At 20 years old

480
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,600
Jin-ah / you handled this so well, so sincerely

481
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,168
Jin-ah / and thought so deeply

482
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,570
Jin-ah / You could’ve been overwhelmed with confusion

483
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,773
Jin-ah / But that maturity

484
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:55,010
Jin-ah / was honestly so charming in the house

485
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,457
Han-kyul / Thank you

486
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:10,058
Ri-won / Haha, that look in your eyes... well, for me

487
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,928
Ri-won / I was debating whether to keep something secret

488
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:17,566
Ri-won / But rather than my age, I wanted to be judged as myself

489
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,302
Ri-won / I really wanted to be seen just as me

490
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,838
Ri-won / I felt like once people knew my age

491
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:24,506
Ri-won / they'd have preconceived notions

492
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,742
Ri-won / And you know how I am personality-wise

493
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,943
Ri-won / When I'm with everyone

494
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,779
Ri-won / It's different from when I'm one-on-one

495
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,949
Ri-won / So anyway, my secret was my age

496
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:39,131
Han-kyul / But she doesn’t seem older than me, so why keep it a secret?

497
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:44,593
Han-kyul / Maybe because we’re close in age, she wanted to hide that?

498
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,329
Ri-won / Actually, Mi-rang is the oldest here

499
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,232
Ri-won / Mi-rang!

500
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,166
Ri-won / Call me 'unnie', I'm older than you

501
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,135
Hee-young / Wait, seriously?

502
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,736
Jin-ah / Did she just call her “ya!”?

503
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,105
Mi-rang / Are you serious?

504
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:57,873
Mi-rang / For real?

505
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,274
Da-gyo / Haha, really

506
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,842
Hee-young / I... I also just called her Ri-won

507
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,312
Ri-won / I'm a year older than Mi-rang

508
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,414
Da-gyo / Seriously...

509
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,958
Mi-rang / You’re older than me?
Ri-won / You’re a year younger than me

510
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:11,353
Han-kyul / Born in '90

511
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,032
Ri-won / Why do you think I kept calling you “hey!”?

512
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:17,502
Jin-ah / Then why did I get scolded for calling you unnie?

513
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:19,861
Ri-won / It was a secret, remember?

514
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,074
Han-kyul / Cancel the casual talk pact!

515
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,100
Mi-rang / Wow, I’ve got goosebumps

516
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,535
Mi-rang / How do you look so young?

517
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,270
Ri-won / It was my secret, remember?

518
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,905
Han-kyul / Honestly, I thought at most

519
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,040
Han-kyul / she was only 2 or 3 years older than me

520
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,785
Hee-young / Her age is honestly shocking

521
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:34,953
Right?

522
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,546
Jin-ah / Good thing she kept it a secret
Hee-young / That’s why we have these two extremes

523
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,048
Jin-ah / So it’s like polar opposites, huh?

524
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,250
Ri-won / Yeah, total extremes

525
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,087
Han-kyul / She was not in the age range I imagined

526
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:47,622
Han-kyul / Honestly, my brain short-circuited at first

527
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:51,770
Han-kyul / I was like, how does she have such a preservative face?

528
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,874
Han-kyul / Honestly, it was truly shocking

529
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,769
Mi-rang / I kept saying “Ri-won! Ri-won!” this whole time

530
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,647
Ri-won / Yeah, always like “Hey, Ri-won!” or “Get over here!”

531
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,984
Mi-rang / “Hey, I need to talk to you, come here”
Ri-won / You know what was the funniest?

532
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,311
Ri-won / You asked me if I was the one who wrote that note

533
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:11,012
Ri-won / Like, “Hey! Did you write this?”

534
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,658
Ri-won / Saying that to me
Mi-rang / Do you like me?

535
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,685
Ri-won / I was so dumbfounded

536
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:17,496
Ri-won / Huh?

537
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,365
Ri-won / “Mi-rang, that wasn’t me!”

538
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,592
Da-gyo / That’s too funny, seriously
Jin-ah / “Do you like me?”

539
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,561
Hee-young / This is wild, her age is genuinely surprising

540
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,531
Hee-young / I kept calling her Ri-won too

541
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,666
Hee-young / I thought she was younger than me

542
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,669
Ri-won / It’s all good
Mi-rang / Just a one-year difference

543
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,272
Ri-won / When’s your birthday?
Mi-rang / October 3rd

544
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,818
Ri-won / Mine’s in April
Mi-rang / Unnie

545
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:46,748
Ri-won / Now that my secret’s out, I feel so free

546
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,885
Ri-won / Especially because I got to surprise the ‘93 crew and Mi-rang

547
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,797
Ri-won / It feels really good, honestly

548
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:53,965
Ri-won / Turns out I’m younger than someone

549
00:23:54,199 --> 00:23:56,525
Ri-won / So when I revealed it today

550
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,393
Ri-won / I purposely teased Mi-rang

551
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:01,563
Ri-won / Told her “Call me unnie” just for fun

552
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:05,734
Ri-won / Anyway, that was my secret
Hee-young / That was honestly hilarious

553
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:06,668
Jin-ah / So funny

554
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,538
Hee-young / I need a drink

555
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,941
Jin-ah / For me, when it comes to things like age or jobs

556
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,343
Jin-ah / the basic info people usually hide on blind dates

557
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,778
Jin-ah / I want to hear those secrets first

558
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,290
Ri-won / I want to know Hee-young’s job!

559
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,327
Hee-young / Ahem

560
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,631
Da-gyo / What could it be?

561
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,230
Hee-young / My job is a tattoo artist

562
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,632
Mi-rang / Oh! I guessed right!

563
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,667
Mi-rang / I totally got it right!

564
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:41,313
Hee-young / But you guessed like a hundred options

565
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,471
Mi-rang / Ah, a hundred...

566
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,438
Ri-won / Hoping one sticks

567
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:44,739
Da-gyo / I asked if it was one of the guesses

568
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,575
Da-gyo / but you said you couldn’t tell

569
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,177
Jin-ah / Since it was, you couldn’t say it
Hee-young / Because it was in there

570
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,423
Hee-young / If it wasn’t, I would've said no

571
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,292
Hee-young / My current job is tattoo artist

572
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,738
Hee-young / and I’ve been doing it for seven years now

573
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,268
Hee-young / On my first overseas trip, a friend’s mom

574
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,537
Hee-young / was getting a lettering tattoo on her arm

575
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:19,374
Hee-young / and I found out it was the name of a child she had lost

576
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:21,009
Hee-young / and it really moved me

577
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,990
Hee-young / That’s when I chose to become a tattoo artist

578
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:33,955
Hee-young / There are still a lot of prejudices

579
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,258
Hee-young / against tattoos and tattoo artists

580
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,994
Hee-young / So rather than leading with that

581
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,396
Hee-young / I wanted people to first know me, Park Hee-young

582
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,198
Hee-young / as a person

583
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,709
Hee-young / and then learn about my job

584
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,380
Hee-young / Actually, I have a sleeve right here

585
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,740
Da-gyo / I knew it! I was so curious about that

586
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,609
Hee-young / You could only see up to here, right?

587
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,777
Da-gyo / What’s above that, unnie?

588
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,879
Da-gyo / I couldn’t just ask you to roll it up

589
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,424
Da-gyo / But I was so curious

590
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,449
Mi-rang / That’s so cool, so cool

591
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:07,088
Hee-young / I’ve also traveled abroad a lot
Da-gyo / Oh~ so your tattoo work is done internationally...

592
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,757
Min-woo / You go abroad because

593
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,559
Min-woo / people are asking for you, right?

594
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,760
Hee-young / That’s right

595
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,061
Hee-young / But not always

596
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,030
Hee-young / Sometimes I just go where I want

597
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,332
Hee-young / I have a lot of freedom when it comes to travel

598
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:19,634
Hee-young / So if I have a girlfriend

599
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,937
Hee-young / I want to match her schedule when I travel for work

600
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,772
Hee-young / and do both travel and work together

601
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,540
Hee-young / in that kind of way

602
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,541
Ri-won / That sounds amazing

603
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,321
Hee-young / I really hope I get to do that someday

604
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,180
Hee-young / Thank you

605
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,549
Hee-young / I feel so relieved, I can finally show my arm

606
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,217
Hee-young / and show more of who I really am

607
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,385
Hee-young / I think this gave me

608
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,055
Hee-young / the chance to do that

609
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,489
Hee-young / No matter how people take it

610
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,368
Hee-young / this is still me

611
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,994
Min-woo / I was a little surprised when I saw that much

612
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:49,497
Min-woo / Because I’m not usually into people with a lot of tattoos

613
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:50,999
Min-woo / That’s just not my type

614
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:53,768
Min-woo / I was a bit surprised, but I still liked her the same

615
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,706
Min-woo / She travels a lot, and she’s really free-spirited

616
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,542
Min-woo / That part of her

617
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:04,389
Min-woo / actually made her more attractive, because I want that too

618
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:09,017
Min-woo / I think we’d really connect on future goals

619
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,962
Mi-rang / So cool

620
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,698
Ri-won / The cutest one

621
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:18,827
Ri-won / The cutest one’s job?
Han-kyul / My Melody

622
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,806
Min-woo / My job is

623
00:27:26,578 --> 00:27:29,738
Min-woo / I work as a TikTok creator

624
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:31,583
Min-woo / I also do live broadcasts

625
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,916
Min-woo / People tend to think TikTok creators

626
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,451
Min-woo / are kind of inappropriate

627
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,020
Min-woo / or live flashy lives

628
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,288
Min-woo / and that we can’t do anything else for the rest of our lives

629
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:48,566
Min-woo / There’s that stereotype

630
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:58,843
Min-woo / But these days, having multiple jobs isn’t a choice, it’s a necessity

631
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,874
Min-woo / I majored in Airline cabin service management

632
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,543
Min-woo / and I used to work in an office and run a business

633
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:11,713
Min-woo / Now I work as a live creator

634
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,949
Min-woo / I love experiences and adventure

635
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:17,852
Min-woo / I want stability in love, but when it comes to work

636
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,220
Min-woo / When it comes to things like that

637
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,699
Min-woo / I'm really passionate

638
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,426
Min-woo / I really want to experience everything

639
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:28,063
Min-woo / So I'm also very free-spirited

640
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,932
Min-woo / And if someone wants to go overseas

641
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:33,912
Min-woo / We can travel and enjoy things together

642
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,872
Mi-rang / That’s a strength
Min-woo / I really want to meet someone

643
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,609
Min-woo / I can grow with while experiencing many things

644
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,712
Ri-won / Why did you switch to being a TikToker?

645
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,957
Min-woo / I think it's the future of social media

646
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,417
Min-woo / Social media platforms are constantly changing

647
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,587
Min-woo / So I wanted to start early and catch on quickly

648
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,056
Min-woo / I had a strong desire to experience it fast

649
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:59,060
Min-woo / And through that, I've been learning a lot

650
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,862
Min-woo / The information flow is really fast

651
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:03,064
Min-woo / And I can gain insights from all over the world

652
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,266
Min-woo / It's not just about making money from content

653
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,267
Min-woo / But also

654
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,436
Min-woo / I can experience everything about myself through it

655
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:12,283
Min-woo / I think it's a really rewarding job

656
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,454
Ri-won / Why does Son Min-woo suddenly look so pretty?

657
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,581
Han-kyul / For me, honestly, TikTok is...

658
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,550
Han-kyul / Is at the center of global trends

659
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,619
Han-kyul / So I’m studying it really hard

660
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,222
Min-woo / Me too
Han-kyul / I think it's a great job

661
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,968
Min-woo / Thank you

662
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:33,461
Min-woo / I was a bit surprised

663
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:37,432
Min-woo / I didn’t know she could think that deeply

664
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,167
Min-woo / Because she's only 20

665
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,379
Min-woo / Maybe it’s because she’s MZ and gets it faster?

666
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,539
Min-woo / Do we have the same interests?

667
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,074
Min-woo / I started wondering things like that

668
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,710
Ri-won / The fact that there was a secret revealed

669
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,145
Ri-won / And it was Da-gyo

670
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,880
Da-gyo / Looking into the distance

671
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,815
Da-gyo / Ri-won kept staring at me on purpose

672
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,985
Da-gyo / Hee-young wasn’t there either, yesterday

673
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,963
Da-gyo / But she got it right today

674
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,057
Hee-young / She guessed it in one go

675
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,759
Ri-won / Tell us the secret

676
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:05,727
Mi-rang / What is it?

677
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,238
Da-gyo / My secret is...

678
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,470
Da-gyo / My secret is about my ideal type

679
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,306
Hee-young / I’m curious why that’s a secret

680
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,875
Da-gyo / It’s a secret because it’s too specific

681
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:24,345
Da-gyo / Everyone I dated had certain features

682
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,849
Da-gyo / They always had double eyelids and a high nose

683
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,919
Da-gyo / So very defined facial features

684
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,921
Da-gyo / And a slim build...

685
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:33,731
Da-gyo / That kind of style...

686
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,423
Mi-rang / Is she slim?

687
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,193
Mi-rang / Wait, not “is she”—I mean

688
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,061
Da-gyo / Only people like that... no one else

689
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:40,995
Da-gyo / Not even one person

690
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,397
Han-kyul / What about hair length?

691
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,766
Da-gyo / I’ve dated people with all kinds of hair lengths

692
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:45,767
Da-gyo / But those external features

693
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,268
Da-gyo / I’ve always been so fixed on them

694
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,471
Da-gyo / So coming here, I wanted to try letting go of that

695
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,806
Da-gyo / To not focus on those things first

696
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,174
Da-gyo / And just try getting to know people

697
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,310
Da-gyo / Since this is a natural setting

698
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,411
Da-gyo / Even if someone’s interested in me

699
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,012
Da-gyo / If I say, “This is my exact ideal type,”

700
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,781
Da-gyo / And they don’t fit it

701
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,783
Da-gyo / It might make it hard for them to approach me

702
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,395
Da-gyo / So that’s why I wanted to keep it a secret

703
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,188
Hee-young / Because you’re so set on it

704
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,592
Da-gyo / I wanted both myself and the other person to stay open

705
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,994
Da-gyo / And get to know each other freely

706
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,196
Mi-rang / I wondered if I didn’t match that

707
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,831
Mi-rang / But it made me happy

708
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:19,834
Mi-rang / Because I felt like I had a better chance

709
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:22,046
Mi-rang / I became more attracted to her

710
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,739
Mi-rang / Since mine isn’t that serious

711
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:25,773
Mi-rang / Can I go next?

712
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,575
Jin-ah / Sure sure

713
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:28,786
Mi-rang / My secret is...

714
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,029
Mi-rang / I have attention deficit

715
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,655
Da-gyo / Really?

716
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,024
Mi-rang / So when you say attention deficit

717
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,393
Mi-rang / People might think it means I can’t focus

718
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,061
Mi-rang / But if you look at it another way

719
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,263
Mi-rang / When I focus on one thing

720
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:50,331
Mi-rang / I can’t pay attention to anything else

721
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,333
Mi-rang / So in daily life

722
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,103
Mi-rang / I take lots of notes so it’s fine

723
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,740
Mi-rang / But someone I’m dating might feel hurt

724
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,184
Mi-rang / Because of that side of me

725
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,378
Hee-young / Suddenly everything makes sense

726
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,146
Ri-won / What? What happened?

727
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,247
Hee-young / She kept dropping things

728
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,825
Hee-young / I nagged her so much

729
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,386
Hee-young / She forgets a lot, so I’m like “Oh my gosh”

730
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,621
Ri-won / I thought she was dropping stuff to act cute

731
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:14,589
Hee-young / Was that it?

732
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,157
Mi-rang / Was I cute?

733
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,725
Ri-won / Oh come on

734
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,794
Mi-rang / Someone I dated before

735
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,130
Mi-rang / Would talk to friends when upset

736
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,474
Mi-rang / But never talked to me

737
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,135
Mi-rang / When I asked why they never told me

738
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,681
Mi-rang / They said, “Because you never remember what I say”

739
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:31,673
Mi-rang / When they said that

740
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,585
Mi-rang / I really wasn’t trying to ignore them

741
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,412
Mi-rang / I honestly didn’t know until then

742
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,380
Jin-ah / That must’ve hurt... blaming yourself

743
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,248
Da-gyo / Yeah I’d feel that way too

744
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,918
Jin-ah / It might’ve made you blame yourself even more

745
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,254
Mi-rang / I found out later

746
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:50,191
Mi-rang / I read a lot of books to fix it

747
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,061
Mi-rang / Took up the habit of writing notes

748
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,330
Mi-rang / Tried really hard, and I’ve gotten much better now

749
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,133
Jin-ah / That’s what matters, putting in effort

750
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,747
Hee-young / But you’re amazing just the way you are

751
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:06,140
Mi-rang / Thank you
Hee-young / I thought you were just acting cute

752
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:06,774
Hee-young / She must’ve been really cute

753
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:07,585
Mi-rang / Was she cute?
Ri-won / Yeah!

754
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:11,112
Da-gyo / Now that I hear it, it doesn't sound like a serious issue at all

755
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,914
Da-gyo / It might be huge for someone else

756
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,682
Da-gyo / But to me, it didn’t sound like a big deal

757
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,150
Da-gyo / It’s just something that happens

758
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,553
Mi-rang / And next...

759
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,188
Ri-won / Seo-yeon and Jin-ah are left

760
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,223
Ri-won / Who wants to go first?

761
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,093
Mi-rang / I was actually curious about Seo-yeon’s secret too

762
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,061
Da-gyo / Seriously, but I have no idea...

763
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,429
Da-gyo / I can’t even guess what it is

764
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:31,132
Min-woo / I really have no clue what Seo-yeon is thinking

765
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,633
Hee-young / Seriously, right?

766
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:33,868
Hee-young / She's such a unique person

767
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,704
Seo-yeon / My secret is...

768
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:39,640
Seo-yeon / I can’t organize my thoughts...

769
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,275
Ri-won / If you cry, I’ll be sad

770
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,677
Mi-rang / Are you crying?

771
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:43,878
Seo-yeon / I’m sorry

772
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,923
Ri-won / Don’t be sorry

773
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:04,065
Seo-yeon / I had no idea you had that kind of secret, Mi-rang

774
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,869
Seo-yeon / I misunderstood everything on my own

775
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,204
Seo-yeon / And now I feel so sorry

776
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,141
Seo-yeon / So I thought what I did to you was revenge

777
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,943
Mi-rang / “You said it was revenge, and now you're saying you liked me?”

778
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:19,847
Mi-rang / I’m so confused

779
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:22,583
Seo-yeon / Confusion was the revenge

780
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,153
Seo-yeon / I wanted to make you confused

781
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:27,431
Mi-rang / What the heck...

782
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:32,626
Seo-yeon / You being confused was my revenge!

783
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:35,840
Seo-yeon / If you were at peace, that’s not revenge

784
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:37,465
Mi-rang / What are you...

785
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:38,632
Mi-rang / Are you acting?

786
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:40,634
Mi-rang / Are you some kind of actress?

787
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:43,381
Seo-yeon / No, you’re just so frustrating sometimes

788
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:51,178
Seo-yeon / Why... why did you have to say that today of all days...

789
00:34:51,188 --> 00:34:52,813
Seo-yeon / If only you’d said it later

790
00:34:52,823 --> 00:34:59,253
Seo-yeon / Just a few hours... if I’d held out just a few more hours

791
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:03,467
Seo-yeon / I wouldn’t feel this sorry

792
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:19,273
Seo-yeon / If I’d just waited a few more hours, I wouldn’t be this sorry

793
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:24,412
Seo-yeon / I regret it so much

794
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:27,648
Seo-yeon / Mi-rang

795
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:32,019
Seo-yeon / I can’t even imagine how confused you must’ve been

796
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,221
Seo-yeon / Just how confused you were...

797
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:37,158
Seo-yeon / You even apologized to me

798
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:42,807
Seo-yeon / And I didn’t know anything, and I was happy about it

799
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,967
Seo-yeon / How confused must you have been?

800
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:51,782
Seo-yeon / You didn’t know anything

801
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:56,187
Seo-yeon / I feel so sorry I think I’m going crazy

802
00:35:57,354 --> 00:35:59,346
Mi-rang / It’s okay, take your time

803
00:35:59,356 --> 00:36:01,582
Jin-ah / Okay, can you talk now?

804
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,450
Jin-ah / Okay okay

805
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,851
Da-gyo / Jin-ah, you go first

806
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:04,952
Jin-ah / Me?

807
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:07,421
Jin-ah / This is really funny, but honestly

808
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,056
Da-gyo / Funny?

809
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,424
Jin-ah / It’s such a real secret

810
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,294
Jin-ah / It’s something that’s always bothered me in relationships

811
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,663
Jin-ah / I’m the first person in Korea

812
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,131
Jin-ah / To be on both a straight dating show and a lesbian dating show

813
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:19,310
Jin-ah / At the same time

814
00:36:20,544 --> 00:36:21,345
Mi-rang / The first?

815
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:25,673
Mi-rang / Hetero means like, normal dating

816
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,540
Jin-ah / Yeah, I’ve been on both straight and lesbian dating shows

817
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:29,520
Jin-ah / Yeah, I’ve been on both straight and lesbian dating shows
Mi-rang / So you weren’t a lesbian back then

818
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,278
Jin-ah / When I worked as an airport announcer

819
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:33,981
Jin-ah / I was 24 when I filmed the straight one

820
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,617
Jin-ah / And six years later, I’m suddenly on a lesbian one

821
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,420
Mi-rang / Oh... so back then, you were... you were...

822
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,699
Da-gyo / “You were”?

823
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,626
Ri-won / I thought she was quoting a trot song

824
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:48,929
Jin-ah / And Da-gyo’s eyes kept sparkling

825
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:51,832
Jin-ah / Because I’ve dated both men and women

826
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,635
Jin-ah / People kept wondering, “When did you meet your first girlfriend?”

827
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,137
Jin-ah / But I couldn’t tell you because

828
00:36:57,147 --> 00:37:00,774
Jin-ah / After I was on the straight dating show

829
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:02,376
Jin-ah / One of my fans

830
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,613
Jin-ah / Stayed by my side as a friend for three years

831
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:09,016
Jin-ah / While I only dated men

832
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,152
Jin-ah / And one day, suddenly...

833
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:14,388
Jin-ah / I realized I was in love with her

834
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:18,158
Jin-ah / So I confessed to my first girlfriend

835
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:20,294
Jin-ah / I drank three bottles of soju that day

836
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,929
Jin-ah / And didn’t even get drunk

837
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,664
Jin-ah / I told her all the reasons I liked her

838
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:25,699
Jin-ah / That when I’m sick I want to tell her first

839
00:37:25,709 --> 00:37:27,935
Jin-ah / When I see cool places on Instagram I want to go with her

840
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,103
Jin-ah / I want to share it with her

841
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:31,105
Jin-ah / Her job is really cool

842
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,307
Jin-ah / The reason I love and respect you

843
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,542
Jin-ah / Is about eightfold

844
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,377
Jin-ah / And if the only reason we shouldn't be together

845
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,177
Jin-ah / Is gender

846
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:39,713
Jin-ah / Then I don't think gender matters Let's date!

847
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:40,915
Jin-ah / With my first girlfriend

848
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,626
Jin-ah / I confessed first, that’s how we started

849
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:46,320
Ri-won / Then did you know she was into women?

850
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,354
Ri-won / Or not?

851
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:48,822
Jin-ah / I honestly had no concept

852
00:37:48,832 --> 00:37:49,957
Jin-ah / Of that kind of thing, like a fool

853
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,059
Jin-ah / I had a lot of gay friends

854
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,294
Jin-ah / But no lesbian friends around me

855
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,195
Jin-ah / I was always at the airport and such

856
00:37:55,205 --> 00:37:57,665
Jin-ah / So pathetically enough

857
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,900
Jin-ah / To me, being a lesbian

858
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,504
Jin-ah / Was like saying “speak a language that doesn't exist in this world”

859
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,905
Jin-ah / So the fact that I discovered love

860
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:06,507
Jin-ah / Through that journey means a lot to me

861
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,686
Jin-ah / I'm a pansexual YouTuber, by the way

862
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,477
Jin-ah / I have the same reason as you

863
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:11,946
Jin-ah / Gender doesn't matter to me

864
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,548
Jin-ah / I want to get married someday

865
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:17,117
Jin-ah / And I found the feeling of lifelong stability

866
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:19,029
Jin-ah / More with women, for me

867
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:20,854
Jin-ah / So now

868
00:38:20,864 --> 00:38:23,023
Jin-ah / I used to date men

869
00:38:23,033 --> 00:38:24,291
Jin-ah / And it wasn’t until my late 20s

870
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,893
Jin-ah / That I dated a woman, and

871
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,761
Jin-ah / There were so many biases about people

872
00:38:27,771 --> 00:38:29,273
Da-gyo / Everyone’s like that...

873
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,365
Ri-won / Tossing the tissue was hilarious

874
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:33,167
Jin-ah / I swallowed it, I did

875
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,668
Jin-ah / I only dated girls with short hair

876
00:38:34,678 --> 00:38:36,570
Jin-ah / But people had so many prejudices

877
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,040
Jin-ah / Like “Aren’t you just replacing a man with her?”

878
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,509
Da-gyo / Yeah, people usually say stuff like that
Jin-ah / “You’re gonna go back to guys after we break up”

879
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:45,679
Jin-ah / “You’re not really a lesbian, right?” That kind of thing

880
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:47,381
Jin-ah / That really hurt

881
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,882
Jin-ah / And also...

882
00:38:48,892 --> 00:38:50,818
Jin-ah / The fact that I had been on a straight dating show

883
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,853
Jin-ah / Is still out there on YouTube

884
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,255
Jin-ah / To me, it’s a distant past

885
00:38:55,265 --> 00:38:57,691
Jin-ah / But my dates or girlfriends

886
00:38:57,701 --> 00:39:01,362
Jin-ah / Would bring that into the present and watch it

887
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,730
Jin-ah / And that made me really sad

888
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,133
Jin-ah / So coming on this show, whether I end up with someone

889
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,601
Jin-ah / Or I don’t

890
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,303
Jin-ah / I wanted to use this lesbian dating show

891
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,215
Jin-ah / To wash away my old dating show past

892
00:39:12,916 --> 00:39:14,541
Jin-ah / I wanted to stop feeling anxious

893
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:16,610
Jin-ah / I didn’t want to leave any insecurity

894
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,345
Jin-ah / For the person I’d marry someday

895
00:39:18,355 --> 00:39:19,179
Jin-ah / That’s it

896
00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:22,593
Da-gyo / That was really good

897
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,988
Han-kyul / I thought that was such a beautiful story

898
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:30,624
Han-kyul / If you turned that into a novel

899
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,360
Han-kyul / It’d be so moving, honestly

900
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:37,665
Han-kyul / That’s why I found it so beautiful

901
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,511
Ri-won / Our gentle king

902
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,914
Seo-yeon / My secret is...

903
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,040
Hee-young / What is it?

904
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,174
Ri-won / What?

905
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:48,585
Hee-young / I’m dying to know

906
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,813
Min-woo / I always felt like Seo-yeon had some big story

907
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:55,215
Min-woo / Something you couldn’t just ask or guess

908
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:58,796
Min-woo / So I had no way to even imagine it

909
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:04,034
Seo-yeon / I...

910
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:06,603
Seo-yeon / have never had a girlfriend

911
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:10,431
Da-gyo / Really

912
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:14,311
Hee-young / I thought you were obsessed with women

913
00:40:14,344 --> 00:40:15,002
Hee-young / Sorry

914
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:16,470
Da-gyo / Me too me too me too

915
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,348
Da-gyo / I really thought you were totally into girls

916
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:19,273
Da-gyo / I seriously kind of—

917
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,842
Seo-yeon / It's because until now

918
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,478
Seo-yeon / I only had crushes on straight women

919
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,681
Mi-rang / Only unrequited loves  
Da-gyo / Wow really

920
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,851
Seo-yeon / The reason I kept this a secret is

921
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,797
Seo-yeon / because the fact that I’ve never dated

922
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:39,036
Seo-yeon / a woman might bring some prejudice

923
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,995
Seo-yeon / from people in this community

924
00:40:42,005 --> 00:40:44,875
Jin-ah / That could make you anxious, for sure

925
00:40:44,908 --> 00:40:47,711
Seo-yeon / And even though I have this complex

926
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:52,239
Seo-yeon / about only having unrequited loves

927
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,218
Seo-yeon / I wanted my first girlfriend

928
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,389
Seo-yeon / to be someone I could meet

929
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,681
Seo-yeon / through this

930
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,993
Seo-yeon / so I decided to come on the show

931
00:41:03,026 --> 00:41:05,195
Mi-rang / That’s really meaningful

932
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:07,631
Seo-yeon / Coming out through this program

933
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:09,757
Seo-yeon / and being able to share this

934
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,504
Mi-rang / That’s incredible  
Ri-won / That must’ve been so hard

935
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:17,841
Seo-yeon / I want to put an end to unrequited love

936
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,235
Hee-young / Seo-yeon

937
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:24,948
Mi-rang / You’re amazing  
Ri-won / I'm seriously giving a standing ovation

938
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,712
Ri-won / Oh my god

939
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,281
Ri-won / I relate to this so much

940
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:37,394
Ri-won / I feel like there are so many people like her

941
00:41:37,427 --> 00:41:39,753
Ri-won / It’s harder for women to meet women

942
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,755
Ri-won / especially in our country

943
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:45,325
Ri-won / So I bet there are a lot of lesbians

944
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:48,071
Ri-won / who have never had a girlfriend

945
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,164
Ri-won / I’m so thankful and amazed

946
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,366
Ri-won / that Seo-yeon had the courage to come here

947
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,001
Ri-won / It's seriously incredible

948
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,312
Mi-rang / It’s not easy

949
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:56,970
Ri-won / I really believe

950
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,839
Ri-won / only good things are ahead for Seo-yeon

951
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,807
Da-gyo / I agree, totally

952
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:02,676
Jin-ah / You made such a great choice coming here

953
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,445
Ri-won / You really did, seriously

954
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:08,482
Seo-yeon / I feel relieved

955
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:12,119
Seo-yeon / that people could understand my actions

956
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:16,300
Seo-yeon / It gave me some comfort

957
00:42:16,466 --> 00:42:19,860
Ri-won / I kept thinking I should’ve taken better care of her

958
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,962
Ri-won / And I felt sorry, so for me

959
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:24,665
Ri-won / My first instinct was that I needed to give Seo-yeon a hug

960
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,800
Ri-won / I want to give you a hug, come here

961
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,979
Min-woo / I seriously thought she was hopelessly stuck

962
00:42:29,012 --> 00:42:29,870
Hee-young / I mean seriously

963
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,072
Hee-young / But that must’ve been so hard  
Ri-won / That must’ve been so hard

964
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,417
Hee-young / I can't even imagine

965
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,577
Da-gyo / The fact that everyone could relate and it felt warm

966
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:40,581
Da-gyo / That moment of sharing all that

967
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,125
Da-gyo / really stayed with me

968
00:42:42,492 --> 00:42:46,720
Ri-won / That time was precious, it was such a wonderful moment

969
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,591
Ri-won / Hearing what you said brought me comfort

970
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,794
Ri-won / It made me realize we all share similar worries

971
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:55,896
Ri-won / I’m glad I came back one more time

972
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,941
Ri-won / And this time I think it’s for an entirely new reason

973
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:08,285
Jin-ah / Han-kyul

974
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,048
Jin-ah / Just personally, I hope

975
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:16,283
Jin-ah / you don’t get the wrong idea

976
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:18,919
Jin-ah / I really leaned on that friend a lot

977
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,088
Jin-ah / and was super clingy with her

978
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,691
Jin-ah / I’ve dated both older and younger women

979
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:28,562
Jin-ah / Even ones around your age, Han-kyul

980
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,941
Jin-ah / Someone like me

981
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:34,635
Jin-ah / would totally like someone like you, Han-kyul, I said that

982
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,080
Han-kyul / Like a life partner

983
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,315
Han-kyul / Like a soulmate

984
00:43:38,348 --> 00:43:40,641
Han-kyul / Someone who can give me stability

985
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,209
Han-kyul / That's what I said

986
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,755
Han-kyul / When I mentioned that younger age range

987
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:48,615
Han-kyul / they might not be able to offer that kind of stability

988
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:49,917
Han-kyul / About that kind of risk—

989
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,885
Jin-ah / I don't really think that way because

990
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:55,122
Jin-ah / I do like older women

991
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:57,157
Jin-ah / But it’s not about chronological age

992
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,435
Jin-ah / that I like

993
00:43:58,468 --> 00:44:01,328
Jin-ah / It's just that we live in a world where we have to act mature

994
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:02,396
Jin-ah / Because this time

995
00:44:02,406 --> 00:44:03,874
Jin-ah / when I changed jobs

996
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:07,878
Jin-ah / I beat out male competitors in their late 40s

997
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,279
Han-kyul / That’s impressive

998
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,080
Jin-ah / So now

999
00:44:10,113 --> 00:44:12,005
Jin-ah / everyone sees me as cool and capable

1000
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:14,608
Jin-ah / and that makes me want to be super cute to my partner

1001
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:17,878
Jin-ah / But the younger ones I dated

1002
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,013
Jin-ah / had this desire to treat me like an older one

1003
00:44:20,023 --> 00:44:22,416
Jin-ah / So ironically, they felt more mature to me

1004
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:25,118
Jin-ah / None of my younger girlfriends

1005
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,888
Jin-ah / ever called me "unnie"

1006
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,833
Jin-ah / Wanna come to our room?

1007
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:34,461
Ri-won / After the pajama party, I saw Jin-ah talking with Han-kyul

1008
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:37,064
Ri-won / I saw the two of them having a conversation

1009
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:39,633
Ri-won / And then I saw them go into a room together

1010
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:42,069
Ri-won / From that moment, I started feeling uneasy

1011
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,880
Jin-ah / Just like Ri-won says

1012
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:45,138
Jin-ah / That “aww baby” kind of feeling

1013
00:44:45,148 --> 00:44:46,683
Jin-ah / I’ve never felt that before

1014
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:50,377
Jin-ah / The way those girls tried not to seem like a baby

1015
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,446
Jin-ah / That really made my heart flutter

1016
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:55,015
Jin-ah / It’s not like “aww the baby’s trying hard”

1017
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,451
Jin-ah / I think younger girls have a kind of mature charm

1018
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,652
Jin-ah / that older ones can't have

1019
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:01,198
Jin-ah / When a younger one says “Jin-ah!”

1020
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,166
Jin-ah / I just melt, I’m like this

1021
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,092
Jin-ah / That’s what I mean so for me

1022
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:08,638
Jin-ah / it’s not something that only works on younger girls

1023
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:09,963
Jin-ah / I hope you don’t think that way

1024
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,542
Jin-ah / There are people like me out there too

1025
00:45:13,076 --> 00:45:15,479
Han-kyul / I’m seriously shocked right now

1026
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:18,638
Jin-ah / I just felt frustrated and wanted to talk

1027
00:45:18,648 --> 00:45:21,608
Jin-ah / But you kept going to talk to others

1028
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:25,612
Jin-ah / I kept thinking “I could give you the best advice”

1029
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:26,680
Jin-ah / I have the experience!

1030
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,250
Han-kyul / I seriously didn’t expect to hear this kind of story

1031
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:33,720
Han-kyul / I thought she seemed kind of like fragile glass

1032
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,654
Han-kyul / So delicate

1033
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:37,657
Han-kyul / She had this soft, gentle image

1034
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:41,161
Han-kyul / She has the clearest eyes I’ve ever seen

1035
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,574
Han-kyul / So I thought if I were taller

1036
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:47,000
Han-kyul / If I could offer more

1037
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,880
Han-kyul / I kind of wanted to make a move

1038
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:50,737
Han-kyul / But I couldn’t

1039
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:53,483
Han-kyul / So I kept hesitating

1040
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:57,377
Jin-ah / No I felt the same, honestly, that’s why—

1041
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,523
Han-kyul / Did you know I asked you on a date?

1042
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:00,881
Jin-ah / When? Seriously?

1043
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:03,360
Han-kyul / When I sent the text

1044
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:05,919
Han-kyul / I actually wrote “To Jin-ah”

1045
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,066
Jin-ah / Seriously? What a shame

1046
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,001
Jin-ah / I thought you didn’t like me

1047
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,559
Jin-ah / I thought you weren’t interested at all

1048
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:15,439
Han-kyul / Honestly I was kind of in a half-giving-up mindset then

1049
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:19,443
Han-kyul / I’m a book lover type of person

1050
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:20,600
Han-kyul / Like a writer—

1051
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,768
Jin-ah / A talk with an author?

1052
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:23,480
Han-kyul / Yeah like that, a talk with an author

1053
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:25,439
Han-kyul / That’s the vibe I was thinking

1054
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,684
Han-kyul / That’s the kind of “date” I meant

1055
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:30,287
Jin-ah / I get it, I also just wanted to talk with you

1056
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,978
Han-kyul / I never imagined that

1057
00:46:31,988 --> 00:46:33,980
Han-kyul / someone here would open that possibility for me

1058
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:35,649
Han-kyul / I really didn’t think that way

1059
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,217
Jin-ah / I thought you’d be super popular

1060
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,519
Han-kyul / Even though I really liked you

1061
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:43,500
Han-kyul / I thought you wouldn’t leave me any room at all

1062
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,695
Jin-ah / My heart was fluttering like crazy but in my head I was like “the age gap though”

1063
00:46:48,705 --> 00:46:52,099
Jin-ah / But my love was much more here

1064
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,534
Jin-ah / than here, you know?

1065
00:46:54,544 --> 00:46:58,972
Jin-ah / That moment was the most

1066
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:02,285
Jin-ah / Actually, since I entered the house

1067
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,643
Jin-ah / Without a single lie

1068
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:06,189
Jin-ah / it was the happiest moment

1069
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:14,621
Ri-won / When did you get here, Han-kyul?
Han-kyul / Me?

1070
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:18,058
Han-kyul / I snuck in without anyone noticing

1071
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:21,571
Ri-won / Did you talk to Jin-ah?
Han-kyul / Yeah

1072
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,332
Ri-won / Did you cry again?
Han-kyul / I didn’t cry

1073
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,535
Han-kyul / I really didn’t
Ri-won / You didn’t cry this time?

1074
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:32,038
Ri-won / You said you feel really comfortable talking to Jin-ah, right?

1075
00:47:32,048 --> 00:47:34,641
Han-kyul / I’ve always felt comfortable around her

1076
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,676
Han-kyul / But I started thinking, “Why did I?”

1077
00:47:36,686 --> 00:47:39,779
Han-kyul / That thought kept coming to me

1078
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:40,947
Ri-won / What do you mean?

1079
00:47:40,957 --> 00:47:45,619
Han-kyul / I think I had some kind of misunderstanding

1080
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:49,422
Han-kyul / Like I just vaguely assumed something

1081
00:47:49,432 --> 00:47:51,258
Ri-won / What kind of misunderstanding?

1082
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:55,438
Han-kyul / I misunderstood her as someone I felt at ease with

1083
00:47:56,173 --> 00:48:00,400
Ri-won / Jin-ah?

1084
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,903
Ri-won / So does that mean she makes you uncomfortable?

1085
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:07,417
Han-kyul / I’m not sure yet

1086
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:13,413
Ri-won / So now that we’ve revealed our secrets, feels good right?

1087
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,148
Han-kyul / Of course
Ri-won / I feel so relieved

1088
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:17,851
Han-kyul / And honestly, for me, starting now

1089
00:48:17,861 --> 00:48:20,187
Han-kyul / This is when things really begin

1090
00:48:20,197 --> 00:48:22,923
Ri-won / Yeah, exactly
Han-kyul / Until now I kept wondering

1091
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:25,168
Han-kyul / “Would anyone even see me as someone to date?”

1092
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:27,460
Han-kyul / So I was in this weird headspace

1093
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:30,163
Han-kyul / It all felt like a fake practice round
Ri-won / Yeah, I get that

1094
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:33,600
Han-kyul / But now I think I can really go all in

1095
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,302
Han-kyul / I decided to trust myself

1096
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,048
Ri-won / Yes, exactly

1097
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:40,483
Han-kyul / I’m wide awake now!

1098
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,154
Ri-won / I’m so glad today happened

1099
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:48,959
Han-kyul / I want to go on a trip

1100
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,818
Ri-won / Me too, I really want to go to Thailand
Han-kyul / Honestly, right now

1101
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:53,987
Han-kyul / This doesn’t even feel like a vacation

1102
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:57,224
Han-kyul / I want to go somewhere with the person I met here

1103
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,959
Ri-won / You promised to go with me!

1104
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,204
Han-kyul / Thailand is our plan

1105
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:05,398
Ri-won / Who else do you want to go with?
Han-kyul / Secret!

1106
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:06,910
Ri-won / Jin-ah?

1107
00:49:07,677 --> 00:49:08,478
Han-kyul / Secret

1108
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:10,237
Ri-won / Come on, it’s obviously Jin-ah

1109
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:11,938
Ri-won / She’s the only one you’ve talked to recently

1110
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:14,551
Han-kyul / Secret!

1111
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,559
Han-kyul / Don’t send me a note tonight

1112
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:24,517
Ri-won / Why not?

1113
00:49:24,527 --> 00:49:25,986
Han-kyul / I told you earlier

1114
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,397
Han-kyul / I don’t need to be comforted

1115
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,999
Han-kyul / I’m fine even if I get zero votes

1116
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,390
Ri-won / From now on

1117
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,725
Ri-won / I’m only going to write to the person I like

1118
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,960
Han-kyul / That’s the right call

1119
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,763
Han-kyul / Because I honestly feel so bad

1120
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:38,431
Ri-won / Why though? 

1121
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:40,567
Ri-won / I really don’t get it

1122
00:49:40,577 --> 00:49:43,546
Han-kyul / I just do... I feel sorry

1123
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:50,987
Mi-rang / I wonder what the question is today

1124
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:51,711
Da-gyo / Yeah, right?

1125
00:49:51,721 --> 00:49:55,348
Da-gyo / Yesterday’s question was so unexpected

1126
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:57,317
Da-gyo / I can't even guess today’s

1127
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,429
Mi-rang / I feel like it might be that one

1128
00:49:59,462 --> 00:50:02,789
Mi-rang / Writing a letter to the person you dated today

1129
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:05,792
Da-gyo / Are we supposed to pick just one person?

1130
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:07,994
Mi-rang / I feel like it’ll be two again today

1131
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:09,272
Da-gyo / No no, I mean—

1132
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:10,797
Da-gyo / If it’s only to the date partner

1133
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:12,709
Da-gyo / it’s kind of limiting, right?

1134
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:15,368
Da-gyo / The note-passing time is supposed to be impactful

1135
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:17,604
Da-gyo / But today we did stuff with our roommates

1136
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:18,348
Mi-rang / But still

1137
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:20,840
Mi-rang / It was basically a date

1138
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:22,552
Mi-rang / Most people were paired

1139
00:50:22,585 --> 00:50:24,654
Mi-rang / with someone they wanted to try dating

1140
00:50:25,855 --> 00:50:26,946
Da-gyo / That happened today?

1141
00:50:26,956 --> 00:50:28,748
Mi-rang / I mean you, you!

1142
00:50:28,758 --> 00:50:32,862
Da-gyo / No not me, you went out on a one-on-one, remember?

1143
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:35,832
Da-gyo / Geez

1144
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:37,123
Mi-rang / I'm talking about you, seriously

1145
00:50:37,133 --> 00:50:38,591
Da-gyo / Hey I did too though

1146
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:41,671
Da-gyo / But you got chosen and went on a solo date

1147
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,430
Mi-rang / We basically shot a whole movie

1148
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,708
Da-gyo / A whole movie, really?

1149
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,509
Mi-rang / I don't know how it'll turn out

1150
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,202
Mi-rang / I don’t even know what kind of movie it is

1151
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,047
Da-gyo / You’re seriously hilarious

1152
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,406
Da-gyo / What could the question be today?

1153
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:56,286
Mi-rang / I’m really curious too
