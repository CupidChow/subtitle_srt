1
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,080
Jin-ah / To. Mi-rang

2
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,840
Jin-ah / I want to go on a date with you, but

3
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,080
Jin-ah / there are also big, clear reasons why maybe I shouldn’t

4
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,960
Jin-ah / Both are equally strong, and it’s very confusing

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,120
So confusing

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,120
Jin-ah / But I’m very clear about why I like you

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,840
Jin-ah / You’re physically my type, that’s for sure

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,760
Jin-ah / I can’t help that part

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,400
Da-gyo / To. Mi-rang

10
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,560
Da-gyo / I really wanted to go on a date today, so I’m glad we could

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,440
Da-gyo / You wanted to visit the perfume studio

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,600
Da-gyo / and I love scents, so it was even more meaningful

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,880
Da-gyo / I want to get to know you more

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,160
Da-gyo / Everything about today was really nice

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,840
Da-gyo / One of the notes was definitely from me

16
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,640
Mi-rang / That one was definitely Da-gyo

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,640
Mi-rang / I really don’t know who the other one was from

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,960
Mi-rang / But comparing it to the first note I got

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,640
Mi-rang / the handwriting looks really similar

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,120
Mi-rang / whoever it was

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,360
Mi-rang / If they reveal themselves later

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,560
Mi-rang / I think I might start to feel differently

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,640
Mi-rang / Everyone probably knows I like Da-gyo already

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,080
Mi-rang / But seeing someone consistently show interest in me

25
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,800
Mi-rang / That really got to me in a good way

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,480
Mi-rang / I think I liked that the most

27
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,000
Min-woo / What the heck?

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,000
Min-woo / I thought I’d get zero votes today

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,360
Min-woo / I figured Han-kyul would

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,840
Min-woo / think the same way and rule me out

31
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,760
Min-woo / And when Seo-yeon asked about my ideal type

32
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Min-woo / I said I don’t like princessy types

33
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,720
Min-woo / So I felt like maybe I put her off

34
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,280
Min-woo / You know how girls are about that

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,440
Min-woo / If I’m not sure, I won’t make a choice

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,120
Min-woo / So I think my note today

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,360
might change tomorrow’s outcome

38
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,240
Min-woo / I want to take things slowly and step by step

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,560
Jin-ah / Ugh, I don’t want to see this

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,080
Da-gyo / Me too!

41
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Jin-ah / I mean, this question has so many interpretations

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,480
Da-gyo / yeah

43
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,640
Hee-young / I’m still getting zero notes

44
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Hee-young / It’s confusing again

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,000
Hee-young / I’m someone who believes in showing it through actions, not words

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,120
Hee-young / That’s just how I am

47
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,240
Hee-young / But I haven’t given anyone a clear sign yet

48
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,320
Hee-young / I don’t know anymore

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,000
Da-gyo / Where am I supposed to go look?

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,080
Jin-ah / I’m going over here

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,040
Jin-ah / Are you coming?

52
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,360
Da-gyo / Are you going up? I’ll just stay down here

53
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,680
Hee-young / To. Jin-ah

54
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,760
Hee-young / Thank you for being honest with me

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,360
Hee-young / I’m a little slow

56
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,760
Hee-young / But I’m listening to everything you say

57
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,440
Hee-young / I had a really good time

58
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,680
Hee-young / Thanks for asking me on a date too

59
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,040
Hee-young / Let’s keep getting to know each other more comfortably

60
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,520
Jin-ah / But honestly, that part in the note

61
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,040
Jin-ah / "Let’s get to know each other comfortably" felt vague

62
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,360
Jin-ah / Like, was it "Let’s take it easy"?

63
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,680
Jin-ah / Or "Should we maybe get more comfortable"?

64
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,040
Jin-ah / When she said “I’m listening,” did she mean “I understand”?

65
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,960
Jin-ah / Or just “I hear you”? It’s so ambiguous

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,280
Jin-ah / I don’t know if that’s supposed to be a sign of certainty

67
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,640
Jin-ah / And I might be failing to give her certainty too

68
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,960
Jin-ah / But if I tell her that

69
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,120
Jin-ah / I feel like she won’t get it

70
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,280
Jin-ah / She’d just go, "Why though?"

71
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,120
Da-gyo / Oh no, what do I do

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,440
Mi-rang / To. Da-gyo

73
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Mi-rang / I really enjoyed going out with you today

74
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,560
Mi-rang / no regrets

75
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,480
Mi-rang / I want to talk with you more

76
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,840
Mi-rang / I was very happy with our date

77
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,000
Mi-rang / And the only person I truly wanted

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,240
Mi-rang / to get to know more was you, Da-gyo

79
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,760
Seo-yeon / To. Da-gyo

80
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,320
Seo-yeon / I really wanted to go on a date with you today...

81
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,800
Seo-yeon / Let’s definitely go next time

82
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,320
Seo-yeon / I want it to be somewhere with a nice vibe

83
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,200
Seo-yeon / With a good setting that helps the mood

84
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,360
Seo-yeon / So we can make it feel more romantic

85
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,600
Seo-yeon / I’d love to go to a place like that with you

86
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,120
Han-kyul / To. Da-gyo

87
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,880
Han-kyul / I liked sitting next to you

88
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,000
Han-kyul / I want to go on a date next time

89
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,960
Han-kyul / Because I really meant it

90
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,720
Han-kyul / I honestly thought this morning

91
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,520
Han-kyul / ‘I’d like to go on a date with her’

92
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,000
Da-gyo / I really have no idea who sent me the notes today

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,120
Da-gyo / There were just too many people sitting next to me

94
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,720
Da-gyo / Like really, way too many

95
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Da-gyo / Did you open your note?

96
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,160
Hee-young / Yeah yeah

97
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,760
Jin-ah / Can I sneak into the next room?

98
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,360
Jin-ah / Are you staying here?

99
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,080
Da-gyo / No idea

100
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,360
Jin-ah / I always feel sorry and grateful during note time

101
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,280
Jin-ah / I didn’t want to come across like

102
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,640
Jin-ah / ‘Sorry I didn’t send you a note, so I’m here to clear it up’

103
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,880
Jin-ah / I didn’t want to make you feel worse that way

104
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,160
Jin-ah / Can we talk for a bit?

105
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,560
Jin-ah / Just a moment?

106
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,440
Jin-ah / I mean, I thought the opposite

107
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,880
Jin-ah / I interpreted it as

108
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,760
Jin-ah / ‘If you didn’t go on a date today’

109
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,520
Da-gyo / If you didn’t go on a date today?

110
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,960
Jin-ah / Among the ones I didn’t go on a date with

111
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,240
Jin-ah / So I thought everyone was saying it was hard because of that

112
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,920
Jin-ah / The people we didn’t date...

113
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,320
Jin-ah / Who would you want to date if you hadn’t today?

114
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,040
Da-gyo / That’s how you interpreted it?

115
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,680
Jin-ah / So I thought everyone meant it was difficult

116
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Da-gyo / So who did you write? Can you tell me?

117
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,400
Jin-ah / It’s not that I can’t...

118
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,880
Jin-ah / It’s just, that’s not the issue

119
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,680
Jin-ah / You know how everyone expresses their feelings differently?

120
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,000
Jin-ah / Everyone has their own way

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
Da-gyo / Why are you speaking so quietly?

122
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,400
Jin-ah / People just have different ways of showing their feelings

123
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,000
Jin-ah / Like the way I express things

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
Jin-ah / and the way Hee-young does are so different

125
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,560
Jin-ah / I’m listening to you

126
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,480
Jin-ah / thanks for asking me on a date

127
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,120
Jin-ah / That “let’s get to know each other comfortably”

128
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,040
Jin-ah / That word “comfortably” can mean so many things

129
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,360
Jin-ah / But since I take her words to heart

130
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Jin-ah / I wasn’t sure if she meant ‘Don’t overthink, just relax’

131
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,320
Jin-ah / Or if she just meant everything is chill

132
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,680
Jin-ah / But these words, they made me think

133
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,560
Jin-ah / ‘Am I really getting to know this person comfortably?’

134
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,040
Jin-ah / I don’t feel it, so is that my issue?

135
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,000
Jin-ah / The feedback about today

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,920
Jin-ah / Saying "It was a good time" felt too vague

137
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,160
Jin-ah / "Let’s get to know each other comfortably"

138
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,240
Jin-ah / Sounds nice, almost too nice

139
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,520
Jin-ah / I mean, it’s just a difference—not a bad thing

140
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,200
Jin-ah / Some people might think “I should explore everyone”

141
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,280
Jin-ah / But honestly,

142
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,600
Jin-ah / I think there are people like me too

143
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,520
Jin-ah / Even if it’s not “the one,”

144
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,200
Jin-ah / I need to start by getting to know one person

145
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
Jin-ah / That’s just how I am

146
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,520
Jin-ah / I honestly wish Hee-young would just

147
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,920
Jin-ah / say things clearly

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
Da-gyo / Oh, you want more direct words?

149
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,160
Jin-ah / But I get it, maybe she’s expressing it her own way

150
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,080
Jin-ah / She’s doing her best to express in her style

151
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
Jin-ah / Maybe I’m just not picking up on it

152
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,680
Jin-ah / And that’s probably tough for her too

153
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,160
Jin-ah / Then who do I even blame?

154
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,360
Jin-ah / For this frustration?

155
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,680
Da-gyo / If someone wants to get to know others

156
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,680
Da-gyo / Then they should just say it

157
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,640
Jin-ah / Yes, exactly!

158
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,120
Da-gyo / Say it clearly and directly

159
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Jin-ah / I even said, “I’d like to go on one more date”

160
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,520
Jin-ah / I said that much

161
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,080
Jin-ah / That was me expressing affection

162
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,680
Jin-ah / In the most non-pressure way I could

163
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,160
Jin-ah / Saying “Let’s talk more going forward” would be too much

164
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,000
Jin-ah / That’d be overstepping

165
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,840
Da-gyo / Did you get a lot of notes today?

166
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,560
Da-gyo / Do you know right away who sent you one?

167
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,440
Da-gyo / The notes you got?

168
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,240
Jin-ah / The ones I got?

169
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,240
Jin-ah / It was Hee-young

170
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,200
Jin-ah / That’s why I’m confused

171
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,600
Jin-ah / If it’s “someone I wanted to go on a date with today”

172
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,680
Jin-ah / And she sent it to me,

173
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,880
Jin-ah / Then it was already predetermined

174
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,360
Jin-ah / If it was someone you didn’t date

175
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,960
Jin-ah / But wanted to get to know

176
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,920
Jin-ah / Then that means there’s interest

177
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,680
Jin-ah / But if you sent it to someone you already dated,

178
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,800
Jin-ah / Maybe it was just because you already had the date

179
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,000
Jin-ah / That’s why it felt ambiguous to me

180
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,720
Seo-yeon / Did you see?

181
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,920
Seo-yeon / How many did you get?

182
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,800
Hee-young / None

183
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,480
Seo-yeon / None?

184
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,240
Hee-young / Yeah, still none

185
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,160
Hee-young / I’m telling you, none

186
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,200
Hee-young / Today’s date?

187
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,600
Seo-yeon / You’re not allowed to send notes to someone you dated today

188
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,160
Hee-young / Sure you can

189
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,040
Seo-yeon / No, you can’t

190
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,080
Hee-young / You totally can

191
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,680
Hee-young / You wanted to date them and you did, that’s all

192
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,760
Hee-young / I wrote one!

193
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
Hee-young / I actually chose Jin-ah again today

194
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,640
Hee-young / Since she said she wanted to try again with me

195
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,560
Hee-young / That’s why I ended up picking her again

196
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,600
Hee-young / But for me, there wasn’t really a choice

197
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,080
Seo-yeon / But the person you’re interested in...

198
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Hee-young / I wonder if I’m just too insensitive?

199
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,440
Hee-young / Rather than focusing on pressure,

200
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,680
Hee-young / I just don’t want the other person to feel it either

201
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,080
Hee-young / If I’m getting to know someone, I want it to be slow

202
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,360
Hee-young / So if we’re going to figure things out, I want to take it slow

203
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,080
Seo-yeon / So today the situation didn’t really help, huh?

204
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,960
Hee-young / Yeah... I think the situation really played a big part

205
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
Da-gyo / The ramen duo

206
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,760
Mi-rang / Where were you?

207
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,800
Da-gyo / We all went to the room to check our notes

208
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,880
Mi-rang / This is too spicy for me to eat...

209
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,800
Da-gyo / I’m not eating it

210
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,720
Mi-rang / Then try putting milk in it

211
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,120
Da-gyo / Huh? I’m just gonna eat it plain

212
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
Da-gyo / I was feeling down but after checking the note

213
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,560
Da-gyo / Mi-rang got super hyped

214
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,720
Da-gyo / Then it’s obvious to everyone that I wrote her a note

215
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,680
Da-gyo / Everyone knows it

216
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,240
Da-gyo / She changed seats so obviously

217
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,920
Da-gyo / Sat next to me

218
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,560
Da-gyo / Took such good care of me

219
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,240
Da-gyo / Then anyone else who might be interested in me

220
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,880
Da-gyo / or even me getting to know someone else—it gets awkward

221
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,520
Da-gyo / When we’re alone, it’s okay to be obvious

222
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,680
Da-gyo / It’s okay to be a bit discreet too

223
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,320
Da-gyo / But it’s still so early

224
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,520
Da-gyo / Isn’t it a bit much to be that obvious around everyone?

225
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,120
Da-gyo / I mean it’s a little bit... just a little...

226
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,600
Da-gyo / It’s a bit too much...

227
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Da-gyo / I’d prefer it if it was just when we’re alone

228
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,960
Mi-rang / Why do you keep glancing back?

229
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,400
Da-gyo / I had my eyes closed

230
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,160
Mi-rang / You sleepy?

231
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,800
Da-gyo / Yeah... just a little...

232
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,560
Mi-rang / After going on the date

233
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,400
Mi-rang / I thought Da-gyo would be more proactive with me

234
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,240
Mi-rang / But she acted the same as usual

235
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,000
Mi-rang / So I started wondering if I was overdoing it

236
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,600
Han-kyul / Hello

237
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,280
Han-kyul / You’re practically asleep

238
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,640
Han-kyul / At this point I’m kind of

239
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,480
Han-kyul / Starting to feel like I wanna escape

240
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,080
Min-woo / You wanna escape?

241
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,760
Han-kyul / You beat me to the escape

242
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,320
Han-kyul / Like, take me out of this story already

243
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,480
Han-kyul / I feel like I’m not really a key character here

244
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,000
Min-woo / But that’s just how it is within this storyline

245
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,840
Han-kyul / That’s true

246
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,160
Min-woo / It’s actually harder to connect with someone in here

247
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,200
Min-woo / I really think so

248
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,880
Han-kyul / I think so too

249
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,960
Han-kyul / It was already hard to meet someone in real life

250
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,280
Han-kyul / Among so many people

251
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,440
Han-kyul / So how do you find one person out of just eight?

252
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,880
Han-kyul / It’s kind of a long shot

253
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,960
Min-woo / If it weren’t, I wouldn’t have been single for two years

254
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,480
Han-kyul / But how did you interpret today’s question?

255
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,640
Min-woo / To me, it was clearly just an “if”

256
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,360
Han-kyul / Yeah I read it as an “if” too, exactly

257
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,840
Min-woo / You really don’t need to feel down

258
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,400
Min-woo / Because I picked you today

259
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,440
Min-woo / I said you were pretty

260
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,920
Min-woo / So don’t feel too down

261
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,320
Han-kyul / No, seriously...

262
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,520
Han-kyul / thank you

263
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,480
Min-woo / Why thank you?

264
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,440
Min-woo / I just said it because you’re pretty

265
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,760
Min-woo / Why would that be something to be thankful for?

266
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,160
Han-kyul / I used to have really low self-esteem

267
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,040
Min-woo / Everyone has low self-esteem, they’re just pretending to be strong

268
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,840
Han-kyul / Oh~ that hits deep

269
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,960
Min-woo / But honestly, being able to cry like this

270
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,400
Min-woo / might actually be healthier

271
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,520
Han-kyul / Why am I crying right now?

272
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,440
Han-kyul / Why am I crying? Hold on

273
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,440
Han-kyul / Why am I crying?

274
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,120
Min-woo / It’s okay to cry, why not?

275
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Han-kyul / Why am I crying right now?

276
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,640
Min-woo / If the tears come, just let them

277
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,360
Min-woo / But you know,

278
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,680
Min-woo / I just think this

279
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,360
Min-woo / Only apologize when there’s really something to be sorry for

280
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,840
Min-woo / That would be better

281
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,120
Min-woo / But you seem to say sorry

282
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,800
Min-woo / even when there’s no need to

283
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,680
Min-woo / Maybe it’s because you’re young

284
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,320
Min-woo / and everything feels like it needs to be carefully managed

285
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,920
Min-woo / Or maybe it’s just because this is all unfamiliar to you

286
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,360
Han-kyul / Honestly, ever since I read the note

287
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,680
Han-kyul / I started getting really emotional

288
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,320
Han-kyul / and couldn’t really control it

289
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,440
Han-kyul / So I kept crying

290
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,400
Han-kyul / First of all

291
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,080
Han-kyul / I started comparing the handwriting

292
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,520
Han-kyul / like how the ‘ㅎ’ was written

293
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,960
Han-kyul / and how the ‘ㄹ’ looked, and

294
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,440
Han-kyul / my name was written in the exact same style

295
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,560
Han-kyul / Even though I wrote the note to someone else

296
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,160
Han-kyul / it somehow ended up coming back to me exactly the same

297
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,200
Han-kyul / Since we’ve been sharing a room yesterday and today

298
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,960
Han-kyul / and preparing dinner together

299
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,920
Han-kyul / she kept looking out for me

300
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,160
Han-kyul / and all of that just kept overlapping in my head

301
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,040
Han-kyul / I felt so sorry

302
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,640
Han-kyul / I couldn’t even look her in the eye properly

303
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,440
Han-kyul / and I just couldn’t stop crying

304
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,640
Han-kyul / She had lent me some clothes, so maybe that’s why

305
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,920
Han-kyul / I felt so bad wearing them that I just put them back

306
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,440
Han-kyul / and from that point on, the tears just wouldn’t stop

307
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,240
Mi-rang / Open the gift and check it—it’s really nice

308
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,160
Hee-young / Then who else besides me?

309
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,720
Jin-ah / That... well...

310
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,520
Jin-ah / Did you know I misunderstood the whole note thing?

311
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,400
Jin-ah / I thought it meant “write to someone you didn’t go on a date with”

312
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,720
Hee-young / So who was it?

313
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Jin-ah / What if I say it and it makes you feel bad?

314
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,400
Jin-ah / I don’t want to upset you

315
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,600
Hee-young / It’s weirder *not* to know

316
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,600
Jin-ah / Really?

317
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,480
Hee-young / It’s okay, I get it

318
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,840
Jin-ah / It’s not that I don’t want to say it, it’s just...

319
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,960
Jin-ah / It’s just...

320
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,520
Jin-ah / I didn’t write to two people

321
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,560
Jin-ah / I didn’t say “this person and that person”

322
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,920
Jin-ah / It wasn’t “you and someone else”

323
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,960
Jin-ah / I didn’t take that stance

324
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,920
Jin-ah / Earlier I told you...

325
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,200
Another deep talk coming;

326
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,480
Da-gyo / I’m gonna try this gel-type mask

327
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,640
Da-gyo / It says it soothes your skin

328
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,560
Da-gyo / We seriously need some soothing right now

329
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,720
Da-gyo / Whoa there’s a ton in one pack

330
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,880
Jin-ah / My throat’s really bad

331
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,960
Jin-ah / I’m going to sleep outside

332
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,200
Hee-young / Really?

333
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,040
Jin-ah / I think I’ll be coughing a lot

334
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,520
Jin-ah / I’ll turn the heater on and sleep

335
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,920
Da-gyo / If Jin-ah goes all in on you

336
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,800
Da-gyo / Are you okay with that?

337
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,320
Da-gyo / I’m really curious

338
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,560
Da-gyo / I want to know how you feel

339
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,720
Da-gyo / Maybe you’re just overthinking it?

340
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,160
Da-gyo / If you’re even a little curious and want to get to know her

341
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,240
Da-gyo / Then it’s okay to say you want to go on a date

342
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,160
Da-gyo / That’s totally fine

343
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,680
Hee-young / Yeah, I know...

344
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,480
Da-gyo / If you both date someone else

345
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,400
Da-gyo / Everything will naturally sort itself out

346
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,800
Hee-young / But what’s the point of dating

347
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,640
Hee-young / someone who’s not interested in me?

348
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,160
Da-gyo / So you should at least consider other people a little

349
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,600
Da-gyo / You should keep your mind open

350
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,920
Hee-young / But there’s no one interested in me

351
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,000
Da-gyo / Out of this many people, there’s bound to be someone

352
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,160
Da-gyo / Maybe someone just hasn’t said anything yet

353
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,400
Hee-young / There’s no one!

354
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,840
Da-gyo / You can’t say that for sure

355
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
Hee-young / I’m telling you, no one!

356
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,520
Hee-young / Seriously, no one!

357
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,560
Da-gyo / Why do you keep thinking that way?

358
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,840
Da-gyo / Why do you think that?

359
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,400
Da-gyo / Why do you think that?

360
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Da-gyo / Maybe someone’s just hiding it really well

361
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,440
Da-gyo / I do still want to go on a date with her

362
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,440
Da-gyo / I’ve been interested in Hee-young from the start

363
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,840
Da-gyo / But she really doesn’t seem to

364
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,320
Da-gyo / think that way at all

365
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,920
Da-gyo / I thought I’d shown my interest pretty clearly

366
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,040
Da-gyo / Did she notice... or not...

367
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,640
Da-gyo / Does she know, or is she really clueless...

368
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,160
Da-gyo / I really want to try going out with Hee-young

369
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,760
Jin-ah / I’m definitely doing a face mask tonight

370
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,400
Jin-ah / You didn’t do one yesterday, right?

371
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,560
Hee-young / Let’s all make sure to do one together tonight

372
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,040
Hee-young / I was planning to wear this

373
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,880
Jin-ah / What?

374
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,160
Jin-ah / Ack~ What did I just see?

375
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,360
Jin-ah / Isn’t that something straight out of *Single’s Inferno*?

376
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,520
Jin-ah / Like fighting over someone?

377
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,080
Hee-young / What are you talking about

378
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,760
Jin-ah / If a girl on fire shows up in a shirt like that

379
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,720
Jin-ah / You wouldn’t be able to focus on your date

380
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,560
Jin-ah / You’d just end up staring at her

381
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,080
Hee-young / Why would that happen?

382
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,040
Jin-ah / It’s way too distracting—it totally grabs your attention

383
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,200
Hee-young / What the...

384
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,280
Jin-ah / It’s scary

385
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,480
Hee-young / Scary?

386
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,360
Jin-ah / You should come alone, why are you bringing another woman?

387
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,720
Hee-young / It just shows my dark side...

388
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,160
Hee-young / But seriously, I looked really pretty

389
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,920
Jin-ah / I finally feel more emotionally settled and honestly

390
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,680
Jin-ah / I do feel ready to genuinely start getting to know someone

391
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,680
Da-gyo / This is sooo moisturizing

392
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,240
Jin-ah / It’s getting in your eyes?

393
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,320
Da-gyo / Yeah I’m not even joking

394
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,560
Da-gyo / I could probably wipe down my whole body with this

395
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,040
Jin-ah / Yeah, I can see that

396
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,840
Da-gyo / With this much ampoule

397
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,960
Da-gyo / I’m gonna put it on my legs too

398
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,680
Da-gyo / I have no idea what I’m doing today

399
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,440
Hee-young / Just like this...

400
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,040
Da-gyo / Huh?

401
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,320
Da-gyo / It’s really good—try it

402
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,760
Da-gyo / I used it before putting on makeup earlier

403
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,680
Da-gyo / The makeup went on so well

404
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,200
Da-gyo / You can see it, right?

405
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,880
Da-gyo / It’s a pad

406
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,040
Da-gyo / It’s not watery, it’s like full-on essence

407
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,680
Da-gyo / Super rich texture

408
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,360
Hee-young / Oh wow this

409
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,080
Da-gyo / Want me to open it?

410
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,760
Hee-young / How do you open this?

411
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,120
Da-gyo / You twist it to the side

412
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,960
Hee-young / Whoa you’re strong

413
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,200
Da-gyo / It’s super dry here so using that before makeup

414
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,680
Da-gyo / It’s super dry here so using that before makeup
Hee-young / Oh? It’s really thin

415
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,240
Da-gyo / The makeup goes on perfectly

416
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,280
Da-gyo / One is enough—you don’t need two

417
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,520
Hee-young / I just put it on my cheek like this?

418
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,520
Da-gyo / But be careful

419
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,320
Da-gyo / Because it’s so overly moisturizing

420
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,360
Da-gyo / Like I put it all over my body with one sheet

421
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,280
Da-gyo / You could totally use one for your whole body

422
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,600
Hee-young / The ampoule keeps dripping?

423
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,080
Hee-young / The ampoule keeps dripping?
Da-gyo / I’m not kidding

424
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,760
Da-gyo / I even put it on my legs earlier

425
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,720
Da-gyo / Then I finished up my face

426
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,960
Da-gyo / Let it sit for a bit

427
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,320
Da-gyo / Then patted it in with my hands

428
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,800
Da-gyo / The makeup went on perfectly after that

429
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,920
Da-gyo / Really? Before makeup?

430
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,440
Da-gyo / Yeah, I used one pad for my whole face and neck

431
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,560
Da-gyo / I put it on my neck too...

432
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,400
Da-gyo / Yup

433
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,080
Hee-young / My skin feels so moisturized

434
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,280
Hee-young / I’ve been so dry lately, you know?

435
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,600
Da-gyo / Your face looks super small right now

436
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,920
Da-gyo / That pad fits your whole cheek perfectly

437
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,960
Da-gyo / Totally fills it

438
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,560
Da-gyo / Seriously

439
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,720
Hee-young / Don’t make me laugh

440
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,400
Mi-rang / Hello there

441
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,480
Jin-ah / Who are you?

442
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,320
Hee-young / What are you doing here?

443
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,080
Mi-rang / I just thought I’d barge in

444
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,560
Hee-young / You never come by, what’s the occasion...

445
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,560
Da-gyo / Ah~ it was Mi-rang!

446
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,200
Da-gyo / Oh?! Perfume!

447
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,440
Da-gyo / Let’s spray it and head out in a bit

448
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,040
Da-gyo / I haven’t sprayed any perfume yet

449
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,400
Mi-rang / Exactly

450
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,760
Mi-rang / I brought it in case you wanted to spray it early

451
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,160
Hee-young / What’s that?

452
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,520
Da-gyo / The one we made at the workshop yesterday

453
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,320
Da-gyo / Spray it before you come out

454
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,840
Da-gyo / I only have 10 minutes left so I need to hurry

455
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,600
Da-gyo / See you in 10 minutes

456
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,680
Da-gyo / I’ve been curious what she wrote

457
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,880
Da-gyo / I’ve been curious what she wrote
Hee-young / Spray it

458
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,640
Da-gyo / Jeonju hanbok?

459
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,320
Da-gyo / What does that mean?

460
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,440
Da-gyo / What’s the meaning behind it?

461
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,400
Da-gyo / I need to ask what Jeonju hanbok means

462
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,000
Da-gyo / What is Jeonju hanbok?

463
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,640
Mi-rang / I just got my perfume delivered

464
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,160
Seo-yeon / From who?

465
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,080
Mi-rang / The one I made with Da-gyo yesterday

466
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,520
Mi-rang / We hadn’t exchanged them yet...

467
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,320
Seo-yeon / Do you like it?

468
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,680
Mi-rang / I wrote something on it actually

469
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Seo-yeon / What did you write?

470
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,520
Mi-rang / “First date on a snowy day”

471
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,560
Seo-yeon / So romantic

472
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,240
Mi-rang / The phrase “first date” just feels like

473
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,840
Mi-rang / it’ll leave a lasting memory

474
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,000
Mi-rang / Huh? It smells nice

475
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,200
Mi-rang / Anyone want to try smelling it?

476
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,320
Mi-rang / I’ll just lay it down here

477
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,600
Seo-yeon / For today...

478
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,320
Mi-rang / Huh? What’s this?

479
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,840
Seo-yeon / Choco ah-Cho

480
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,280
Mi-rang / Here’s the chocolate
Seo-yeon / Oh, that’s where it is

481
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Mi-rang / This tastes like an Americano to me

482
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,920
Mi-rang / Americano...

483
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,200
Mi-rang / Why are you moving so silently?

484
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,680
Han-kyul / What’s this?

485
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,760
Mi-rang / It’s a perk for people who show up early

486
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,280
Han-kyul / Oh? Nice!

487
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Mi-rang / It’s warm

488
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,240
Han-kyul / Thank you

489
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,320
Han-kyul / Oh? It’s tasty

490
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,800
Mi-rang / Mmm~? Tastes good

491
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,440
Han-kyul / Tastes like that Together ice cream milk flavor

492
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,760
Seo-yeon / Together ice cream milk flavor?

493
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,360
Mi-rang / Oh! Yeah yeah, it does

494
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,200
Seo-yeon / Sounds delicious

495
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,920
Mi-rang / If we leave it in the room

496
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,880
Mi-rang / I think it’ll make the room smell nice

497
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,560
Seo-yeon / That sounds amazing

498
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,760
Da-gyo / Hello there~

499
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,360
Hello~

500
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,520
Mi-rang / That’s my favorite color

501
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,320
Please read it

502
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,600
Da-gyo / It says the gift has arrived

503
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,000
Da-gyo / And to enjoy it

504
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,560
Jin-ah / A gift has arrived from someone

505
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,800
Jin-ah / Enjoy it everyone at the ToGetHer House

506
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,280
Jin-ah / We better behave then

507
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,080
Hee-young / We should say thank you before drinking...

508
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,480
Da-gyo / Say thank you before eating?

509
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,800
Da-gyo / Thank you~

510
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,200
Mi-rang / We need to pick two people to cook dinner tonight

511
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,160
Da-gyo / Oh right

512
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,440
Mi-rang / Should we do a random draw?

513
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,400
Mi-rang / What should we use?

514
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,920
Mi-rang / Should we use that pirate game?

515
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,680
Okay then this...

516
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,120
Ri-won / Okay then this...

517
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,880
Ri-won / Should we start with Han-kyul, who got picked yesterday?

518
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,480
You two from yesterday go first

519
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,240
Jin-ah / Pick a direction too—this way or that

520
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,960
Han-kyul / This way

521
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,680
Okay

522
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,200
Mi-rang / How? Like this?

523
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,520
Towards Mi-rang

524
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,080
Mi-rang / Oh like that?

525
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,200
This game scares me

526
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,560
Ri-won / But hey, you should be happy about this

527
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,080
Ri-won / Hee-young's the best cook here

528
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,440
Ri-won / We’re eating something delicious

529
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,720
Hee-young / I was so confident I wouldn’t get picked

530
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,480
Ri-won / I guess I just got lucky

531
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,240
Da-gyo / I’m scared too

532
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,280
Da-gyo / Oh~ it’s lasting a long time

533
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:52,400
Mi-rang / I have a feeling it’s gonna be me

534
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,760
Ri-won / I hope I get Mi-rang too

535
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,240
Mi-rang / The menu popped into my head as soon as I woke up

536
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,520
Ri-won / Are we having doenjang stew today?

537
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,720
Mi-rang / I really think it’s me

538
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,640
Mi-rang / When someone next to me said, “Are we having doenjang stew?”

539
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,200
Hee-young / You’re on stew duty

540
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,040
Mi-rang / Perfect

541
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:20,640
Hee-young / I’ll make something else

542
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,880
Mi-rang / I actually thought about that this morning

543
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,040
Mi-rang / If I make doenjang stew

544
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,800
Mi-rang / someone else can make another dish

545
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,680
Ri-won / Ah, I’m just gonna skip lunch

546
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
Da-gyo / Please take good care of us

547
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,360
I should’ve been fasting since yesterday

548
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,960
Min-woo / My eyes... now that it’s morning

549
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,320
Min-woo / I look like an owl

550
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,640
Min-woo / I’ve never seen my eyes this swollen

551
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
Hee-young / You should try the pad I recommended today

552
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,240
Hee-young / The one from earlier

553
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,240
Min-woo / Really?

554
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,560
Min-woo / Will it help with puffiness?

555
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,120
Ri-won / Oh?! Do those pads actually work?

556
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,440
Hee-young / I just woke up and my skin was so dry

557
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,000
Seo-yeon / 5 minutes? That’s long

558
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,240
Da-gyo / 5 minutes?

559
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,880
Han-kyul / Why is everything moving so fast today?

560
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,360
Ri-won / When I think about who I’d like to go on a date with

561
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,640
Ri-won / for me, it’s Han-kyul

562
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,360
Mi-rang / Yeah, I think I sent mine without hesitating even for a second

563
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,640
Mi-rang / Just straight away

564
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,480
Hee-young / I wrote down Jin-ah and sent it in

565
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,520
Min-woo / I'm staying in my room

566
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,600
Da-gyo / Then I’ll go to my room and think about it

567
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,720
Mi-rang / Am I the only one who sent it already?

568
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,160
Ri-won / Actually, I sent one too

569
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,360
Really?

570
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,840
Seo-yeon / I wanted to go on a date with Da-gyo, so I wrote Da-gyo

571
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,320
Mi-rang / Did you send it?

572
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,000
Min-woo / Huh? I’m still hanging my clothes

573
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,480
Mi-rang / Why so slow

574
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,000
Mi-rang / I actually had a similar dream

575
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,680
Mi-rang / But this isn’t something you can solve by thinking too hard

576
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,080
Mi-rang / This isn’t something you can solve by thinking too hard
Min-woo / That’s why my luck’s bad today

577
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,600
Min-woo / Just go with who you want to be with

578
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,360
Seo-yeon / But what if it’s not a match...?

579
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,760
Min-woo / What happens if it’s not?

580
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,160
Mi-rang / Then I guess we just stay here

581
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,440
Min-woo / That’s not so bad

582
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,520
Seo-yeon / I don’t think that’s bad either

583
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,880
Min-woo / Flirting indoors isn’t a bad idea either

584
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,360
Min-woo / I picked the person I really wanted

585
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,840
Min-woo / I sent it to Han-kyul

586
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,720
Min-woo / Han-kyul

587
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,280
Han-kyul / I wrote down Jin-ah

588
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,800
Han-kyul / The person I wanted to date

589
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,760
Han-kyul / It wasn’t exactly about attraction, more like curiosity?

590
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,760
Ri-won / Han-kyul, did you get a note yesterday?

591
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,360
Han-kyul / Me?

592
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,320
Ri-won / Yeah

593
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,640
Han-kyul / Yeah, just one

594
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,400
Ri-won / Do you think you’ve ever gotten a note from the person you sent one to?

595
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Ri-won / Like, at the same time?

596
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,000
Han-kyul / No

597
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,840
Han-kyul / Did I keep sending them to the same person?

598
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,080
Han-kyul / No, I sent it to someone else, and also

599
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,920
Han-kyul / I’m 100% sure it wasn’t from them

600
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,320
Ri-won / Then did you send it to different people each time? All three times?

601
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,920
Han-kyul / No, twice was the same person

602
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,240
Ri-won / The first and second time?

603
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,560
Han-kyul / I couldn’t send it to the first person again on the second and third
Ri-won / So someone else?

604
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,680
Han-kyul / The second and third were the same...
Ri-won / Ah, so the second and third were the same person

605
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,240
Han-kyul / Yeah...

606
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,600
Ri-won / Then why did it change? From the first to

607
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,440
Ri-won / the second and third being the same person?

608
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Han-kyul / Honestly, the first one was totally just

609
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,440
Ri-won / Based on looks?

610
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,320
Han-kyul / Yeah, I picked based on visuals, like a visual pick?

611
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,040
Ri-won / What about the second and third?

612
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,440
Han-kyul / The second and third?

613
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,160
Han-kyul / That was more like, in terms of appearance

614
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:34,560
Han-kyul / it kind of matched the type of person I’ve dated before

615
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,800
Ri-won / Who could it be?

616
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,000
Ri-won / I think Han-kyul...

617
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Ri-won / The first one seems like Da-gyo

618
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,320
Ri-won / but I have no idea about the second and third?

619
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,840
Han-kyul / I don’t think I should say

620
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,520
Ri-won / Of course you shouldn’t

621
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,000
Han-kyul / I’m really curious about the dating criteria

622
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,280
Ri-won / Don’t we only go out if we get matched?

623
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,160
Han-kyul / Then why are we...

624
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,520
Han-kyul / Why am I getting ready right now?

625
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,320
Da-gyo / Did anyone here send their text yet?

626
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,600
Da-gyo / Did anyone send a text?

627
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,920
Da-gyo / Did you send yours?

628
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,800
Da-gyo / Just now?

629
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,560
Da-gyo / You’re already getting ready in your room

630
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,840
Jin-ah / Honestly, I think my hair doesn’t look good today

631
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,720
Jin-ah / I should just stay home

632
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,840
Jin-ah / I should just stay home
Da-gyo / Did you send it?

633
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,200
Da-gyo / Everyone got theirs in

634
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,280
Jin-ah / What’s wrong with staying in?

635
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,600
Jin-ah / If I don’t get picked, I’ll just mentally prepare

636
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,120
Da-gyo / You haven’t gone out yet

637
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,320
So how is it?

638
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:24,880
Da-gyo / Well, you know...

639
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,920
Jin-ah / It’s not bad, right?

640
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,720
Da-gyo / It’s not bad

641
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,040
Jin-ah / Is it just like this?

642
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,640
Jin-ah / Like chatting among ourselves?

643
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,680
Da-gyo / We just hang out with the others who didn’t go out

644
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,760
Jin-ah / You know that vibe

645
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,280
Da-gyo / And aside from that

646
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,000
Da-gyo / there’s fun stuff going on here too

647
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,120
Jin-ah / What did you spray?

648
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,320
Hee-young / This fixer spray

649
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,160
Jin-ah / I keep wanting your stuff

650
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,680
Jin-ah / Should I not tie my hair up like this?

651
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,320
Da-gyo / Half-up?

652
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
Jin-ah / Yeah, should I not do this half-up?

653
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Jin-ah / It’s kind of too much, right?

654
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,400
Hee-young / No it’s not~

655
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:49,880
Jin-ah / Really?

656
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,520
Hee-young / Yeah

657
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,200
Hee-young / If you let it down

658
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,080
Jin-ah / Will it look rounder?

659
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,040
Hee-young / It’ll look like a job interview

660
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,040
Jin-ah / Really? Should I change my outfit then?

661
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,040
Da-gyo / I think I ended up writing Hee-young after all that thinking

662
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,640
Da-gyo / I feel like I’d regret it if I didn’t get to know her

663
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,160
Mi-rang / But in my dream last night

664
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,920
Min-woo / In your dream?

665
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,880
Mi-rang / I dreamed about Da-gyo

666
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,520
Min-woo / Oh really?

667
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,840
Mi-rang / I can’t remember clearly, but Da-gyo

668
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,400
Mi-rang / broke a promise with me and made plans with someone else?

669
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,760
Mi-rang / Something like that

670
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,840
Mi-rang / And we had a huge fight about it in the dream

671
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,360
Mi-rang / But when I woke up, I couldn’t stop thinking about it

672
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,040
Min-woo / But somehow

673
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,480
Min-woo / being here kind of feels like...

674
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,960
Min-woo / there might be a fight or something coming

675
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,080
Min-woo / Like, “Didn’t you feel the same way I did?”

676
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,000
Min-woo / It might lead to something like that

677
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,840
Mi-rang / I don’t know, but maybe because of the dream

678
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,400
Mi-rang / I feel like I’m just going to keep charging forward

679
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,640
Min-woo / Oh really?

680
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,280
Han-kyul / Am I going?

681
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,600
Mi-rang / Uh... looks like it?

682
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,280
Ri-won / Looks like you're going on a date, Han-kyul?

683
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,680
Um... me?

684
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,760
Did you get matched?

685
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,160
Min-woo / I don’t know yet

686
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,240
Min-woo / I’ll head out and find out

687
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,200
Hee-young / Bye

688
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,600
Jin-ah / Why? What is it?

689
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,920
Hee-young / Have fun...

690
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,880
Jin-ah / I think I know what this is

691
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,320
Jin-ah / Don’t misunderstand

692
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,320
Jin-ah / I think I’m going out now because of you

693
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,120
Jin-ah / I really think I’m going out because of you

694
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,080
Hee-young / Why me?

695
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,560
Hee-young / Why are you leaving because of me?

696
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,800
Jin-ah / Because you got matched with someone else

697
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,000
Jin-ah / Isn't that why I'm going?

698
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,640
Hee-young / You're going because you got matched with someone else

699
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,680
Hee-young / You're going because you got matched with someone else
Jin-ah / I stupidly wrote you down

700
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,280
Jin-ah / I think that’s what happened?

701
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,480
Jin-ah / I wrote you down

702
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,520
Jin-ah / Bye, I’m heading out

703
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,840
Da-gyo / Why?

704
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
Jin-ah / I’m told to go on a date

705
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,480
Da-gyo / Really?

706
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,880
Jin-ah / Yeah

707
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,640
Da-gyo / Do you know who you’re going with?

708
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,880
Jin-ah / No idea

709
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,720
Da-gyo / Really?

710
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,000
Hee-young / As Jin-ah was leaving

711
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Hee-young / she said something blaming me

712
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,960
Hee-young / She said she was going on a date

713
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,320
Hee-young / with someone else because of me

714
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,640
Hee-young / But I just couldn’t understand what she meant

715
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,000
Hee-young / Because I actually chose Jin-ah

716
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
Hee-young / So I was really confused

717
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,720
Da-gyo / Who do you think Jin-ah is out with?

718
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,400
Hee-young / I wonder too

719
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,240
Da-gyo / I’m curious

720
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,360
Hee-young / I don’t get it right now

721
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,720
Hee-young / I don’t get what she said either

722
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,200
Da-gyo / Did you choose Jin-ah?

723
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,440
Da-gyo / Ah

724
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,000
Da-gyo / So you only want to write someone if you’re sure?

725
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,480
Hee-young / Yeah, but even when I do, it keeps ending up like this

726
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,240
Hee-young / And suddenly she said she wrote me this time

727
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,160
Da-gyo / Today? Just now?

728
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,200
Hee-young / So now I’m like, “What am I supposed to do?”

729
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,040
Hee-young / Is she thinking I didn’t write her?

730
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,560
Hee-young / Or is she just lying?

731
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,880
Hee-young / I’m just like, “What is this?”

732
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,600
Da-gyo / She said she wrote you?

733
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,760
Da-gyo / Then how is she going with someone else?

734
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,840
Hee-young / Exactly, she was like

735
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,120
Hee-young / “So I’m going out because of you,” like that

736
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,440
Hee-young / I was like, “What are you talking about?”

737
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,360
Hee-young / You’re the one who picked someone else

738
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,560
Hee-young / That’s why you’re going out

739
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,320
Da-gyo / Huh? What is this?

740
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,280
Hee-young / Did you write Mi-rang?

741
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,040
Da-gyo / Did I write Mi-rang?

742
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,080
Da-gyo / No

743
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,760
Da-gyo / I didn’t write Mi-rang

744
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,880
Da-gyo / Why?

745
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,040
Hee-young / Who did you write?

746
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,760
Hee-young / Who did you write?
Da-gyo / Who did I write?

747
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,880
Da-gyo / I can’t tell you that

748
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,040
Da-gyo / I really don’t know

749
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,200
Da-gyo / I honestly have no idea

750
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,080
Da-gyo / This is a lot harder than I thought

751
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,360
Mi-rang / Please don’t leave me behind at the end

752
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,680
Ri-won / Oh, me? Me?

753
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,200
Mi-rang / You never know, you might get in the car

754
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,520
Mi-rang / and I might be sitting right behind you

755
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,880
Mi-rang / Oh, are we heading out?

756
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,560
Seo-yeon / Yeah

757
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,760
Mi-rang / Ugh, I think I’m the only one not going

758
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,320
Hee-young / You going?

759
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,120
Da-gyo / Yup

760
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,560
Hee-young / Bye

761
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,360
Da-gyo / Who are you going on a date with?

762
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,400
Hee-young / With the person you picked, probably

763
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,560
Da-gyo / With the person I picked?

764
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,440
Hee-young / Yeah, if it matched, that’s why you’re going out

765
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,240
Da-gyo / That’s not how I see it though

766
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,600
Hee-young / Ugh... why are you all like this...

767
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,120
Ri-won / Babe Team? Baby Team? What is this?

768
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,240
Ri-won / What? Huh? Oh!

769
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,560
Ri-won / What even is this?

770
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,520
Ri-won / Huh?

771
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,440
Ri-won / I just thought, 'What is this?'

772
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,160
Ri-won / Since it’s a date no matter what

773
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,080
Ri-won / I thought it’d be a more romantic location

774
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,000
Ri-won / But it was a kart track and I was freezing...

775
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,680
Ri-won / I was really thrown off

776
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,240
Ri-won / Am I the first one?

777
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,640
Ri-won / Is that why no one’s here?

778
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,240
Ri-won / Ah...

779
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,920
Ri-won / Then why are there four karts?

780
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,400
Ri-won / There are eight people though

781
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,880
Ri-won / Wait, what? Hold on...

782
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,280
Ri-won / What do the message and the card have to do with this?

783
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,280
Ri-won / Hurry up!

784
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,480
Ri-won / Hurry up, Son Min-woo!

785
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,640
Ri-won / Hurry up!

786
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,360
Ri-won / Min-woo~ What did you pick?

787
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,080
Min-woo / Me?

788
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,800
Ri-won / Yeah

789
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,080
Min-woo / Why?

790
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,040
Ri-won / Why won't you tell me...

791
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,640
Ri-won / It's either "baby Team" or "babe Team" anyway

792
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,800
Min-woo / Do I look like I’d pick "baby"?

793
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,280
Ri-won / You could’ve picked "baby"

794
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,240
Min-woo / Let's go for a round

795
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,880
Min-woo / I'll stay right here

796
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,600
Min-woo / I chose Han-kyul

797
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,320
Min-woo / But Ri-won was waiting

798
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,520
Min-woo / So at that moment, I was like...

799
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,800
Min-woo / I really need to win this somehow

800
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,800
Min-woo / All I could think was, "Ri-won, she's it"

801
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,720
Min-woo / Wow~ I really switched to here!

802
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,160
Min-woo / I switched because of the curve

803
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,840
Ri-won / You should’ve picked first then

804
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,400
Min-woo / Then I’ll just take this one

805
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,880
Ri-won / Fine, go ahead

806
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,120
Ri-won / Drivers always end up coming this way

807
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,720
Ri-won / All the way to the end, the worst spot

808
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:34,160
Han-kyul / There were six cards

809
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,920
Han-kyul / Split between Baby & Babe

810
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,400
Han-kyul / I mean, obviously I'm a baby, but if I picked Baby

811
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,640
Han-kyul / It felt like I was just stamping it in, so...

812
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,320
Han-kyul / I chose Babe

813
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,960
Han-kyul / What? Han-kyul?

814
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,360
Ri-won / Did you pick Baby or Babe?

815
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,000
Han-kyul / I picked Babe

816
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,920
Ri-won / What did you pick?

817
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,160
Min-woo / Me?

818
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,560
Min-woo / I picked Baby

819
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,720
Min-woo / Come over here, Han-kyul

820
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,600
Han-kyul / Wait a sec, what is this?

821
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,160
Ri-won / What? I guess "baby" and "babe" didn’t even matter

822
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,880
Ri-won / Then why did they make us pick?

823
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,320
Min-woo / I'm sure there's a reason

824
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,480
Min-woo / Maybe it's something couples are supposed to do

825
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,120
Ri-won / Couples?

826
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,240
Ri-won / Who's a couple exactly?

827
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,440
Min-woo / Huh?

828
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,720
Ri-won / Who is it?

829
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,640
Jin-ah / It’s me, why?

830
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,360
Ri-won / Oh, it's Jin-ah?

831
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,200
Ri-won / So it’s four of us?

832
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,400
Ri-won / Seriously?

833
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,080
Jin-ah / What’s your pick, Ri-won?

834
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,280
Ri-won / I picked Baby

835
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,800
Jin-ah / Right, you like being Baby

836
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,640
Jin-ah / I’m Baby too

837
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,440
Han-kyul / Am I the only Babe?

838
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,440
Han-kyul / Oh, Babe

839
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,320
Jin-ah / Two people picked Babe

840
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,800
Jin-ah / One person picked Baby

841
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,880
Jin-ah / So I went with Baby

842
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,280
Ri-won / Wait, then where’s the other "Babe"?

843
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,280
Ri-won / Two people picked "Babe"?

844
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,040
Ri-won / Oh, two of you did?

845
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,920
Ri-won / You both picked "Babe"?

846
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,560
Ri-won / What the heck~ You were pretending you picked "baby," Min-woo!

847
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,920
Jin-ah / Oh really? That’s why it got confusing?

848
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,720
Ri-won / Seriously, what is with him?

849
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,480
Min-woo / Who told you to believe it so easily?

850
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,440
Min-woo / Just 'cause a girl said it?

851
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,240
Ri-won / I’m just naturally trusting, okay?

852
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,640
Jin-ah / I figured this must be the outcasts' group

853
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,040
Jin-ah / Thought Hee-young didn’t pick me

854
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,960
Jin-ah / That Hee-young didn’t pick me?

855
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,520
Jin-ah / Thinking that made me a little sad

856
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,480
Jin-ah / But also felt kind of relieved

857
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,040
Ri-won / Wait, why just the four of us... What about the other four?

858
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,120
Han-kyul / I think this is

859
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,240
Han-kyul / Like “the unmatched people go roll around together”

860
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,400
Han-kyul / Isn’t that it?

861
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,760
Jin-ah / Really?

862
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,920
Ri-won / Ah! Ah! That must be it!

863
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,760
Min-woo / So this is the punishment?

864
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,800
Ri-won / This is a punishment

865
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,440
Ri-won / Oh, it’s a sad, tearful racing punishment

866
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,080
Ri-won / The matched couples are probably somewhere warm and nice

867
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,080
Ri-won / having a delicious meal and enjoying their date

868
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,160
Jin-ah / So what, we don’t even get to eat? We just starve?

869
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,800
Ri-won / Maybe after the racing

870
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,160
Ri-won / something will happen?

871
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,920
Ri-won / There are only four karts, so I guess we’re the last group

872
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,320
Ri-won / This is driving me crazy

873
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,400
Hee-young / A cart?

874
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,360
Ri-won / What the heck! Why are you here?

875
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,560
Ri-won / There are only four karts!

876
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,600
Then what do we do?

877
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,640
What the...

878
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:32,120
Hee-young / Are you an outcast here?

879
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,080
Jin-ah / We were seriously thinking we were the outcasts

880
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,160
Ri-won / Five... There are five of us

881
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,720
Hee-young / What’s going on?

882
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,200
Hee-young / Because of what we talked about yesterday

883
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,120
Hee-young / I thought she would’ve picked me

884
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,520
Hee-young / And she even said she picked me as she left

885
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:49,000
Hee-young / If that’s true, then there must be some other reason

886
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,040
Hee-young / That we’re here like this

887
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,920
Hee-young / Or maybe she lied

888
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,120
Jin-ah / First I was like, “What’s going on?”

889
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,560
Jin-ah / But I was glad to see her

890
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,000
Jin-ah / Did she choose me or not? Now I’m not sure

891
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,480
Jin-ah / She was like “Hi hi”

892
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,640
Jin-ah / But Hee-young didn’t even look at me

893
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,840
Jin-ah / Huh? What’s going on?

894
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,720
Jin-ah / Seriously, 100 question marks in my head

895
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,640
Jin-ah / That’s what I was thinking

896
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,280
Jin-ah / Oh? Everyone’s coming!

897
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,120
Ri-won / Huh? So four wasn’t the last group? What’s going on?

898
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,200
Hee-young / What is this? A loser revival round?

899
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,240
Jin-ah / This is so confusing

900
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,000
Ri-won / Huh? Isn’t that Da-gyo over there?

901
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,040
Huh?

902
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,400
Ri-won / Oh what! We're all doing this together~

903
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,680
Ri-won / I’m so glad the two of them aren’t going on a date lol

904
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,600
Ri-won / Looks like all 8 of us are coming

905
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,680
Seo-yeon / Then Da-gyo must be on the “baby” team too

906
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,600
Ri-won / Hi~ Welcome!
Seo-yeon / Hi baby~

907
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,680
Da-gyo / I didn’t know! I thought we’d be separated!

908
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,680
Ri-won / I didn’t know either

909
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,840
Da-gyo / Oh... this kind of thing...

910
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,720
Jin-ah / What? She walked in like “Oh no...”

911
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,320
Jin-ah / Da-gyo, are you Baby?

912
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,640
Da-gyo / Huh?

913
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,920
Jin-ah / Sorry, but honestly

914
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,080
Jin-ah / We already all showed our picks

915
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,320
Jin-ah / Why are you trying so hard to hide it?

916
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,600
Ri-won / I just assumed it was "baby"—that’s the only one I saw

917
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,040
Da-gyo / I was baby

918
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,920
Jin-ah / How are you this transparent?

919
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,480
Da-gyo / I was Baby

920
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,280
Da-gyo / What is this? What’s happening?

921
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,520
Da-gyo / I had no idea

922
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,560
Da-gyo / Things are really tangled up

923
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,840
Da-gyo / I thought, “Wow, things got really tangled”

924
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,760
Da-gyo / That day was just so absurd

925
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,480
Da-gyo / I was too busy trying to understand it all

926
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,080
Ri-won / Doesn’t this mean none of us got matched?

927
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:20,800
Seo-yeon / That’s what I’m saying

928
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,800
Min-woo / The person I wanted

929
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,560
Min-woo / And the person they wanted

930
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,640
Min-woo / Aren’t they all gathered here?

931
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,280
Jin-ah / But why is one person missing?

932
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,720
Ri-won / Why isn’t Mi-rang coming?

933
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,840
Hee-young / Is this a scramble match?

934
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,080
Han-kyul / She probably got the most texts

935
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,760
Han-kyul / Maybe she's doing something solo? Like a royal game?

936
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,520
Ri-won / Isn’t it kind of weird if Mi-rang doesn’t show up?

937
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,000
Ri-won / Anyway, whatever this is, we have to win

938
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,240
Ri-won / Winning is a must

939
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,000
Hee-young / No matter what...

940
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,640
Seo-yeon / A date ticket... Is it a date ticket?

941
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,760
Ri-won / Yeah, I think it’s something like a date ticket

942
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,640
Ri-won / We have to win this like our lives depend on it

943
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,960
Ri-won / Who’s on the “baby” team?

944
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,200
Ri-won / All the babies are going down!

945
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,120
Seo-yeon / Hmm... Me... I'm savage!

946
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,720
Da-gyo / Heyyy~

947
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,960
Jin-ah / Welcome~

948
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,880
Ri-won / Oh? Mi-rang... Mi-rang

949
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,280
Seo-yeon / Oh! Mi-rang, the baby~

950
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,760
Seo-yeon / The royal baby is arriving!

951
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,120
Ri-won / Hey there, Super Baby!

952
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,040
Mi-rang / Why am I a baby?

953
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,800
Ri-won / You picked the one that was left, that’s why

954
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,440
Mi-rang / What the heck!

955
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,400
Mi-rang / Seeing 7 people lined up

956
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,880
Mi-rang / I was like, "What is this?"

957
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,560
Mi-rang / I realized it was a really complicated situation

958
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,640
Mi-rang / Da-gyo and I picked at the same time

959
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,520
Mi-rang / So someone must’ve liked one of us

960
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,520
or maybe both

961
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,360
Mi-rang / That’s why it got all tangled up like this

962
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,760
Mi-rang / I was most curious about who picked Da-gyo

963
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,440
Mi-rang / That was what I wanted to know most

964
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,640
Mi-rang / Something’s here!

965
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,040
Mi-rang / Check your texts

966
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,800
Seo-yeon / Check your messages~

967
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,640
Da-gyo / You automatically get matched with whoever chose you

968
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,280
Han-kyul / People who chose the same keyword are on the same team

969
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,840
Han-kyul / Compete in a kart game

970
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,400
Mi-rang / The winning team gets a team date

971
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,880
Ri-won / A chance to go on a team date?

972
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:09,280
Babe Team, come over here

973
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,240
Jin-ah / Everyone looks like a baby, so they’re all Baby

974
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,520
Ri-won / I don’t look like a baby though

975
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,720
Da-gyo / Feels like a baby... definitely baby vibes

976
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,240
Mi-rang / I don’t care if we win or lose

977
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,800
Mi-rang / I’m just glad I’m on the same team as Da-gyo

978
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,120
Mi-rang / That I can go on a date with her

979
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,640
Mi-rang / That made me happy, I wasn’t worried

980
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,600
Han-kyul / Are you good at this?

981
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,240
Hee-young / This stuff? Never done it

982
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,240
Han-kyul / You seem like you’d be good...

983
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,000
Seo-yeon / But on the other team

984
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,040
Seo-yeon / I think they’ve got some good drivers

985
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,320
Hee-young / Really?
Seo-yeon / On that team...

986
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,080
Hee-young / Who?

987
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,320
Ri-won / Who?

988
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,320
Ri-won / Bring it on!

989
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:48,360
Hee-young / We need to show dominance, why so quiet?

990
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,000
Seo-yeon / I know for a fact there are at least 3 good drivers over there

991
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,400
Three of them for sure

992
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,680
Hee-young / No way!

993
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,520
Hee-young / We can do this!

994
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,960
Hee-young / We have to win that date!

995
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,200
Min-woo / So what should we do?

996
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,000
Seo-yeon / You and I need to split up, Han-kyul

997
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,120
Seo-yeon / We have to separate

998
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,760
Min-woo / Right

999
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,960
Min-woo / If there’s a reward, we need to win it

1000
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,800
Min-woo / So the better odds...

1001
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,000
Min-woo / Anyway, I have Han-kyul on my team, who I wanted

1002
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,760
Min-woo / I wanted to impress her and win too

1003
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,440
Min-woo / I wanted to lead the team well

1004
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,520
Min-woo / I don't know if that would leave an impression

1005
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,920
Min-woo / But that’s what I wanted to show

1006
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:22,880
Min-woo / Like leadership that brings us to victory

1007
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,520
Mi-rang!

1008
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,800
You have to win!

1009
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,240
Mi-rang / Don’t pressure me!

1010
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,000
Mi-rang / But isn’t it harder for people with long legs?

1011
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,280
Da-gyo / I’m scared~

1012
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:41,160
Da-gyo / I’m scared!

1013
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,760
Hee-young / Seo-yeon! Drive safe

1014
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,600
Seo-yeon / Okay~ safety first!

1015
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,800
Mi-rang / What the? What is this?

1016
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,200
Da-gyo / This is fun~

1017
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,640
Han-kyul / But wow, they're overwhelmingly fast

1018
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,120
Hee-young / Whoa, so fast

1019
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:16,880
Ri-won / The speed’s different for each of those machines

1020
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,440
Hee-young / Maybe they just didn't press as hard

1021
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,680
Jin-ah / I was too scared
Hee-young / Too nervous

1022
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,360
Ri-won / Mi-rang!

1023
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,920
Ri-won / Were you too scared to step on the gas or what?!

1024
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,200
Bbabbarabbarabam!

1025
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,320
Ri-won / Step on it! Go!

1026
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,640
Ri-won / Step on it! I said go!

1027
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,560
Min-woo / Why is that one so fast?

1028
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,120
Da-gyo / This is hilarious

1029
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,240
Da-gyo / Why is it so fast

1030
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,000
Jin-ah / Hey hey Park Da-gyo!

1031
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,560
Ri-won / You’re driving a farm tractor!

1032
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,040
Ri-won / Is that a tractor or what?

1033
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,040
Seo-yeon / When the sun rises, will you come to me~

1034
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,200
Seo-yeon / But if the wind blows, you’ll be gone again~

1035
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,240
Hee-young / Min-woo~ Step on it!
Ri-won / They’re catching up! Hurry!

1036
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,360
Hee-young / Go faster!

1037
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,480
Min-woo / This one’s just slower, seriously

1038
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,720
Ri-won / Da-gyo, what are you doing?!

1039
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,560
Ri-won / Is that a stroller or what?

1040
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,760
Da-gyo / What did you say?

1041
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,280
Ri-won / That’s totally a stroller~ a baby walker~!

1042
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,200
Ri-won / Kim Mi-rang!

1043
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,880
Ri-won / They’re catching up! Step on it!

1044
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,360
Ri-won / Don’t look behind!

1045
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,160
Ri-won / Hey, behind you—beside you!

1046
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,000
Ri-won / Faster!

1047
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,520
Mi-rang / Is it over?

1048
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,000
Mi-rang / Huh? What? What is this?

1049
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,920
Ri-won / We won! We won!

1050
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,840
Jin-ah / We won? Are you sure?

1051
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,920
Jin-ah / We won? Are you sure?
Ri-won / We won!

1052
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,480
Hee-young / Check the video

1053
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,520
Ri-won / No, we won
Hee-young / Let’s check the footage

1054
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,000
Mi-rang / Hey! When did you catch up?

1055
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,560
Mi-rang / I seriously… I thought you were way back...

1056
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,000
Mi-rang / I thought you were still way over there

1057
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,200
Seo-yeon / At least we weren’t last
Mi-rang / Yeah~ we did well

1058
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,840
Jin-ah / Good job, good job

1059
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:44,120
Ri-won / Good job, Mi-rang~

1060
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,320
Jin-ah / No but we barely won, it was so close

1061
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,680
I kept yelling, you know~

1062
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,760
Mi-rang / I did see you, but Min-woo was over there

1063
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,040
Ri-won / I told you I was right behind you

1064
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,160
Ri-won / I kept saying I was right behind you
Jin-ah / But seriously, you won by the tiniest margin

1065
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,840
Hee-young / No way, we won

1066
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,680
Hee-young / We passed first at the end

1067
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,840
Hee-young / We definitely won

1068
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,560
Min-woo / I crossed first

1069
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,080
Ri-won / We won

1070
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,760
Ri-won / We won
Mi-rang / We won?

1071
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,320
Jin-ah / I'm not just arguing, I really think—

1072
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,360
Ri-won / We really won

1073
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,920
Min-woo / No, let's just go with what they say

1074
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,560
Min-woo / The camera doesn't lie

1075
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,080
Hee-young / I'm telling you, we turned it around

1076
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,640
Jin-ah / Just watch, see for yourself
Ri-won / No way

1077
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,480
Ri-won / Watch me, I’ve got this

1078
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,160
Da-gyo / I think it was fun to watch

1079
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,480
Da-gyo / Even the heated atmosphere

1080
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,240
Da-gyo / It felt like everyone was serious

1081
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:21,240
Min-woo / If you release the brake hard—

1082
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,240
Min-woo / It speeds up again like a booster

1083
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,040
Hee-young / Ah~ Like Kart Rider!

1084
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,720
Min-woo / So it’s not about how you start

1085
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,400
Mi-rang / Constant braking doesn’t help either

1086
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,280
Mi-rang / When you turn a curve, the key is—

1087
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,560
Mi-rang / Stay as close as possible to the inside

1088
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,760
Mi-rang / And let off the gas just a bit

1089
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,160
Jin-ah / Don’t go all wild with it

1090
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,080
Jin-ah / This kart game was about winning love

1091
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,920
Jin-ah / As I grabbed the wheel

1092
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,440
Jin-ah / I could feel my blood pumping

1093
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,400
Jin-ah / I realized I really am someone who fights for love

1094
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,760
Jin-ah / Doing something for the sake of love

1095
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,360
Jin-ah / I thought, “Wow, this gives me such good energy”

1096
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,680
Jin-ah / As expected, Kim Jin-ah, lover girl

1097
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,360
Jin-ah / Ri-won!

1098
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,960
Jin-ah / You can do it!

1099
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,760
Da-gyo / Fighting!

1100
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,960
Da-gyo / Fighting!
Seo-yeon / Fighting!

1101
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,720
Mi-rang / Fighting! Baby Team, let’s go!

1102
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,520
Seo-yeon / Go Babe Team!

1103
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,680
Seo-yeon / Go Babe Team!
Hee-young / Let’s go, Babe!

1104
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:13,880
Min-woo / Go Babe!

1105
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,320
Seo-yeon / Run, Babe!

1106
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,960
Hee-young / Go, Babe!

1107
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,960
Mi-rang / Ri-won, if you lose, don’t even think about coming back

1108
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,200
Da-gyo / Everyone’s gone mad with love

1109
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,560
Seo-yeon / You love-crazed women!

1110
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,200
Da-gyo / "Ri-won is really serious about this"

1111
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,120
Da-gyo / The game is way too intense

1112
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,480
Da-gyo / I was watching with Hee-young, going back and forth

1113
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,040
Da-gyo / Everyone’s dead serious. They’re crazy about dating

1114
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,480
Ri-won / Move! Move!

1115
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,360
Ri-won / I said move it, get out of the way!

1116
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,120
Whoa~

1117
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,760
Da-gyo / Wow, Ri-won is seriously no joke

1118
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,400
Ri-won / Han-kyul!

1119
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,200
Han-kyul / I knew it’d go this way

1120
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,200
Han-kyul / I passed the written test but failed the driving test

1121
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,320
Han-kyul / So I thought, "Wow, I really shouldn’t be driving"

1122
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,000
Jin-ah / Hey!  No, I mean, Ri-won!

1123
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,760
Mi-rang / Oh! I think that’s Ri-won

1124
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,920
Mi-rang / Oh! I think that’s Ri-won
Da-gyo / Ri-won?

1125
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:34,640
Let’s go!

1126
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,320
Mi-rang / Wow, that’s our team! Let’s go!

1127
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,920
Da-gyo / Wow~ All of us are on the same team

1128
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,240
Seo-yeon / What are you doing, Babe?

1129
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,080
Min-woo / Accelerating

1130
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:41,960
Seo-yeon / Babe!

1131
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,360
Min-woo / Okay, we got this

1132
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,200
Jin-ah / Ri-won, it’s me~

1133
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,320
Jin-ah / Ugh! This speed is totally different!

1134
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,160
Seo-yeon / Run, Babe!

1135
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,800
Min-woo / Where’s Han-kyul?

1136
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,120
Han-kyul / Oh seriously...

1137
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,360
Han-kyul / I’m gonna crash again

1138
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,480
Han-kyul / I'm done!

1139
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,800
No!

1140
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,160
Min-woo / You know, right? You get it?

1141
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,920
Da-gyo / How did it end up like this?

1142
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,240
Ri-won / This thing is way too slow

1143
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:17,360
Min-woo / It's not slow, you just didn’t know how to do it
Ri-won / No, it’s really slow

1144
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,560
Min-woo / You have to let go of the brake and then accelerate

1145
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,640
Min-woo / That’s the trick

1146
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,800
Da-gyo / Everyone's overheated

1147
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,680
Da-gyo / They're all way too hyped up

1148
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,840
Da-gyo / Totally fired up
Seo-yeon / Seriously

1149
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,560
Da-gyo / Everyone’s love crazy

1150
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,280
Da-gyo / They're obsessed with dating

1151
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,600
Hee-young / I finally got the hang of it
Min-woo / You get what I was saying, right?

1152
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,680
Hee-young / But I was stuck at the start too

1153
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,080
Hee-young / I was tied up in the beginning
Min-woo / Now you know what I meant

1154
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,000
Min-woo / Good job! Come here

1155
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,880
Hee-young / I was seriously moved! I sped up at the end

1156
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,720
Min-woo / It was thrilling, right?

1157
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,000
Hee-young / Seriously!!

1158
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:45,240
Min-woo / I still don’t know if I won

1159
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,560
Ri-won / I think each kart had a different speed

1160
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,480
Ri-won / But I mean, what can you do?

1161
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,920
Ri-won / I was just a bit upset about losing and all

1162
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:59,120
Ri-won / I was kinda frustrated, but it is what it is

1163
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,080
Hee-young / Who is that?
Min-woo / Ugh you're so cute I can’t stand it

1164
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,640
Hee-young / Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

1165
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,120
Hee-young / She crashed over there earlier

1166
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,320
Hee-young / She crashed over there earlier
Jin-ah / Baby~ you crashed?

1167
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,080
Hee-young / That’s why I was worried at first

1168
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,320
Hee-young / I was worried from the beginning
Min-woo / Where did you hit?

1169
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,560
Hee-young / She hit the tire over there and went into it

1170
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,480
Min-woo / Really?

1171
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,000
Seo-yeon / Babe, come here

1172
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,840
Jin-ah / You crashed?

1173
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,680
Han-kyul / I crashed twice

1174
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,840
Jin-ah / Really? Good job, good job

1175
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,520
Jin-ah / Crashing is a big deal

1176
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,960
Hee-young / Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

1177
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,760
Min-woo / Did you hit your head?

1178
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,040
Han-kyul / No, no, I didn’t hit my head

1179
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,240
Han-kyul / I didn’t bump my head

1180
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,560
Han-kyul / I didn’t bump my head
Min-woo / Did you kiss the tire?

1181
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,400
Han-kyul / I crashed twice, seriously

1182
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,400
Min-woo / Really?

1183
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,160
Ri-won / Huh? You hit your head?

1184
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,520
Ri-won / Where did you hit your head?

1185
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,760
Hee-young / Over there, into the tire pile

1186
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,960
Hee-young / I suddenly went straight into it

1187
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:40,920
Ri-won / What?! Seriously?

1188
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,240
Hee-young / I was so shocked

1189
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,320
Han-kyul / I was just sightseeing honestly

1190
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,000
Han-kyul / After speeding through the tires like this—

1191
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,960
Ri-won / That’s such a metaphor for myself

1192
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,640
Da-gyo / That was hip-hop energy at the end

1193
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:57,760
Jin-ah / Fun to watch, right?

1194
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,240
Jin-ah / This is what a love battle between girls looks like

1195
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,240
Ri-won / I really wanted to win that date ticket

1196
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,240
Da-gyo / Ah~ I get that feeling

1197
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,280
We’ll now announce the results

1198
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,160
In the first match, Mi-rang won

1199
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:12,800
I figured that would happen

1200
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,280
In the second match, Hee-young came in first

1201
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,200
There’ll be a rematch

1202
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,160
Jin-ah / Let the winner move on, I say

1203
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,120
Da-gyo / Go win this

1204
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,000
Ri-won / I believe you can do it

1205
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,040
Da-gyo / Her long legs are kind of a disadvantage

1206
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,640
Ri-won / It’s because my legs are long

1207
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,920
Ri-won / It’s because my legs are long
Jin-ah / Put some strength in your legs

1208
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,440
Da-gyo / Her physique puts her at a disadvantage
Jin-ah / Just press with strength

1209
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,960
Mi-rang / Got it

1210
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,360
Mi-rang / I’ll just go with my gut, no words needed

1211
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,000
Min-woo / You know

1212
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,680
Seo-yeon / That side is the Baby

1213
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,640
Min-woo / You know what kind of vibe I mean?

1214
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,920
Seo-yeon / Let’s go Bbo-sha!

1215
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,240
Ri-won / Let’s do it too, let’s do something like that

1216
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,320
We can be athletes too!

1217
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,840
Ri-won / I said I wanna go on a date~

1218
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,880
Massage it! What are you doing? Hurry, massage!

1219
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,160
Oh right, right hahaha

1220
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,720
Okay

1221
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,040
Min-woo / You can do it!

1222
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,400
Seo-yeon / You got this

1223
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,400
You too, fighting!

1224
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:09,960
Baby, fighting!

1225
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,240
Waaah! Waaah!

1226
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,640
Mi-rang / What the—what the—what is this

1227
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,600
Mi-rang / Why is it so slow?

1228
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,720
Mi-rang / This thing is way too slow

1229
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,200
Mi-rang / No... this can’t be it, no way

1230
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,160
Seo-yeon / You’re doing great

1231
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,360
Min-woo / Go! Go! Go!

1232
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,720
Mi-rang / No... this is way too slow

1233
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:02,600
Ri-won / I think that’s the one I rode

1234
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,840
Mi-rang / This isn’t the one

1235
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,480
Mi-rang / Ugh, I’m seriously losing my mind

1236
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:21,080
Min-woo / Ready for your victory moment?

1237
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,000
Seo-yeon / Of course

1238
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,880
Min-woo / Who is it? Huh, who is it?

1239
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,120
Seo-yeon / Isn’t she the queen of Jeju?

1240
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,760
Look at that expression

1241
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,520
Seo-yeon / Look at that expression

1242
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,360
Ri-won / That was awesome

1243
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,560
Ri-won / That was seriously cool, I’ll give you that

1244
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,920
Seo-yeon / I just had heart-flutters

1245
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,200
Hee-young / What was that just now?

1246
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,480
Min-woo / What did you do?

1247
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,160
Seo-yeon / Wanna go on a date with me?

1248
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,160
Seo-yeon / Let’s go on a date

1249
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,560
Min-woo / Wait, what was that drift?

1250
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,360
Hee-young / I don’t know, what did I even do?

1251
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,600
Min-woo / That was cool, I honestly fell a little for her

1252
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,360
Min-woo / Even in competition, her attitude stood out

1253
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,680
Min-woo / The way she handled it—

1254
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,040
Min-woo / I found that really attractive

1255
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,280
Ri-won / It’s okay, Mi-rang

1256
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,280
Da-gyo / It’s okay

1257
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,040
Ri-won / I think that one’s a bit faster

1258
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,800
Ri-won / Kart 9 and 10 seem to be the fast ones

1259
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,920
Ding~ ding~ ding~ ding~ ding~

1260
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,920
It’s okay~ ding ding ding~

1261
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,360
Hee-young won the final race

1262
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,200
So her team is the winner

1263
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,320
Da-gyo / Go on your date

1264
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,800
Seo-yeon / We’ll be back from our date

1265
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,360
Da-gyo / Okay~ have fun!

1266
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,200
Da-gyo / Let’s go home and rest up

1267
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,400
Mi-rang / Sounds perfect

1268
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,800
Da-gyo / It’s cold anyway

1269
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,040
Min-woo / The losers sure talk a lot, let’s go

1270
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,680
Hee-young / So four people ended up going on a date randomly

1271
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,320
Hee-young / Honestly, I liked that even better

1272
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,640
Hee-young / It gave us a chance to get to know someone new

1273
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,760
Hee-young / And it was a new kind of experience

1274
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,240
Jin-ah / I actually felt very at ease

1275
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,720
Jin-ah / I wanted to spend some time away from Hee-young

1276
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,000
Jin-ah / Let her have her freedom for a bit

1277
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,760
Jin-ah / While I just quietly keep choosing her

1278
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:17,280
Jin-ah / That’s when I thought—

1279
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,600
Jin-ah / “That would honestly give me peace of mind”

1280
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,760
Jin-ah / So this was the time I personally really needed

1281
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,720
I’m really curious how it ended up with all eight of us

1282
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,400
Let’s go and try to guess

1283
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,960
Min-woo is...

1284
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,440
Mi-rang / I think he’s with OO

1285
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,560
Da-gyo / I thought Ri-won would’ve picked me

1286
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,320
Ri-won / Huh? Wait a second

1287
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,160
Jin-ah / Here’s what I thought about Ri-won

1288
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:42,480
Da-gyo / I don’t know about Min-woo

1289
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,760
Da-gyo / Han-kyul... I’m not sure about her either

1290
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,240
Ri-won / I think Seo-yeon might’ve picked OO

1291
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,240
Jin-ah / I literally know nothing

1292
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,360
Everyone interprets this differently depending on who’s hearing it

1293
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,560
Han-kyul / It’s like I’m broken or something

1294
01:05:57,560 --> 01:06:00,200
Han-kyul / The tears just won’t stop

1295
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:03,760
If I were to say

1296
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,320
Da-gyo / "I want to try going on a date with OO"

1297
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:07,360
Da-gyo / What would you think?

1298
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,320
Jin-ah / You keep not answering my questions

1299
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,000
Jin-ah / Are you mad at me?

1300
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,400
Jin-ah / Are you upset?

1301
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,160
Jin-ah / Do you understand?

1302
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,840
Hee-young / Ugh... come on

1303
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:23,880
Hee-young / Let’s talk about it later
