1
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:18,584
Min-woo / It’s all glass here

2
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:27,455
Han-kyul / Thank you

3
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:29,165
Min-woo / I think you’re supposed to stir this

4
00:00:29,175 --> 00:00:31,864
Min-woo / Feels like it

5
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,838
Min-woo / They both look good though

6
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:37,055
Han-kyul / Should I cut it up a little?

7
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:39,055
Han-kyul / Want to eat as we slice it?

8
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:40,785
Min-woo / I’m good with whatever

9
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:46,151
Han-kyul / Judging by the texture, I think this is a croffle

10
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:49,265
Min-woo / You’re cutting that really well

11
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:56,265
Min-woo / Try it

12
00:00:56,985 --> 00:00:59,255
Han-kyul / I’ll take this one then

13
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:01,135
Min-woo / But I want that one

14
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:02,175
Han-kyul / Why?

15
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:04,415
Min-woo / Because I feel like eating it

16
00:01:04,425 --> 00:01:06,975
Han-kyul / I cut that big piece on purpose!

17
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:09,975
Han-kyul / Why are you going for the small one?

18
00:01:09,985 --> 00:01:11,695
Min-woo / Thank you

19
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,135
Han-kyul / I cut it all in advance

20
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:15,665
Han-kyul / But the cream kind of collapsed...

21
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:19,175
Min-woo / she was speaking so softly

22
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:21,495
Min-woo / I really wanted to tease her

23
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:23,415
Min-woo / And the way she offered that bite

24
00:01:23,425 --> 00:01:25,265
Min-woo / It was just too cute

25
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:32,855
Min-woo / But...

26
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:34,055
Min-woo / It’s like...

27
00:01:34,065 --> 00:01:39,265
Min-woo / I picked you like 3 minutes after I arrived

28
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:43,735
Min-woo / She must’ve been so flustered

29
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:48,815
Min-woo / But I don’t know what her type is

30
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:52,895
Min-woo / General ideal type?

31
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,575
Min-woo / Doesn’t have to be super detailed

32
00:01:55,585 --> 00:01:58,335
Min-woo / Even a general idea is fine

33
00:01:58,345 --> 00:02:01,255
Han-kyul / Hmm... for me, basically

34
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:03,415
Han-kyul / I tend to be drawn to the pure type

35
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:06,375
Han-kyul / That’s usually my first instinct

36
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:08,135
Han-kyul / Then after that,

37
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:10,175
Han-kyul / on a deeper level,

38
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:13,105
Han-kyul / If someone says they like movies, I find that attractive

39
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,935
Han-kyul / Someone I can relate to?

40
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,585
Han-kyul / My personality is kind of

41
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:26,935
Han-kyul / quiet? Maybe heavy?

42
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:28,935
Han-kyul / People might see it that way

43
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:32,455
Han-kyul / But if someone says “That’s what I like about you,” I feel really understood

44
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:34,665
Han-kyul / I guess that’s it

45
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:41,815
Min-woo / And the people you’ve dated in the past—

46
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:43,535
Min-woo / Were they like that?

47
00:02:43,545 --> 00:02:47,535
Han-kyul / I usually liked them first and made the first move

48
00:02:47,545 --> 00:02:49,975
Han-kyul / So I was often the one in the “lesser” position

49
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:54,945
Han-kyul / A lot of my relationships started that way

50
00:02:57,065 --> 00:03:01,865
Min-woo / But being the one who gives more—

51
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,215
Min-woo / That didn’t make the relationship bad, right?

52
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,735
Min-woo / Even if you were the “lesser” one?

53
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:09,705
Min-woo / That word makes it sound sad though

54
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:18,815
Han-kyul / I actually kind of enjoy the self-pity that comes with love

55
00:03:18,825 --> 00:03:21,505
Han-kyul / I like that feeling

56
00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:28,535
Han-kyul / When I’m the one receiving too much

57
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:32,905
Han-kyul / I don’t like the way I am in those situations

58
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:36,175
Min-woo / Do you feel uncomfortable when people do things for you?

59
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:37,185
Han-kyul / Yeah

60
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:41,855
Min-woo / If I say I’ll take care of you, or do things for you

61
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:42,935
Min-woo / Does that bother you?

62
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:45,985
Han-kyul / Not really that... it’s more like...

63
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:50,415
Han-kyul / If someone says “I’ll give this up for you”

64
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:52,415
Han-kyul / “I’ll give up my choice for you”

65
00:03:52,425 --> 00:03:55,015
Han-kyul / I’d rather say “No, don’t do that

66
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:57,015
Han-kyul / Just leave me when you’re tired of me”

67
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:59,575
Han-kyul / That’s kind of the way I think

68
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:02,655
Han-kyul / I don’t like when someone is enduring me

69
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:05,175
Han-kyul / The thought of them putting up with me makes me uncomfortable

70
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:08,505
Han-kyul / I’d rather be the one enduring it, always

71
00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:13,705
Min-woo / But in life, is there anything you can get without enduring?

72
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:15,065
Han-kyul / Hmm...

73
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:21,135
Min-woo / Sometimes endurance brings even greater things later

74
00:04:21,145 --> 00:04:22,575
Min-woo / Even good things

75
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:23,655
Han-kyul / For me?

76
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:25,775
Min-woo / So when you say “self-pity”—

77
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:27,815
Min-woo / You did have happy relationships too, right?

78
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:29,495
Han-kyul / Of course. They were good

79
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:31,855
Min-woo / I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing

80
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:34,415
Min-woo / It might just be your style

81
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,575
Min-woo / Maybe you like being cared for

82
00:04:36,585 --> 00:04:38,655
Min-woo / You like someone taking the lead

83
00:04:38,665 --> 00:04:40,055
Min-woo / Someone who looks after you

84
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:43,065
Min-woo / I think that’s what you were trying to say, indirectly

85
00:04:47,905 --> 00:04:49,295
Han-kyul / Hold on a sec haha

86
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:52,065
Min-woo / I saved some so I could eat it at home

87
00:04:52,785 --> 00:04:53,935
Min-woo / There's nothing to eat once I get back

88
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:56,415
Min-woo / There's nothing to eat once I get back

89
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:58,449
Min-woo / So I’m pacing myself now

90
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:02,775
Han-kyul / Do you have a napkin?

91
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:05,105
Min-woo / I brought one just in case

92
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:12,615
Min-woo / Is this part of your self-pity too?

93
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,625
Han-kyul / Yeah

94
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:17,935
Han-kyul / There’s a kind of maturity in that vibe of yours

95
00:05:17,945 --> 00:05:20,015
Han-kyul / That’s how it felt to me

96
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:25,735
Han-kyul / But honestly, I’m not good in that kind of atmosphere

97
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:30,345
Han-kyul / I don’t know how to react...

98
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:33,575
Min-woo / That physical contact wasn’t unconscious

99
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:35,015
Min-woo / I held your hand on purpose

100
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,575
Min-woo / I was kind of shy about it too

101
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:39,425
Min-woo / I felt a little embarrassed

102
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:58,521
Han-kyul / You're so funny, like...

103
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:01,281
Han-kyul / I feel like a lot of people must find you charming

104
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,321
Han-kyul / Really

105
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,411
Min-woo / Me?
Han-kyul / Yeah

106
00:06:06,011 --> 00:06:09,531
Min-woo / I need to like the person, that’s a must for me

107
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:16,281
Han-kyul / It felt like I was going on a date with a cool and fascinating unnie

108
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,481
Han-kyul / That’s really how it felt

109
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:21,001
Han-kyul / Everything about it felt surreal

110
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:25,851
Han-kyul / Like I was dreaming—it was kind of strange

111
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:28,201
Min-woo / Aren’t you curious about this? Want to try it?

112
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:29,881
Min-woo / It’s their signature dish

113
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:32,011
Han-kyul / Are you okay with sharing it with me?

114
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:34,841
Min-woo / Sharing? Of course

115
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:37,331
Min-woo / That’s what we’re here for, to share

116
00:06:41,131 --> 00:06:43,721
Han-kyul / This one still has powder in it

117
00:06:43,731 --> 00:06:45,241
Han-kyul / I want to let it melt more before eating

118
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:47,881
Min-woo / Yeah, there’s powder settled at the bottom

119
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:49,601
Min-woo / I was sipping it, and the powder hit me haha

120
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:52,681
Han-kyul / You’re really good at finding the root of the problem

121
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:53,841
Han-kyul / The source of it...

122
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:55,841
Min-woo / It’s obviously all clumped up haha

123
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:58,001
Han-kyul / I thought it was syrup

124
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,521
Han-kyul / So I just drank it straight

125
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:00,161
Min-woo / Without a second thought?

126
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:01,841
Han-kyul / I was like, “Wow, powder~”

127
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:03,881
Han-kyul / It’s like powder exploding in my mouth

128
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,361
Min-woo / Okay

129
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:07,731
Han-kyul / It had a personality of its own

130
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:12,681
Han-kyul / I think cutting it up earlier

131
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:15,091
Han-kyul / ruined the presentation

132
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:20,931
Min-woo / It looks like a piece of modern art now

133
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:25,641
Han-kyul / Yeah, it kind of does

134
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:30,171
Han-kyul / I could probably pass it off as abstract art

135
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:33,921
Han-kyul / But why do you keep agreeing?

136
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,491
Han-kyul / Even when I say nonsense

137
00:07:37,931 --> 00:07:42,321
Min-woo / I think those little gestures of yours

138
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:44,641
Min-woo / Others might miss them

139
00:07:44,651 --> 00:07:48,691
Min-woo / But to me, they’re really endearing

140
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:55,921
Min-woo / I’m curious about something though

141
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:58,121
Min-woo / When I first walked in earlier—

142
00:07:58,131 --> 00:08:00,331
Min-woo / What did you think?

143
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:01,891
Min-woo / Honestly

144
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:07,291
Min-woo / You can be totally honest

145
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:10,561
Han-kyul / I was sure you’d never choose me

146
00:08:10,571 --> 00:08:13,681
Han-kyul / That was the impression you gave off

147
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:17,721
Han-kyul / Like you’d be into a completely different type of person

148
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,281
Han-kyul / If we’d met outside,

149
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:23,211
Han-kyul / I don’t think I’d have even dared to speak to you

150
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:27,561
Min-woo / If we had met outside,

151
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:29,681
Min-woo / I think I would’ve asked what you do

152
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:31,801
Han-kyul / Me? You’d approach me?

153
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:36,161
Han-kyul / I don’t think I stand out that much

154
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:37,641
Min-woo / You were the one I was most curious about

155
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,841
Min-woo / And honestly, you were the prettiest one

156
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:40,921
Min-woo / You were my type

157
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:43,041
Han-kyul / No way, that’s just flattery...

158
00:08:43,051 --> 00:08:45,441
Han-kyul / You’re just saying that to make me feel good

159
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:48,771
Min-woo / I don’t say things just to flatter people
Han-kyul / Really?

160
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:50,401
Han-kyul / Just to make me feel good...

161
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:52,961
Min-woo / I meant it, you’re the prettiest there

162
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:54,521
Min-woo / You stood out the most to me

163
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:56,921
Han-kyul / Honestly, I can’t even look at you directly

164
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:58,761
Han-kyul / I can’t look into your eyes

165
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,361
Min-woo / Me?

166
00:08:59,371 --> 00:08:59,891
Han-kyul / Yeah

167
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:01,801
Min-woo / Should I close my eyes?

168
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:04,011
Han-kyul / Yes, please do that

169
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:06,411
Han-kyul / It’s like...

170
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:08,561
Han-kyul / You’re from another world

171
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:11,371
Han-kyul / That’s how it feels—like you live in a different realm

172
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:14,761
Han-kyul / Like we’ve lived completely different lives

173
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:19,041
Han-kyul / I really thought you must be from another world

174
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:21,601
Han-kyul / And we wouldn’t have much in common

175
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:25,201
Han-kyul / Like our lives wouldn’t intersect, and that you

176
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:31,731
Han-kyul / would never see me as a romantic interest

177
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,361
Han-kyul / Can you talk about yourself a little more?

178
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:46,001
Min-woo / I already talked about myself a ton!

179
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,011
Min-woo / Are you sure your mind didn’t just go blank?

180
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,761
Han-kyul / Honestly, I’m not even sure where the food is going

181
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:54,521
Han-kyul / I can’t tell where it’s going inside me

182
00:09:54,531 --> 00:09:56,161
Min-woo / It’s going down your throat right now

183
00:09:56,171 --> 00:09:58,691
Min-woo / I’ll let you know where each bite ends up

184
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:02,651
Han-kyul / Why is this...

185
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:06,811
Han-kyul / Why is it so hard to digest?

186
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:10,121
Min-woo / Places like this always have chocolate cream

187
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:12,961
Min-woo / for writing initials or something

188
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:15,331
Min-woo / I kinda like doing that

189
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:19,171
Han-kyul / But it looks so messy right now

190
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,321
Min-woo / Why’d you draw a heart?

191
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,761
Han-kyul / That looks like a heart to you?

192
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:24,801
Min-woo / It is a heart

193
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:26,481
Han-kyul / You’re right, it is

194
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,571
Han-kyul / But it looks so dirty now

195
00:10:30,411 --> 00:10:34,091
Min-woo / So this is how you express how you feel, huh

196
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:37,321
Min-woo / You’re so awkward, it makes me want to tease you more

197
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:40,931
Min-woo / She was literally drawing a heart with chocolate and whipped cream

198
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:45,481
Min-woo / It’s rare to see someone wear their heart on their sleeve like that

199
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:46,411
Min-woo / I found it kind of fascinating

200
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:51,171
Han-kyul / Getting to know you... was nice...

201
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:56,961
Min-woo / You’re saying it was nice getting to know me?

202
00:10:56,971 --> 00:11:00,411
Min-woo / You’re saying it was nice getting to know me?
Han-kyul / Yeah, it was

203
00:11:14,198 --> 00:11:15,348
Han-kyul / Oh I was curious

204
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:18,038
Han-kyul / Do you prefer older, younger, or same-age partners?

205
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:21,948
Min-woo / Same-age or older, but

206
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,798
Min-woo / if we connect well, younger is fine too

207
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:26,548
Han-kyul / I just assumed I'd seem way younger

208
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:27,838
Han-kyul / That’s the impression I get

209
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:31,908
Han-kyul / So even though I give off that vibe

210
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:33,308
Han-kyul / So even though I give off that vibe
Min-woo / What do you mean?

211
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,908
Han-kyul / Even though I seem way younger

212
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:38,468
Han-kyul / You still picked me, and that was really

213
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:40,318
Han-kyul / kind of a refreshing shock

214
00:11:41,358 --> 00:11:43,708
Han-kyul / That really surprised me, honestly

215
00:11:43,718 --> 00:11:45,428
Han-kyul / That’s just the vibe I got

216
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,388
Min-woo / Everyone except one person felt younger than me

217
00:11:48,398 --> 00:11:51,148
Min-woo / So honestly, age wasn’t really a big deal to me

218
00:11:51,158 --> 00:11:53,918
Min-woo / It’s not like that was some huge merit

219
00:11:54,678 --> 00:11:59,908
Han-kyul / So basically you’re saying age doesn’t matter to you?

220
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:01,638
Min-woo / Yeah, it doesn’t

221
00:12:04,718 --> 00:12:06,348
Min-woo / We communicate well, don’t we?

222
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:07,268
Han-kyul / Right now?

223
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,788
Han-kyul / I’d like to think we do, but honestly

224
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:14,388
Han-kyul / I’m being so awkward that I feel self-conscious

225
00:12:14,398 --> 00:12:17,028
Han-kyul / I’m actually feeling a little nervous right now

226
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:21,428
Han-kyul / A bit self-conscious, yeah

227
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:22,128
Min-woo / Really?

228
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,468
Min-woo / So you are embarrassed

229
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,908
Min-woo / You say it all philosophically

230
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:39,988
Min-woo / But in the end, it just sounds like you're saying 'I'm interested too'

231
00:12:39,998 --> 00:12:41,091
Min-woo / That’s the vibe I get

232
00:12:41,101 --> 00:12:45,430
Min-woo / You’re kind of mysterious and I want to get to know you more

233
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:50,078
Han-kyul / You still don’t know how old I am

234
00:12:50,398 --> 00:12:53,868
Han-kyul / Honestly, I figured you'd have better chemistry

235
00:12:53,878 --> 00:12:58,028
Han-kyul / with someone closer to your own age

236
00:12:58,038 --> 00:13:02,788
Han-kyul / I didn’t think someone like you would go for someone my age

237
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:10,028
Han-kyul / So I thought, once you find out how old I am, whatever interest you’re showing now

238
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:12,228
Han-kyul / won’t last anymore

239
00:13:12,238 --> 00:13:16,078
Han-kyul / That’s just something I vaguely assumed

240
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,043
Wasn't it us? Was it just one person?

241
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,167
Ri-won / What is this?

242
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:34,702
Seo-yeon / It could be something like a date card

243
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:38,149
Ri-won / If you choose the same card, you get to go on a 1-on-1 date

244
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:41,019
Ri-won / Today, we get to go out

245
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,254
Ri-won / It's the day for one-on-one dates

246
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:46,981
Ri-won / If you have a preference among the three cards

247
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,249
Ri-won / you can choose it

248
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,651
Jin-ah / Can I go first?

249
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:50,652
Ri-won / No

250
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:51,319
Ri-won / You can't

251
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:52,187
Hee-young / Then what do we do?

252
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:53,731
Ri-won / Let's do rock-paper-scissors

253
00:13:55,801 --> 00:14:01,774
rock-paper-scissors

254
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:12,718
Ri-won / Ugh I’m always like thisㅠ

255
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:24,396
Da-gyo / Oh, it's me?

256
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,870
Da-gyo / I'll take this one

257
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,399
Da-gyo / Aren’t we supposed to pick one of these?

258
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,936
Ri-won / Honestly, this isn't about the pictures

259
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:43,171
Ri-won / It's just a way to choose the person you want to go with

260
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:45,017
Ri-won / Hurry up, let’s go

261
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:49,144
Seo-yeon / I want to go with Da-gyo for now

262
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,122
Seo-yeon / Da-gyo

263
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:07,205
Mi-rang / I’ll just pick this one too

264
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:11,042
Ri-won / Okay, and then—

265
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:17,438
Seo-yeon / My mind literally went blank for a second

266
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:21,475
Seo-yeon / I was... honestly speechless

267
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:23,254
Seo-yeon / I mean... just a bit...

268
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:27,481
Seo-yeon / Betrayed?

269
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:28,726
Seo-yeon / Is that what I should call it?

270
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:30,718
Mi-rang / But honestly

271
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:32,320
Mi-rang / Love is something you fight for

272
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,533
Mi-rang / So I didn’t really overthink it

273
00:15:36,867 --> 00:15:39,070
Seo-yeon / I’ll go with this one

274
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:52,807
Jin-ah / Why?

275
00:15:52,817 --> 00:15:57,989
Jin-ah / I can’t really see the drawings clearly, I don’t know

276
00:15:59,157 --> 00:16:02,384
Jin-ah / I think we didn’t really get to know each other enough at first

277
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,220
Jin-ah / Whether it’s a yes or a no

278
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,057
Jin-ah / I just wanted to get to know them better

279
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,936
Jin-ah / I felt like I didn't have enough to go on

280
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:12,482
Ri-won / Are you two going again?

281
00:16:12,492 --> 00:16:13,012
Jin-ah / Is that a problem?

282
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:15,202
Jin-ah / We can, right?

283
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:17,202
Ri-won / I’m fine with it

284
00:16:17,212 --> 00:16:19,282
Ri-won / I actually wanted to go on a date with Seo-yeon

285
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:22,242
Ri-won / So part of me was like, ‘Oh, nice!’

286
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:25,612
Ri-won / I thought I should go and make it fun for her

287
00:16:25,972 --> 00:16:28,162
Seo-yeon / I felt so bad for Ri-won

288
00:16:28,172 --> 00:16:31,523
Seo-yeon / I was so shocked that I couldn’t even process what was happening

289
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:48,130
Seo-yeon / Ugh seriously

290
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,865
Seo-yeon / Hey!

291
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,733
Seo-yeon / Do you wanna die?

292
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:53,302
Seo-yeon / How could you do that?

293
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:57,005
Mi-rang / I told you there’d be a twist

294
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:59,541
Seo-yeon / Ugh I really feel betrayed

295
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,577
Seo-yeon / Hey I—hey

296
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,611
Mi-rang / No way

297
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,756
Seo-yeon / Hey! How old are you?

298
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:07,049
Mi-rang / I don’t know ㅎㅎ

299
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,952
Seo-yeon / Hey, how old are you?

300
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:10,819
Mi-rang / This is too funny

301
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,589
Seo-yeon / How could you do that?

302
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,334
Mi-rang / But you know, there’s that thing too

303
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:17,960
Mi-rang / I told you I was torn between two people

304
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,695
Mi-rang / But the first person and I

305
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,939
Mi-rang / had already kind of made a decision

306
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,200
Mi-rang / You get what I mean?

307
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,435
Mi-rang / Since it was already decided

308
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,614
Mi-rang / I just thought I should go with that person

309
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:31,372
Seo-yeon / Wanna fight?

310
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:32,740
Mi-rang / No…

311
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,019
Seo-yeon / Let’s throw down

312
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:39,213
Seo-yeon / Have a good date

313
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:40,180
Mi-rang / You too

314
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,192
Mi-rang / I am curious what kind of date we’ll have

315
00:17:43,894 --> 00:17:46,353
Da-gyo / Do you think I should fix my makeup?

316
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:48,923
Jin-ah / You look so pretty today though

317
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:49,823
Da-gyo / Really?

318
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,026
Jin-ah / I want to try that makeup style too

319
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:53,460
Jin-ah / It’s so well done

320
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,629
Hee-young / But it looks better because you did it yourself

321
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,698
Da-gyo / Really?

322
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:00,034
Da-gyo / I’m so happy~ Why is everything echoing?

323
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:02,403
Da-gyo / The applause startled me

324
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:03,537
Jin-ah / Can I ask you something then?

325
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:04,738
Jin-ah / Was one of your interests Mi-rang?

326
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:05,883
Jin-ah / Like your crushes

327
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:08,876
Da-gyo / Yes

328
00:18:08,886 --> 00:18:11,178
Da-gyo / But honestly, I was planning to ask someone else on the date today

329
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:12,313
Da-gyo / If we had to write it down, I mean

330
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:13,080
Jin-ah / Why?

331
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,891
Jin-ah / Why?

332
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:15,583
Da-gyo / The one who showed clearer interest was Mi-rang

333
00:18:15,593 --> 00:18:16,684
Da-gyo / But the one I couldn’t figure out

334
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:19,253
Da-gyo / I just wanted to make it clear that I was interested

335
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,421
Da-gyo / I wanted to show it

336
00:18:20,431 --> 00:18:21,265
Da-gyo / That I’m into her

337
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,892
Da-gyo / Ugh I’m shaking so much I can’t even talk properly

338
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,894
Jin-ah / I could totally feel that and it was so sweet

339
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:27,905
Hee-young / Yeah, seriously

340
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:31,065
Hee-young / What’s with you~

341
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:34,301
Da-gyo / I'm so nervous... and hot

342
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:35,546
Da-gyo / It’s so hot

343
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:39,039
Da-gyo / Hot hot

344
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:40,441
Da-gyo / Anyway, that’s how it was

345
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:41,909
Jin-ah / Don't get too hot while you're out

346
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,576
Jin-ah / Because when you're hot

347
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:44,478
Jin-ah / It’s your cute charm point

348
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:46,413
Da-gyo / Really? It’s a complex of mine

349
00:18:46,423 --> 00:18:49,283
Jin-ah / Even if it’s cold, say “It’s so hot”

350
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:51,819
Hee-young / Seriously, she’s so cute when she gets shy

351
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:53,320
Hee-young / It’s so adorable

352
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,855
Jin-ah / It felt really genuine

353
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:57,234
Da-gyo / I’m seriously hot right now

354
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:03,240
It's snowing so much...

355
00:19:05,593 --> 00:19:08,246
Da-gyo / I’m so nervous

356
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:10,972
Da-gyo / Aren’t you nervous?

357
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:15,019
Mi-rang / Me? I’m actually super nervous right now

358
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,223
Da-gyo / I'm so curious what we're going to do

359
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,665
Da-gyo / Is it okay if I sit here?

360
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,213
Mi-rang / I wanted to talk to Da-gyo

361
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,873
Mi-rang / I wondered if she felt

362
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,551
Mi-rang / the same interest I did

363
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:51,422
Mi-rang / I wanted to get to know her more through this date

364
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,021
Da-gyo / Until now I always thought

365
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:02,767
Da-gyo / it was more important how I felt about someone

366
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,960
Da-gyo / But Mi-rang choosing me

367
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,872
Da-gyo / that action...

368
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:13,101
Da-gyo / made me curious about someone who likes me

369
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,213
Da-gyo / I was really shy about it

370
00:20:21,686 --> 00:20:23,611
Please write your name and date

371
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,580
and the scent you like or want to make

372
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,891
Just jot it down simply

373
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,250
Da-gyo / I guess it's a place where you make scents

374
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,261
Mi-rang / Right?

375
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,126
Da-gyo / When you saw the picture earlier

376
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,171
Da-gyo / did you guess what it was?

377
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,297
Mi-rang / Scent didn’t even cross my mind

378
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:43,308
Da-gyo / Same here

379
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:45,767
Mi-rang / You said you liked scents earlier

380
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,146
Mi-rang / So when it turned out to be a perfume place

381
00:20:48,246 --> 00:20:50,215
Mi-rang / I was amazed

382
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:53,751
Mi-rang / And I really liked it

383
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:55,844
Da-gyo / I just picked it

384
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,213
Da-gyo / because among the three cards

385
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,692
Da-gyo / that one was the only oriental-style painting

386
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:03,251
Da-gyo / Why did you choose it?

387
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:05,653
Mi-rang / Honestly, regardless of the image

388
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,889
Mi-rang / I just wanted to...

389
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:11,426
Mi-rang / go on a date with you

390
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,005
Da-gyo / Really?

391
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:15,707
Da-gyo / Okay

392
00:21:17,208 --> 00:21:20,345
Mi-rang / Ugh this is so embarrassing

393
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:24,148
Da-gyo / What’s the date today?

394
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,253
Mi-rang / Should we just skip the date part? ㅎㅎ

395
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:31,779
Da-gyo / What kind of scents do you like?

396
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:34,115
Da-gyo / But we need to decide something first

397
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,127
Da-gyo / Should we make it for ourselves or for each other?

398
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,454
Mi-rang / Then let’s make it for each other

399
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,488
Da-gyo / For each other?

400
00:21:40,498 --> 00:21:40,889
Mi-rang / Yeah

401
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,690
Da-gyo / A scent you want the other person to wear

402
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,570
Mi-rang / It’d be weird if I made one and just took it home

403
00:21:46,504 --> 00:21:48,062
Mi-rang / Trading makes it more meaningful

404
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:49,307
Da-gyo / I like that

405
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:50,899
Da-gyo / So a scent that suits the other person?

406
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,233
Mi-rang / A scent that suits them?

407
00:21:52,243 --> 00:21:54,712
Da-gyo / Or just a scent you’d like them to wear? Which one?

408
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:57,105
Mi-rang / One that suits them

409
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,950
Da-gyo / A scent that suits them? That's hard

410
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:00,642
Mi-rang / One you'd want them to wear?

411
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,376
Mi-rang / I’ll just

412
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:03,621
Mi-rang / go with what suits them

413
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,417
Mi-rang / A sweet scent?

414
00:22:09,427 --> 00:22:12,063
Mi-rang / Because you look really soft

415
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,768
Mi-rang / and fresh

416
00:22:19,537 --> 00:22:21,739
Da-gyo / I wish they had examples

417
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:26,811
Mi-rang / How about something sexy?

418
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:29,013
Da-gyo / Ooh~ that’s a good idea

419
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:37,455
Da-gyo / Flowers? Soap? What suits best?

420
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,192
Mi-rang / Like that herbal balm smell ㅋㅋㅋ

421
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,487
Da-gyo / Like you said earlier

422
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:47,889
Da-gyo / I think a sexy scent would really suit you

423
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,023
Mi-rang / Love that

424
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,459
Da-gyo / That outfit too...

425
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:52,537
Mi-rang / A rider jacket?

426
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:54,295
Da-gyo / Yeah, kind of matches today

427
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:55,940
Mi-rang / Right?

428
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,599
Da-gyo / I didn’t mean to match...

429
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,301
Mi-rang / I did though?

430
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:01,245
Da-gyo / What was I wearing today...?

431
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,937
Mi-rang / I saw it this morning

432
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:05,016
Da-gyo / You figured it out this morning??

433
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:08,676
Mi-rang / You're here?

434
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:09,887
Da-gyo / Yep

435
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,591
Mi-rang / Da-gyo, you look great today

436
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:22,922
Seo-yeon / Who am I going to do it with?

437
00:23:22,932 --> 00:23:24,172
Seo-yeon / And how is it going to work?

438
00:23:24,732 --> 00:23:26,002
Seo-yeon / One person gets left out

439
00:23:26,012 --> 00:23:26,922
Da-gyo / One person gets left out?

440
00:23:26,932 --> 00:23:28,005
Da-gyo / Because it's an odd number?

441
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:45,979
Mi-rang / Since the weather’s cold today

442
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:47,647
Mi-rang / I was going to wear something else

443
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:49,316
Mi-rang / But then I saw what you were wearing

444
00:23:49,326 --> 00:23:50,484
Da-gyo / Really?

445
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:52,753
Mi-rang / So I wore it too

446
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:56,356
Da-gyo / That’s honestly so touching

447
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:59,559
Da-gyo / You’re so sneaky, how do you think of that?

448
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:01,561
Da-gyo / I never would've thought of that

449
00:24:01,571 --> 00:24:03,563
Da-gyo / You might not have even gone on the date with me

450
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:05,699
Da-gyo / Just because I wore leather

451
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:08,812
Da-gyo / You matched with a rider outfit?

452
00:24:09,913 --> 00:24:11,104
Da-gyo / That’s seriously amazing

453
00:24:11,114 --> 00:24:12,773
Da-gyo / I don't think I could have thought of that

454
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:14,418
Da-gyo / Thinking through all those details

455
00:24:19,923 --> 00:24:21,114
Da-gyo / I’m done writing

456
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:23,060
Da-gyo / Huh? We wrote almost the same thing?

457
00:24:23,727 --> 00:24:24,785
I'll bring it to you

458
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:25,896
Mi-rang / Okay

459
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:31,258
Mi-rang / So when you like someone

460
00:24:31,268 --> 00:24:34,394
Mi-rang / do you usually show it, or

461
00:24:34,404 --> 00:24:36,696
Mi-rang / are you more of an observer?

462
00:24:36,706 --> 00:24:38,899
Da-gyo / Didn’t it show?

463
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:41,201
Mi-rang / Toward me?

464
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:42,569
Mi-rang / I seriously had no idea

465
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:45,605
Da-gyo / Really? Wow...

466
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:47,184
Mi-rang / But you know

467
00:24:47,784 --> 00:24:50,987
Mi-rang / we did lock eyes a few times

468
00:24:51,254 --> 00:24:53,447
Da-gyo / Like when I looked at you, too

469
00:24:53,457 --> 00:24:54,781
Da-gyo / and when you lent me clothes

470
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,783
Da-gyo / I couldn’t tell if that meant you were interested

471
00:24:56,793 --> 00:24:58,018
Da-gyo / or if you're just kind

472
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:59,529
Da-gyo / That part confused me

473
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:01,154
Da-gyo / I was curious

474
00:25:01,164 --> 00:25:03,967
Da-gyo / I really wanted to ask you during today’s date

475
00:25:04,167 --> 00:25:05,525
Mi-rang / I’d been watching you

476
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:07,771
Da-gyo / Really?

477
00:25:08,138 --> 00:25:10,464
Da-gyo / When were you looking at me?

478
00:25:10,474 --> 00:25:13,200
Mi-rang / Just constantly, in little moments

479
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,968
Mi-rang / That’s why we made eye contact a few times

480
00:25:14,978 --> 00:25:15,979
Mi-rang / here and there...

481
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:19,883
Mi-rang / I'm Kim Mi... ra...ng

482
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:24,788
Mi-rang / It’s Kim Mi-rang

483
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:26,790
Da-gyo / Rang? Oh~

484
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,845
Da-gyo / Yeah, that’s why

485
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,947
Da-gyo / I was seriously so anxious

486
00:25:59,957 --> 00:26:02,025
Da-gyo / Like, am I just imagining this?

487
00:26:02,426 --> 00:26:05,686
Mi-rang / The reason I was being so direct

488
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,433
Mi-rang / was because I was curious how you'd react

489
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,925
Mi-rang / And I just wanted to be honest

490
00:26:11,935 --> 00:26:13,127
Mi-rang / about what I was feeling

491
00:26:13,137 --> 00:26:15,329
Mi-rang / No lies

492
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:18,142
Da-gyo / So there was an intention behind lending me your clothes?

493
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:21,101
Mi-rang / Ye... yeah there was

494
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:22,546
Da-gyo / There was!?

495
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:28,609
Da-gyo / I’ve been keeping them safe

496
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:30,254
Da-gyo / I haven’t returned them yet

497
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:32,613
Mi-rang / ‘So she was interested in me too’

498
00:26:32,623 --> 00:26:34,057
Da-gyo / That kind of feeling

499
00:26:34,658 --> 00:26:35,749
Da-gyo / That feels good

500
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,427
Da-gyo / So that’s your style

501
00:26:37,628 --> 00:26:39,419
Mi-rang / At least I’m not delusional

502
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:41,688
Da-gyo / I was like, what if this ends up being a joke? Just me...

503
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:43,824
Da-gyo / What if it was nothing?

504
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:45,859
Da-gyo / What if I was the only one overthinking it?

505
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:48,071
Da-gyo / I even asked Jin-ah about it earlier

506
00:26:48,705 --> 00:26:50,574
Mi-rang / You asked Jin-ah?

507
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:53,277
Da-gyo / She straight up asked me

508
00:26:54,411 --> 00:26:56,537
Da-gyo / ‘The person you’re going on a date with today,

509
00:26:56,547 --> 00:26:58,472
Da-gyo / is it the one you’re actually into?’

510
00:26:58,482 --> 00:26:59,383
Da-gyo / She asked me that

511
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,509
Mi-rang / Oh... so that’s why...

512
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:03,410
Da-gyo / I told her yes

513
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,889
Da-gyo / That I was going with the person I wanted to go with

514
00:27:08,225 --> 00:27:09,459
Da-gyo / Because it’s true

515
00:27:10,794 --> 00:27:12,619
Da-gyo / I just like to be honest

516
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:17,301
Da-gyo / There's no reason to lie or anything like that

517
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,862
Da-gyo / What?

518
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:25,943
Mi-rang / I thought you were super shy and quiet

519
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:28,769
Mi-rang / But that moment felt so bold

520
00:27:28,779 --> 00:27:30,204
Mi-rang / and I liked it

521
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:30,981
Da-gyo / Really?

522
00:27:31,715 --> 00:27:33,907
Da-gyo / No, I really am shy

523
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,052
Da-gyo / I'm a shy girl ㅎㅎ

524
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,546
Da-gyo / For real though, I’m usually pretty shy

525
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:42,015
Mi-rang / But hearing you speak so honestly

526
00:27:42,025 --> 00:27:46,096
Mi-rang / helped clear my head a bit

527
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:50,624
Mi-rang / I actually thought Da-gyo wasn’t interested in me

528
00:27:50,634 --> 00:27:52,926
Mi-rang / That’s what I’d assumed

529
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:54,228
Mi-rang / But seeing her

530
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:57,731
Mi-rang / sincerely say she wanted to go on a date with me

531
00:27:57,741 --> 00:28:02,402
Mi-rang / made me think I need to be more honest too

532
00:28:02,412 --> 00:28:03,580
Mi-rang / That’s what I felt

533
00:28:04,114 --> 00:28:06,006
Mi-rang / She says things shyly

534
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,417
Mi-rang / but still says everything she wants

535
00:28:07,751 --> 00:28:10,544
Mi-rang / Like 'Yeah I was interested, that’s why I did that'

536
00:28:10,554 --> 00:28:12,579
Mi-rang / She still gets her point across

537
00:28:12,589 --> 00:28:16,393
Mi-rang / It made me flustered and hot

538
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:32,532
Mi-rang / If it smells good I’ll spray it right here

539
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:33,877
Da-gyo / Oh like that

540
00:28:36,213 --> 00:28:37,814
Da-gyo / It won’t open...

541
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:39,773
Da-gyo / It’s oil

542
00:28:39,783 --> 00:28:41,918
Mi-rang / It’s slippery

543
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:44,855
Da-gyo / Thank youuuu

544
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:47,591
Da-gyo / This one’s pretty nice too

545
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:51,028
Mi-rang / I had my eye on that one too

546
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:54,655
Da-gyo / What if our scents end up too similar?

547
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:57,834
Mi-rang / That’s okay, I think

548
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:03,106
Mi-rang / Then it’d be like our unique shared scent

549
00:29:08,378 --> 00:29:10,070
Mi-rang / Have you ever made perfume before?

550
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,904
Da-gyo / Never

551
00:29:10,914 --> 00:29:11,571
Mi-rang / Never?

552
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:12,372
Da-gyo / Nope, you?

553
00:29:12,382 --> 00:29:15,352
Mi-rang / I have a friend who works at a perfume studio

554
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:18,111
Mi-rang / So I’ve tried it before

555
00:29:18,121 --> 00:29:19,222
Da-gyo / With who?

556
00:29:20,857 --> 00:29:22,549
Mi-rang / Wouldn’t you like to know?

557
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,261
Mi-rang / Did you go alone?

558
00:29:24,828 --> 00:29:26,420
Da-gyo / Oh, I see~

559
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,230
Mi-rang / Yeah, I’ve done it before

560
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:31,391
Mi-rang / But back then, after smelling all the scents

561
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:34,037
Mi-rang / you know how you sample them—it gave me a huge headache

562
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:35,262
Mi-rang / Do you have a headache now?

563
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:37,531
Mi-rang / This place isn’t giving me one at all...

564
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:39,566
Da-gyo / Maybe it’s the oil-based scents?

565
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:41,478
Da-gyo / They’re more natural

566
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:52,779
Mi-rang / I’ll mix three

567
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:54,057
Da-gyo / Three? Oh man...

568
00:29:58,495 --> 00:30:00,187
Mi-rang / I’m just going to go for it all at once

569
00:30:00,197 --> 00:30:02,666
Mi-rang / If I keep smelling, I’ll get dizzy

570
00:30:06,236 --> 00:30:08,862
Da-gyo / I’m trying not to overthink it...

571
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:12,032
Da-gyo / Just because we went on one date doesn’t mean we’re dating

572
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,367
Da-gyo / Of course I care, but

573
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:17,214
Da-gyo / It’s not something that bothers me that much

574
00:30:18,285 --> 00:30:19,475
Da-gyo / What is this?

575
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,205
Da-gyo / The writing got smudged

576
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:21,785
Da-gyo / I’ll mix three too

577
00:30:25,655 --> 00:30:29,326
Da-gyo / Numbers 36, 1, and 27

578
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:31,218
Da-gyo / How is it?

579
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:33,387
Da-gyo / What do you think?

580
00:30:33,397 --> 00:30:34,464
Da-gyo / Should I take one out?

581
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:35,889
Da-gyo / Is it okay?

582
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:36,456
It’s nice

583
00:30:36,466 --> 00:30:37,023
Da-gyo / Really?

584
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:38,892
Make #3 the main one, though

585
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:40,093
Make it the strongest

586
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:42,162
Da-gyo / Following the expert’s advice ㅎㅎ

587
00:30:42,172 --> 00:30:43,630
Go with #3

588
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,909
You did a good job with that blend

589
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:51,004
Da-gyo / The real fragrance is just...

590
00:30:51,014 --> 00:30:53,240
Mi-rang / Keep it for 50 years, okay?

591
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,918
Da-gyo / O... Okay

592
00:30:56,052 --> 00:30:59,379
Do you want hot coffee?

593
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:02,392
Mi-rang / I’m okay either way, but I prefer cold

594
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:04,995
Da-gyo / I’ll take hot

595
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:07,320
Mi-rang / Then I’ll get hot too

596
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,922
Da-gyo / Get iced

597
00:31:08,932 --> 00:31:10,066
Da-gyo / Why are you adjusting to me?

598
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:14,738
Mi-rang / I’ll get cold then ㅎㅎ

599
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:17,774
Mi-rang / Do you have a preference for older, younger, or same age?

600
00:31:18,074 --> 00:31:19,332
Mi-rang / I used to prefer older

601
00:31:19,342 --> 00:31:21,945
Da-gyo / Really? You don’t seem like that at all

602
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:26,139
Mi-rang / What about you?

603
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:28,552
Mi-rang / Well, I started with older

604
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:30,844
Mi-rang / But after dating younger

605
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:33,213
Mi-rang / I found they have their own charm too

606
00:31:33,223 --> 00:31:34,981
Da-gyo / So younger ones have their own appeal...

607
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:37,851
Mi-rang / As you get older, approaching someone becomes

608
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:41,988
Mi-rang / scarier, more calculated, and mutual

609
00:31:41,998 --> 00:31:43,223
Mi-rang / But...

610
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:48,328
Mi-rang / Younger people tend to be more honest and bold

611
00:31:48,338 --> 00:31:50,540
Da-gyo / So that’s your image of younger types

612
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:53,934
Da-gyo / So you like older the best

613
00:31:53,944 --> 00:31:56,613
Da-gyo / Then younger, then same age?

614
00:31:58,915 --> 00:31:59,606
Mi-rang / I used to prefer older

615
00:31:59,616 --> 00:32:01,908
Mi-rang / but now I think I like younger better

616
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:02,742
Da-gyo / Really?

617
00:32:02,752 --> 00:32:03,854
Mi-rang / Yeah

618
00:32:04,454 --> 00:32:06,546
Da-gyo / All of a sudden? Just like that?

619
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:10,383
Da-gyo / Is it because I look young? So you’re calling me younger?

620
00:32:10,393 --> 00:32:12,419
Mi-rang / No, I like *this* kind of younger

621
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:13,787
Da-gyo / What kind is that?

622
00:32:13,797 --> 00:32:16,056
Mi-rang / Bold...

623
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:17,934
Da-gyo / Bold?

624
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:19,860
Da-gyo / First you said you like older

625
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,339
Da-gyo / and now you’re like 'I think I’ll like younger from now on'

626
00:32:22,706 --> 00:32:26,132
Da-gyo / This girl is seriously fearless

627
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:29,946
Da-gyo / How can she say things so directly?

628
00:32:32,115 --> 00:32:33,006
Mi-rang / It’s fun

629
00:32:33,016 --> 00:32:34,040
Da-gyo / Oh, you’re having fun?

630
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,786
Da-gyo / People say I’m fun once we get close

631
00:32:36,853 --> 00:32:37,777
Da-gyo / But

632
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:41,848
Da-gyo / If someone talks too little, I get uncomfortable

633
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:43,850
Da-gyo / I can talk because you're responding well

634
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,995
Mi-rang / Have I been responding well?

635
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:47,287
Mi-rang / Have I really?

636
00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:49,256
Mi-rang / You make it so easy to talk

637
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:52,425
Da-gyo / When someone responds well, I end up talking more

638
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:56,172
Da-gyo / If not, it’s hard to keep talking, you know?

639
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:58,164
Mi-rang / You’ve asked me a lot of questions too

640
00:32:58,174 --> 00:33:00,143
Mi-rang / And your eyes...

641
00:33:00,343 --> 00:33:04,204
Mi-rang / they look like you’re really curious about me

642
00:33:04,214 --> 00:33:07,183
Mi-rang / I really liked that

643
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:10,210
Da-gyo / For me, it’s super important that

644
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,645
Da-gyo / the other person responds well

645
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:14,047
Da-gyo / Depending on their reactions

646
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:16,149
Da-gyo / I open up differently

647
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,585
Da-gyo / You’ve responded so well, so I think I was able to speak freely

648
00:33:18,595 --> 00:33:20,664
Da-gyo / That’s how I feel

649
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,235
Mi-rang / Thank you

650
00:33:30,373 --> 00:33:31,932
Mi-rang / I want to check the mirror

651
00:33:31,942 --> 00:33:33,376
Da-gyo / The mirror? You look pretty right now

652
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,738
Mi-rang / Your eyes are really beautiful

653
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:40,173
Da-gyo / Really?

654
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:41,351
Mi-rang / They're so captivating

655
00:33:42,953 --> 00:33:45,579
Mi-rang / You have this princess-like image

656
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:46,256
Da-gyo / Really?

657
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:51,284
Mi-rang / Even last night when we were all talking

658
00:33:51,294 --> 00:33:53,420
Mi-rang / I thought, 'Do I really like that kind of vibe?'

659
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,297
Mi-rang / That’s what I was thinking

660
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:56,890
Da-gyo / I'm aware of it myself

661
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,602
Mi-rang / Your eyebrows are really charming too

662
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:03,229
Da-gyo / Thank you

663
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:07,377
Da-gyo / I feel proud I did a good job today hehe

664
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:11,915
If you just pick the bottle, I’ll pour it in for you

665
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:15,742
Da-gyo / Pick one you think suits me

666
00:34:15,752 --> 00:34:16,977
Da-gyo / I already chose mine

667
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:19,155
Mi-rang / Oh really?

668
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,261
Da-gyo / This one for me

669
00:34:25,895 --> 00:34:27,664
Mi-rang / Oh I was going to pick that too

670
00:34:28,064 --> 00:34:31,034
Mi-rang / But I wore white today

671
00:34:31,868 --> 00:34:34,494
Mi-rang / This one kind of looks like it has short hair

672
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:37,107
Mi-rang / And this one looks like it has medium to long hair, so I picked this

673
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:41,768
Mi-rang / They kind of look the same though

674
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:43,079
Da-gyo / That's hilarious

675
00:34:43,346 --> 00:34:44,381
Da-gyo / Okay okay

676
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:45,915
Da-gyo / Let’s go with these then

677
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,787
Now you can write something and stick it on each other’s bottle

678
00:34:52,322 --> 00:34:53,647
Mi-rang / Can I write something besides my name?

679
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:57,193
Sure, write whatever you’d like

680
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:18,571
Da-gyo / Why are you being so shy?

681
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:21,107
Mi-rang / It’s just too funny

682
00:35:21,117 --> 00:35:24,154
Da-gyo / Alright, let’s stick them on now

683
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:29,282
Da-gyo / Mi-rang pretends to be shy but does a lot of flirting

684
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:30,784
Da-gyo / I liked it, it was nice

685
00:35:30,794 --> 00:35:32,152
Da-gyo / Saying things so directly like that

686
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:36,132
Da-gyo / I didn’t expect her to say that much to me

687
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:38,992
Da-gyo / I really didn’t expect that

688
00:35:39,002 --> 00:35:41,871
Da-gyo / I didn’t think she’d open up that much to me

689
00:35:42,939 --> 00:35:45,231
Mi-rang / I think I’ve clearly

690
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:47,000
Mi-rang / sorted out my feelings after the date

691
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,968
Mi-rang / As of right now

692
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:50,747
Mi-rang / I think Da-gyo is the best match for me

693
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:56,953
Mi-rang / She’s my top pick right now

694
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:01,719
Seo-yeon / What does our card mean?

695
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,429
Ri-won / It’s Van Gogh, right?

696
00:36:04,439 --> 00:36:06,879
Ri-won / Maybe it’s something related to him?

697
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:11,119
Ri-won / Oh, we’re painting

698
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,119
Seo-yeon / It's a painting

699
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:29,439
Seo-yeon / It’s a galaxy painting, it's beautiful

700
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,989
Ri-won / Once we’re done with this

701
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:35,039
Ri-won / I think it’ll feel pretty rewarding

702
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,989
Ri-won / The apron

703
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:39,629
Ri-won / You said you liked this color, so

704
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,149
Ri-won / Your arm, like this. Okay

705
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,679
Ri-won / All done

706
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,149
Seo-yeon / I’ll help you too

707
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:55,319
Ri-won / You want to help me?

708
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:00,549
Ri-won / Like this?

709
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:02,789
Ri-won / I’m not sure though. Seo-yeon!

710
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:04,669
Ri-won / You said you'd help me

711
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:05,799
Ri-won / But you don’t know either

712
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,119
Ri-won / Seo-yeon did this

713
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:11,149
Seo-yeon / Just tie it in the back

714
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,079
Ri-won / Right, I’m not good at tying ribbons

715
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:22,509
Ri-won / What’s your favorite color?

716
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:27,239
Seo-yeon / My favorite color is pink

717
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:29,959
Ri-won / Pink suits you well

718
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:32,999
Ri-won / Should we start with that over there?

719
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:40,629
Ri-won / Did you expect it to be painting?

720
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,749
Ri-won / I didn’t even think of that

721
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:46,919
Seo-yeon / I really wanted to have a long conversation

722
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:49,429
Hee-young / But when you’re painting

723
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:51,919
Seo-yeon / It’s hard to talk much

724
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,389
Seo-yeon / Since it’s a date

725
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:55,149
Seo-yeon / I was hoping we could talk more

726
00:37:55,159 --> 00:37:56,349
Seo-yeon / That was on my mind

727
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:58,429
Seo-yeon / But I feel like we won’t have enough time for that

728
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:01,119
Seo-yeon / So I was a bit worried

729
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,759
Ri-won / Then shall we try using your favorite colors?

730
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,839
Ri-won / You’re pretty good

731
00:38:24,399 --> 00:38:26,359
Ri-won / What kind of date did you want to have?

732
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:29,829
Seo-yeon / Actually, I did want a hands-on kind of date

733
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,879
Seo-yeon / But one where we could talk more

734
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,029
Seo-yeon / Something more casual

735
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:35,269
Ri-won / Where you can talk more comfortably?

736
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,759
Seo-yeon / Yeah, something like that

737
00:38:38,279 --> 00:38:40,389
Ri-won / Didn’t you say earlier in the car you’re not good at multitasking?

738
00:38:40,399 --> 00:38:41,839
Seo-yeon / That’s right

739
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,639
Ri-won / You really can't multitask, Seo-yeon?

740
00:38:53,399 --> 00:38:54,719
Seo-yeon / This is driving me crazy

741
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,519
Ri-won / It’s okay

742
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,039
Ri-won / I’ll just start the conversation again

743
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:03,519
Ri-won / You know, I really wanted to try ring-making

744
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:08,319
Ri-won / It looks really fun

745
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,269
Seo-yeon / I actually like making rings

746
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:11,909
Ri-won / I’ve never tried it

747
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:13,759
Seo-yeon / I haven’t either, not with rings

748
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,709
Seo-yeon / Something quiet

749
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,029
Seo-yeon / Like making rings

750
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:20,759
Seo-yeon / Or doing flower arrangements?

751
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,359
Seo-yeon / I want to do those kinds of dates

752
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:26,149
Seo-yeon / The kind that leave shared memories

753
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,319
Seo-yeon / Something like that

754
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:32,469
Seo-yeon / I’m actually a big introvert

755
00:39:32,479 --> 00:39:35,439
Seo-yeon / But you seem really extroverted

756
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:36,989
Ri-won / I’m super extroverted

757
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:40,749
Ri-won / I don’t really get shy around people

758
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:42,639
Ri-won / I really like being around people

759
00:39:43,479 --> 00:39:45,589
Seo-yeon / So because of that

760
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,189
Seo-yeon / I wonder if it’d make dating a little hard

761
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:52,759
Seo-yeon / That’s what I’ve been thinking

762
00:39:53,479 --> 00:39:56,349
Ri-won / I know exactly what you mean

763
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:00,669
Ri-won / Most of the people I dated

764
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:02,949
Ri-won / Were actually introverts

765
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:05,389
Seo-yeon / Oh really?

766
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:09,599
Ri-won / They were always worried about that part

767
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:13,589
Seo-yeon / But were your personalities compatible?

768
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,679
Ri-won / Of course. All my relationships were long-term

769
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:20,629
Ri-won / So does that mean you prefer someone more serious?

770
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:22,479
Ri-won / Like a calm type?

771
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:27,549
Seo-yeon / Not serious exactly, more like matching energy levels

772
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,909
Ri-won / So like, not draining each other?

773
00:40:29,919 --> 00:40:30,909
Ri-won / You get drained?

774
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,749
Seo-yeon / Yes, exactly

775
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:35,189
Seo-yeon / Right now I’m actually super comfortable

776
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,479
Seo-yeon / This is my usual energy level

777
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:43,989
Seo-yeon / I want someone who can match this tone for a long time

778
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:47,119
Seo-yeon / That’s the kind of girlfriend I want

779
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:50,389
Ri-won / I thought you were super bubbly at first

780
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:52,389
Ri-won / Like a total puppy

781
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:54,949
Seo-yeon / No, I’m really not...

782
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:58,389
Ri-won / I totally thought you were like that

783
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:00,159
Ri-won / That was my first impression

784
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:01,749
Seo-yeon / Other people

785
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:02,789
Seo-yeon / Say that too sometimes

786
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:04,989
Seo-yeon / But honestly, it’s frustrating for me

787
00:41:04,999 --> 00:41:07,469
Seo-yeon / It’s not that I’m in a bad mood

788
00:41:07,479 --> 00:41:09,349
Seo-yeon / I just have low energy by default

789
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,319
Seo-yeon / That’s all it is

790
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:17,389
Ri-won / But I feel like I know who’s on your mind

791
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:18,839
Seo-yeon / I think I do too

792
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:20,559
Ri-won / Who?

793
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,519
Seo-yeon / Han-kyul!

794
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,719
Seo-yeon / You were on dinner duty with Han-kyul, right?

795
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:30,629
Hee-young / Pick one person

796
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,119
Ri-won / Yeah, go ahead and choose

797
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:36,309
Han-kyul / No no no...

798
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,069
Ri-won / Wanna pair with me?

799
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,679
Ri-won / I got up late, so do it with me

800
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,429
Seo-yeon / Let Han-kyul choose whoever she wants

801
00:41:44,439 --> 00:41:46,949
Seo-yeon / I suggested it because it seemed fun

802
00:41:46,959 --> 00:41:48,119
Seo-yeon / But she just jumped on it?

803
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:51,989
Seo-yeon / She kept being really nice to Han-kyul

804
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:55,359
Seo-yeon / So I decided to trust my instincts

805
00:41:57,639 --> 00:41:58,669
Ri-won / No, it's not that

806
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:00,869
Ri-won / I just spent the whole day with Han-kyul

807
00:42:00,879 --> 00:42:01,629
Ri-won / Talking and all, right?

808
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:02,989
Ri-won / And from what I saw

809
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:05,839
Ri-won / She seemed a bit hesitant, like she didn’t want to be a burden?

810
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,229
Ri-won / Someone had to volunteer for the duty

811
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:12,839
Ri-won / And she looked like she was really troubled by it

812
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:16,599
Ri-won / You didn’t notice? Was it just me?

813
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,789
Ri-won / That’s why I suggested doing it

814
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,319
Ri-won / Since I got up the latest

815
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:25,439
Seo-yeon / So it wasn’t because you had feelings for her?

816
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:30,039
Ri-won / Who knows? That part’s a secret

817
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:33,669
Ri-won / Honestly, I was trying to keep it to myself

818
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:35,589
Ri-won / But apparently everyone already knows

819
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,949
Ri-won / That I have feelings for Han-kyul

820
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:39,639
Ri-won / I have no idea how they figured it out

821
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,349
Seo-yeon / So up until now

822
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:46,469
Seo-yeon / I thought you were clearly set on that person

823
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:48,869
Seo-yeon / That’s how I interpreted it

824
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:51,189
Ri-won / I think everyone else thinks the same

825
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,719
Ri-won / The others too

826
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:07,239
Ri-won / Oh~ you're good at this

827
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:09,159
Ri-won / That’s really well done

828
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,399
Ri-won / If there's another chance to go on a date

829
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:16,949
Ri-won / Do you think you'll go with someone from Unit 1?

830
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:18,719
Ri-won / Or from Unit 2?

831
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,789
Ri-won / I get the feeling that you're interested

832
00:43:23,799 --> 00:43:26,159
Ri-won / In someone from Unit 1

833
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,799
Seo-yeon / How did you know?

834
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,509
Ri-won / I’m quick to pick up on things

835
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:34,429
Ri-won / I also knew Mi-rang was from Unit 1

836
00:43:34,439 --> 00:43:36,109
Ri-won / That’s why you two got close, right?

837
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:38,079
Ri-won / Talking about that stuff?

838
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:42,239
Seo-yeon / You’re right, I’m from Unit 1

839
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,639
Ri-won / But you’re not into the same person, are you?

840
00:43:57,919 --> 00:44:01,599
Ri-won / Or maybe you are?

841
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:06,799
Seo-yeon / I confided in her a lot because I trusted her

842
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:09,189
Seo-yeon / About who I was interested in

843
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:11,189
Seo-yeon / Then who I grew interested in next

844
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:13,269
Seo-yeon / How my feelings changed

845
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:14,789
Seo-yeon / But just because I told her that

846
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:18,039
Seo-yeon / Doesn’t mean she can’t make her own choices

847
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:23,709
Seo-yeon / But she didn’t tell me how she really felt

848
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:27,439
Seo-yeon / And then suddenly made that choice, so it caught me off guard

849
00:44:30,479 --> 00:44:35,109
Seo-yeon / There was no expression or mention of it beforehand

850
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,879
Seo-yeon / I honestly didn’t see it coming at all

851
00:45:13,814 --> 00:45:15,679
Seo-yeon / Right? It’s good, huh?

852
00:45:15,693 --> 00:45:17,933
Ri-won / The tea’s really good too

853
00:45:18,493 --> 00:45:22,083
Seo-yeon / Honestly, I want us to drop formal speech already

854
00:45:22,093 --> 00:45:24,453
Ri-won / Me too, seriously, I really want to

855
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:27,203
Ri-won / You know your own age, right?

856
00:45:27,213 --> 00:45:30,093
Ri-won / Do I seem older or younger than you?

857
00:45:31,493 --> 00:45:33,963
Ri-won / Younger!

858
00:45:33,973 --> 00:45:37,013
Ri-won / But you don’t know exactly how much...

859
00:45:37,293 --> 00:45:38,483
Seo-yeon / Definitely younger!

860
00:45:38,493 --> 00:45:40,373
Ri-won / Really?

861
00:45:41,093 --> 00:45:42,883
Seo-yeon / And I like younger people

862
00:45:42,893 --> 00:45:44,523
Ri-won / Oh really? Why not older?

863
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,563
Seo-yeon / It's not that I dislike them

864
00:45:47,573 --> 00:45:51,053
Seo-yeon / My ideal type is just someone a little cute

865
00:45:51,573 --> 00:45:54,003
Seo-yeon / Cute and affectionate

866
00:45:54,013 --> 00:45:56,253
Ri-won / Oh really?

867
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:02,163
Ri-won / So like...

868
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:06,493
Ri-won / Jin-ah seems kind of cute...

869
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:09,243
Ri-won / That’s why I thought you liked Jin-ah

870
00:46:09,253 --> 00:46:10,683
Ri-won / And you, Seo-yeon

871
00:46:10,693 --> 00:46:13,283
Ri-won / And Mi-rang likes

872
00:46:13,293 --> 00:46:15,883
Ri-won / Da-gyo

873
00:46:15,893 --> 00:46:19,123
Ri-won / Jin-ah likes Hee-young

874
00:46:19,133 --> 00:46:21,933
Ri-won / And Hee-young also likes Jin-ah

875
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:28,013
Ri-won / But I’m not sure about Han-kyul...

876
00:46:29,613 --> 00:46:33,493
Ri-won / I’ve just been playing detective on my own

877
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:39,013
Seo-yeon / But do you think if people knew personal info, feelings would change a lot?

878
00:46:39,173 --> 00:46:41,373
Ri-won / I think they totally would

879
00:46:44,893 --> 00:46:46,563
Ri-won / I wouldn't change though

880
00:46:46,573 --> 00:46:49,443
Ri-won / Someone’s age or job

881
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:51,133
Ri-won / That stuff doesn’t matter to me

882
00:46:51,533 --> 00:46:52,243
Ri-won / I wouldn't change my mind

883
00:46:52,253 --> 00:46:54,693
Ri-won / But I think others would change a lot

884
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:58,523
Ri-won / Most people tend to be drawn to those close to their own age

885
00:46:58,533 --> 00:47:01,293
Ri-won / That’s just how it is, I guess

886
00:47:02,093 --> 00:47:05,403
Ri-won / That’s something I’m worried about too

887
00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:07,843
Ri-won / What if the person I like

888
00:47:07,853 --> 00:47:09,683
Ri-won / Doesn’t like me back

889
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,723
Ri-won / Because of my age?

890
00:47:11,733 --> 00:47:14,453
Ri-won / That kind of scares me

891
00:47:21,933 --> 00:47:24,893
Seo-yeon / But what if it’s not about your age

892
00:47:25,573 --> 00:47:28,323
Seo-yeon / What if they just like someone else

893
00:47:28,333 --> 00:47:31,043
Seo-yeon / And they’re not thinking about you that way

894
00:47:31,053 --> 00:47:34,173
Seo-yeon / And they tell you that clearly?

895
00:47:37,893 --> 00:47:38,963
Ri-won / Then I think I’d speak up

896
00:47:38,973 --> 00:47:41,453
Ri-won / And ask for just one chance

897
00:47:41,773 --> 00:47:45,053
Ri-won / I don’t really care what others think

898
00:47:45,813 --> 00:47:48,403
Ri-won / If I like someone

899
00:47:48,413 --> 00:47:49,963
Ri-won / And they say, “Don’t waste your time

900
00:47:49,973 --> 00:47:51,933
Ri-won / Go meet someone else”

901
00:47:52,933 --> 00:47:54,243
Ri-won / I’d think of that date

902
00:47:54,253 --> 00:47:56,243
Ri-won / As a chance to show who I am

903
00:47:56,253 --> 00:47:58,363
Ri-won / So I wouldn’t see it as a waste of time

904
00:47:58,373 --> 00:48:00,363
Ri-won / I’d probably say, “If you’re okay with it, I’d like to go on a date”

905
00:48:00,373 --> 00:48:01,733
Ri-won / That’s what I’d say

906
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:05,933
Seo-yeon / That’s fair

907
00:48:07,253 --> 00:48:09,413
Seo-yeon / That’s kind of moving

908
00:48:12,853 --> 00:48:18,083
Seo-yeon / I’m curious who you'll show that side of yourself to later

909
00:48:18,093 --> 00:48:19,723
Seo-yeon / But you're in Unit 1, right?

910
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:21,003
Seo-yeon / Then

911
00:48:21,013 --> 00:48:22,373
Seo-yeon / That’s a secret

912
00:48:23,013 --> 00:48:25,363
Seo-yeon / But I even said mine, you know?

913
00:48:25,373 --> 00:48:27,483
Ri-won / Do we have to be fair though?

914
00:48:27,493 --> 00:48:28,853
Ri-won / It’s a secret

915
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:32,003
Ri-won / Can you keep it to yourself?

916
00:48:32,013 --> 00:48:32,963
Seo-yeon / Yeah

917
00:48:32,973 --> 00:48:34,013
Ri-won / I’m in Unit 2

918
00:48:34,253 --> 00:48:36,853
Seo-yeon / You’re in Unit 2?

919
00:48:43,653 --> 00:48:45,843
Ri-won / I’m not even interested in anyone in Unit 1

920
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:47,813
Ri-won / Anyone I want to go on a date with

921
00:48:48,373 --> 00:48:50,723
Seo-yeon / Then it really must be Han-kyul...

922
00:48:50,733 --> 00:48:52,133
Ri-won / Not necessarily

923
00:48:53,773 --> 00:48:56,093
Ri-won / You never know

924
00:48:59,413 --> 00:49:02,323
Seo-yeon / Before the date started, I was still in shock

925
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:04,893
Seo-yeon / My brain was just completely blank

926
00:49:05,773 --> 00:49:08,403
Seo-yeon / But as we started talking more

927
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:10,563
Seo-yeon / I got totally immersed in the date

928
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,523
Seo-yeon / And I thought, “Oh? I feel really at ease now”

929
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:15,213
Seo-yeon / I think you're someone who makes people feel that way

930
00:49:15,533 --> 00:49:20,173
Seo-yeon / So I was really thankful

931
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,813
Ri-won / Oh? It’s snowing

932
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:29,013
Ri-won / It was snowing earlier when we were painting

933
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:33,133
Seo-yeon / It goes really well with the winter flowers

934
00:49:33,533 --> 00:49:37,453
Ri-won / I heard it usually doesn’t snow much in Jeju

935
00:49:43,693 --> 00:49:47,363
Ri-won / You asked earlier if I thought I’d cry later

936
00:49:47,373 --> 00:49:49,773
Ri-won / Do you think you will?

937
00:49:51,333 --> 00:49:54,013
Seo-yeon / Honestly

938
00:49:57,973 --> 00:50:00,453
Seo-yeon / I kind of hope I’ll have a reason to cry

939
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:05,443
Ri-won / Like, someone who stirs your heart that much

940
00:50:05,453 --> 00:50:07,813
Ri-won / I hope someone like that comes along

941
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:14,683
Seo-yeon / What about you?

942
00:50:14,693 --> 00:50:15,853
Ri-won / I don’t think I would cry

943
00:50:16,853 --> 00:50:18,333
Seo-yeon / Why not?

944
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:19,883
Ri-won / Would I cry?

945
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:21,403
Seo-yeon / I think you would

946
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:22,653
Ri-won / Why?

947
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,893
Seo-yeon / You seem really heartfelt and intense

948
00:50:26,373 --> 00:50:28,963
Ri-won / Oh, that’s only if I fall in love

949
00:50:28,973 --> 00:50:32,013
Seo-yeon / You're not there yet? Not quite love?

950
00:50:32,493 --> 00:50:35,613
Ri-won / My standards for love are really high

951
00:50:36,653 --> 00:50:38,003
Ri-won / It’s a deeper thing for me

952
00:50:38,013 --> 00:50:39,883
Ri-won / I always think

953
00:50:39,893 --> 00:50:42,403
Ri-won / “I could die for this person”

954
00:50:42,413 --> 00:50:47,123
Ri-won / That’s how I define love

955
00:50:47,133 --> 00:50:50,443
Seo-yeon / So what needs to happen for you to love someone?

956
00:50:50,453 --> 00:50:52,453
Seo-yeon / What does it take?

957
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:55,323
Ri-won / I’m really weak to this one thing

958
00:50:55,333 --> 00:50:57,763
Ri-won / When I feel like, “This person can’t live without me”

959
00:50:57,773 --> 00:50:59,563
Ri-won / “I need to take care of them”

960
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:01,763
Ri-won / “I have to do this for them”

961
00:51:01,773 --> 00:51:05,123
Ri-won / I think I’m drawn to that kind of thing

962
00:51:05,133 --> 00:51:07,813
Ri-won / It’s kind of like maternal instinct?

963
00:51:09,013 --> 00:51:10,163
Ri-won / So

964
00:51:10,173 --> 00:51:11,013
Ri-won / Just

965
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:14,363
Ri-won / I might like someone, sure

966
00:51:14,373 --> 00:51:17,253
Ri-won / But I don’t think I’d cry over it

967
00:51:20,093 --> 00:51:22,643
Ri-won / I talked about this a little with Han-kyul

968
00:51:22,653 --> 00:51:23,963
Ri-won / Not a lot though

969
00:51:23,973 --> 00:51:26,083
Ri-won / I kept falling asleep

970
00:51:26,093 --> 00:51:29,173
Ri-won / But honestly, just from hearing all this

971
00:51:29,373 --> 00:51:32,693
Seo-yeon / It really sounds like you’re talking about Han-kyul

972
00:51:36,533 --> 00:51:38,693
Seo-yeon / Even more like Han-kyul now

973
00:51:39,773 --> 00:51:41,363
Seo-yeon / But if you say it’s not, then fine

974
00:51:41,373 --> 00:51:43,813
Ri-won / You're allowed to think that

975
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:50,283
Ri-won / I think I was more concerned about Han-kyul

976
00:51:50,293 --> 00:51:52,653
Ri-won / Than I realized

977
00:51:54,813 --> 00:51:56,083
Ri-won / I really think so

978
00:51:56,093 --> 00:51:59,043
Ri-won / I think I realized that today

979
00:51:59,053 --> 00:52:02,323
Ri-won / I’m curious about what Han-kyul likes

980
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:05,133
Ri-won / I want to know more about her preferences

981
00:52:06,253 --> 00:52:09,773
Ri-won / I'm going to try harder to flirt

982
00:52:18,293 --> 00:52:21,093
Let's head back~
Thank you~

983
00:52:23,171 --> 00:52:24,997
Jin-ah / Hello

984
00:52:25,007 --> 00:52:26,832
Let me guide you through the experience today

985
00:52:26,842 --> 00:52:29,267
You two will be doing a personalized beer glass making session

986
00:52:29,277 --> 00:52:32,381
It's a custom glass experience just for you

987
00:52:39,554 --> 00:52:41,847
Hope you both have a great time

988
00:52:41,857 --> 00:52:43,982
Let’s head up to the third floor

989
00:52:43,992 --> 00:52:45,684
Jin-ah / Shall we take the stairs?

990
00:52:45,694 --> 00:52:47,486
Hee-young / I’ve never done anything like this before

991
00:52:47,496 --> 00:52:52,567
Hee-young / I’m curious just to learn about beer in general

992
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:56,071
Hee-young / I was just feeling really good overall

993
00:52:59,474 --> 00:53:02,411
Jin-ah / These are totally souvenir-style

994
00:53:02,678 --> 00:53:04,903
Hee-young / They made merch out of beer

995
00:53:04,913 --> 00:53:07,105
Jin-ah / I’ve actually had this brand a lot

996
00:53:07,115 --> 00:53:08,240
Hee-young / You’ve tried all of them?

997
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,441
Jin-ah / I’ve had this one

998
00:53:09,451 --> 00:53:10,452
Jin-ah / The wit ale

999
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,445
Jin-ah / Haven’t tried the black ale...

1000
00:53:13,455 --> 00:53:14,880
Hee-young / What’s “black”?

1001
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:19,528
Jin-ah / That one doesn’t have a strong fruity smell so it’s alright

1002
00:53:19,961 --> 00:53:23,955
Jin-ah / I already liked this beer brand

1003
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:26,625
Jin-ah / I think there’s nothing better than alcohol when getting to know someone

1004
00:53:26,635 --> 00:53:30,238
Jin-ah / So I was really happy

1005
00:53:33,341 --> 00:53:35,277
Jin-ah / This is wine, and this is whiskey

1006
00:53:43,285 --> 00:53:45,944
Hee-young / Cute

1007
00:53:45,954 --> 00:53:49,347
The beers should be tasted left to right

1008
00:53:49,357 --> 00:53:50,949
Our signature, the wit ale

1009
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:52,551
goes well with tangerine chips

1010
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:55,387
Try pairing them together

1011
00:53:55,397 --> 00:53:57,222
Hee-young / Finally...

1012
00:53:57,232 --> 00:53:58,567
Hee-young / I finally get to drink

1013
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,136
Hee-young / My face is glowing

1014
00:54:02,771 --> 00:54:04,473
Hee-young / I gotta take a picture

1015
00:54:15,917 --> 00:54:17,809
Hee-young / Can we take pictures today?

1016
00:54:17,819 --> 00:54:20,489
Jin-ah / Like this from the side? Sure!

1017
00:54:21,523 --> 00:54:24,549
Jin-ah / The beer sampler came with tangerines on top

1018
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,018
Jin-ah / It really felt like, ‘Wow, this is a date’

1019
00:54:27,028 --> 00:54:29,488
Jin-ah / All the pretty little details made me happy

1020
00:54:29,498 --> 00:54:32,734
Jin-ah / I guess I like pretty dates

1021
00:54:33,568 --> 00:54:34,669
Jin-ah / Cheers

1022
00:54:43,178 --> 00:54:44,880
Hee-young / Oh it’s good!

1023
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,205
Hee-young / It’s really good

1024
00:54:47,215 --> 00:54:48,483
Hee-young / It’s not sweet either

1025
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,289
Hee-young / Oh it’s really delicious!

1026
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:58,917
Hee-young / I was worried because I’m not great with beer

1027
00:54:58,927 --> 00:55:02,197
Hee-young / But it was so good, I had so much fun

1028
00:55:12,374 --> 00:55:13,799
Jin-ah / Are fruity flavors okay for you?

1029
00:55:13,809 --> 00:55:14,409
Hee-young / They’re fine

1030
00:55:15,177 --> 00:55:19,638
Jin-ah / I really love doing cheers

1031
00:55:19,648 --> 00:55:21,850
Hee-young / I like “clear cheers,” do you know it?

1032
00:55:22,217 --> 00:55:23,408
Jin-ah / Like this?

1033
00:55:23,418 --> 00:55:24,886
Hee-young / You know it?!

1034
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,789
Hee-young / You can kind of do it with these too

1035
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:37,155
Hello, welcome

1036
00:55:37,165 --> 00:55:38,957
In the personalized beer glass session,

1037
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:41,259
you’ll be doing a self-guided DIY

1038
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:44,062
One thing to note it can’t be changed afterward

1039
00:55:44,072 --> 00:55:46,164
So the key is to apply carefully

1040
00:55:46,174 --> 00:55:48,266
You can go ahead and begin

1041
00:55:48,276 --> 00:55:50,602
Jin-ah / I want to give it as a gift

1042
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:53,215
Jin-ah / But I’m not good with crafts—is that okay?

1043
00:55:53,748 --> 00:55:55,540
Jin-ah / Would you not want to drink from an ugly glass?

1044
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:59,421
Hee-young / It’s the thought that counts because we’re making them for each other

1045
00:55:59,721 --> 00:56:01,880
Hee-young / I’m not confident either...

1046
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:03,181
Hee-young / Let’s just give it a try

1047
00:56:03,191 --> 00:56:06,151
Jin-ah / I really love couple items and stuff like this

1048
00:56:06,161 --> 00:56:09,621
Jin-ah / So the experience itself was totally my style

1049
00:56:09,631 --> 00:56:12,400
Jin-ah / I really loved it

1050
00:56:13,001 --> 00:56:15,026
Jin-ah / I’ll try to make something simple and chic that suits you

1051
00:56:15,036 --> 00:56:16,872
Jin-ah / Leave it to me

1052
00:56:18,073 --> 00:56:20,008
Hee-young / Oh?! Oops!

1053
00:56:21,443 --> 00:56:22,510
Hee-young / More than I thought...

1054
00:56:23,879 --> 00:56:27,415
Jin-ah / Just know that I really tried, okay?

1055
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:33,521
Hee-young / No this seems defective...

1056
00:56:35,657 --> 00:56:36,892
Hee-young / I’m sorry

1057
00:56:39,361 --> 00:56:42,163
Hee-young / I said sorry

1058
00:56:42,497 --> 00:56:45,624
Jin-ah / We said it’s the meaning that counts

1059
00:56:45,634 --> 00:56:47,636
Jin-ah / So it’s okay hehe

1060
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:52,874
Jin-ah / Let’s agree we only apologize up to three times

1061
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:59,004
Jin-ah / But now that it’s the second day, I’m starting to get a feel

1062
00:56:59,014 --> 00:57:01,883
Jin-ah / I’m beginning to see things more clearly with the others

1063
00:57:02,884 --> 00:57:06,021
Jin-ah / But honestly, you were the one I couldn’t read at all

1064
00:57:06,688 --> 00:57:07,679
Hee-young / Huh?

1065
00:57:07,689 --> 00:57:08,924
Hee-young / Me?

1066
00:57:09,758 --> 00:57:11,650
Jin-ah / Can I be really honest?

1067
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:14,296
Jin-ah / Just keep working while I talk

1068
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:16,164
Jin-ah / I felt like...

1069
00:57:17,098 --> 00:57:19,124
Jin-ah / You kept trying to signal

1070
00:57:19,134 --> 00:57:21,826
Jin-ah / That you wanted to explore other people

1071
00:57:21,836 --> 00:57:24,863
Jin-ah / That’s what it felt like to me

1072
00:57:24,873 --> 00:57:26,274
Hee-young / Oh, you mean yesterday?

1073
00:57:26,775 --> 00:57:29,401
Hee-young / But I think it’s actually natural to change your mind early on

1074
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:31,269
Hee-young / That kind of thing happens

1075
00:57:31,279 --> 00:57:33,381
Hee-young / It’s normal really

1076
00:57:33,481 --> 00:57:34,272
Hee-young / You know what I mean?

1077
00:57:34,282 --> 00:57:37,709
Hee-young / Everyone’s “boiling point” is different

1078
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:40,478
Jin-ah / Am I maybe too...

1079
00:57:40,488 --> 00:57:44,059
Hee-young / It’s normal to go back and forth in the beginning

1080
00:57:46,928 --> 00:57:49,220
Jin-ah / Like when you said “Yeah, it’s okay to go check them out”

1081
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:51,823
Jin-ah / That stuck with me

1082
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:54,793
Hee-young / That was honestly just me sharing my thoughts

1083
00:57:54,803 --> 00:57:57,362
Hee-young / Because that topic came up

1084
00:57:57,372 --> 00:57:59,130
Hee-young / It wasn’t a specific situation

1085
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,432
Hee-young / Just a realistic take on things

1086
00:58:00,442 --> 00:58:03,211
Hee-young / I was just sharing my opinion

1087
00:58:03,878 --> 00:58:05,837
Hee-young / It wasn’t something with an ulterior motive

1088
00:58:05,847 --> 00:58:08,216
Hee-young / It wasn’t a calculated move

1089
00:58:08,516 --> 00:58:11,543
Hee-young / Even if someone wanted to explore others, that’s okay

1090
00:58:11,553 --> 00:58:14,656
Hee-young / As long as there’s less pressure

1091
00:58:15,256 --> 00:58:18,126
Jin-ah / I mean of course it’s fine

1092
00:58:18,193 --> 00:58:21,119
Jin-ah / But the thing is, like our dear roommate Da-gyo said

1093
00:58:21,129 --> 00:58:23,431
Jin-ah / Like she said

1094
00:58:23,832 --> 00:58:28,793
Jin-ah / At least... I wanted to hear

1095
00:58:28,803 --> 00:58:31,473
Jin-ah / ‘I want to get to know you’

1096
00:58:32,574 --> 00:58:34,109
Jin-ah / Even if it was something like...

1097
00:58:34,442 --> 00:58:37,502
Jin-ah / ‘This place is special, so I’ll go explore a bit’

1098
00:58:37,512 --> 00:58:40,115
Jin-ah / That would’ve been fine

1099
00:58:40,715 --> 00:58:44,109
Jin-ah / Of course you’re allowed to meet others

1100
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:46,745
Jin-ah / But I wanted to feel like you still had interest in me

1101
00:58:46,755 --> 00:58:50,915
Jin-ah / Even a drop of that would’ve been enough

1102
00:58:50,925 --> 00:58:52,327
Jin-ah / But I didn’t feel it

1103
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,602
Jin-ah / That’s why I thought that way

1104
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,439
Jin-ah / Maybe your first impression changed

1105
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,199
Jin-ah / Or maybe you just wanted to talk to more people

1106
00:59:08,209 --> 00:59:11,980
Jin-ah / Which makes sense, because that’s what we’re here for

1107
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,872
Jin-ah / But since we already had our first date

1108
00:59:13,882 --> 00:59:15,907
Jin-ah / I thought maybe you didn’t want that image to stick

1109
00:59:15,917 --> 00:59:18,520
Jin-ah / That could’ve made you uncomfortable

1110
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:25,717
Hee-young / Honestly, I’ve only had time with you these past two days

1111
00:59:25,727 --> 00:59:29,754
Hee-young / And I did feel like things were moving too fast

1112
00:59:29,764 --> 00:59:32,357
Hee-young / I thought maybe you felt that too

1113
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:33,725
Hee-young / So for today, day two

1114
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:35,160
Hee-young / I thought it’d be good to try a random date

1115
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:38,740
Hee-young / To meet someone totally new

1116
00:59:39,007 --> 00:59:41,466
Hee-young / I thought that might help balance things with you too...

1117
00:59:41,476 --> 00:59:44,279
Hee-young / Just bring some perspective

1118
00:59:48,683 --> 00:59:50,085
Jin-ah / I honestly...

1119
00:59:50,351 --> 00:59:53,655
Jin-ah / I really thought you were trying to let me go

1120
00:59:53,888 --> 00:59:58,259
Jin-ah / Like you wanted to get rid of me

1121
01:00:00,095 --> 01:00:02,397
Jin-ah / Because our first date was so awkward

1122
01:00:03,531 --> 01:00:05,490
Jin-ah / We barely talked

1123
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,192
Jin-ah / And I usually talk more when it’s awkward

1124
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:09,828
Jin-ah / That’s my way of coping

1125
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:13,975
Hee-young / Did I just talk about myself too much?

1126
01:00:14,075 --> 01:00:15,900
Jin-ah / I felt like I gave you too much reason

1127
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:17,035
Jin-ah / To think we weren’t a match

1128
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:19,414
Jin-ah / Maybe I opened that door too wide

1129
01:00:20,915 --> 01:00:25,677
Jin-ah / Maybe it’s just me overthinking because I’m sensitive

1130
01:00:25,687 --> 01:00:27,879
Jin-ah / But once we were actually on a 1-on-1

1131
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:29,848
Jin-ah / I started to wonder if you felt uncomfortable

1132
01:00:29,858 --> 01:00:33,585
Jin-ah / Or if you were just curious about someone else

1133
01:00:33,595 --> 01:00:35,630
Jin-ah / Those thoughts kept popping up

1134
01:00:35,797 --> 01:00:38,633
Jin-ah / And that kind of made me feel a bit sad

1135
01:00:43,738 --> 01:00:44,829
Hee-young / To be honest, I’m

1136
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:46,564
Hee-young / Someone who’s slow and cautious when getting to know people

1137
01:00:46,574 --> 01:00:48,466
Hee-young / I think I mentioned that before

1138
01:00:48,476 --> 01:00:51,779
Hee-young / So I assumed you’d understand that

1139
01:00:52,313 --> 01:00:53,938
Hee-young / When things move too fast like that

1140
01:00:53,948 --> 01:00:58,510
Hee-young / I tend to get overwhelmed

1141
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,911
Hee-young / But at the same time

1142
01:00:59,921 --> 01:01:02,857
Hee-young / I also really don’t want to pressure the other person

1143
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:06,451
Hee-young / So however you feel about it

1144
01:01:06,461 --> 01:01:08,820
Hee-young / From my perspective

1145
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:12,901
Hee-young / Things getting defined so quickly is a bit...

1146
01:01:13,201 --> 01:01:16,161
Hee-young / My choices should come from my genuine feelings

1147
01:01:16,171 --> 01:01:17,829
Hee-young / From my own free thinking

1148
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,941
Hee-young / That’s what matters to me

1149
01:01:20,408 --> 01:01:23,011
Hee-young / I put a lot of value in that

1150
01:01:24,445 --> 01:01:26,848
Hee-young / To be honest

1151
01:01:27,115 --> 01:01:28,640
Hee-young / Yeah, I probably showed it

1152
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:29,941
Hee-young / I'm a very honest person

1153
01:01:29,951 --> 01:01:32,854
Hee-young / I can't help but say what I'm thinking...

1154
01:01:33,354 --> 01:01:36,080
Hee-young / When everything starts feeling like “this is the only way”

1155
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:38,149
Hee-young / That feels suffocating to me

1156
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:39,551
Hee-young / So from my point of view

1157
01:01:39,561 --> 01:01:43,188
Hee-young / I was just trying to say that “going too fast doesn’t suit me”

1158
01:01:43,198 --> 01:01:45,366
Hee-young / I was just being honest about myself

1159
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:46,724
Hee-young / There wasn’t any hidden meaning

1160
01:01:46,734 --> 01:01:47,192
Hee-young / Really

1161
01:01:47,202 --> 01:01:49,394
Jin-ah / But now that you’ve said this

1162
01:01:49,404 --> 01:01:52,964
Jin-ah / Even if you go on a date with someone else

1163
01:01:52,974 --> 01:01:55,900
Jin-ah / It doesn’t feel so heavy or serious

1164
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:58,980
Jin-ah / It’s less pressure now

1165
01:02:01,449 --> 01:02:04,742
Jin-ah / I used to worry that my actions might give the wrong idea

1166
01:02:04,752 --> 01:02:07,245
Jin-ah / That maybe it meant there was nothing between us

1167
01:02:07,255 --> 01:02:08,590
Jin-ah / So it’s actually a relief

1168
01:02:09,257 --> 01:02:11,749
Jin-ah / Still, I did want

1169
01:02:11,759 --> 01:02:14,429
Jin-ah / To go on at least one more date

1170
01:02:14,729 --> 01:02:15,987
Jin-ah / Just one more, really

1171
01:02:15,997 --> 01:02:16,988
Jin-ah / One more date

1172
01:02:16,998 --> 01:02:17,755
Hee-young / Then after that

1173
01:02:17,765 --> 01:02:19,934
Hee-young / You’d be open to meeting someone else?

1174
01:02:21,603 --> 01:02:24,172
Jin-ah / I just really wanted one more

1175
01:02:28,443 --> 01:02:31,069
Hee-young / So far only one person has shown interest in me

1176
01:02:31,079 --> 01:02:34,449
Hee-young / And that’s also the only person I feel interested in

1177
01:02:34,749 --> 01:02:37,819
Hee-young / But it felt like I was getting tied only to this one person

1178
01:02:37,919 --> 01:02:40,455
Hee-young / And that felt too fast for me

1179
01:02:47,095 --> 01:02:49,420
Hee-young / Once I felt that it was too fast

1180
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:51,633
Hee-young / I kind of pulled back a bit

1181
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,570
Hee-young / Today I just feel confused

1182
01:02:56,437 --> 01:03:00,141
Hee-young / I want to take things slow...

1183
01:03:02,243 --> 01:03:03,835
Jin-ah / Maybe it's just a difference in how we express things

1184
01:03:03,845 --> 01:03:08,706
Jin-ah / But it felt like we were really out of sync

1185
01:03:08,716 --> 01:03:09,641
Jin-ah / Even when talking in a group

1186
01:03:09,651 --> 01:03:12,644
Jin-ah / I would say “I want to get to know you more”

1187
01:03:12,654 --> 01:03:15,313
Jin-ah / But you’d say “It’s fine to explore different people”

1188
01:03:15,323 --> 01:03:17,081
Jin-ah / That kind of response

1189
01:03:17,091 --> 01:03:19,684
Jin-ah / It made me wonder if we could be anything more

1190
01:03:19,694 --> 01:03:21,319
Jin-ah / Even just a little bit more special

1191
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:25,767
Jin-ah / But now it just all feels so unclear
