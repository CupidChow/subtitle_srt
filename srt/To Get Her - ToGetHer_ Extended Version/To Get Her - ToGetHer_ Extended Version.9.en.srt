1
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,092
Mi-rang / Was I the only one who didn’t get it?

2
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,016
Da-gyo / What? What is it?

3
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:01,551
Mi-rang / Why did Seo-yeon get to choose?

4
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,286
Da-gyo / Seo-yeon had the date invitation card

5
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,487
Da-gyo / and she invited you to a one-on-one

6
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,099
Da-gyo / date, right?

7
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:09,526
Mi-rang / Wait, why? Was it because of the clover?

8
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,061
Da-gyo / Yeah, she got the 'room choice' card

9
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,963
Da-gyo / and the 'date invitation' card too!

10
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:17,167
Da-gyo / Seo-yeon invited you on a date

11
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:20,113
Da-gyo / You’re such a popular girl!

12
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:27,620
Mi-rang / I seriously wasn’t thinking about anything

13
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,946
Da-gyo / Yeah right, and you told me not to go on a date!

14
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:34,661
Da-gyo / Why are you acting like you're the one going on a date?

15
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,722
Da-gyo / I can’t even say “Don’t go on the date”

16
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:40,800
Da-gyo / Have a good time then

17
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:48,364
Da-gyo / So Seo-yeon picked Mi-rang for a one-on-one date

18
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,534
Da-gyo / Normally the roommates go on the date together

19
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,370
Da-gyo / But Seo-yeon picked Mi-rang and went out with her

20
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,606
Da-gyo / So I ended up going on the date

21
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,508
Da-gyo / with Hee-young who was left

22
00:01:58,518 --> 00:01:59,442
Da-gyo / The whole thing was hilarious

23
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,411
Da-gyo / Literally like one minute before that

24
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,379
Da-gyo / I was thinking, “If you gets serious and tells me not to go”

25
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,948
Da-gyo / “Then I won’t go”

26
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,750
Da-gyo / But then suddenly she tells me to go

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,820
Da-gyo / It felt like a scene out of a drama

28
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,256
Mi-rang / Someone who wasn’t thinking anything

29
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:16,025
Mi-rang / suddenly invited me to a one-on-one date

30
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,495
Mi-rang / So I got really curious

31
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,572
Mi-rang / about what feelings she had

32
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,565
Da-gyo / You said that note yesterday made you all confused

33
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,977
Da-gyo / Well, I guess here’s your answer

34
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,112
Da-gyo / It must’ve been a note from Seo-yeon

35
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,950
Mi-rang / That feeling I got earlier… while talking…

36
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,247
Da-gyo / Have a nice time…

37
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,384
Mi-rang / Then why did you and I end up in the same room…

38
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,662
Da-gyo / Right?

39
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:55,098
Seo-yeon / There was something I wanted to address about the whole card draw situation with Da-gyo

40
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,768
Seo-yeon / Maybe there was lingering tension between us

41
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,781
Seo-yeon / But I just wanted to stir things up

42
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,574
Seo-yeon / Honestly, I just wanted to attack a little

43
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,120
Seo-yeon / I just wanted to mess with her

44
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,190
Seo-yeon / Ugh, when do I go out?

45
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,026
Hee-young / So you used your date ticket and were just singing?

46
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,688
Hee-young / But for a potluck party

47
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,522
Hee-young / aren’t you supposed to make food?

48
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,500
Hee-young / Can’t we just buy it?

49
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,325
Seo-yeon / As long as we bring food, it’s fine

50
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,695
Hee-young / So we’re just doing order and pickup now

51
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,931
Han-kyul / What do you want to pick up?

52
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,912
Ri-won / I want hotpot or spring rolls

53
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,071
Ri-won / I really love spring rolls

54
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,482
Han-kyul / I don’t think anyone will choose the same thing

55
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,581
Jin-ah / Oh, this is it

56
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:48,294
Jin-ah / Pajama party

57
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,853
Jin-ah / But just saying it out loud feels refreshing

58
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,732
Jin-ah / What should we make though?

59
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,686
Seo-yeon / Why do you think

60
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:26,199
Seo-yeon / I asked you out on a date?

61
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,702
Mi-rang / I had two thoughts

62
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:34,107
Mi-rang / One was “Did she have feelings for me?”

63
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,509
Mi-rang / And the other was “Because we’re comfortable?”

64
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,270
Mi-rang / We had talked a lot, right?

65
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,404
Seo-yeon / Yeah

66
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,683
Mi-rang / So...

67
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,953
Mi-rang / I also wanted to ask you the same thing

68
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,846
Seo-yeon / But whether it’s the first reason or the second

69
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,326
Seo-yeon / If I asked you on a date

70
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,485
Seo-yeon / Da-gyo is in the picture for you

71
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:58,288
Seo-yeon / So it would mean I made a choice

72
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,256
Seo-yeon / without considering your relationship with Da-gyo

73
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,802
Seo-yeon / What do you think about that?

74
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:03,526
Mi-rang / But...

75
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,004
Seo-yeon / Isn’t that kind of a bad move?

76
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,196
Mi-rang / Not really. We’re here to date

77
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:10,767
Mi-rang / and find someone to connect with

78
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,703
Mi-rang / And you get to make your own choices

79
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,338
Seo-yeon / True

80
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,717
Mi-rang / I always tell people here

81
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,619
Mi-rang / not to worry about what others think

82
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:22,121
Seo-yeon / Yeah

83
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,279
Mi-rang / So I just hope

84
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,549
Hee-young / that you don’t feel too burdened by it

85
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:30,553
Mi-rang / Was that what was really bothering you?

86
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,187
Seo-yeon / What do you mean?

87
00:05:32,197 --> 00:05:35,791
Mi-rang / You were worried about Da-gyo and me?

88
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,770
Seo-yeon / No?

89
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:10,593
Mi-rang / Whoa what is this?

90
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:11,904
Seo-yeon / Cake

91
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,642
Mi-rang / Are we making a cake?

92
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:17,844
Seo-yeon / Have you ever tried?

93
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,678
Mi-rang / Not even once

94
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,522
Seo-yeon / Tangerine pie

95
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,092
Mi-rang / This is my first time making this

96
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,731
Mi-rang / Smells like yogurt

97
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:39,799
Seo-yeon / Oh yeah it does

98
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:40,957
Mi-rang / Did you do this?

99
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:41,634
Seo-yeon / Yeah

100
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,696
Seo-yeon / But there’s something I’ve been wondering

101
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:50,032
Seo-yeon / That date when we picked cards…

102
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,300
Seo-yeon / The day we picked the same one

103
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,104
Seo-yeon / Why did you suddenly pick the same card as Da-gyo

104
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,583
Seo-yeon / without even giving me a heads-up?

105
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:04,580
Mi-rang / It was the first day, you know

106
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,982
Mi-rang / I didn’t feel certain about Da-gyo

107
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:07,783
Mi-rang / or anything like that

108
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:08,684
Mi-rang / And when you said

109
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,964
Mi-rang / that you liked Da-gyo

110
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:16,035
Mi-rang / we hadn’t even known each other that long

111
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,193
Mi-rang / and I didn’t feel sure either

112
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:19,729
Mi-rang / So I just thought

113
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,475
Mi-rang / “Oh, so we like the same person”

114
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,368
Mi-rang / That was really it

115
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,603
Seo-yeon / Hmm…

116
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:31,517
Seo-yeon / But when I came to you for advice

117
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,976
Seo-yeon / and told you what I was going through

118
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:36,746
Seo-yeon / I  thought you’d at least give me a heads-up or something

119
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,357
Seo-yeon / I was expecting that

120
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,349
Mi-rang / But here’s the thing

121
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:45,287
Mi-rang / I wasn’t 100% sure I wanted to go on a date with Da-gyo that day

122
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:48,434
Mi-rang / I honestly didn’t even know how it worked on day one

123
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,326
Mi-rang / I didn’t even know if we’d be going on dates

124
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,228
Mi-rang / It was all so unclear

125
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,897
Mi-rang / But at first, I actually wanted

126
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:58,868
Mi-rang / to go on a date with Jin-ah that day

127
00:07:58,878 --> 00:07:59,535
Mi-rang / That was my first thought

128
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,980
Mi-rang / Honestly

129
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:05,251
Seo-yeon / Oh really?
Mi-rang / Yeah,  but that day…

130
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,578
Mi-rang / Da-gyo just stood out more than Jin-ah

131
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,856
Seo-yeon / Ah

132
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,215
Mi-rang / And if there was really someone else

133
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,493
Mi-rang / I liked way more

134
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,917
Mi-rang / I would've picked them to go on the date

135
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,562
Mi-rang / But I felt the same toward both

136
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,189
Mi-rang / And in that moment

137
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,037
Mi-rang / I didn’t want to show who I liked more between them

138
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,230
Mi-rang / I didn’t want to make it obvious

139
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,335
Seo-yeon / Then didn’t you care how I felt?

140
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:36,148
Seo-yeon / I liked Da-gyo

141
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,742
Seo-yeon / I even talked to you about it

142
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:43,189
Mi-rang / But the thing is…

143
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,449
Mi-rang / I didn’t know how deep your feelings were

144
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,451
Mi-rang / It was only the first day

145
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,985
Mi-rang / I didn’t know how serious you were

146
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:51,764
Mi-rang / I thought it was just a light interest

147
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,324
Mi-rang / And even though you opened up to me

148
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,527
Mi-rang / I didn’t open up to you

149
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,106
Mi-rang / That’s the only real issue here

150
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:04,066
Mi-rang / Because honestly, If I had been really into Da-gyo

151
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,245
Mi-rang / I would’ve told you, “Yeah, I like her too”

152
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,371
Mi-rang / I would've been upfront about it

153
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,606
Mi-rang / But back then, I didn’t feel that way

154
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,042
Mi-rang / Even going on the date wasn’t because I really liked her

155
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,043
Mi-rang / It wasn’t like “I have to date this person”

156
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,012
Mi-rang / It wasn’t like I had deep feelings

157
00:09:17,022 --> 00:09:19,492
Mi-rang / And not just you, but with the others too

158
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:20,749
Mi-rang / Everyone told me

159
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,985
Mi-rang / who they liked and all that

160
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,487
Mi-rang / Honestly, I can’t remember who said what

161
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:27,099
Mi-rang / I couldn’t keep track

162
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,093
Mi-rang / So I just told myself not to care about others

163
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,661
Mi-rang / “Just go with who I want”

164
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,665
Mi-rang / That’s all it was for me, really simple

165
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:40,780
Mi-rang / So… were you really bothered by that?

166
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:46,809
Seo-yeon / I don’t have any older sister figures around me

167
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:48,377
Seo-yeon / You’re the first one I’ve called “unnie(older sister)”

168
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,755
Seo-yeon / You were my first unnie

169
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,915
Seo-yeon / And in the house

170
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,961
Seo-yeon / you were the first person I went to

171
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:58,531
Seo-yeon / for advice and emotional support

172
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:03,769
Seo-yeon / So because of that
Mi-rang / You felt betrayed?

173
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:08,264
Seo-yeon / Yeah, I felt kind of betrayed

174
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:13,569
Mi-rang / That might really be my fault, but

175
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,872
Mi-rang / I honestly didn’t think it was that deep

176
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,375
Mi-rang / That’s the truth

177
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,844
Mi-rang / I think because I’m simple-minded

178
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,713
Mi-rang / I assumed other people were too

179
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:27,259
Mi-rang / So I didn’t know you thought this deeply

180
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,317
Mi-rang / I really didn’t know

181
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:32,054
Mi-rang / I’m  only finding out now from you

182
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,723
Mi-rang / But honestly

183
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,358
Mi-rang / I don’t think you should act based on my feelings

184
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:37,893
Mi-rang / Like watching what you say around me

185
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,140
Mi-rang / You didn’t come here to find a close friend

186
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:46,802
Seo-yeon / I didn’t come here to find friend

187
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,939
Seo-yeon / But with you...

188
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,218
Seo-yeon / I don’t even know, with you...

189
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:57,990
Seo-yeon / I really liked you

190
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,294
Mi-rang / As an unnie?

191
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,457
Seo-yeon / As an unnie, yes

192
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,560
Seo-yeon / And after Da-gyo

193
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,274
Seo-yeon / you were someone I liked as a potential romantic partner too

194
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,408
Seo-yeon / You’re probably shocked and confused

195
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:30,256
Seo-yeon / by me saying all this right now, aren’t you?

196
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:36,762
Mi-rang / Yeah, it’s confusing and overwhelming

197
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,789
Seo-yeon / I think it’s because I’m not a simple person

198
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,658
Mi-rang / But I’m glad you were honest with me

199
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:47,239
Mi-rang / I understand how you feel now

200
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:51,434
Mi-rang / And I feel bad about it too
Seo-yeon / You feel bad?

201
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,380
Mi-rang / Of course. I was so clueless

202
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:58,039
Mi-rang / Going on and on like things were going well with Da-gyo

203
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:03,145
Mi-rang / I was saying all that to you, but

204
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,925
Mi-rang / I never meant to hurt your feelings

205
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:11,654
Mi-rang / But since we shared a room

206
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,489
Mi-rang / and I had no one else to talk to

207
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,657
Mi-rang / I just naturally talked to you

208
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,170
Mi-rang / I wasn’t thinking about your feelings

209
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,145
Seo-yeon / I think I just didn’t want you to feel at peace

210
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,238
Seo-yeon / Like wanting to toss a stone into a calm lake

211
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,551
Seo-yeon / That’s how I felt

212
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,922
Mi-rang / I really am sorry, Seo-yeon...

213
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,080
Mi-rang / So that note yesterday—

214
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,715
Mi-rang / You’re saying it wasn’t from you?

215
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:44,163
Seo-yeon / I kept writing to Da-gyo the whole time

216
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,524
Seo-yeon / But then the day before yesterday

217
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:55,808
Seo-yeon / toward you, I felt a bit.. a little...

218
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,699
Mi-rang / Hurt?

219
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:01,770
Seo-yeon / I don’t know... maybe something like that

220
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,976
Seo-yeon / That card... it really had a big impact

221
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:12,848
Seo-yeon / I think I just wanted to throw a stone

222
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,161
Seo-yeon / into your heart too

223
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,320
Mi-rang / Huh? Throw what?

224
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,855
Mi-rang / You wanna play around?

225
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,701
Seo-yeon / I mean I wanted to toss a stone into your heart too

226
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,239
Seo-yeon / Just...

227
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,542
Seo-yeon / I wanted to shake you up a bit

228
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,171
Seo-yeon / So that’s why...

229
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,606
Mi-rang / That’s why you wrote it like that?

230
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,541
Seo-yeon / Yeah

231
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:43,612
Mi-rang / Honestly, it did shake me up like you said

232
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,192
Mi-rang / I thought I hurt you

233
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:51,120
Mi-rang / I can be so oblivious sometimes

234
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,700
Mi-rang / I kept talking to you about Da-gyo

235
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,792
Mi-rang / Thinking you weren’t interested in me

236
00:13:57,802 --> 00:13:59,527
Mi-rang / But now suddenly

237
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:00,596
Mi-rang / I’m thinking

238
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,065
Mi-rang / “Have I been hurting her all this time?”

239
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,100
Mi-rang / That thought really brought me down

240
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,012
Mi-rang / It weighed on me so much

241
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:18,657
Seo-yeon / I liked you too...

242
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,961
Seo-yeon / I couldn’t hide my face

243
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,430
Seo-yeon / My lips were literally trembling

244
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:28,390
Seo-yeon / I could feel how flustered I was

245
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,502
Seo-yeon / It hurt a little too

246
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,763
Mi-rang / I...

247
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:37,042
Seo-yeon / Don’t change the subject

248
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,100
Seo-yeon / What are you trying to say?

249
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,502
Mi-rang / I don’t think you’ve fully sorted out

250
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:41,637
Mi-rang / your feelings yet

251
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,706
Seo-yeon / I probably haven’t

252
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,275
Mi-rang / When I look at you, your feelings...

253
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:50,446
Mi-rang / I can't tell if it's because you hate me

254
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,258
Mi-rang / or if it's because you like me

255
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,226
Mi-rang / I don't think you even know for sure

256
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,451
Seo-yeon / Feelings aren’t that simple...

257
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:58,453
Mi-rang / Listening to you makes me confused

258
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:02,067
Seo-yeon / It's not something that’s black and white...

259
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,358
Seo-yeon / But Da-gyo...

260
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,884
Seo-yeon / Of course I had romantic feelings

261
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,931
Seo-yeon / Da-gyo was always my top choice

262
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:36,158
Seo-yeon / But the one I liked more as a person

263
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,037
Seo-yeon / was always you,

264
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,406
Seo-yeon / So...

265
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,811
Seo-yeon / So...

266
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:56,088
Seo-yeon / I tried to help you and Da-gyo become closer

267
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:02,785
Seo-yeon / I arranged the room assignments for that too

268
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,698
Mi-rang / I actually was wondering about that

269
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:15,474
Seo-yeon / That’s just how I felt...

270
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:26,174
Mi-rang / Then why did you keep writing notes to Da-gyo?

271
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:27,686
Seo-yeon / Because at the time

272
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,578
Seo-yeon / I hadn’t fully given up

273
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,379
Mi-rang / Given up on who?

274
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,513
Seo-yeon / On Da-gyo

275
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:36,051
Seo-yeon / The moment I gave up on her was...

276
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:40,733
Mi-rang / When you sent me that “I like you” note

277
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,002
Mi-rang / Hmm...

278
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:48,040
Mi-rang / I think I get it now

279
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:01,286
Seo-yeon / That note was my way of showing I gave up

280
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,246
Mi-rang / So basically

281
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:09,595
Mi-rang / You liked two people in this house

282
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:14,255
Mi-rang / And now those two are getting along

283
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:16,135
Mi-rang / And you're just watching that happen

284
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:22,474
Mi-rang / You gave up on Da-gyo

285
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:26,969
Mi-rang / And now your feelings... ended up here, with me?

286
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,747
Mi-rang / Is that it?

287
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,607
Mi-rang / I mean... I don’t know...

288
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,752
Seo-yeon / No, it’s not like that now

289
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,488
Seo-yeon / Ugh this is so frustrating

290
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:40,883
Seo-yeon / Seriously

291
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,396
Seo-yeon / I mean

292
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,656
Seo-yeon / I said it was revenge on you

293
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,925
Mi-rang / First it’s revenge, now you say you like me

294
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:54,039
Mi-rang / It's so confusing, Seriously confusing...

295
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,932
Seo-yeon / That confusion is the revenge

296
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,501
Seo-yeon / I wanted to confuse you

297
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,903
Seo-yeon / You hurt me and just what?

298
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,083
Seo-yeon / You thought you could just go on and be happy?!

299
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,775
Mi-rang / What the heck...

300
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:11,780
Seo-yeon / If you’re comfortable, that’s not revenge

301
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,017
Seo-yeon / If your heart’s at ease, it doesn’t count

302
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:19,364
Mi-rang / Are you acting right now? Are you an actress or something?

303
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,724
Seo-yeon / No, you’re just so frustrating

304
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:24,093
Seo-yeon / I talk and you don’t get it

305
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,872
Seo-yeon / Wouldn’t I get angry?

306
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:35,247
Mi-rang / Oh my god...
Seo-yeon / I was really sad earlier, but now I’m just mad!

307
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:38,117
Seo-yeon / Seriously

308
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,810
Mi-rang / So in the end

309
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,678
Mi-rang / You liked Da-gyo so much

310
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:45,491
Mi-rang / That you took it out on me?

311
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,584
Seo-yeon / Ugh... this is stressful

312
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:52,564
Seo-yeon / How could you even date Da-gyo?

313
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,600
Seo-yeon / Is she some kind of volunteer?

314
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,525
Mi-rang / What do you mean date! We’re not even dating yet

315
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,127
Seo-yeon / Whatever...

316
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,807
Mi-rang / I don’t know, I really can’t understand any of this

317
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,167
Seo-yeon / It just felt like you couldn’t understand my feelings

318
00:19:06,177 --> 00:19:08,036
Seo-yeon / And that was really frustrating

319
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,306
Seo-yeon / I was just this upset, that’s all

320
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,920
Mi-rang / You were talking about how much you liked Da-gyo

321
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:19,224
Mi-rang / And then all of a sudden you say you like me?

322
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,729
Mi-rang / I don’t even know if you really mean it

323
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:28,567
Mi-rang / My emotions are a mess right now

324
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,879
Hee-young / It’s beautiful

325
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,947
Da-gyo / It’s really sparkling today

326
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:55,016
Da-gyo / The sunlight’s so strong

327
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:56,562
Da-gyo / The wind is pretty strong too

328
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,197
Hee-young / The sun’s hitting this spot

329
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,088
Hee-young / Even the blue looks pretty

330
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,058
Da-gyo / This is the clearest day since we got here

331
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,659
Hee-young / Best weather so far

332
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:06,171
Hee-young / The water’s so clear too

333
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,432
Da-gyo / Your outfit today matches the sea perfectly

334
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,977
Da-gyo / The colors go really well

335
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,848
Hee-young / Maybe I subconsciously knew we’d be by the sea

336
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:21,809
Da-gyo / At our place we can only see a bit of the windmill

337
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:23,377
Da-gyo / But here we can see everything

338
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:29,528
Hee-young / Is that the same windmill we see from the house?
Da-gyo / Huh? I’m not sure about that

339
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,734
Da-gyo / The wind really is blowing hard

340
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,707
Da-gyo / But there’s something romantic about the winter sea

341
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,069
Hee-young / So

342
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,237
Da-gyo / Yeah?

343
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,514
Hee-young / Today

344
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:52,974
Hee-young / is our first actual date, right?

345
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,175
Hee-young / How was it?

346
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:55,844
Da-gyo / How I felt?

347
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:56,945
Hee-young / When did you kno—

348
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,747
Hee-young / You didn’t get the message that we had a date?

349
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,658
Da-gyo / I did

350
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,585
Da-gyo / I sent you a note yesterday

351
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,687
Da-gyo / So yeah...

352
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,122
Da-gyo / That’s what happened

353
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,491
Hee-young / Oh... I read it yesterday

354
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,103
Da-gyo / Did you get a lot of notes yesterday?

355
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,062
Da-gyo / You don’t know?

356
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:14,606
Hee-young / I don’t know...

357
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,365
Da-gyo / You can’t tell me?

358
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,444
Da-gyo / I mean, even just like “a lot” or “not many”

359
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,571
Da-gyo / Was it just normal? average?

360
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,005
Hee-young / I got some

361
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:26,318
Da-gyo / I figured you did

362
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:30,379
Da-gyo / I sent mine here, after all

363
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,581
Hee-young / But I thought you

364
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,483
Hee-young / and Mi-rang were hitting it off

365
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,852
Hee-young / So I was confused why you sent it to me

366
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,789
Da-gyo / When I first got here, that first day...

367
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,170
Da-gyo / Honestly, I wasn’t interested in anyone at first

368
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,761
Da-gyo / I didn’t know who was who

369
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,440
Da-gyo / No one went on a date yet

370
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,298
Da-gyo / I didn’t go on one either

371
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:49,898
Hee-young / Right

372
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:51,699
Da-gyo / So that day, I just chose

373
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:53,968
Da-gyo / someone who was kind to me as a person

374
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:58,006
Da-gyo / I wrote to the person who made a good human impression

375
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,042
Da-gyo / Then that evening

376
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:04,713
Da-gyo / After spending a day observing people

377
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,982
Da-gyo / I realized the ones I liked were

378
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,660
Da-gyo / Mi-rang and you, Hee-young

379
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,297
Da-gyo / Then the next day I went on a date

380
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,456
Da-gyo / with Mi-rang first

381
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,868
Da-gyo / You went out with Jin-ah

382
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:17,426
Da-gyo / But you

383
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,127
Hee-young / I wasn’t thinking about anyone romantically

384
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:22,463
Da-gyo / And the three of us were roommates, so

385
00:22:22,473 --> 00:22:24,076
Da-gyo / I heard you talking

386
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,134
Da-gyo / I could’ve tried to snatch you away

387
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,936
Da-gyo / I could’ve stirred up trouble between you two

388
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,137
Da-gyo / Split you up, played dirty, but

389
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,482
Da-gyo / You’re both good people

390
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,707
Da-gyo / There was no need to be like that

391
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:34,242
Da-gyo / If you two are meant to be

392
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:35,510
Da-gyo / You’ll make it happen

393
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,546
Da-gyo / And if I show interest too

394
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:42,860
Da-gyo / Whoever things work out with, they will
Hee-young / Right, right

395
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:46,354
Da-gyo / Anyway, since I had feelings for two people

396
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:49,324
Da-gyo / I didn’t want to just keep it inside

397
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:51,436
Da-gyo / Not writing to you felt wrong

398
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,163
Da-gyo / So I finally wrote and made it clear

399
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:58,777
Hee-young / So that was the first time you sent me a note?

400
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,535
Da-gyo / Yeah

401
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,037
Da-gyo / I wanted to make sure you knew

402
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:04,605
Da-gyo / Because you kept saying

403
00:23:04,615 --> 00:23:08,142
Da-gyo / “Nobody likes me”

404
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:10,078
Da-gyo / I said “Maybe there is someone who does”

405
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:11,546
Da-gyo / But you insisted “No, there’s no one”

406
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,215
Da-gyo / So coldly

407
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,394
Hee-young / I really believed that

408
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,529
Hee-young / But you also never showed anything

409
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:21,856
Hee-young / I mean, not even a sign

410
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:24,459
Da-gyo / That’s true, but still

411
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,703
Da-gyo / I didn’t get a chance to show it

412
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:26,895
Hee-young / Right, right. Given the situation

413
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,830
Da-gyo / The timing just didn’t work out

414
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,776
Da-gyo / That’s why it ended up like that

415
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,537
Da-gyo / I just didn’t want to have regrets

416
00:23:35,547 --> 00:23:37,048
Da-gyo / I didn’t want to leave without showing my feelings

417
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,619
Da-gyo / I didn’t want to go without doing anything

418
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,312
Da-gyo / So...

419
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,758
Da-gyo / That’s why I asked you on a date yesterday

420
00:23:47,392 --> 00:23:49,661
Hee-young / Before the go-kart ride?

421
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:53,020
Hee-young / I see

422
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,488
Da-gyo / I even told Mi-rang the day before

423
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:55,800
Da-gyo / Because I thought that was the respectful thing to do

424
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,628
Da-gyo / That’s what I believe is right

425
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,562
Hee-young / You told her what?

426
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:03,208
Da-gyo / That I had feelings for both of you

427
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,167
Hee-young / You told her you liked me?

428
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,178
Da-gyo / I did

429
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,203
Da-gyo / For someone who’s been open and honest with me

430
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:11,139
Da-gyo / I wanted to give my best in return

431
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:13,207
Hee-young / Being honest is always better

432
00:24:13,217 --> 00:24:16,154
Da-gyo / I didn’t want to hide it and make things confusing

433
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,246
Da-gyo / Confused...

434
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,115
Da-gyo / I think I already made things confusing though

435
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,595
Hee-young / But I just didn’t want to be a coward
Da-gyo / Yeah yeah yeah, that’s it, so

436
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,997
Hee-young / That’s why I came here

437
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:31,670
Da-gyo / So, I sent a date request to you

438
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,299
Da-gyo / After talking outside

439
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,267
Da-gyo / Since I expressed that I had feelings for both

440
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,203
Da-gyo / I don’t regret it, I think?

441
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:44,739
Da-gyo / I’m glad I wrote that note and made it obvious

442
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,285
Da-gyo / I think that helped me move on

443
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,455
Hee-young / Thank you, really...

444
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,594
Hee-young / You must have been so frustrated

445
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:56,918
Da-gyo / No

446
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,965
Da-gyo / Okay, saying “no” is a lie honestly

447
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,690
Da-gyo / It’s just, hearing both sides constantly

448
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,259
Da-gyo / And hearing you both explain things so differently

449
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:06,161
Da-gyo / With Jin-ah

450
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,796
Da-gyo / You went on two dates in a row with her

451
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:10,198
Da-gyo / Like you were really going straight for her

452
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,700
Da-gyo / So I wondered if I could even express my feelings

453
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,770
Da-gyo / I was worried about that and the vibe in our room is so good

454
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,740
Da-gyo / We roommates are really close

455
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,308
Da-gyo / I didn’t want to mess that up

456
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,577
Da-gyo / I was thinking about that too

457
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:25,046
Da-gyo / And also

458
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:25,957
Hee-young / From what I can feel

459
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,884
Hee-young / You’re someone who is truly kind from deep inside

460
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:33,421
Hee-young / You’re just naturally good-hearted, so

461
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:36,091
Hee-young / You really know how to consider all the possibilities in people’s hearts

462
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:38,670
Hee-young / You’re that kind of person

463
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:39,261
Da-gyo / Me?

464
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:39,838
Hee-young / Yeah

465
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,165
Hee-young / That’s why even early on

466
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:47,269
Hee-young / I really enjoyed talking with you

467
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,970
Hee-young / And I was thankful

468
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,207
Hee-young / In the middle of all that confusion

469
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,142
Hee-young / You were like a place to catch my breath

470
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:58,046
Hee-young / Because you’re so good at reading people broadly

471
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,381
Hee-young / So for me

472
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,184
Hee-young / I’ve always had feelings for you

473
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:05,253
Hee-young / But I couldn’t express them

474
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:06,230
Da-gyo / Right

475
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,722
Hee-young / I was curious about you

476
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,501
Hee-young / And now we finally got to have a date?

477
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,172
Hee-young / This is really nice

478
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,999
Da-gyo / Then it was worth writing that note

479
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:21,937
Hee-young / Thank you hahaha

480
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,973
Hee-young / So how do you feel right now?

481
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,384
Da-gyo / Right now?

482
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,546
Hee-young / You don’t have to say

483
00:26:32,556 --> 00:26:36,928
Hee-young / Then today...

484
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,820
Da-gyo / Are you deep in thought?

485
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,123
Da-gyo / Your mind’s all over?

486
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,126
Hee-young / Then for today

487
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,272
Hee-young / Let’s just enjoy it

488
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:51,509
Hee-young / A date disguised as party prep

489
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:55,480
Da-gyo / Yeah, I really wanted to say all this anyway

490
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:58,739
Hee-young / I’m really thankful that you opened up honestly

491
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:01,609
Hee-young / But I felt like you were saying it to bring closure

492
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,979
Hee-young / Not that you currently still like me

493
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,890
Hee-young / If it had been like that...

494
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:09,183
Hee-young / I’d be like “Oh really?” and banter with you

495
00:27:09,193 --> 00:27:12,053
Hee-young / But it feels like digging into someone who’s already moved on

496
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:14,522
Hee-young / Or like you’re explaining the past

497
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,392
Hee-young / That’s what it felt like to me

498
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,594
Hee-young / So it got really difficult...

499
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:24,075
Hee-young / It must be cold, should we go inside?

500
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,137
Da-gyo / But isn’t it so nice being by the ocean?

501
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,940
Da-gyo / Didn’t you want to see the sea while in Jeju?
Hee-young / I did want to come to the sea

502
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,275
Da-gyo / Right?
Hee-young / I really needed this after four days...

503
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:37,856
Da-gyo / And today, I think you really needed it too
Hee-young / Yeah

504
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,848
Da-gyo / This is fun

505
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:42,560
Da-gyo / Wow but seriously, the camera...

506
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:43,928
Da-gyo / I should’ve brought any camera

507
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,955
Da-gyo / It’s such a shame to only capture this with our eyes

508
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,233
Da-gyo / It’s a bummer

509
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,734
Hee-young / I know right

510
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,311
Da-gyo / Here we are

511
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,904
Da-gyo / Go on in

512
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:05,116
Hello

513
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:09,120
Hee-young / Since the two of us are probably buying dessert

514
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:11,813
Hee-young / We’ll take one spicy sujebi and one pork kalguksu

515
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,682
Hee-young / And two cuttlefish pancakes, please

516
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:17,829
Thank you

517
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,222
Min-woo / What are you gonna wear when we go out?

518
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,090
Min-woo / Oh! Not bad
 

519
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,324
Min-woo / Oh! Not bad
Jin-ah / I made this myself

520
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,059
Min-woo / Oh? Really?
 

521
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,094
Min-woo / Oh? Really?
Jin-ah / Yeah, I made it

522
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:28,063
Min-woo / Try it on, go ahead
Jin-ah / It’s a body-shaping brand

523
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:30,565
Jin-ah / It’s a little bulky, though

524
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,801
Min-woo / Hmm, but...

525
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,569
Min-woo / This one looks cuter though

526
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,537
Min-woo / Like, for grocery shopping

527
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,738
Jin-ah / Yeah, but this one’s uncomfortable

528
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,641
Min-woo / You wore that when you went running yesterday

529
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,619
Min-woo / Let’s wear this one today

530
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,989
Jin-ah / Oh! I heard something

531
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,431
Min-woo / That was ridiculous

532
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,928
Jin-ah / Do I have to stand like this?

533
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,529
Jin-ah / I got fully dressed to go out

534
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,833
Min-woo / I’ll feel bad if we don’t do something

535
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,301
Jin-ah / I’ll wear it tomorrow, then

536
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,836
Min-woo / No, I have to capture this moment

537
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,137
Min-woo / I need to take a Polaroid of it

538
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:11,406
Min-woo / Try that one on, here...

539
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,218
Min-woo / Hold that for a sec

540
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:17,846
Min-woo / I’ll regret it otherwise

541
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:19,424
Jin-ah / I love Polaroids too

542
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,050
Jin-ah / This is hilarious

543
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,085
Min-woo / What the—? Why isn’t it working?

544
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,154
Jin-ah / Double the heartbreak

545
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,222
Min-woo / Oh, it’s out of film!

546
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,101
Min-woo / And I even lost the lens cap...
Jin-ah / Double the heartbreak

547
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,575
Min-woo / Why is this so funny!

548
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,345
Shall we head out?

549
00:29:42,413 --> 00:29:45,850
Jin-ah / Shall we go make some food?

550
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,643
Min-woo / What should we eat?

551
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,479
Jin-ah / Maybe something like mille-feuille nabe

552
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,248
Jin-ah / Something easy but

553
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,651
Jin-ah / Looks fancy and well-made

554
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,052
Min-woo / Mille-feuille nabe sounds good

555
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,420
Jin-ah / Something hearty, because...
 

556
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,622
Jin-ah / Something hearty, because...
Min-woo / People probably won’t expect a soup dish

557
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,833
Jin-ah / Yeah

558
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,137
Jin-ah / What is this? What’s this thing?

559
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:14,212
Min-woo / It’s hard to tell when it’s all stacked up

560
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,038
Jin-ah / Can’t we just mix this and that and make something?

561
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,773
Min-woo / It’s already seasoned, I think

562
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:21,252
Jin-ah / This and that… and add some garlic

563
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:23,711
Jin-ah / Take it all out

564
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,612
Min-woo / Green onion!

565
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,514
Min-woo / Spam

566
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:27,916
Jin-ah / Let’s cook with what we have

567
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:29,617
Jin-ah / And make more if we need to

568
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,920
Min-woo / Or, how about...

569
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,490
Min-woo / Rolling things with radish slices and paprika

570
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,891
Min-woo / Like little finger foods

571
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:37,692
Jin-ah / I like that

572
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,527
Min-woo / Ones that won’t dry out

573
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:41,996
Jin-ah / Then what do we need?

574
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,766
Min-woo / This is already seasoned

575
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:48,236
Min-woo / We’ll use the leftover spam, chicken breast

576
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:49,437
Min-woo / And apple

577
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,039
Jin-ah / We need a dipping sauce too, right?

578
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,273
Min-woo / Yeah

579
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,652
Min-woo / That’ll be the main part and it’s really good

580
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:58,680
Jin-ah / We're making black pork bulgogi gochujang soup tteokbokki

581
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,849
Jin-ah / And since Min-woo’s confident in her sauce

582
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,651
Jin-ah / We decided to make spring rolls too

583
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,930
Jin-ah / I’ve been craving spring rolls anyway

584
00:31:18,576 --> 00:31:20,368
Min-woo / During the cooking process

585
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,637
Min-woo / Jin-ah really surprised me

586
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,550
Min-woo / We actually worked really well together

587
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,446
Min-woo / I’m a little nervous but...

588
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:33,281
Min-woo / I think it’ll turn out okay

589
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,617
Min-woo / As long as it tastes good in the end, that’s what matters

590
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:36,951
Jin-ah / I think it’ll be good though, because

591
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:39,497
Jin-ah / We’re relying on store-bought sauces

592
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,834
Min-woo / If I hadn’t become roommates with Jin-ah

593
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,103
Min-woo / I would've spent these 7 days not knowing anything

594
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,537
Min-woo / About what’s going on

595
00:31:56,547 --> 00:32:00,208
Jin-ah / Honestly, I was worried others might think

596
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:02,477
Jin-ah / I’m just this girl who's been hurt by love

597
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,579
Jin-ah / So sometimes it's hard being around others

598
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,457
Min-woo / But to me, like, here—

599
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:09,083
Min-woo / However people see you or whatever

600
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:12,287
Min-woo / It’s natural to worry about that, but still

601
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:15,323
Min-woo / If you don’t speak up or don’t know what’s going on

602
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,458
Min-woo / Time just passes you by

603
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:18,726
Min-woo / And if someone I like

604
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,562
Min-woo / Gets the wrong idea about me

605
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,232
Min-woo / That just doesn’t feel good, right?

606
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,534
Min-woo / So when it’s someone I care about, I think...

607
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,303
Jin-ah / It’s better to say something

608
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,138
Min-woo / I think it’s okay to express yourself, even a lot

609
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:31,072
Jin-ah / Like how?

610
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:34,218
Min-woo / Even if it’s a bit much...

611
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,378
Min-woo / It doesn’t come off as weird...

612
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,180
Jin-ah / It won’t make you look lame

613
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,225
Min-woo / It actually makes you look cuter

614
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,752
Jin-ah / So today marks the halfway point

615
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,120
Min-woo / Yeah, today is exactly halfway

616
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,956
Jin-ah / So if I don’t do anything today...

617
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:52,093
Jin-ah / I feel like if I just go with the flow, it'll all just end

618
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:55,563
Min-woo / That kind of sounds like my future

619
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,732
Min-woo / You've already experienced it once

620
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,011
Min-woo / And now you're starting over with a new rhythm

621
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,982
Min-woo / But I still haven't really gone through anything definite

622
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,640
Jin-ah / That’s frustrating, isn’t it?

623
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,374
Min-woo / It's really frustrating

624
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,142
Jin-ah / I feel the same way, so...

625
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,578
Jin-ah / At first I thought I had to go on tons of dates

626
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,524
Jin-ah / With as many people as possible

627
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:19,354
Jin-ah / Because there are so few people to really get to know

628
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,055
Jin-ah / That was a bit disappointing, I guess?

629
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,724
Jin-ah / Not because I was impatient

630
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,503
Jin-ah / But because I was afraid it would just end in disappointment

631
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,763
Jin-ah / When you said that just now

632
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,933
Jin-ah / It made me realize how everyone in the house is going through

633
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:35,403
Jin-ah / So much pain and confusion and inner chaos

634
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,138
Jin-ah / But in a way, being true to that

635
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,842
Jin-ah / Makes me feel like… aren't we kind of beautiful?

636
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,812
Jin-ah / I’ve really come to like you as a person, Min-woo

637
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,381
Min-woo / Because you said it clearly

638
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,216
Min-woo / And encouraged me

639
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,451
Min-woo / You kind of shine more to me now

640
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,120
Min-woo / I think I’m the kind of person who really changes

641
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,032
Min-woo / Depending on how others treat me

642
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:59,093
Jin-ah / This is great, it’s like cooking therapy or something

643
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,194
Min-woo / Really?

644
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,563
Min-woo / Perilla leaves are surprisingly pretty

645
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:03,441
Jin-ah / Aren’t they?

646
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,132
Hello

647
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,326
Ri-won / Isn't this place known for its sweet and spicy fried chicken?

648
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,828
Han-kyul / Yeah, so maybe we could get that

649
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,663
Han-kyul / And maybe some fries too?

650
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,932
Ri-won / I feel like the mac and cheese might be even better?

651
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,211
Ri-won / Should we get those two to-go?

652
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:46,140
Han-kyul / I feel like the risotto or pasta is their specialty

653
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,909
Han-kyul / I think those are what they're known for

654
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,879
Ri-won / Can’t we just eat here?
Han-kyul / But it might get soggy if we take it out, right?

655
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:54,849
Ri-won / Since it will, let’s eat this here and just take the other stuff to-go

656
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,194
Han-kyul / Should we just eat this ourselves?

657
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,987
Ri-won / What do you want to try? How about pasta?

658
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,690
Han-kyul / What if we each order one and share?

659
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,437
Ri-won / Then should we get the octopus and abalone ones?

660
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:14,402
Ri-won / We’ll have the octopus pasta and the abalone risotto please

661
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:15,269
Ri-won / And

662
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,749
Ri-won / We’ll take the sweet spicy chicken and mac and cheese to-go

663
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:26,380
Han-kyul / For the potluck, I picked the place known for its chicken because

664
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,717
Han-kyul / We’ll be sharing food and it's easy to carry and portion out

665
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,253
Han-kyul / So that’s why I picked it

666
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,387
Han-kyul / When we got there

667
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,823
Han-kyul / They had some kind of signature menu

668
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:38,903
Han-kyul / So I wanted to try that too

669
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:54,318
Ri-won / Shouldn’t we just say it when we get there?

670
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,990
Han-kyul / If they ask why we’re not eating, just act like we’re light eaters

671
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:02,360
Han-kyul / Say we don’t eat much

672
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:29,053
Han-kyul / I feel like we’re just going to silently devour everything because we’re hungry

673
00:36:29,987 --> 00:36:30,845
Ri-won / I’m not the type

674
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,346
Ri-won / To talk much while eating

675
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,192
Han-kyul / Me too, more like after eating...

676
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:35,016
Ri-won / Oh~ same, same

677
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,385
Ri-won / I like talking while drinking or having dessert

678
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,053
Han-kyul / When you’re full

679
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:40,998
Han-kyul / You know that relaxed pose?

680
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,502
Han-kyul / Like this kind of posture

681
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,134
Ri-won / I’m way too serious about eating

682
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,279
Ri-won / I can’t be interrupted

683
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,979
Han-kyul / Should we try this?

684
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,591
Ri-won / I’m so excited

685
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:15,233
Han-kyul / It’s my first time trying this and it’s really good
Ri-won / That’s abalone liver sauce

686
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:23,397
Han-kyul / I’ve never had proper abalone like this before

687
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:27,678
Han-kyul / I’ve only had tiny bits of it in rice porridge

688
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:34,518
Ri-won / Why do you think Seo-yeon chose Hee-young as her roommate?

689
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:36,320
Ri-won / Do you think Seo-yeon likes Hee-young?

690
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:42,783
Ri-won / What do you think?

691
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:44,952
Han-kyul / I don't think so?

692
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:48,799
Ri-won / I honestly have no idea who Seo-yeon likes

693
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,925
Han-kyul / Maybe she changed her mind

694
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,629
Ri-won / Yeah, that could be it

695
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,274
Han-kyul / You never know

696
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:59,467
Ri-won / I think she just wanted Mi-rang and Da-gyo to be happy

697
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,778
Ri-won / So she made that choice

698
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,574
Ri-won / And for Jin-ah and Min-woo, it seemed like

699
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:08,509
Ri-won / She paired them so Jin-ah would feel a bit better

700
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,844
Ri-won / I think Min-woo helped with that

701
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,223
Han-kyul / Min-woo’s like a healing type

702
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,550
Ri-won / Yeah, I think she’s actually really good at listening to people’s problems

703
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,222
Ri-won / And we were paired to be happy too

704
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,834
Ri-won / I’m really satisfied with it

705
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,560
Ri-won / It’s our fourth day here now

706
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,863
Ri-won / I feel like I’ve gotten closer to you

707
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,631
Han-kyul / Yeah, same here

708
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,366
Han-kyul / It feels like we’ve known each other for a while

709
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,813
Han-kyul / Time feels longer in this place overall, right?

710
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,339
Ri-won / Totally

711
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,909
Ri-won / Up to now, we’ve sent letters

712
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:45,079
Ri-won / Four times in the past three days

713
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,190
Ri-won / Did you send them all to different people?

714
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,584
Ri-won / I thought before yesterday

715
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:52,920
Ri-won / You were really focused on just one or two people

716
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,532
Ri-won / Maybe Hee-young or Jin-ah?

717
00:38:55,633 --> 00:39:00,461
Ri-won / Yeah, like Hee-young or Jin-ah?

718
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:04,565
Han-kyul / I actually did ask Jin-ah out on a date once

719
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:06,467
Han-kyul / But what I meant by that was

720
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:09,870
Han-kyul / When I talked to her, I felt kind of healed

721
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,972
Han-kyul / Like I really needed that at the time

722
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:14,318
Han-kyul / So I chose her because she made me feel better

723
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,444
Han-kyul / Not because I wanted something serious

724
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,079
Han-kyul / I’m not really thinking about

725
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:23,150
Han-kyul / Wanting things to work out with anyone right now

726
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,821
Han-kyul / I thought if I wrote to the same person every time

727
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:30,057
Han-kyul / It might come off like I’m clinging to her

728
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,626
Han-kyul / So I’ve been intentionally spreading them around

729
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,829
Ri-won / Oh, on purpose?

730
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,465
Ri-won / Hearing that you don’t like anyone in particular

731
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,066
Ri-won / That made me happy

732
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:42,169
Ri-won / Because I thought you’d been sending letters

733
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,705
Ri-won / To the same person this whole time

734
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,606
Ri-won / But actually

735
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,541
Ri-won / You sent them to different people each time

736
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,987
Ri-won / And you don’t have anyone you really like

737
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:54,849
Ri-won / So I thought, if I try hard enough

738
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:58,652
Ri-won / Maybe you’ll start to feel something too?

739
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,788
Ri-won / That gave me a little hope

740
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,391
Ri-won / Do you know who I’ve been writing letters to?

741
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,226
Ri-won / Who is it?

742
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:10,441
Han-kyul / You write the “ㅎ” like an “o” right?

743
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:15,469
Han-kyul / And your “ㄹ” is kind of round, right?

744
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,814
Ri-won / Yeah, I think so

745
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,706
Han-kyul / All the letters I’ve gotten so far

746
00:40:18,716 --> 00:40:20,641
Han-kyul / Have been from the same person

747
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:24,245
Han-kyul / And the handwriting looks exactly the same

748
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,891
Han-kyul / But the very first one I got

749
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,616
Han-kyul / Was from you, right?

750
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,684
Han-kyul / So I kind of thought

751
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,521
Han-kyul / You might be the one sending them

752
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,989
Han-kyul / Is it true?

753
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:37,034
Ri-won / Why do you think I’m sending them?

754
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:40,671
Han-kyul / I told you I got zero votes on the first day

755
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,731
Han-kyul / So maybe

756
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,867
Han-kyul / You felt bad and wanted to support me

757
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,869
Han-kyul / Maybe you wanted to cheer me up

758
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,504
Han-kyul / And you thought if my box was empty

759
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,673
Han-kyul / I might get too down

760
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,341
Han-kyul / So you helped me out a bit? And also

761
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,720
Han-kyul / It seems like you didn’t have anyone else you really wanted to write to

762
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,056
Han-kyul / So I thought

763
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,414
Han-kyul / If that’s the case

764
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,583
Han-kyul / I was going to tell you this afterwards but

765
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:06,387
Han-kyul / If you’re writing to me because there’s no one else

766
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,555
Han-kyul / That’s totally fine

767
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:10,734
Han-kyul / But if you’re doing it just because you’re worried I’ll get zero votes

768
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,294
Han-kyul / Even though you have someone else in mind

769
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,629
Han-kyul / Then you really don’t have to do that for me

770
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,798
Han-kyul / I’ve honestly let go of all of it

771
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,500
Han-kyul / You don’t need to help me anymore

772
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,313
Han-kyul / I’m really okay now

773
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:25,506
Ri-won / I wonder what it is about me that’s not appealing?

774
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:28,876
Ri-won / I’m curious too—I honestly don’t know

775
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,779
Ri-won / What is it about others that stands out?

776
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:34,615
Ri-won / What made them get letters?

777
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,661
Ri-won / I want to know, but I have no way of finding out

778
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,505
Han-kyul / Can I be completely honest?

779
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,306
Han-kyul / I’m super into looks, so honestly

780
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:02,443
Han-kyul / I’ve never had someone I liked like me back

781
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:06,957
Han-kyul / So I was always the one chasing first

782
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,450
Han-kyul / But I don’t think of myself as someone who’s been hurt

783
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,229
Han-kyul / Even when I get hurt, I see it as something I brought on myself

784
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,823
Han-kyul / I feel like I drew the line myself

785
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,125
Han-kyul / Even for the pain I received from others

786
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:20,861
Han-kyul / But still

787
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,464
Han-kyul / I always feel guilty when someone likes me

788
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:26,600
Han-kyul / I’m just that kind of person

789
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,969
Han-kyul / I can’t really handle that guilt well

790
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:31,582
Han-kyul / And it makes me really emotional sometimes

791
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,919
Han-kyul / Even though I know

792
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,412
Han-kyul / That things feel comfortable and genuine between us

793
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:45,553
Han-kyul / And I like you as a person

794
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,189
Han-kyul / I just don’t feel that certainty, like, “I want to be in a relationship with her”

795
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,392
Han-kyul / So if it’s just going to be dating for the sake of dating

796
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,238
Han-kyul / I’d rather be alone

797
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,874
Han-kyul / I prefer that

798
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,967
Ri-won / I totally agree

799
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:03,170
Ri-won / Because then you’d just end up hurting yourself

800
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,317
Ri-won / And the other person too

801
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:15,449
Han-kyul / But when I look into your eyes, I feel so guilty
Ri-won / Why?

802
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,717
Han-kyul / Your bunny eyes

803
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,195
Ri-won / Oh, because my eyes look like a bunny’s?

804
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,422
Han-kyul / They’re like judging eyes...

805
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,034
Ri-won / No, they’re not

806
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:27,705
Han-kyul / If you find someone you really like

807
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:31,198
Han-kyul / Go all in, okay?

808
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:35,369
Ri-won / Go all in if I like someone?
Han-kyul / Yeah, seriously

809
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,681
Han-kyul / There’s still four days left, don’t hesitate

810
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:43,444
Ri-won / Got it. Then starting today, since you told me

811
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:44,745
Ri-won / To go all in on someone I like

812
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,614
Ri-won / I’ll do exactly that

813
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,693
Ri-won / I’ll go for it

814
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:55,589
Han-kyul / By being honest about where our feelings are

815
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,859
Han-kyul / I hope it made things easier for her

816
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,229
Han-kyul / I just want her heart to feel at ease

817
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,376
Ri-won / I definitely felt something from Han-kyul today

818
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,468
Ri-won / I think she’s feeling pressured

819
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,946
Ri-won / So I really don’t know

820
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,115
Ri-won / What I’m supposed to do now

821
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:20,891
Ri-won / The clouds are purple and the sky is pink

822
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,551
Han-kyul / I love everything right now, I’m so happy

823
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,920
Ri-won / Honestly, since I’ve been here

824
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,032
Ri-won / This might be my favorite moment

825
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:30,324
Han-kyul / Today’s been the best day for me

826
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,692
Ri-won / The ocean looks so beautiful

827
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,728
Han-kyul / Today actually felt like a vacation

828
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,730
Ri-won / Before that it felt more like we were trapped

829
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,501
Han-kyul / Yeah, it felt a bit confining before... but now

830
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,871
Han-kyul / It finally feels like we’re on a Jeju trip

831
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:49,119
Han-kyul / Should we lean on something and look out at the ocean for a bit?

832
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:57,484
Han-kyul / That soft purple line between the pink and the sky—it's so pretty

833
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:02,690
Han-kyul / I can’t believe we have to leave this ocean behind and go back in

834
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,837
Han-kyul / It’s so beautiful

835
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:09,506
Han-kyul / Seriously, it’s unbelievably beautiful today

836
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,099
Han-kyul / I really don’t want to go back in

837
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:14,445
Han-kyul / I just want to stay here

838
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,185
Ri-won / Walking along the beach together—it was just so beautiful

839
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:24,178
Ri-won / And it made me really happy to see you enjoying it too

840
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:27,024
Ri-won / Let’s go!

841
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,830
Mi-rang / There might already be other people in that room

842
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,342
Seo-yeon / Oh, right, maybe

843
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:57,111
Seo-yeon / Ah! No!

844
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,480
Mi-rang / What, what? Did it die?

845
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,547
Seo-yeon / It died

846
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,682
Mi-rang / It died?

847
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:06,653
Seo-yeon / I think I can save it, hold on...

848
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:07,688
Mi-rang / Why’d you kill it?

849
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:09,323
Seo-yeon / Wait, I revived it!

850
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,502
Mi-rang / You did?

851
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,037
Seo-yeon / I think I’m a genius

852
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,531
Mi-rang / Killed it, saved it, killed it, saved it

853
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,767
Mi-rang / Oh? They’re already here

854
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,567
Min-woo / You’re here?

855
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:24,304
Mi-rang / We killed it(?)

856
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:26,039
Min-woo / A tangerine fell?

857
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:27,241
Mi-rang / Yeah, so we killed it

858
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,051
Min-woo / Oh really?

859
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,211
Jin-ah / Did you make mine?

860
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,313
Mi-rang / Wow, you really made that yourself?

861
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,282
Min-woo / Yeah, I made all of it

862
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,785
Hee-young / I’m kind of excited

863
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,453
Da-gyo / Do you know why?

864
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,189
Da-gyo / Because the food tastes good

865
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,893
Da-gyo / And no one has to cook anymore

866
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,905
Da-gyo / Was that too much of a T-type comment?

867
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,976
Hee-young / Yeah, kind of

868
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,435
Da-gyo / The moment I said it, I was like, “Huh?”

869
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:57,204
Da-gyo / “Is that not the mood right now?”

870
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,783
Hee-young / You're such a T-type

871
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,719
Da-gyo / We’re here~

872
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:08,549
Da-gyo / Ta-da~

873
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:09,950
Min-woo / Look at this, please

874
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,851
Da-gyo / Look at what?

875
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,853
Min-woo / We didn’t have a blender, so I made the sauce by hand

876
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:13,954
Min-woo / I squeezed it with a spoon

877
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,355
Da-gyo / That sounds delicious\~

878
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:16,323
Da-gyo / What is it?

879
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,758
Min-woo / I made the sauce for spring rolls

880
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,627
Da-gyo / Oh, it’s spring rolls?

881
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:21,805
Da-gyo / Why are you so good at this?

882
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:24,631
Jin-ah / What did you bring?

883
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:25,265
Da-gyo / I...

884
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,834
Jin-ah / Pho?

885
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,903
Da-gyo / Kalguksu and sujebi

886
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:32,306
Mi-rang / I tried to guess, but failed

887
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,207
Da-gyo / Guess what that is?

888
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,107
Jin-ah / Pizza~

889
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:35,709
Da-gyo / Pizza?

890
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,344
Da-gyo / It’s Korean pizza

891
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,145
Jin-ah / Jeon?

892
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:40,157
Da-gyo / Jeon? Hahaha

893
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,559
Seo-yeon / What are you doing?

894
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:56,173
Hee-young / Good posture, good mindset

895
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,269
Seo-yeon / It’s nothing! (I told myself)

896
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:03,704
Seo-yeon / It’s nothing

897
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,305
Hee-young / It’s nothing?

898
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,808
Seo-yeon / No, it’s just... a little hypnosis

899
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:12,145
Seo-yeon / I was just trying a little self-hypnosis

900
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:16,450
Hee-young / Everything shall pass...

901
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:17,885
Jin-ah / Da-gyo

902
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,286
Jin-ah / Are you not changing out of your pajamas?

903
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,321
Da-gyo / Oh, are we going to change now?

904
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:24,157
Jin-ah / I want to get comfy, but I feel like I can't eat like this

905
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,626
Jin-ah / It’s too tight to eat in

906
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,561
Da-gyo / Then let’s go change

907
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,595
Jin-ah / Yeah, let’s do that

908
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,663
Mi-rang / Should we go change now?

909
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:32,866
Da-gyo / Yeah! The four of us will go get changed

910
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:33,967
Mi-rang / To our room

911
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:36,046
Da-gyo / To our room?

912
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:39,273
Mi-rang / I need to change into pajamas

913
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:40,984
Hee-young / Oh, right now?

914
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,043
Seo-yeon / Yes!

915
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:46,079
Hee-young / Oh no, my NewJeans (?)

916
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:50,150
Min-woo / Finally, it's time for pajamas

917
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,786
Min-woo / Close the door, it’s a secret

918
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:55,088
Jin-ah / I’ll go change first

919
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,590
Da-gyo / So cute, so cute

920
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,001
Da-gyo / Everyone’s adorable

921
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,895
Let’s go, let’s go

922
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:02,839
Go go

923
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,000
Jin-ah / Da-gyo, why are you bringing that? Too much stuff?

924
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:08,435
Jin-ah / Not enough space over there?

925
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,236
Da-gyo / I was worried there wouldn’t be slippers

926
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,804
Jin-ah / Oh yeah, there aren’t any

927
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:11,905
Da-gyo / I already grabbed one

928
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:13,507
Jin-ah / Da-gyo, are those the striped Adidas ones?

929
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:18,278
Da-gyo / No, these are padded Adidas slides

930
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,949
Mi-rang / Feels like we’re back in school days

931
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,094
Seo-yeon / Wow~ so cute

932
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:29,366
Da-gyo / We’re back~

933
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,566
Min-woo / Hi

934
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,878
Mi-rang / Everyone’s in pink

935
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:45,315
Ri-won / The door’s open

936
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,709
Han-kyul / Aren’t they cold?
Ri-won / That’s why it’s always freezing

937
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,756
Han-kyul / Don’t the people inside feel cold?
Ri-won / That’s what I’m saying

938
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,192
Ri-won / Wait, you're wearing pajamas?

939
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,995
Han-kyul / Hello there

940
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,359
Da-gyo / Oh~ what’s on the menu?

941
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:09,329
Ri-won / Us? We made something super tasty

942
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,998
Da-gyo / Oh, I’m curious

943
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,766
Ri-won / It’s really good, seriously

944
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:16,236
Ri-won / We’ve got sweet and spicy chicken and mac & cheese

945
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:18,205
Da-gyo / Whoa~ sounds amazing

946
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:21,585
Ri-won / We’re gonna go change real quick

947
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:26,546
Han-kyul / I really liked wearing this

948
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:32,396
Han-kyul / It kind of felt like we were wearing couple outfits

949
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:36,099
Mi-rang / I think I’m just gonna cut this off

950
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,797
Mi-rang / Did you guys do a food shopping date?

951
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,399
Mi-rang / You brought food?

952
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,644
Han-kyul / Water, maybe?

953
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:50,437
Is this real?

954
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,649
Han-kyul / Water, maybe?
Mi-rang / Water? It’s underneath

955
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,219
Min-woo / What was that?
Hee-young / Is this for real?

956
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:05,952
Seo-yeon / I killed both of them

957
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,722
Hee-young / Now this is a party

958
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,400
Hee-young / This is what a party should be

959
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:11,268
Let’s cheer up

960
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:12,903
Think about it

961
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,906
Hee-young / Hold on, hold on

962
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:21,802
Han-kyul / Oh no...

963
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:23,370
Mi-rang / I’m sorry

964
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,073
Mi-rang / It was the cake we made together

965
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,076
Mi-rang / I felt bad when it fell, especially toward Seo-yeon

966
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,610
Seo-yeon / But honestly, I didn’t mind

967
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:35,115
Seo-yeon / The cake itself wasn’t the important part

968
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,450
Seo-yeon / I was just like, “Oh, it fell”

969
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,984
Seo-yeon / So we cleaned it up together

970
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:39,763
Mi-rang / If we just do this, only the top...

971
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,959
Mi-rang / Let’s do it this way

972
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,762
Mi-rang / This should be fine, like this...

973
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,197
Min-woo / It’s okay

974
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,032
Mi-rang / I’ll wipe it up

975
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,569
Min-woo / Let’s shape it nicely with that

976
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:59,272
Jin-ah / No wait, what if we top it with strawberries?

977
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,419
Min-woo / And drizzle a little strawberry jam like this

978
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,021
So sweet

979
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,149
Mi-rang / I was saying earlier that you killed the pie

980
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,151
Min-woo / And I was like, "You need to do surgery on it"

981
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,954
Mi-rang / But I ended up killing it myself...

982
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,356
Seo-yeon / The teddy bear funeral was hilarious

983
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:20,237
Mi-rang / Now we can’t even hold a funeral—it’s completely gone

984
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:29,069
Seo-yeon / Oh my\~

985
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:29,803
Jin-ah / Are you okay?

986
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,415
Seo-yeon / I actually love it

987
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,352
Min-woo / Okay, okay

988
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,364
Jin-ah / Even if it starts sliding down, it’s fine

989
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:59,599
Da-gyo / Wait, you guys made this?

990
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:02,846
Da-gyo / As expected\~ from the cooking team

991
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:06,907
Da-gyo / The visuals are amazing

992
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,608
Looks delicious

993
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:09,976
I’m so excited

994
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,721
Looks seriously delicious

995
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,246
Min-woo / What did you guys prepare?

996
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:15,682
Ri-won / So today, during our roommate date

997
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,751
Ri-won / I decided to speak casually for the first time

998
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,886
Ri-won / She's the only one I’ve done that with

999
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,832
Da-gyo / Oh? Really?
Ri-won / I didn’t reveal my age

1000
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,891
Ri-won / But no matter how I look at her

1001
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,236
Ri-won / I’m pretty sure she’s younger than me

1002
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:27,961
Ri-won / So it’s a secret, but

1003
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,163
Ri-won / I told her to just call me unnie and

1004
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,841
Ri-won / We decided to speak casually only with each other

1005
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,668
Ri-won / Should Han-kyul explain?

1006
00:53:34,678 --> 00:53:35,869
Han-kyul / This is just...

1007
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:39,573
Han-kyul / Some simple sweet and spicy chicken

1008
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,275
Han-kyul / I thought it’d be easy to eat, so we got that

1009
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:46,112
Han-kyul / And also...

1010
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:47,948
Han-kyul / What else was it again?

1011
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,850
Han-kyul / Oh right! This mac & cheese potato?

1012
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,185
Mi-rang / You two are such a good team

1013
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:53,430
Hee-young / Seriously

1014
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,603
Jin-ah / We also decided to speak casually (Banmo)

1015
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:06,066
Jin-ah / Black pork gochujang bulgogi soup tteokbokki

1016
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,169
Jin-ah / With spring rolls that you can fill with chicken breast or spam

1017
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,770
Jin-ah / And for the spring rolls

1018
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,772
Jin-ah / We didn’t have any sauce

1019
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,151
Jin-ah / So Min-woo made it all from scratch

1020
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,145
Jin-ah / And with the leftovers

1021
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:19,980
A dessert?

1022
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,547
Jin-ah / Yes

1023
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:22,659
Da-gyo / This seriously looks like store-bought

1024
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:30,624
Da-gyo / Hee-young and I went out together

1025
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:32,325
Da-gyo / And saw the ocean too

1026
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:34,127
Mi-rang / The ocean?!

1027
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,329
Mi-rang / You went to the ocean?

1028
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:39,132
Ri-won / What? Weren’t we supposed to only go out with our roommates?

1029
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:41,301
Da-gyo / But Seo-yeon...

1030
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:45,005
Da-gyo / Mi-rang got a one-on-one date request

1031
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:48,074
Da-gyo / So even though it’s supposed to be with your roommate, that’s how it ended up

1032
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:51,811
Da-gyo / So the two of us went out together

1033
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,114
Mi-rang / So what did you bring back?

1034
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,950
Da-gyo / One spicy sujebi

1035
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,020
Da-gyo / Kalguksu, and that one

1036
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:03,900
Da-gyo / The squid pancake here—it’s apparently the most famous

1037
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:11,831
Mi-rang / We worked really hard on this three-layer teddy bear cake

1038
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:12,966
Mi-rang / We made it ourselves

1039
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,311
Da-gyo / It was three layers?

1040
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:17,771
Mi-rang / I was so tired from driving today

1041
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:21,207
Mi-rang / I accidentally dropped it

1042
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:25,011
Mi-rang / But Jin-ah stepped in

1043
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:28,048
Mi-rang / And saved the day

1044
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,660
Mi-rang / She saved me

1045
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:37,033
Mi-rang / I also made this tangerine pie from scratch

1046
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,636
Hee-young / Wow, but it looks so good

1047
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,213
Mi-rang / Shall we all do a toast?

1048
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,015
Cheers~

1049
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:55,819
Thanks for your hard work

1050
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,425
Hee-young / What is this, wine... turning your head like that lol

1051
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,295
Min-woo / This is so good

1052
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:07,687
Jin-ah / One has chicken breast

1053
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,489
Jin-ah / And the other has spam

1054
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:11,534
Min-woo / This one is chicken, and this one’s spam

1055
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:13,193
Ri-won / Let’s not serve each other

1056
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,427
Ri-won / Just grab whatever you want

1057
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,829
Ri-won / Whatever looks good to you

1058
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,864
Ri-won / I’m really craving Vietnamese spring rolls right now

1059
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,567
Ri-won / Do you want spring rolls too? What are you in the mood for?

1060
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:21,745
Ri-won / You can have this, Han-kyul

1061
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:40,397
Hee-young / Thank you

1062
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,934
Tastes like nature

1063
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,929
Dip it in this, trust me

1064
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,674
Jin-ah / The sauce is so good

1065
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,101
Da-gyo / You really nailed the sauce

1066
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:56,169
Hee-young / How’d you make it?

1067
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:56,736
Mi-rang / It’s so tasty

1068
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:59,482
Da-gyo / It tastes just like actual spring roll sauce

1069
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:03,643
Han-kyul / The spring rolls made by Jin-ah and Min-woo

1070
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,712
Han-kyul / That was the best thing I ate today

1071
00:57:05,722 --> 00:57:08,581
Da-gyo / Those spring rolls were so well made

1072
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,050
Da-gyo / They were delicious

1073
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,163
Da-gyo / Better than the store-bought stuff

1074
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,629
Hee-young / This is great!

1075
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,074
Seo-yeon / It’s delicious

1076
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:38,411
Jin-ah / Wait, why am I chewing on tangerine?

1077
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:39,946
Jin-ah / Yeah, there's tangerine in the chicken

1078
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,381
Da-gyo / Maybe they put some in

1079
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:43,026
Jin-ah / Huh?

1080
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,991
Mi-rang / This is really good—whoever made this dish

1081
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,827
Ri-won / Whoa, is this tteokbokki?

1082
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,295
Ri-won / I’ve seriously been craving tteokbokki

1083
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,096
Hee-young / I had a feeling you’d like it

1084
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,932
Ri-won / Isn’t that obvious?

1085
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,467
Mi-rang / Seriously, you and I, Ri-won

1086
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,902
Mi-rang / We have the exact same taste

1087
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:05,205
Ri-won / We’re like real sisters
Mi-rang / It’s like we lived together

1088
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,517
Ri-won / We were raised by the same mom, I swear

1089
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,778
Ri-won / Watching you enjoy the food so much, Han-kyul

1090
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:13,880
Ri-won / It actually made me feel full just looking at you

1091
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,916
Ri-won / It was nice to see because honestly, ever since we got here

1092
00:58:16,926 --> 00:58:19,285
Ri-won / You’ve just been picking at your food

1093
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:21,754
Ri-won / And you didn’t seem to be in a good mood

1094
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:25,225
Ri-won / But today you looked relaxed

1095
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:28,328
Ri-won / And you seemed more energized—it made me happy

1096
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,630
Ri-won / What did everyone do on their dates?

1097
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,908
Jin-ah / We did this—cooked

1098
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,366
Ri-won / Cooking was your date?

1099
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:35,368
Jin-ah / Cooking...

1100
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:38,404
Min-woo / Figuring it out together

1101
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,773
Hee-young / Actually, we got really close too

1102
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,785
Hee-young / While cooking, we bonded fast

1103
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,445
Jin-ah / I wanted to go out too

1104
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:47,780
Jin-ah / I really wanted to, honestly

1105
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,883
Jin-ah / But I just loved being here with Min-woo today

1106
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:51,284
Ri-won / So you just felt at ease?

1107
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:54,521
Jin-ah / Yeah, I don’t know, I just liked being with Min-woo

1108
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,189
Ri-won / So you just like her, don’t you?

1109
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:56,956
Jin-ah / I think I do

1110
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:57,857
Ri-won / You like Min-woo?

1111
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,726
Ri-won / You like her?
Jin-ah / No, no

1112
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:00,737
Ri-won / Teasing you~

1113
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:06,833
Min-woo / Someone shut her up or something

1114
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:09,145
Ri-won / Where did Da-gyo go?

1115
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,038
Da-gyo / Like I said earlier—we went to the ocean

1116
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,640
Jin-ah / I want to go to the ocean too

1117
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,408
Da-gyo / The weather was amazing today

1118
00:59:15,418 --> 00:59:17,777
Hee-young / We were just joking around by the windmills

1119
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:20,046
Da-gyo / The sunlight on the water was so beautiful

1120
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:22,392
Ri-won / What about Mi-rang and Seo-yeon?

1121
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:26,296
Mi-rang / We made those dishes and came back

1122
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,022
Ri-won / Huh?! A cooking class?
Min-woo / You made it together?

1123
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:31,491
Seo-yeon / Yeah, we cooked together

1124
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:34,928
Ri-won / Why aren’t you asking what we did?

1125
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:36,863
Hee-young / What did you do?

1126
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,441
Ri-won / Ask us what we did

1127
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:40,567
Ri-won / Han-kyul, tell them

1128
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,803
Han-kyul / While we waited for the food, we just took a walk by the sea

1129
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:45,638
Jin-ah / The sea?

1130
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:48,241
Jin-ah / I haven’t been yet—I really want to go

1131
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,919
Ri-won / The ocean was pink

1132
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,388
Ri-won / Yeah, with the sky

1133
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:54,290
Hee-young / Why? Was it sunset?

1134
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:04,023
Ri-won / I’m curious about something

1135
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,925
Ri-won / You know how sometimes

1136
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,127
Ri-won / You just like someone as a person

1137
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:09,095
Ri-won / Especially between women

1138
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,496
Ri-won / Versus liking someone romantically

1139
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,265
Ri-won / What’s the difference?

1140
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,800
Hee-young / I wonder that too

1141
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,135
Ri-won / See? I’m the one who asked

1142
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:17,737
Hee-young / I’ve been so curious

1143
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:19,105
Ri-won / My standard is this:

1144
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,240
Ri-won / “Do I want to kiss this person or not?”

1145
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,142
Hee-young / Physical affection!

1146
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:24,410
Yeah, exactly

1147
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,856
Ri-won / Not a kiss on the cheek—on the lips

1148
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,216
Da-gyo / I think just a kiss isn’t enough, maybe more?

1149
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:32,986
Hee-young / Like a full-on kiss?

1150
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:36,132
Hee-young / Or more?

1151
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,327
Hee-young / You brought it up and now your face is red

1152
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,262
Ri-won / What? What are you imagining right now?

1153
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:44,974
Da-gyo / If it’s possible, then yes...

1154
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:48,468
Ri-won / After kissing, how far would your thoughts go?

1155
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:49,569
Min-woo / Her face is literally the color of this strawberry

1156
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:50,670
Da-gyo / Isn’t it possible? Right?

1157
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,372
Da-gyo / No wait, I’m not drunk, I mean it

1158
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,574
Hee-young / Are you really just that embarrassed?

1159
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:55,775
Ri-won / Anyway, that’s my standard

1160
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:57,810
Ri-won / But I wonder what others think

1161
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,646
Da-gyo / I think it’s pretty similar for me

1162
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:03,016
Ri-won / It’s confusing with girls because of the emotions

1163
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:04,884
Min-woo / Not for me

1164
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:06,519
Hee-young / Then what’s your standard?

1165
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:11,601
Min-woo / I just know when I like someone

1166
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,261
Min-woo / There's treating someone nicely as a friend

1167
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:18,331
Min-woo / And treating someone nicely because you're interested

1168
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:22,135
Min-woo / I think my behavior makes it pretty obvious

1169
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:25,571
Da-gyo / I’ve never liked someone unless I was sure she liked girls

1170
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:28,708
Da-gyo / If I’m not sure, I just don’t go there

1171
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,010
Da-gyo / If I don't know how they feel... I mean

1172
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,412
Da-gyo / I’ve never liked a straight girl

1173
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:35,448
Hee-young / Same, I only like girls who like girls

1174
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:36,549
Da-gyo / Never, ever

1175
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,784
Hee-young / I've never liked a straight girl

1176
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,285
Ri-won / Me neither

1177
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:40,586
Hee-young / But there are lots of people who do

1178
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:43,823
Han-kyul / So what about age? Older, same age, or younger?

1179
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:47,093
Da-gyo / Hmm… I prefer older

1180
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,571
Da-gyo / Then same age, then younger?

1181
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:52,465
Ri-won / I’m definitely into younger ones
Hee-young / I figured

1182
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:54,333
Ri-won / Wait, really? Why?

1183
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,312
Hee-young / I just feel like that’s totally your thing

1184
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,939
Ri-won / But I could still go “Mmm~” to someone older, you know

1185
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,908
Hee-young / Yeah but that’d just be you being playful

1186
01:02:01,918 --> 01:02:03,910
Hee-young / It’d feel more like friendly teasing

1187
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,611
Hee-young / But when it’s that real warm kind of love...

1188
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:07,080
Ri-won / Huh?! How did you know?

1189
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,215
Ri-won / When my heart does that thump! thing, it’s always with someone younger...

1190
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:13,462
Hee-young / I can totally see you loving to say “my baby~” and stuff
Ri-won / Yes yes exactly

1191
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:15,154
Ri-won / What about you, Hee-young?

1192
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,023
Ri-won / I feel like I don’t know anything about you

1193
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:19,292
Hee-young / What kind of question is this?

1194
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,861
Ri-won / I’m really curious about your type

1195
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,429
Ri-won / You always say it’s “just a vibe”

1196
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:25,531
Ri-won / Like you’re just doing your thing

1197
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:26,966
Ri-won / And people come out of nowhere

1198
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,945
Ri-won / Saying they all met naturally

1199
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,537
Da-gyo / But how do you even meet naturally?

1200
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:32,705
Da-gyo / When it’s not with straight people?

1201
01:02:32,715 --> 01:02:36,409
Hee-young / That’s what’s wild to me—do I give off a vibe?

1202
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,245
Hee-young / Do I? I don’t think I do

1203
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,313
Da-gyo / I was just now

1204
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:42,014
Da-gyo / Surprised when you said you’ve never dated hetero

1205
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:43,349
Da-gyo / It was kind of shocking

1206
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,650
Ri-won / I just...

1207
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,953
Ri-won / I’m really curious about your ideal type

1208
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,822
Da-gyo / So lesbians just approached you?

1209
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,624
Ri-won / You and Min-woo sound really alike

1210
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:53,693
Ri-won / You both won’t name a specific type

1211
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,394
Ri-won / Just say “I like who I like”

1212
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:58,965
Hee-young / But everyone I’ve dated was really different

1213
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,166
Ri-won / That’s why you two seem alike

1214
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,101
Ri-won / And I don’t really get it

1215
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,337
Ri-won / Everyone keeps saying “we met naturally”

1216
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,671
Hee-young / But the one thing that’s clear

1217
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:08,508
Hee-young / Is that they all really liked me

1218
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:11,778
Ri-won / I totally fell for Park Hee-young

1219
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,646
Hee-young / They made it clear they were sincere

1220
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,758
Hee-young / You could feel it

1221
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:18,851
Ri-won / What about you, Min-woo?

1222
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,653
Ri-won / Did everyone fall for Son Min-woo?

1223
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,365
Min-woo / No, I made them fall for me

1224
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:27,670
Hee-young / How exactly?

1225
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,906
Min-woo / Me? That’s a secret

1226
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,430
Hee-young / Why is that a secret?

1227
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,298
Min-woo / It's my own recipe

1228
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,466
Ri-won / You’re not gonna share?

1229
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,845
Min-woo / Absolutely not

1230
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,436
That’s a trade secret

1231
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,282
Even your daughter-in-law won’t know it
