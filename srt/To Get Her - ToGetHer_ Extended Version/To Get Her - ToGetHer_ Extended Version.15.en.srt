1
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,463
Ri-won / If I go there now, will Han-kyul be there?

2
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:14,743
Ri-won / Who is Han-kyul on a date with?

3
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:17,873
Ri-won / I hope someone quickly hops into that seat next to me

4
00:00:18,513 --> 00:00:20,143
Ri-won / I was so happy

5
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,423
Ri-won / I just really wanted to drive

6
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:23,303
Ri-won / And in the passenger seat

7
00:00:23,313 --> 00:00:25,273
Ri-won / I really wanted to give Han-kyul a ride

8
00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:27,903
Ri-won / We’re here already?

9
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:29,993
Ri-won / We’re here!

10
00:00:31,273 --> 00:00:32,833
Han-kyul / I'm coming

11
00:00:46,353 --> 00:00:48,783
Han-kyul / Who are you?
Ri-won / Hey!

12
00:00:48,793 --> 00:00:51,503
Ri-won / I came to kidnap you
Han-kyul / Let’s go!

13
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:53,143
Ri-won / I'm here to kidnap you

14
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:55,903
Han-kyul / Ugh, you're driving me crazy

15
00:00:55,913 --> 00:00:58,303
Han-kyul / So this is how I get taken away

16
00:00:58,313 --> 00:01:00,913
Han-kyul / I just thought, “She's thorough”

17
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:03,743
Han-kyul / What even is this

18
00:01:03,753 --> 00:01:05,463
Han-kyul / Isn’t this like a psycho thriller?

19
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:07,583
Ri-won / Why? Why is this a psycho thriller?

20
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:11,623
Han-kyul / Just everything about it was totally unexpected

21
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:12,823
Ri-won / Seatbelt, seatbelt

22
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,903
Han-kyul / I’m completely falling apart right now

23
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:18,423
Ri-won / So who did you go on a date with?
Han-kyul / Me?

24
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:19,633
Han-kyul / With Jin-ah!

25
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:22,913
Ri-won / Jin-ah picked you?

26
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:26,863
Ri-won / Seriously? She wrote the note before I did?

27
00:01:26,873 --> 00:01:28,943
Han-kyul / So then what about me...

28
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:32,783
Han-kyul / Today I was told to write a letter to Hee-young

29
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:34,303
Ri-won / Ah... why?

30
00:01:34,313 --> 00:01:36,503
Han-kyul / There’s still some misunderstanding left unresolved...

31
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,183
Han-kyul / That’s what they said, so I—

32
00:01:38,193 --> 00:01:41,383
Ri-won / It's not a misunderstanding...
Han-kyul / Before making new connections—

33
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,863
Han-kyul / or showing interest in someone else

34
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:48,143
Han-kyul / “You should clear up the misunderstandings first”

35
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:49,633
Han-kyul / That was the advice I got

36
00:01:52,593 --> 00:01:55,263
Ri-won / I see
Han-kyul / So where are we going?

37
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:56,663
Ri-won / Huh?
Han-kyul / Where are we headed?

38
00:01:56,673 --> 00:01:58,503
Ri-won / That’s a secret

39
00:01:58,513 --> 00:01:59,913
Han-kyul / A secret?

40
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:03,903
Han-kyul / Everyone here sure has a lot of secrets

41
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:06,503
Ri-won / What? I don’t have any secrets from you!

42
00:02:06,513 --> 00:02:08,423
Han-kyul / You, as a person—

43
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,303
Han-kyul / You feel like a complete lie

44
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:15,623
Ri-won / What do you mean?
Han-kyul / With that frozen-in-time face, you suddenly—

45
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:16,383
Han-kyul / How old did you say?

46
00:02:16,393 --> 00:02:18,983
Han-kyul / You said you were 16 years older than me?

47
00:02:18,993 --> 00:02:22,783
Han-kyul / And you said you enjoy supporting people?

48
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:26,063
Han-kyul / You seriously sound like some kind of cult leader

49
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:27,463
Ri-won / What? A cult?

50
00:02:27,473 --> 00:02:31,183
Ri-won / Why?
Han-kyul / Who would believe your age?

51
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:34,263
Ri-won / Who did you write your note to?
Han-kyul / Me?

52
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:36,343
Han-kyul / I sent mine to Da-gyo

53
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:38,743
Ri-won / Ah, you sent it to Da-gyo

54
00:02:38,753 --> 00:02:40,223
Han-kyul / I just wanted to ask why she did it on the first day

55
00:02:40,233 --> 00:02:41,663
Ri-won / Oh, you were curious

56
00:02:41,673 --> 00:02:43,263
Ri-won / Da-gyo’s gonna be busy today

57
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:44,823
Han-kyul / She got five notes, right?

58
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,103
Ri-won / What? That many?

59
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:48,703
Han-kyul / Maybe three?

60
00:02:48,713 --> 00:02:51,663
Ri-won / Probably four
Han-kyul / Four

61
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:53,343
Han-kyul / She’s the main character, huh?

62
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:55,543
Ri-won / So yeah, Da-gyo’s gonna have a busy day

63
00:02:55,553 --> 00:02:57,793
Ri-won / But to me, you’re the heroine

64
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:03,503
Han-kyul / You’re my hero

65
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:06,023
Ri-won / This place is so pretty

66
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:08,583
Han-kyul / I came here with Min-woo before

67
00:03:08,593 --> 00:03:11,593
Ri-won / Oh really?

68
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,143
Ri-won / I feel good just because it’s so beautiful

69
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,633
Han-kyul / Yeah, it really is pretty

70
00:03:31,793 --> 00:03:34,143
Han-kyul / I got kidnapped

71
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:36,073
Han-kyul / But I like it... I actually like it
Ri-won / I kidnapped you

72
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:40,343
Ri-won / For a kidnapper, I was pretty gentle, right?

73
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,753
Han-kyul / You’re so funny

74
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:46,343
Han-kyul / Ah, it’s almost over now

75
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:49,223
Ri-won / Time flew by
Han-kyul / Yeah, it did

76
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:50,983
Han-kyul / Do you think you’ll feel sad?

77
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:52,903
Ri-won / Honestly, once it ends

78
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:55,623
Ri-won / I think it’ll be more fun to meet up with you outside

79
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,553
Han-kyul / Let’s meet up separately
Ri-won / We should go to Thailand

80
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,943
Ri-won / So for me

81
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:05,303
Ri-won / It doesn’t feel that sad that it’s ending

82
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:08,143
Han-kyul / As long as you don’t have any regrets

83
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:10,743
Ri-won / But you said you had a lot of regrets
Han-kyul / Me?

84
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:13,103
Han-kyul / From day two, I kind of let go

85
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:14,193
Han-kyul / I became more chill

86
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:18,593
Han-kyul / Now I try to think positively about everything

87
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:21,703
Ri-won / Thank you
Han-kyul / Thank you

88
00:04:21,713 --> 00:04:23,143
Enjoy your food

89
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:25,823
Han-kyul / I’m actually good at making carrot cake

90
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,233
Ri-won / Oh yeah, you said you're good at baking

91
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:37,713
Han-kyul / So good!

92
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,823
Han-kyul / We’ve been such roommates

93
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,423
Han-kyul / We talked so much at night

94
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:48,503
Han-kyul / That now I don’t know what to say outside

95
00:04:48,513 --> 00:04:50,423
Ri-won / Didn’t we probably talk the most?

96
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:52,743
Han-kyul / Yeah

97
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:55,303
Ri-won / At first I was totally here just for fun

98
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:57,903
Ri-won / I thought, “Let’s just enjoy and have a good time”

99
00:04:57,913 --> 00:04:58,943
Han-kyul / Same here

100
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:00,823
Ri-won / I even hosted the first episode

101
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:05,393
Han-kyul / I didn’t have the confidence to be an MC, so I just became a panelist...

102
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,063
Ri-won / But for me

103
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,863
Ri-won / It’s not like there’s no one I’m interested in here

104
00:05:09,873 --> 00:05:13,233
Han-kyul / Think about what happens after you leave here

105
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:17,233
Ri-won / Yeah, for me too... hmm

106
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,983
Han-kyul / So like—normally, if someone makes a move first

107
00:05:20,993 --> 00:05:22,143
Han-kyul / If you’re not interested, you wouldn’t date them?

108
00:05:22,153 --> 00:05:24,953
Ri-won / Never date them
Han-kyul / Yeah, same here

109
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:38,873
Han-kyul / Why are you smiling like that?

110
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:41,103
Ri-won / I was just thinking—if we hadn’t made those promises

111
00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:42,863
Ri-won / I probably would’ve felt a little sad

112
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:44,983
Ri-won / Like after this ends

113
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:47,623
Ri-won / I’d visit your place, and you’d come to mine

114
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,943
Ri-won / We’d travel to Thailand together

115
00:05:49,953 --> 00:05:51,943
Ri-won / If we hadn’t promised that

116
00:05:51,953 --> 00:05:55,703
Ri-won / Then honestly

117
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:56,823
Ri-won / I think I would’ve felt pretty sad

118
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:59,343
Han-kyul / To be honest

119
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:02,343
Han-kyul / I keep thinking the feelings I had here

120
00:06:02,353 --> 00:06:06,703
Han-kyul / Will disappear like a mirage, like melting snow

121
00:06:06,713 --> 00:06:09,023
Han-kyul / That’s actually what hits me the most

122
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,783
Han-kyul / Like when you meet people while traveling, for example

123
00:06:11,793 --> 00:06:12,703
Han-kyul / As people, face to face

124
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:14,663
Han-kyul / Keeping in touch after that...

125
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:16,143
Han-kyul / Even if you promise

126
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:18,183
Han-kyul / For me, it’s never really happened

127
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:21,423
Ri-won / Then I’ll show you that we can make it happen

128
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:25,903
Han-kyul / Okay, just pick up if I reach out

129
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:29,153
Ri-won / I never make promises I can’t keep

130
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:33,353
Ri-won / And I don’t want to be the kind of person who breaks them

131
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:36,033
Han-kyul / What kind of life have you lived?

132
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,783
Ri-won / You’re always saying I’m fascinating...

133
00:06:38,793 --> 00:06:41,463
Ri-won / I just lived my life, in my own way

134
00:06:41,473 --> 00:06:44,343
Ri-won / I just want you to know I’m only interested in you

135
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:47,183
Ri-won / That’s what I hope you think

136
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:49,383
Han-kyul / Even if that doesn’t change anything for you?

137
00:06:49,393 --> 00:06:52,223
Han-kyul / Even if it means nothing changes?

138
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:55,423
Ri-won / Just like I do what I feel

139
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,623
Ri-won / You have your own heart too

140
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:01,143
Ri-won / So your feelings are your own

141
00:07:01,153 --> 00:07:05,193
Ri-won / And like I said to you before

142
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:08,103
Ri-won / Out there, in whatever form

143
00:07:08,113 --> 00:07:11,543
Ri-won / If I can be someone you need

144
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:14,183
Ri-won / If I can just be by your side, I’d be happy

145
00:07:14,193 --> 00:07:15,663
Ri-won / Back then you told me

146
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:17,983
Ri-won / “It feels like I gained a big sister,” remember?

147
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:21,543
Ri-won / I don’t mind that
Han-kyul / I always wanted an older sister

148
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:24,783
Ri-won / I can be that too

149
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:25,863
Ri-won / I really don’t mind

150
00:07:25,873 --> 00:07:28,353
Han-kyul / It sounds too good to be true

151
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:34,623
Han-kyul / Why would you do all this for me?

152
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:38,793
Ri-won / I just really like seeing you smile

153
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:41,143
Han-kyul / Then for the rest of the time we have here

154
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:43,593
Han-kyul / I’ll smile a lot

155
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:47,063
Ri-won / And lately, you haven’t been crying

156
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:48,623
Ri-won / You've been smiling a lot more

157
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:51,463
Han-kyul / I used to cry all the time

158
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:52,983
Han-kyul / Sigh, I don’t know

159
00:07:52,993 --> 00:07:56,463
Han-kyul / I came here because I wanted to feel love

160
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:59,463
Han-kyul / But instead, I feel like I’ve experienced

161
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:02,703
Han-kyul / Every emotion I’ve never felt before in life

162
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:06,503
Han-kyul / I wonder if I’ll even remember this later

163
00:08:06,513 --> 00:08:09,343
Han-kyul / Like I told you, if I do remember...

164
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:13,753
Han-kyul / I think you’ll be the first one who comes to mind

165
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:18,743
Ri-won / That’s how it is
Han-kyul / That’s truly how I feel

166
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:22,023
Han-kyul / I just wanted to say thank you

167
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:24,423
Han-kyul / If it weren’t for you

168
00:08:24,433 --> 00:08:26,063
Han-kyul / I would’ve kept getting zero votes

169
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,583
Han-kyul / I was one of the people who had the hardest time adjusting

170
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:31,863
Han-kyul / One of the most lost people here

171
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:35,023
Han-kyul / But you really cared about that

172
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:36,383
Han-kyul / You helped me

173
00:08:36,393 --> 00:08:40,343
Han-kyul / So I wanted to say thank you

174
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,103
Han-kyul / But I also feel kind of bad
Ri-won / Why?

175
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:44,343
Han-kyul / When I talk like this

176
00:08:44,353 --> 00:08:45,743
Han-kyul / It’s all about me

177
00:08:45,753 --> 00:08:48,753
Han-kyul / And you just keep listening with those sparkling eyes

178
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:51,343
Ri-won / I like listening

179
00:08:51,353 --> 00:08:54,303
Han-kyul / I used to be the one who loved listening too

180
00:08:54,313 --> 00:08:55,823
Han-kyul / So why do I keep talking?

181
00:08:55,833 --> 00:09:00,263
Ri-won / Maybe it’s because no matter what you say

182
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,183
Ri-won / You know I’m not going to hate you

183
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:03,223
Ri-won / Isn’t that it?

184
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:06,783
Han-kyul / Has there ever been a time when you felt that certainty—

185
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:08,153
Han-kyul / and then it changed?

186
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:12,023
Ri-won / No, I’ve never had that happen

187
00:09:12,033 --> 00:09:14,543
Han-kyul / As for me—

188
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:17,743
Han-kyul / I instinctively don’t like

189
00:09:17,753 --> 00:09:20,463
Han-kyul / Trusting someone right away

190
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:22,943
Han-kyul / I don’t want to date someone

191
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:24,993
Han-kyul / Who likes me first

192
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:26,863
Ri-won / I get what you mean

193
00:09:26,873 --> 00:09:29,223
Han-kyul / Basically, I just feel like

194
00:09:29,233 --> 00:09:33,393
Han-kyul / I’m destined to get hurt—so I go into things with that mindset

195
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:35,743
Han-kyul / That kind of relationship feels easier

196
00:09:35,753 --> 00:09:38,183
Han-kyul / And for someone who’s not used to receiving love

197
00:09:38,193 --> 00:09:41,343
Han-kyul / Giving love to them feels like

198
00:09:41,353 --> 00:09:42,703
Han-kyul / Pouring water into a bottomless pot

199
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:46,223
Han-kyul / That’s all it is

200
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:49,863
Han-kyul / That’s why the feelings we pour into others—

201
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:50,903
Han-kyul / All those emotions—

202
00:09:50,913 --> 00:09:53,103
Han-kyul / Even love that gets wasted is still precious

203
00:09:53,113 --> 00:09:54,703
Han-kyul / So, so precious like this

204
00:09:54,713 --> 00:09:57,263
Han-kyul / You have to trust and care and give your heart

205
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:59,513
Han-kyul / To someone who can really hold and return it

206
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:03,063
Han-kyul / But everything just feels weird

207
00:10:03,073 --> 00:10:04,983
Han-kyul / Like “What is this? This feels fake”

208
00:10:04,993 --> 00:10:06,383
Han-kyul / And then everything—

209
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:08,663
Han-kyul / It just leaks out through all the cracks

210
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:10,543
Han-kyul / I’m that kind of person

211
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:14,703
Han-kyul / So being in a relationship where I’m loved doesn’t feel right

212
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:16,583
Han-kyul / I’d rather be the one who gets hurt

213
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:19,513
Han-kyul / The one who stumbles and falls in love

214
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:20,423
Han-kyul / But here—

215
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:23,583
Han-kyul / I can’t really be in that position

216
00:10:23,593 --> 00:10:26,383
Han-kyul / So I don’t think I can really feel romantic feelings

217
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,543
Han-kyul / I’ve always been like that

218
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:29,623
Han-kyul / Outside too, honestly—

219
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:31,743
Han-kyul / I’m drawn to people who make me feel like

220
00:10:31,753 --> 00:10:34,343
Han-kyul / “I want to protect them,” you know?

221
00:10:34,353 --> 00:10:36,423
Ri-won / A brave little kitten

222
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:39,783
Han-kyul / Right, you always say I’m a baby cat and stuff

223
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:42,343
Han-kyul / But you can’t ignore the power of age dynamics

224
00:10:42,353 --> 00:10:44,103
Han-kyul / That really plays a role

225
00:10:44,113 --> 00:10:47,343
Han-kyul / So the fact that no one here is around my age

226
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:50,223
Han-kyul / I already thought, “Guess this won’t work out for me”

227
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:54,103
Han-kyul / But still, the gratitude I feel

228
00:10:54,113 --> 00:10:56,153
Han-kyul / That hasn’t changed

229
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,583
Ri-won / That’s enough then

230
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,303
Ri-won / So having me here—

231
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:04,143
Ri-won / Did that make your time here easier?

232
00:11:04,153 --> 00:11:05,233
Han-kyul / Of course

233
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:08,703
Han-kyul / If you hadn’t been here

234
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:11,023
Han-kyul / I might’ve actually lost it

235
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:13,463
Han-kyul / Just having someone who treated me comfortably—

236
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,473
Han-kyul / That made a huge difference

237
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:18,793
Ri-won / I think coming here was a good decision for me

238
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:23,913
Ri-won / Huh? What is it?

239
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:28,543
Ri-won / Oh, the date’s over

240
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:31,103
Ri-won / Our one-on-one date is done

241
00:11:31,113 --> 00:11:33,063
Ri-won / They said to head back to ToGetHer House

242
00:11:33,073 --> 00:11:38,913
Ri-won / Let’s go back to the house
Han-kyul / Yeah, let’s start heading back

243
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:45,023
Han-kyul / Wow, look at the sky!

244
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,303
Han-kyul / That’s insane!

245
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:47,623
Han-kyul / Look at that sky

246
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:48,943
Ri-won / What’s up with the sky color?

247
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:50,867
Ri-won / It’s so beautiful!

248
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:06,325
Han-kyul / When it was the third round

249
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:09,336
Han-kyul / I figured no one else would pick me

250
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,623
Han-kyul / So I knew it would be Da-gyo

251
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:13,040
Han-kyul / Because I picked her

252
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:16,630
Mi-rang / What is this?

253
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:20,803
Da-gyo / Hey there!

254
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:24,476
Da-gyo / Han-kyul, here’s a blanket. It’s cold

255
00:12:27,876 --> 00:12:30,484
Da-gyo / Bye bye

256
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,374
Da-gyo / I thought maybe 3 or 4 people would go

257
00:12:36,384 --> 00:12:38,662
Da-gyo / I didn’t expect it to turn out like this

258
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:41,299
Da-gyo / Honestly, I really didn’t see this coming. With Han-kyul, I wasn’t sure

259
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:43,734
Da-gyo / Because with Jin-ah, it was like that...

260
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:46,133
Da-gyo / Had some kind of connection

261
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:50,474
Da-gyo / So I thought she would’ve chosen Jin-ah

262
00:12:50,484 --> 00:12:53,051
Da-gyo / It really was unexpected

263
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:54,843
Mi-rang / Honestly

264
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:55,713
Mi-rang / I never once

265
00:12:55,723 --> 00:12:57,342
Mi-rang / Thought about Han-kyul like that

266
00:12:57,362 --> 00:13:00,224
Mi-rang / I just thought, “Wow, Da-gyo is really popular”

267
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:01,686
Mi-rang / But still

268
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:03,048
Mi-rang / Because I trusted Da-gyo

269
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,760
Mi-rang / So no matter what she talked about with Han-kyul

270
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,687
Mi-rang / I believed she would still choose me

271
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:11,891
Mi-rang / It’s not like I felt bad or anything

272
00:13:11,901 --> 00:13:14,694
Da-gyo / Hey, did you have a good date?

273
00:13:14,704 --> 00:13:17,229
Han-kyul / This is your fourth one today, right?

274
00:13:18,295 --> 00:13:19,753
Da-gyo / Why would you think that?

275
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:21,499
Han-kyul / I already know everything

276
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,293
Da-gyo / Oh really?

277
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,503
Han-kyul / Yep

278
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:26,817
Da-gyo / The others...

279
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:28,766
Han-kyul / You’re tired, right?

280
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:30,420
Da-gyo / No, not at all

281
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,957
Da-gyo / I’m totally fine

282
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:35,103
Da-gyo / It’s just that...

283
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:38,073
Da-gyo / I didn’t expect Han-kyul to choose me

284
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,966
Han-kyul / Well, it’s the last day, and

285
00:13:41,976 --> 00:13:43,530
Han-kyul / I realized we never really

286
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:45,300
Han-kyul / Had a proper conversation

287
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,469
Da-gyo / That’s true, that’s true

288
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:49,090
Han-kyul / So just once

289
00:13:49,116 --> 00:13:53,152
Han-kyul / I wanted to go out with the person who was closest to my ideal type visually

290
00:13:54,796 --> 00:13:57,904
Han-kyul / That’s why I chose you

291
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,063
Da-gyo / The note I was most curious about

292
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,198
Da-gyo / The note I was curious about

293
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,922
Da-gyo / The one I was really curious about

294
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:05,954
Da-gyo / Was actually from you

295
00:14:05,964 --> 00:14:08,244
Da-gyo / It was your note, Han-kyul

296
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:12,359
Han-kyul / Oh! I figured out from that it was Hee-young

297
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,422
Han-kyul / I thought things might change between you two

298
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,784
Da-gyo / No no no, not at all

299
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:23,581
Han-kyul / I... actually had something I wanted to ask

300
00:14:23,591 --> 00:14:26,027
Da-gyo / What is it you wanted to ask?

301
00:14:26,037 --> 00:14:27,493
Han-kyul / I also...

302
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:30,479
Han-kyul / There was a note I was curious about

303
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:33,873
Han-kyul / The one you gave me on the very first day

304
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:36,076
Han-kyul / That note

305
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:38,867
Han-kyul / Was it by any chance

306
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:40,367
Han-kyul / Because you didn’t know who else to write it to

307
00:14:40,377 --> 00:14:43,046
Han-kyul / And maybe because that day, I

308
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:46,283
Han-kyul / Kept saying you were pretty

309
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:50,321
Han-kyul / And that I liked you

310
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:52,666
Han-kyul / So was that your way of responding?

311
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:54,467
Han-kyul / Or was it just that on the first day

312
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:58,735
Han-kyul / Even with no information, you genuinely felt something for me?

313
00:14:58,745 --> 00:15:02,958
Han-kyul / Was it the same for you? Did you feel a bit of interest too?

314
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,776
Da-gyo / Honestly, I would’ve wanted to know too

315
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:08,196
Da-gyo / To be honest

316
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,376
Da-gyo / That day

317
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:13,923
Da-gyo / When I got my first note

318
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:15,986
Da-gyo / I assumed it was from you

319
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:18,555
Da-gyo / Since you said such nice things about me

320
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:21,682
Da-gyo / So I think that evening, I wrote mine to you

321
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:25,350
Han-kyul / So there weren’t any more after that, huh?

322
00:15:27,516 --> 00:15:29,156
Han-kyul / If I had just been a bit more...

323
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,630
Han-kyul / If maybe I had... done a little more

324
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:33,707
Han-kyul / A bit older maybe

325
00:15:33,874 --> 00:15:35,932
Han-kyul / Or if I had shown a bit more...

326
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:40,671
Han-kyul / Of that mature vibe or charm
Da-gyo / No, that’s not it at all

327
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:44,608
Da-gyo / Your secret was your age, right?

328
00:15:44,618 --> 00:15:45,842
Da-gyo / When you revealed it

329
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:49,246
Da-gyo / I honestly just...
Han-kyul / Wouldn’t have changed anything?

330
00:15:49,256 --> 00:15:51,882
Da-gyo / I mean, I don’t want you to think

331
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:53,193
Da-gyo / That it had any influence on me

332
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,787
Da-gyo / I really saw you

333
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:59,623
Da-gyo / As someone attractive just the way you are

334
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:01,858
Han-kyul / But now, I just think

335
00:16:01,868 --> 00:16:04,828
Han-kyul / It’s too late to expect anything romantic from you

336
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:08,765
Han-kyul / That moment’s already passed

337
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:12,336
Da-gyo / So did you write me a lot of notes?

338
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:16,807
Han-kyul / Honestly, besides you, there wasn’t anyone

339
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:21,645
Han-kyul / Who matched my ideal type physically

340
00:16:21,655 --> 00:16:24,247
Han-kyul / And you seemed to have

341
00:16:24,257 --> 00:16:26,983
Han-kyul / A love line with Mi-rang at first

342
00:16:26,993 --> 00:16:29,296
Han-kyul / So I thought

343
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,254
Han-kyul / You must like older women with short hair

344
00:16:31,264 --> 00:16:32,656
Han-kyul / That must be your type

345
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,502
Han-kyul / That’s what I assumed

346
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:37,728
Han-kyul / So I figured

347
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:40,697
Han-kyul / There’s no space for me there

348
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:43,767
Han-kyul / I wrote two notes, and then

349
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:47,547
Han-kyul / Kind of unintentionally gave up

350
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:50,273
Da-gyo / But honestly, hair length doesn’t matter to me

351
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:52,509
Da-gyo / When it comes to appearances

352
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,978
Da-gyo / There were two people I was physically attracted to

353
00:16:54,988 --> 00:16:57,414
Han-kyul / That was Hee-young and Mi-rang?

354
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:58,148
Da-gyo / That’s right

355
00:16:58,158 --> 00:17:01,328
Han-kyul / Then if we set them aside

356
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:06,233
Han-kyul / Just in terms of looks, what rank was I?

357
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:12,038
Da-gyo / You? What number... hmm...

358
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,765
Han-kyul / Be really honest
Da-gyo / Honest?

359
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:17,567
Da-gyo / Third place!

360
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:19,569
Han-kyul / Thank you

361
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,647
Da-gyo / Seriously

362
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:24,184
Han-kyul / Third?
Da-gyo / Yeah, for real

363
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:27,687
Han-kyul / I even thought about writing another note like

364
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:30,380
Da-gyo / Writing what?
Han-kyul / Like, you know

365
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,218
Han-kyul / Since your note said “Let’s get to know each other more”

366
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:38,255
Han-kyul / But we never really got to

367
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,924
Han-kyul / I kinda wanted to write something back like

368
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:45,105
Han-kyul / “In the next life, I want to get to know you better”

369
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:47,964
Han-kyul / Like if I were reborn

370
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:51,101
Han-kyul / As the kind of older, cool woman you like

371
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,670
Han-kyul / I’d want to get to know you in my next life

372
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:00,277
Han-kyul / I really wanted to write something like that

373
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,679
Da-gyo / Honestly, I’m just really grateful

374
00:18:02,689 --> 00:18:05,182
Da-gyo / Because it means you always saw me in a good light

375
00:18:05,192 --> 00:18:08,452
Da-gyo / That kind of feeling is just...

376
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,786
Da-gyo / Really touching

377
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:12,389
Da-gyo / I really think you're attractive

378
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:14,891
Da-gyo / That mature woman vibe you were talking about?

379
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:17,828
Da-gyo / I get what you mean now

380
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:20,730
Da-gyo / And I honestly think you totally match it

381
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,200
Da-gyo / So I don’t get why you're being all timid

382
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,001
Da-gyo / I just want to cheer you on

383
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:27,370
Da-gyo / You can absolutely be confident

384
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,172
Da-gyo / You fit that mature image

385
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:30,440
Da-gyo / So well

386
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,743
Han-kyul / I just feel like I never showed

387
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:37,380
Han-kyul / Any of the charms I could’ve shown

388
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,917
Han-kyul / So I’ve just felt kind of foolish the whole time

389
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:44,654
Han-kyul / That’s the impression I have of myself
Da-gyo / You really don’t need to feel that way

390
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:47,023
Han-kyul / So now

391
00:18:47,033 --> 00:18:50,560
Han-kyul / You wouldn’t consider giving me another chance, would you?

392
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,029
Han-kyul / I mean, I’m not really asking you that directly

393
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,601
Da-gyo / Then what I want to know is, Han-kyul, you...

394
00:18:57,611 --> 00:18:59,236
Da-gyo / Am I in your final choice?

395
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:01,738
Da-gyo / Right now?

396
00:19:01,748 --> 00:19:03,540
Han-kyul / I don’t know if I’ll keep thinking about this

397
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,409
Han-kyul / Or just move on, but honestly

398
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,855
Han-kyul / I just keep thinking about your smile

399
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:11,815
Han-kyul / I feel like I’ll always remember that

400
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:15,852
Han-kyul / So if I didn’t even get to talk to you

401
00:19:15,862 --> 00:19:19,623
Han-kyul / And things just ended like that

402
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,067
Han-kyul / I would’ve really regretted it

403
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:23,026
Han-kyul / I just wanted to see you one more time

404
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:26,596
Han-kyul / So thank you for...
Da-gyo / I'm the one who's grateful you said that

405
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:28,598
Han-kyul / Please don’t feel pressured by any of this

406
00:19:28,608 --> 00:19:30,500
Han-kyul / Really, it's not like that

407
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,480
Da-gyo / I get it
Han-kyul / It’s more like a fan... like a fan moment

408
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:34,648
Da-gyo / I don’t see it that way

409
00:19:34,781 --> 00:19:38,241
Han-kyul / I just wanted to remember you as someone beautiful

410
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:41,278
Da-gyo / Honestly, at the beginning

411
00:19:41,288 --> 00:19:43,046
Da-gyo / I was really worried too

412
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,581
Da-gyo / Everyone probably was

413
00:19:44,591 --> 00:19:47,717
Da-gyo / Like, "What if no one likes me when I get there?"

414
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,020
Da-gyo / We all came in with those kinds of worries

415
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:54,057
Da-gyo / So when you were the first one

416
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,559
Da-gyo / To send me a note

417
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,427
Da-gyo / And to say you liked me

418
00:19:57,437 --> 00:19:59,563
Da-gyo / I wanted to thank you face to face

419
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:03,109
Da-gyo / Every time I felt my confidence drop

420
00:20:03,343 --> 00:20:05,969
Da-gyo / You’d say I had a pretty smile

421
00:20:05,979 --> 00:20:07,347
Da-gyo / Or compare me to fruit

422
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:09,940
Da-gyo / And say I was pretty—things like that

423
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,609
Da-gyo / They really gave me a lot of strength

424
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:14,454
Da-gyo / I drew so much energy from that

425
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:17,814
Da-gyo / So thank you for that, truly

426
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:22,662
Han-kyul / I didn’t even know I’d received a note from you

427
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:25,522
Han-kyul / When I found that out

428
00:20:25,532 --> 00:20:28,758
Da-gyo / That’s why you sent yours yesterday—to confirm it, right?

429
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:31,471
Han-kyul / It made me so happy

430
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:33,763
Han-kyul / But now there’s really

431
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:37,043
Han-kyul / Nothing I can do about it, to be honest

432
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:40,370
Han-kyul / I know that, I’m aware of that

433
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,740
Han-kyul / I don’t know who you’ll end up with

434
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:49,179
Han-kyul / But I know there are people who definitely chose you

435
00:20:49,189 --> 00:20:51,858
Han-kyul / And I hope you’ll be happy with them

436
00:20:52,158 --> 00:20:53,627
Da-gyo / I just hope you

437
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:58,488
Da-gyo / Stay true to your feelings all the way until the end

438
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:01,024
Da-gyo / I want that for everyone here

439
00:21:01,034 --> 00:21:05,362
Han-kyul / So your final choice… it’s that person, right?

440
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:08,131
Da-gyo / Well, that’s something...

441
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,934
Da-gyo / I can’t tell you

442
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:15,405
Han-kyul / When I leave here

443
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:17,984
Han-kyul / I want to meet someone like you

444
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:21,144
Da-gyo / Wait, what? Why?

445
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,114
Da-gyo / You’re so popular... You totally could...

446
00:21:24,124 --> 00:21:27,984
Da-gyo / Why me? That really surprises me

447
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:31,454
Han-kyul / Honestly, the moment I first saw you

448
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:34,024
Han-kyul / I thought, "If someone like her existed..."

449
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:37,260
Han-kyul / She’d be the kind of person you could fall for at first sight

450
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,596
Han-kyul / You were the only one who gave me that feeling

451
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:42,866
Han-kyul / But I also thought, “Someone like her

452
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:45,769
Han-kyul / Would never be shaken by someone like me”

453
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:48,138
Han-kyul / That’s honestly what I believed

454
00:21:48,148 --> 00:21:51,885
Han-kyul / But just being able to say this

455
00:21:52,152 --> 00:21:53,810
Han-kyul / Is enough

456
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,614
Han-kyul / I didn’t want to leave here pretending I felt nothing

457
00:21:57,624 --> 00:21:58,682
Han-kyul / That wouldn’t be fair to myself

458
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,817
Han-kyul / So I thought, “At least let me get this out”

459
00:22:00,827 --> 00:22:04,621
Han-kyul / And shake off even the smallest bit of regret

460
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:07,033
Han-kyul / That’s really what this is about

461
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,992
Han-kyul / You already had so many date offers

462
00:22:09,002 --> 00:22:10,627
Han-kyul / I didn’t want to burden you

463
00:22:10,637 --> 00:22:14,631
Han-kyul / With my feelings on top of that

464
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:16,109
Han-kyul / That was the biggest reason

465
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:19,769
Da-gyo / Honestly, from now on

466
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:22,238
Da-gyo / If I ever have a hard time in life

467
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:24,140
Da-gyo / I think I’ll remember today

468
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,710
Da-gyo / Those people who

469
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,179
Da-gyo / Even though I didn’t show clear interest

470
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:31,614
Da-gyo / Still asked me out for the final date

471
00:22:31,624 --> 00:22:33,516
Da-gyo / Moments like that

472
00:22:33,526 --> 00:22:36,052
Da-gyo / Gave me so much strength

473
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:40,423
Da-gyo / I think I’ll keep remembering them

474
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:42,058
Da-gyo / So thank you

475
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:45,528
Han-kyul / I just wanted you to know

476
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:48,698
Han-kyul / That you were the heroine

477
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:50,410
Oh wow\...

478
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:55,171
Da-gyo / I never saw it that way
Han-kyul / That’s all I needed

479
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:59,609
Han-kyul / From that moment on

480
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:02,956
Han-kyul / I was just one of the many

481
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,560
Da-gyo / One of the many...
Han-kyul / Extras who liked you

482
00:23:08,294 --> 00:23:11,521
Han-kyul / And I’m okay being remembered like that

483
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:14,090
Han-kyul / Just someone who confessed but it didn’t work out

484
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,536
Han-kyul / That brings me peace

485
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:21,107
Han-kyul / That makes it easier to move on

486
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,766
Da-gyo / I think I would've done the same

487
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,934
Da-gyo / Actually, I did

488
00:23:24,944 --> 00:23:27,437
Da-gyo / Since I was already here

489
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,606
Da-gyo / Leaving without saying anything

490
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,641
Da-gyo / Would’ve left me with regrets too

491
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:36,556
Da-gyo / And I get exactly where your heart is coming from

492
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:52,996
Da-gyo / So the date ends like this

493
00:23:53,006 --> 00:23:55,208
Da-gyo / Thank you

494
00:23:56,376 --> 00:23:58,077
Han-kyul / Thank you

495
00:24:39,651 --> 00:24:43,779
Hee-young / I was really nervous before the pool party

496
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:46,281
Hee-young / I'm actually pretty conservative

497
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:49,118
Hee-young / So I’m not someone who likes to be that exposed in a bikini

498
00:24:49,128 --> 00:24:51,553
Hee-young / It's not really my thing

499
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:56,225
Hee-young / But... I mean, it looked pretty

500
00:24:56,235 --> 00:25:01,763
Seo-yeon / Honestly, I was a bit curious and excited

501
00:25:01,773 --> 00:25:05,367
Seo-yeon / To see everyone in their swimsuits

502
00:25:05,377 --> 00:25:07,746
Seo-yeon / I was looking forward to it

503
00:25:13,385 --> 00:25:15,244
Mi-rang / I wore a rash guard

504
00:25:15,254 --> 00:25:17,212
Mi-rang / But it made my shoulders look so narrow

505
00:25:17,222 --> 00:25:18,247
Ri-won / They are narrow though

506
00:25:18,257 --> 00:25:20,115
Ri-won / Your shoulders are narrower than mine

507
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:23,462
Ri-won / My shoulders are wider

508
00:25:24,363 --> 00:25:25,764
Min-woo / Oh, that’s Seo-yeon

509
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:32,294
Ri-won / Surprised? Surprised?

510
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:34,673
Ri-won / I asked if you were surprised!

511
00:25:39,545 --> 00:25:44,373
Ri-won / So cute, our Han-kyul is so cute, what do I do

512
00:25:44,383 --> 00:25:46,008
Ri-won / What stood out to me about Han-kyul

513
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:47,576
Ri-won / I thought rash guard meant top and bottom

514
00:25:47,586 --> 00:25:49,711
Ri-won / Like full coverage

515
00:25:49,721 --> 00:25:52,848
Ri-won / But it was this super cute one-piece swimsuit

516
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:54,983
Ri-won / It looked so good on her

517
00:25:54,993 --> 00:25:57,252
Ri-won / I was like, “She’s too cute,” that’s all I could think

518
00:25:57,262 --> 00:25:59,932
Mi-rang / Alright, to our last night together!

519
00:26:15,214 --> 00:26:17,749
Mi-rang / You're all not eating much 'cause you're about to wear bikinis, right?

520
00:26:19,618 --> 00:26:21,376
Da-gyo / That’s not it

521
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:23,779
Han-kyul / I’m not wearing a bikini, so I’m gonna eat

522
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:26,381
Go ahead, eat / So cute

523
00:26:26,391 --> 00:26:29,051
Han-kyul / I'm eating this fruit

524
00:26:29,061 --> 00:26:31,320
Hee-young / Don’t you think we’re all getting prettier as this goes on?

525
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:31,987
Ri-won / Right?

526
00:26:31,997 --> 00:26:34,433
Ri-won / Doesn’t our skin look brighter?

527
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,270
Ri-won / I love it so much

528
00:26:45,477 --> 00:26:47,302
Mi-rang / If you get cream on your face, tell each other

529
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:50,682
Mi-rang / Seriously, let each other know, okay?

530
00:26:52,251 --> 00:26:53,518
Hee-young / That’s so cheesy

531
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,030
Min-woo / Should we head in now?Ri-won / Yeah! Sounds good

532
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,833
Da-gyo / Whoever’s most confident should go first

533
00:27:17,843 --> 00:27:19,401
Min-woo / Let’s go in together

534
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:21,703
Hee-young / Whoever’s confident, stand up!

535
00:27:21,713 --> 00:27:22,938
Ri-won / Mi-rang, they said to get up, hurry

536
00:27:22,948 --> 00:27:24,783
Mi-rang / Alright then, I’ll go

537
00:27:30,756 --> 00:27:33,015
Hee-young / She’s taking it off! She’s taking it off!

538
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:34,793
Da-gyo / But it’s nothing, really

539
00:27:40,065 --> 00:27:42,424
Mi-rang / I honestly hoped no one else would see

540
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:45,871
Mi-rang / A part of me just wanted to keep it to myself

541
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:16,535
Ri-won / I thought she was an Egyptian goddess

542
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:26,468
Min-woo / Yeah, I came fully prepared today

543
00:28:26,478 --> 00:28:29,304
Min-woo / I’d been waiting for this moment to finally

544
00:28:29,314 --> 00:28:31,640
Min-woo / Show a side of me I’ve been hiding

545
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,576
Hee-young / It was like a magazine shoot, seriously

546
00:28:34,586 --> 00:28:36,511
Hee-young / Everyone looked incredible, really

547
00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:40,649
Hee-young / I saw so much skin...

548
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:45,263
Hee-young / I was so overwhelmed, I couldn’t even process anything

549
00:28:53,872 --> 00:28:57,576
Ri-won / That purple looks amazing on you!

550
00:29:00,011 --> 00:29:04,873
Ri-won / Wow... Hee-young, you really surprised me

551
00:29:04,883 --> 00:29:09,054
Ri-won / The way she was covering up that gorgeous figure—totally caught me off guard

552
00:29:09,821 --> 00:29:11,456
Ri-won / I love this place

553
00:29:17,162 --> 00:29:19,197
Mi-rang / One, two, three

554
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:26,371
Ri-won / Throw it one more time, please

555
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:36,515
Ri-won / You're throwing it way too high on purpose!

556
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:50,986
Mi-rang / Honestly, thinking we might say goodbye today

557
00:29:50,996 --> 00:29:52,063
Mi-rang / Made me really sad

558
00:29:53,432 --> 00:29:56,858
Ri-won / But earlier on the bed, she was seriously tearing up

559
00:29:56,868 --> 00:29:58,894
Ri-won / Her eyes were welling up

560
00:29:58,904 --> 00:30:01,129
Ri-won / And she said, "Just thinking this might be the end makes me so sad"

561
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:02,297
Ri-won / That’s what she said

562
00:30:02,307 --> 00:30:05,967
Mi-rang / Even coming here like this

563
00:30:05,977 --> 00:30:09,304
Mi-rang / It really wasn’t easy for me

564
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:12,874
Mi-rang / I mean, I wasn’t even that close to anyone

565
00:30:12,884 --> 00:30:14,843
Mi-rang / And it was my first time doing this with total strangers

566
00:30:14,853 --> 00:30:15,877
Mi-rang / So I think it’ll really stay with me

567
00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:17,579
Mi-rang / It'll be such a meaningful memory

568
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:20,282
Ri-won / Same here

569
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:22,017
Mi-rang / I hope we keep in touch

570
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:23,094
Mi-rang / Even as time passes

571
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:28,456
Ri-won / Around this time next year, I want all of us

572
00:30:28,466 --> 00:30:30,091
Ri-won / To come back here again, same place

573
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:34,162
Ri-won / What do you think?Hee-young / The exact same place?

574
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:35,230
Ri-won / I wanna come back here

575
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,033
Hee-young / Let’s just do Jeju next timeRi-won / You didn’t like it here?

576
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:39,211
Hee-young / No, I loved it

577
00:30:40,178 --> 00:30:43,705
Hee-young / But every time? We should explore other places too

578
00:30:43,715 --> 00:30:46,875
Ri-won / Either way, I really want to go to Jeju next year

579
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:49,377
Min-woo / But time really flew by

580
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:52,180
Ri-won / Especially since you came a day later than the rest

581
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,882
Yeah yeah

582
00:30:53,892 --> 00:30:57,128
Min-woo / I was going to try something but it was already over

583
00:30:57,996 --> 00:31:01,156
Ri-won / I think Han-kyul is the one who's changed the most

584
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,725
Ri-won / Compared to the first day here

585
00:31:03,735 --> 00:31:06,328
Han-kyul / For me

586
00:31:06,338 --> 00:31:10,242
Han-kyul / Just being around all these beautiful women

587
00:31:11,343 --> 00:31:13,902
Da-gyo / I totally get that

588
00:31:13,912 --> 00:31:18,173
Han-kyul / I feel like I recharged my energy

589
00:31:18,183 --> 00:31:22,177
Han-kyul / and now I’m leaving with a full heart

590
00:31:22,187 --> 00:31:24,880
So cute

591
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:29,517
Han-kyul / It's like I’ve absorbed the hormones of women

592
00:31:29,527 --> 00:31:31,786
Hee-young / Maybe that’s why you keep getting prettier

593
00:31:31,796 --> 00:31:33,288
Ri-won / Yeah you’ve gotten so pretty

594
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:38,827
Han-kyul / Seriously, you’re all like vitamins

595
00:31:38,837 --> 00:31:42,574
Da-gyo / I really loved it

596
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:46,534
Da-gyo / I don’t have many close friends

597
00:31:46,544 --> 00:31:49,804
Da-gyo / So it was nice to have people

598
00:31:49,814 --> 00:31:52,274
Da-gyo / to talk about the same topics with

599
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:55,710
Da-gyo / That really left a strong impression on me

600
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,446
Da-gyo / I didn’t expect Min-woo to be so fun

601
00:31:58,456 --> 00:32:03,184
When we talked, she was honestly really charming

602
00:32:03,194 --> 00:32:05,287
Mi-rang / Min-woo came in as the wild card

603
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:09,758
Da-gyo / Yeah, I thought “Ah~ there’s a reason for that”

604
00:32:09,768 --> 00:32:11,893
Ri-won / I was really struggling on my own

605
00:32:11,903 --> 00:32:14,262
Ri-won / But once Min-woo arrived, I could finally breathe

606
00:32:14,272 --> 00:32:16,831
Ri-won / The moment I saw her I thought

607
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:18,867
Ri-won / "Ah now that Min-woo's here"

608
00:32:18,877 --> 00:32:23,071
Ri-won / "I can just do half the work"

609
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:26,618
Mi-rang / You really saved the mood in the beginning

610
00:32:29,654 --> 00:32:33,258
Ri-won / Ah not exactly, but like...

611
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:38,053
Ri-won / Having the pool party at the end made it feel more

612
00:32:38,063 --> 00:32:42,090
Ri-won / bittersweet, like are we really leaving now?

613
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,492
Ri-won / That’s what I was thinking

614
00:32:44,502 --> 00:32:48,196
Mi-rang / We should’ve played like this way earlier

615
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:51,166
Mi-rang / It’s not something you can do in everyday life

616
00:32:51,176 --> 00:32:52,567
Mi-rang / Unless you go on a trip

617
00:32:52,577 --> 00:32:55,637
Mi-rang / It really felt like we created another special memory

618
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:57,072
Seo-yeon / I was feeling a bit sad too

619
00:32:57,082 --> 00:32:59,374
Seo-yeon / But I was glad we got to do this on our last night

620
00:32:59,384 --> 00:33:02,744
Seo-yeon / We got to enjoy it, eat delicious food

621
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:06,648
Seo-yeon / Play in the water together and talk about things we hadn’t shared yet

622
00:33:06,658 --> 00:33:11,229
Seo-yeon / So I think that’s what made it really special

623
00:33:14,566 --> 00:33:22,166
Cheers~ To us~

624
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:35,145
Mi-rang~

625
00:33:35,445 --> 00:33:36,246
Who is it?

626
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:41,241
Da-gyo / I came to scold you
Hee-young / Can I come in?

627
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:43,277
Mi-rang / Who are you?

628
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:44,011
Mi-rang / Oh my gosh

629
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:44,878
Da-gyo / Who is it?

630
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:45,812
Hee-young

631
00:33:45,822 --> 00:33:47,881
Da-gyo / Oh it’s Hee-young unnie

632
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:50,484
Hee-young / I'm not the type to step in like that

633
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:51,495
Hee-young / But I ran straight over because

634
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:53,720
Hee-young / You two are sharing a room

635
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:56,023
Hee-young / That would make things emotionally complicated

636
00:33:56,033 --> 00:34:00,160
Hee-young / And in this kind of situation, they’d probably have some emotional exchange

637
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:02,763
Hee-young / I just wanted to understand what it felt like

638
00:34:02,773 --> 00:34:05,098
Hee-young / So I went and lay between their beds

639
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:08,435
Hee-young / I don't think we really said anything different or deep

640
00:34:08,445 --> 00:34:10,804
Hee-young / I didn’t want to make it feel like pressure

641
00:34:10,814 --> 00:34:12,516
Hee-young / That would have made it awkward

642
00:34:20,824 --> 00:34:24,017
Hee-young / Where are you going?
Da-gyo / I don’t know

643
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:25,752
Mi-rang / The reason I stepped away was

644
00:34:25,762 --> 00:34:28,889
Mi-rang / Because Da-gyo was already having a really hard day

645
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:31,358
Mi-rang / I thought my presence might make her uncomfortable

646
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:33,870
Mi-rang / Or that we wouldn’t be able to say what we wanted to say

647
00:34:34,104 --> 00:34:36,530
Mi-rang / Honestly, it wasn’t so much out of consideration for Hee-young

648
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,601
Mi-rang / I just didn’t want Da-gyo to feel awkward so I left

649
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,113
Da-gyo / Have you decided who you're writing to tonight?

650
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:47,784
Hee-young / What is she saying!

651
00:34:50,654 --> 00:34:53,690
Da-gyo / Appeal with cuteness?

652
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,961
Hee-young / No?

653
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:59,586
Da-gyo / Cute Cute

654
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:00,631
Hee-young / I’m not doing it

655
00:35:01,064 --> 00:35:02,189
Da-gyo / No seriously you’re cute

656
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,734
Da-gyo / No seriously you’re cute

657
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:09,329
Ri-won / Just make your final choice tomorrow comfortably

658
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:11,074
Han-kyul / You too

659
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,602
Ri-won / I’ve always just done whatever I wanted anyway

660
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:18,305
Han-kyul / And now

661
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:19,740
Han-kyul / I’m not going to put

662
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,742
Han-kyul / any special meaning into my final choice

663
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,711
Han-kyul / My book... of course the book itself

664
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:26,613
Han-kyul / doesn’t cost much, but that

665
00:35:26,623 --> 00:35:28,949
Han-kyul / is something I only recommend

666
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,751
Han-kyul / to someone I really cherish

667
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:34,231
Han-kyul / So I hope you'll take it with you

668
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,275
Seo-yeon / After the pool party, I came back and lay in bed

669
00:35:55,285 --> 00:35:59,246
Seo-yeon / I remembered I still had time left to write my note

670
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:02,616
Seo-yeon / I debated whether to write to Da-gyo or someone else

671
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,494
Seo-yeon / I thought about it a lot

672
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,756
Oh am I first?

673
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:09,724
Am I the first one?

674
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,002
Yeah

675
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,436
Ri-won / Honestly, today

676
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:24,071
Ri-won / I had so many thoughts

677
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,507
Ri-won / I wanted Han-kyul to be happy here

678
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,209
Ri-won / and not regret coming here

679
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,211
Ri-won / and finish this well

680
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,379
Ri-won / That’s why I stayed by her side like that

681
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:34,048
Ri-won / But when it didn’t go well

682
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,583
Ri-won / I started to wonder if

683
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:36,817
Ri-won / maybe Han-kyul didn’t see me

684
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,586
Ri-won / as someone cool

685
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,355
Ri-won / like Hee-young or Da-gyo, the ones she admired

686
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,325
Ri-won / If they had been her roommates, cheering her on

687
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:47,094
Ri-won / and writing her notes every day

688
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:49,163
Ri-won / maybe she would’ve changed more?

689
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,098
Ri-won / That thought came to me

690
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,499
Ri-won / and because of that

691
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:54,878
Ri-won / I think I had a bit of a crash of reality

692
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,932
Jin-ah / I kinda knew it would be like this

693
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:40,447
Seo-yeon / I was a bit flustered

694
00:37:40,457 --> 00:37:42,382
Seo-yeon / But at the same time I was kind of happy

695
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:45,085
Seo-yeon / Because today I was going to write to someone new

696
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:48,055
Seo-yeon / And she wasn’t really sure

697
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,689
Seo-yeon / if I was interested in her or not

698
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:50,690
Seo-yeon / That was the situation

699
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,727
Seo-yeon / So thinking about her reaction made me laugh a little

700
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:56,873
Seo-yeon / And thinking about sending that note made me excited

701
00:37:57,741 --> 00:37:59,433
Mi-rang / I didn’t really hesitate

702
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,070
Mi-rang / Because there was always someone I wanted to write to

703
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,006
Mi-rang / I just thought, ‘I’m writing a note to her’

704
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:07,551
Mi-rang / That’s all that came to mind

705
00:38:08,285 --> 00:38:09,419
Min-woo / When I found out it was a public note

706
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:10,777
Min-woo / it was fun, but honestly

707
00:38:10,787 --> 00:38:11,578
Min-woo / it was fun

708
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:14,748
Min-woo / But I always made it obvious it was me

709
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:17,184
Min-woo / Whether my name was on it or not

710
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,919
Min-woo / Still, when she sees my name

711
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:22,265
Min-woo / I thought, ‘Maybe she’ll waver a little more?’

712
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,325
Hee-young / Honestly, I’ve never struggled with

713
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:27,327
Hee-young / the whole anonymous vs. public thing

714
00:38:27,337 --> 00:38:30,564
Hee-young / Every time I wrote a note, I’ve always been clear

715
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,499
Hee-young / and either made it obvious or didn’t write at all

716
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:34,067
Hee-young / So revealing myself

717
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:35,502
Hee-young / doesn’t mean much to me

718
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:37,981
Hee-young / It’s not that significant

719
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,815
Ri-won / I think I had two thoughts

720
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,651
Ri-won / ‘Is Han-kyul feeling pressured?’

721
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,320
Ri-won / ‘Would she feel more comfortable if I wrote to someone else

722
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,023
Ri-won / and let go a bit?’

723
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,625
Ri-won / ‘But would that even change anything?’

724
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,737
Ri-won / So I ended up weighing everything out

725
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,606
Min-woo / To. Hee-young

726
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,717
Min-woo / You looked the prettiest today

727
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,786
Min-woo / At the end of the note

728
00:40:32,796 --> 00:40:34,488
Min-woo / I drew the moon on Hee-young’s shoulder

729
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:35,722
Min-woo / And my moon too

730
00:40:35,732 --> 00:40:38,725
Min-woo / I overheard that she likes movies

731
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:40,861
Min-woo / I picked that up from conversations

732
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,664
Min-woo / She’s artistic and has tattoos

733
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:45,933
Min-woo / So I hoped for more emotional impact

734
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,212
Min-woo / Through abstract expression

735
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,246
Hee-young / I felt really happy and grateful

736
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,514
Hee-young / I didn’t think someone like Da-gyo

737
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,483
Hee-young / Could write a note to me

738
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,651
Hee-young / So I really wasn’t expecting anything

739
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:06,453
Hee-young / But when I saw Min-woo’s note

740
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:08,722
Hee-young / I felt even more thankful

741
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,859
Hee-young / We’re such different people

742
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,394
Hee-young / So there are still a lot of things I don’t understand

743
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:17,364
Hee-young / But I feel that in their own way

744
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:20,267
Hee-young / They keep trying to express their feelings to me

745
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:24,638
Hee-young / And trying not to make me feel burdened

746
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,774
Hee-young / I felt that they really see me positively

747
00:41:27,784 --> 00:41:32,246
Hee-young / And are trying to sincerely connect with me

748
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,413
Hee-young / That good feeling

749
00:41:33,423 --> 00:41:36,917
Hee-young / Just tingled through my whole body

750
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,862
Hee-young / It felt warm

751
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,348
Min-woo / I don’t feel regret

752
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:11,018
Min-woo / I think I gave it my all

753
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,853
Min-woo / But I don’t want to give up

754
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,522
Min-woo / I’ve done my best so far

755
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:19,136
Min-woo / And I’m going to keep giving my best until the end

756
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,250
Ri-won / Aww... okay okay

757
00:42:50,572 --> 00:42:52,442
Han-kyul / Puffed rice fairy

758
00:42:52,452 --> 00:42:54,042
Ri-won / It's so good

759
00:42:54,052 --> 00:42:56,082
Ri-won / I can't stop eating

760
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:58,292
Han-kyul / Did a note come?

761
00:42:58,652 --> 00:43:00,012
Ri-won / Yeah look!

762
00:43:00,492 --> 00:43:02,252
Ri-won / Take a look at it

763
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:09,602
Han-kyul / Thank you

764
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:11,002
Ri-won / Do you have one by any chance?

765
00:43:11,012 --> 00:43:13,412
Han-kyul / I’ve always had just one

766
00:43:14,132 --> 00:43:15,442
Ri-won / You didn’t even check who it’s from

767
00:43:15,452 --> 00:43:17,242
Ri-won / Why are you saying thank you

768
00:43:17,252 --> 00:43:20,852
Han-kyul / Because I’ve never received one before

769
00:43:23,732 --> 00:43:24,922
Ri-won / To. Han-kyul!

770
00:43:24,932 --> 00:43:27,602
Ri-won / You asked if it felt like pouring water into a bottomless jar

771
00:43:27,612 --> 00:43:29,042
Ri-won / The answer is

772
00:43:29,052 --> 00:43:30,642
Ri-won / If you pour more water faster than it leaks

773
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:33,682
Ri-won / the jar will eventually fill up

774
00:43:33,692 --> 00:43:35,442
Ri-won / So let go of your guilt

775
00:43:35,452 --> 00:43:36,602
Ri-won / and without pressure

776
00:43:36,612 --> 00:43:38,842
Ri-won / I hope you make the choice you want tomorrow

777
00:43:38,852 --> 00:43:41,362
Ri-won / Thank you so much for this past week, I was really happy

778
00:43:41,372 --> 00:43:43,492
Ri-won / From. Ri-won

779
00:43:44,492 --> 00:43:46,282
Ri-won / If there had been a real chance

780
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,202
Ri-won / for Han-kyul to do well with someone else

781
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:50,612
Ri-won / maybe I wouldn’t have written a note

782
00:43:51,172 --> 00:43:53,362
Ri-won / If Han-kyul had other options

783
00:43:53,372 --> 00:43:56,602
Ri-won / I thought, "Then like always, I should just share how I feel today too"

784
00:43:56,612 --> 00:43:59,492
Ri-won / That’s what I thought

785
00:44:02,372 --> 00:44:05,252
Han-kyul / What is there to be thankful for about me?

786
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:07,082
Ri-won / You didn’t even check who it’s from

787
00:44:07,092 --> 00:44:07,882
Ri-won / Saying “thank you” like that

788
00:44:07,892 --> 00:44:09,962
Ri-won / is seriously so funny

789
00:44:09,972 --> 00:44:12,322
Han-kyul / Up until now

790
00:44:12,332 --> 00:44:15,092
Han-kyul / I've only ever received one from you each time

791
00:44:16,372 --> 00:44:20,562
Han-kyul / And something to be thankful about...

792
00:44:20,572 --> 00:44:22,762
Han-kyul / If it's just being polite, I get it...

793
00:44:22,772 --> 00:44:26,122
Ri-won / But I really was thankful

794
00:44:26,132 --> 00:44:29,242
Han-kyul / Even though I never replied in the end

795
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:31,522
Han-kyul / Still, I honestly...

796
00:44:31,532 --> 00:44:34,202
Han-kyul / I really want to give you my favorite poetry book

797
00:44:34,212 --> 00:44:35,362
Ri-won / I didn’t send the note

798
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:37,852
Ri-won / expecting a reply anyway...

799
00:44:39,852 --> 00:44:41,962
Ri-won / When I said I was thankful to Han-kyul, I meant it

800
00:44:41,972 --> 00:44:42,722
Ri-won / Because

801
00:44:42,732 --> 00:44:47,322
Ri-won / I really didn’t expect to feel all these emotions coming here

802
00:44:47,332 --> 00:44:52,092
Ri-won / Not at all, honestly

803
00:44:52,172 --> 00:44:54,962
Ri-won / But I got to feel these things again after a long time

804
00:44:54,972 --> 00:44:58,562
Ri-won / And it reminded me of who I am

805
00:44:58,572 --> 00:45:00,202
Ri-won / Or just what kind of person I am

806
00:45:00,212 --> 00:45:01,962
Ri-won / So I think it was really meaningful for me

807
00:45:01,972 --> 00:45:05,292
Ri-won / This time meant a lot to me

808
00:45:05,492 --> 00:45:09,922
Han-kyul / If it weren’t for you, unnie, I would’ve just been

809
00:45:09,932 --> 00:45:12,402
Han-kyul / someone who disappeared without ever getting a single vote

810
00:45:12,412 --> 00:45:15,522
Han-kyul / Just “Person #1” or something like that

811
00:45:15,532 --> 00:45:17,762
Ri-won / The number of votes doesn’t matter

812
00:45:17,772 --> 00:45:19,732
Ri-won / It really doesn’t

813
00:45:20,132 --> 00:45:23,722
Ri-won / What matters is that Han-kyul felt something through this

814
00:45:23,732 --> 00:45:29,242
Han-kyul / I’m taking away so much as a person

815
00:45:29,252 --> 00:45:30,762
Ri-won / That’s all that matters

816
00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:31,802
Ri-won / Even if you become a couple

817
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,772
Ri-won / you never know what’ll happen afterwards

818
00:45:34,252 --> 00:45:36,122
Ri-won / And even if you don’t become a couple here

819
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:37,842
Ri-won / you don’t know what might happen later

820
00:45:37,852 --> 00:45:39,162
Ri-won / There’s no way to know

821
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:42,202
Ri-won / If it’s meant to be, you’ll keep seeing each other

822
00:45:42,212 --> 00:45:46,042
Ri-won / But we made a promise

823
00:45:46,052 --> 00:45:47,412
Ri-won / And I’m going to keep it!

824
00:45:48,532 --> 00:45:50,642
Ri-won / I’ll visit your place, and you’ll come to mine

825
00:45:50,652 --> 00:45:52,812
Ri-won / We’ll go to Thailand...

826
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:05,285
Jin-ah / Oh geez

827
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:06,796
Jin-ah / It’s your first time huh

828
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,744
Min-woo / Hahaha why?

829
00:47:12,362 --> 00:47:13,430
Mi-rang / You're turning around?

830
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:18,902
Da-gyo / I’ll go down and check
Mi-rang / Okay

831
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:37,811
Da-gyo / To. Mi-rang

832
00:47:37,821 --> 00:47:39,245
Da-gyo / The date was so much fun

833
00:47:39,255 --> 00:47:41,524
Da-gyo / But I couldn't stop thinking about how you cried today

834
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,694
Da-gyo / Thank you for always expressing your feelings

835
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,288
Mi-rang / Da-gyo wrote to me

836
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,622
Mi-rang / So I thought maybe

837
00:47:49,632 --> 00:47:51,758
Mi-rang / She could write to someone else too

838
00:47:51,768 --> 00:47:55,038
Mi-rang / But in the end she chose me, and I was grateful

839
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,568
Seo-yeon / To. Mi-rang

840
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:04,404
Seo-yeon / I really liked sharing a room with you

841
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:07,874
Seo-yeon / From now on, I want to write you a note every day

842
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:08,818
Seo-yeon / I like you!

843
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:15,081
Seo-yeon / 'Yeah I know this is just'

844
00:48:15,091 --> 00:48:17,527
Seo-yeon / 'One-sided feelings on my part'

845
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,086
Seo-yeon / I had those thoughts too but still

846
00:48:20,096 --> 00:48:22,088
Seo-yeon / I can’t just keep having one-sided crushes

847
00:48:22,098 --> 00:48:24,124
Seo-yeon / You have to try everything

848
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:27,003
Seo-yeon / So I wrote my note carefully and sent it

849
00:48:54,397 --> 00:48:56,166
Jin-ah / To. My lovely Da-gyo

850
00:48:57,033 --> 00:49:00,036
Jin-ah / For a strong love to grow, there must be trials and growth

851
00:49:00,436 --> 00:49:03,373
Jin-ah / And when trials lead to growth and deep love

852
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:08,134
Jin-ah / You inevitably need a mature guide, and here

853
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:09,436
Jin-ah / At ToGetHer House, right now

854
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:13,173
Jin-ah / I didn’t find someone to share my heart and future with

855
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,608
Jin-ah / But in the steady and transparent love

856
00:49:15,618 --> 00:49:17,610
Jin-ah / That Jin-ah will grow into

857
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:19,655
Jin-ah / Your influence will be clearly

858
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,948
Jin-ah / Deeply embedded

859
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:25,561
Jin-ah / My first lesbian friend

860
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,520
Jin-ah / Thank you for being that to me

861
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,331
Jin-ah / From Jin-ah

862
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:33,803
Han-kyul / You looked beautiful today

863
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:35,695
Han-kyul / That’s all I wanted to say

864
00:49:35,705 --> 00:49:41,211
Han-kyul / If it’s the next life (I really wanted to get to know you more)

865
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,215
Hee-young / To. Da-gyo

866
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:58,084
Hee-young / I was worried I might have realized it too late but still

867
00:49:58,094 --> 00:50:01,154
Hee-young / I’m glad I got to say something before it ended

868
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:04,824
Hee-young / Thank you for letting me feel this experience and emotion

869
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:08,428
Hee-young / I think I want to get to know you more even after this

870
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,296
Hee-young / Have a peaceful night

871
00:50:10,306 --> 00:50:11,541
From. Hee-young

872
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,467
Hee-young / The one who really reached me

873
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:16,469
Hee-young / And gave me courage sincerely

874
00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:19,572
Hee-young / The one who came to me was Da-gyo

875
00:50:19,582 --> 00:50:22,408
Hee-young / And I think Da-gyo is such a good person

876
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:23,820
Hee-young / I felt butterflies

877
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:26,723
Hee-young / And the one who made me feel this way

878
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,559
Hee-young / Was only Da-gyo

879
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,561
Mi-rang / To Da-gyo

880
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,229
Mi-rang / Why are you so self-conscious?

881
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:45,765
Mi-rang / Don’t be, you didn’t do anything wrong

882
00:50:45,775 --> 00:50:47,767
Mi-rang / You're just very popular

883
00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:51,671
Mi-rang / I pretended not to care in front of people today so you wouldn’t feel pressured

884
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,707
Mi-rang / I waited a lot today, so I was sad we didn’t get a date

885
00:50:54,717 --> 00:50:58,811
Mi-rang / Since it’s the last day, organize your thoughts and cheer up

886
00:50:58,821 --> 00:51:00,913
Mi-rang / You’re part of a place I’ll remember forever

887
00:51:00,923 --> 00:51:03,916
Mi-rang / And last year too, I’m grateful you were there

888
00:51:03,926 --> 00:51:04,984
Mi-rang / I like you

889
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:06,729
From Mi-rang

890
00:51:07,563 --> 00:51:10,690
Mi-rang / Normally Da-gyo is always cheerful

891
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,725
Mi-rang / But after getting so many notes

892
00:51:12,735 --> 00:51:14,560
Mi-rang / She probably felt bad toward some of them

893
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,728
Mi-rang / I don’t know exactly how she felt

894
00:51:15,738 --> 00:51:17,463
Mi-rang / But it didn’t feel like her usual self

895
00:51:17,473 --> 00:51:21,434
Mi-rang / So I figured she was walking on eggshells

896
00:51:21,444 --> 00:51:22,969
Mi-rang / I thought if I tried to care for her

897
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:26,339
Mi-rang / It might make her feel burdened

898
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:29,218
Mi-rang / So I tried to hide my feelings today

899
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:32,021
Mi-rang / I just thought, ‘I hope Da-gyo feels at ease’

900
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,006
Mi-rang / Is it complicated?

901
00:53:07,016 --> 00:53:10,410
Da-gyo / No it’s not that

902
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,488
Da-gyo / I’m just exhausted

903
00:53:12,955 --> 00:53:18,384
Da-gyo / I had so many conversations with so many people today

904
00:53:18,394 --> 00:53:21,664
Da-gyo / It was just too much

905
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:28,571
Da-gyo / I used up too many emotions all at once

906
00:53:29,605 --> 00:53:31,941
Mi-rang / Do you feel bad toward Hee-young?

907
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:33,643
Da-gyo / No

908
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:38,104
Mi-rang / Be honest
Da-gyo / About what?

909
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,673
Mi-rang / Do you feel bad toward Hee-young?

910
00:53:40,683 --> 00:53:41,974
Da-gyo / No

911
00:53:41,984 --> 00:53:43,910
Da-gyo / I'm crying because I'm exhausted

912
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,323
Da-gyo / And because it’s the last day

913
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:53,062
Mi-rang / You don’t seem happy

914
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:57,089
Da-gyo / Why?
Mi-rang / Because you’re crying

915
00:53:57,099 --> 00:53:59,502
Mi-rang / Isn’t that a sign things are complicated?

916
00:54:00,536 --> 00:54:03,606
Mi-rang / I didn’t think you were crying because of me

917
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:06,265
Mi-rang / That made me feel a little sad

918
00:54:06,275 --> 00:54:08,010
Mi-rang / If she’s crying this much

919
00:54:08,177 --> 00:54:10,269
Mi-rang / It means her heart is really

920
00:54:10,279 --> 00:54:12,615
Mi-rang / In a tangled state

921
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:15,174
Mi-rang / So the note I gave her

922
00:54:15,184 --> 00:54:18,287
Mi-rang / Felt like it got pushed aside

923
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:21,013
Mi-rang / Feeling sorry means

924
00:54:21,023 --> 00:54:25,051
Mi-rang / There were some good feelings there

925
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:29,589
Mi-rang / But maybe the timing just didn’t work out

926
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,936
Mi-rang / So I felt like maybe she was crying out of sadness

927
00:54:34,103 --> 00:54:37,840
Da-gyo / Love isn’t the only emotion you feel

928
00:54:38,007 --> 00:54:39,175
Da-gyo / There’s also gratitude

929
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:42,211
Da-gyo / And we’ve shared time together here

930
00:54:43,312 --> 00:54:47,016
Da-gyo / I cried because those things meant a lot to me

931
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:53,089
Da-gyo / But hearing you say

932
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,214
Da-gyo / That you’re not happy because of me

933
00:54:55,224 --> 00:54:57,426
Da-gyo / That was just too hard to hear

934
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:05,591
Da-gyo / I don’t know what I’m supposed to do

935
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:11,774
Da-gyo / Did I really make it that confusing?

936
00:55:30,893 --> 00:55:34,987
Mi-rang / I think I went to Jin-ah for advice

937
00:55:34,997 --> 00:55:38,824
Mi-rang / But honestly if she cried because of me

938
00:55:38,834 --> 00:55:40,326
Mi-rang / She would’ve stayed with me

939
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:42,695
Mi-rang / She would’ve tried to talk to me

940
00:55:42,705 --> 00:55:45,565
Mi-rang / But if she cried because of someone else

941
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:49,602
Mi-rang / Then it’s something she couldn’t say to me

942
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:53,049
Mi-rang / That’s why I think she went to someone else

943
00:55:58,854 --> 00:56:02,024
Mi-rang / That’s probably why she turned to another person

944
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:24,470
Mi-rang / Ri-won, what are you doing?

945
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,916
Ri-won / Huh? Oh it’s Mi-rang?

946
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,320
Ri-won / Did you get a letter?

947
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:32,578
Ri-won / You didn’t?

948
00:56:32,588 --> 00:56:33,613
Mi-rang / I did

949
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:34,947
Ri-won / Oh? Then that’s good, but why?

950
00:56:34,957 --> 00:56:38,761
Mi-rang / But I’m crying
Ri-won / Why are you crying?

951
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:42,989
Mi-rang / It’s like she cried after getting Hee-young’s letter

952
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:45,691
Mi-rang / She’s crying like that

953
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:49,071
Mi-rang / But I can’t have a relationship like that

954
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,407
Da-gyo / Honestly I was really touched

955
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,886
Da-gyo / Mostly I was just so grateful

956
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:11,227
Da-gyo / I didn’t want to cry either

957
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,523
Jin-ah / But did you make that clear?

958
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:22,138
Jin-ah / That it’s not because you’re confused?
Da-gyo / I told her not to be anxious

959
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,173
Jin-ah / Then tell her that

960
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:41,123
Da-gyo / I didn’t cry because I was confused

961
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:45,828
Mi-rang / Forget it
Da-gyo / I mean it

962
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:56,205
Da-gyo / I hate that you’re upset

963
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,786
Mi-rang / Did you talk a lot with Jin-ah?
Da-gyo / Yeah

964
00:58:11,053 --> 00:58:17,993
Mi-rang / Talk more, I’m going to step out
Da-gyo / No, don’t

965
00:58:22,064 --> 00:58:24,256
Mi-rang / I waited for you all day

966
00:58:24,266 --> 00:58:28,104
Mi-rang / And you’re crying in front of me...

967
00:58:29,004 --> 00:58:35,444
Da-gyo / I’m sorry I cried
Maybe I’m just still too young

968
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:45,745
Mi-rang / I’m not playing with you anymore

969
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,758
Da-gyo / Don’t say that

970
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:54,296
Mi-rang / After getting the note today

971
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,591
Mi-rang / I felt like those tears weren’t for me

972
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,193
Mi-rang / I thought it was Hee-young’s letter

973
00:59:01,203 --> 00:59:03,439
Mi-rang / That made her cry

974
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:06,132
Mi-rang / I feel like she really confused me

975
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:10,513
Mi-rang / So when someone confuses me like that

976
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,506
Mi-rang / I tend to avoid them

977
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:16,085
Mi-rang / I’m not going to choose her

978
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:42,545
Da-gyo / So I’m frustrated with myself

979
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:49,218
Da-gyo / I’m mad at me

980
00:59:50,052 --> 00:59:52,745
Da-gyo / I have feelings but I’m like this

981
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,246
Da-gyo / Showing this side of me

982
00:59:54,256 --> 00:59:56,849
Da-gyo / Knowing it would upset her

983
00:59:56,859 --> 01:00:01,897
Da-gyo / I keep losing control of my emotions and I hate that

984
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:04,623
Jin-ah / But you understand

985
01:00:04,633 --> 01:00:08,470
Jin-ah / What it means for someone to come into this house

986
01:00:08,637 --> 01:00:10,629
Jin-ah / You’ve heard them for 7 days

987
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:13,632
Jin-ah / Seo-yeon, Hee-young, and so on

988
01:00:13,642 --> 01:00:15,801
Jin-ah / Do you think the notes they gave you

989
01:00:15,811 --> 01:00:18,404
Jin-ah / Were meaningless? No, right?

990
01:00:18,414 --> 01:00:20,206
Jin-ah / If you were someone

991
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:21,907
Jin-ah / Who took those notes and feelings lightly

992
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:24,486
Jin-ah / I don’t think you could’ve talked to me like this

993
01:00:25,654 --> 01:00:27,413
Da-gyo / It’s not about love

994
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:30,282
Da-gyo / I’m thankful for all those feelings given to me

995
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:34,063
Da-gyo / But the contents of those letters were all so heavy

996
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:39,225
Da-gyo / When I read them

997
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:42,905
Da-gyo / I cried because I resonated with them

998
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:46,432
Jin-ah / That’s not Mi-rang unnie’s burden

999
01:00:46,442 --> 01:00:50,502
Jin-ah / It’s yours—the feelings people have for you

1000
01:00:50,512 --> 01:00:57,076
Jin-ah / So gather a little more strength

1001
01:00:57,086 --> 01:01:03,859
Da-gyo / Today felt so incredibly long

1002
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:09,098
Da-gyo / I’m just going to make my choice

1003
01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:16,862
Da-gyo / This is all part of who I am

1004
01:01:16,872 --> 01:01:19,832
Jin-ah / And because you're this kind of you

1005
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,143
Jin-ah / The story between you and Mi-rang

1006
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,513
Jin-ah / Was even possible—because that’s who you are

1007
01:01:28,984 --> 01:01:32,745
Han-kyul / I need to go ask something downstairs

1008
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:35,658
Ri-won / Go ask and come back

1009
01:01:42,097 --> 01:01:44,890
Han-kyul / Hee-young! Can I ask you something?

1010
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:45,758
Hee-young / What is it?

1011
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:47,726
Han-kyul / Did you get a note from Jin-ah?

1012
01:01:47,736 --> 01:01:50,930
Hee-young / Today? No, why would I?

1013
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,464
Han-kyul / She said she’d write one today

1014
01:01:52,474 --> 01:01:54,800
To me?

1015
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:56,111
Han-kyul / Got it

1016
01:01:57,012 --> 01:01:59,638
Hee-young / What are you even saying to me right now?

1017
01:01:59,648 --> 01:02:03,886
Han-kyul / It's kind of... an explanation?

1018
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:06,155
Huh?

1019
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:10,859
Han-kyul / Honestly it might be me meddling too much

1020
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:15,220
Hee-young / Hold on
Han-kyul / I'm sorry

1021
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:19,692
Han-kyul / I'm sorry, I really have no idea what's going on...

1022
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:22,671
Hee-young / Okay I understand

1023
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:25,197
Hee-young / It's fine

1024
01:02:25,207 --> 01:02:27,600
Han-kyul / But you’ll see

1025
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,368
Han-kyul / If I didn’t do that

1026
01:02:29,378 --> 01:02:32,538
Han-kyul / I wouldn’t have had anything to say there

1027
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:36,442
Hee-young / Got it

1028
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,876
Hee-young / Okay okay it’s fine

1029
01:02:37,886 --> 01:02:39,678
Han-kyul / I just thought maybe the two of you...

1030
01:02:39,688 --> 01:02:43,248
Hee-young / No it’s okay but please don’t do anything like that again

1031
01:02:43,258 --> 01:02:44,049
Han-kyul / But there was only one option

1032
01:02:44,059 --> 01:02:47,586
Hee-young / That situation was already over

1033
01:02:47,596 --> 01:02:49,288
Han-kyul / It was over?

1034
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:50,956
Han-kyul / I didn’t know it was over

1035
01:02:50,966 --> 01:02:54,503
Hee-young / It ended a while ago, and there was nothing left

1036
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:57,763
Hee-young / So why did it suddenly turn into this?

1037
01:02:57,773 --> 01:02:59,208
Hee-young / What should I do?

1038
01:02:59,241 --> 01:03:01,900
Han-kyul / I’ll just assume I was fooled

1039
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:03,802
Hee-young / But why did you bring up my name?

1040
01:03:03,812 --> 01:03:05,638
Han-kyul / I just didn’t want to be misunderstood

1041
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:07,339
Han-kyul / Can I be honest?

1042
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:08,907
Hee-young / About what?

1043
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:11,043
Han-kyul / I asked her why she did that

1044
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:16,291
Han-kyul / Why she picked someone even though she didn’t write a note

1045
01:03:16,759 --> 01:03:19,685
Han-kyul / I didn’t know the situation

1046
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:21,987
Hee-young / I’m seriously going crazy here

1047
01:03:21,997 --> 01:03:24,289
Hee-young / You kept asking so I’d explain all this?

1048
01:03:24,299 --> 01:03:25,891
Hee-young / Even though I hadn’t said anything?

1049
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:27,503
Han-kyul / Said what?

1050
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,809
Han-kyul / I really didn’t know anything between you two

1051
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:35,444
Hee-young / Then why did you say anything?

1052
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,404
Han-kyul / In that situation, I didn’t even ask Jin-ah on a date

1053
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:41,507
Hee-young / You were talking about something completely different
Han-kyul / I didn’t send a date request

1054
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,452
Han-kyul / So I had nothing to say in that moment

1055
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:45,477
Hee-young / Ah okay okay

1056
01:03:45,487 --> 01:03:48,647
Hee-young / Now seriously
Han-kyul / If I need to be scolded, just scold me

1057
01:03:48,657 --> 01:03:50,616
Han-kyul / So I can know what I did wrong

1058
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,985
Han-kyul / I was just thinking to myself

1059
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:55,054
Han-kyul / Why did I stick my nose in this?

1060
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:56,789
Han-kyul / I’ve been blaming myself, so

1061
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:59,291
Han-kyul / If I deserve it, please scold me now

1062
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:00,359
Hee-young / What did I even say?

1063
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:02,594
Seo-yeon / You just wanted to help mediate, right?

1064
01:04:02,604 --> 01:04:05,464
Han-kyul / No, it wasn’t even about that

1065
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:07,066
Han-kyul / I just didn’t know what to say...

1066
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:09,301
Hee-young / So you sold me out because you had nothing to say?

1067
01:04:09,311 --> 01:04:12,881
Han-kyul / No, I didn’t mean it like that

1068
01:04:13,148 --> 01:04:16,308
Hee-young / But you did? Did you hear what she said?

1069
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:18,277
Hee-young / She said you told her

1070
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:20,045
Hee-young / To write a note to explain herself to me

1071
01:04:20,055 --> 01:04:21,380
Han-kyul / That was...

1072
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:22,191
Hee-young / You said it

1073
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:27,286
Han-kyul / I meant that before moving on emotionally
Hee-young / You told her to write a note to explain herself to me

1074
01:04:27,296 --> 01:04:28,887
Han-kyul / I thought resolving that first

1075
01:04:28,897 --> 01:04:30,189
Han-kyul / Was the right thing to do

1076
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:30,622
Hee-young / Resolve what?

1077
01:04:30,632 --> 01:04:32,624
Hee-young / Nothing ever even happened between them

1078
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:35,594
Han-kyul / I just meant before trying to share feelings with me

1079
01:04:35,604 --> 01:04:37,863
Han-kyul / If there was leftover tension

1080
01:04:37,873 --> 01:04:40,232
Han-kyul / It should be cleared up first

1081
01:04:40,242 --> 01:04:42,444
Han-kyul / That’s all I was thinking

1082
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:47,740
Hee-young / Okay, I understand
Ri-won / Hee-young doesn’t want

1083
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:50,709
Han-kyul / Any more connection
Ri-won / She just wants this to end now

1084
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:52,444
Hee-young / So I’ve been trying to do that

1085
01:04:52,454 --> 01:04:56,915
Hee-young / I’ve never talked about it with anyone until now

1086
01:04:56,925 --> 01:04:59,051
Hee-young / It’s just people who heard something from him

1087
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,396
Came to me first, so I talked then

1088
01:05:02,297 --> 01:05:04,690
Hee-young / The reason you didn’t know, Han-kyul

1089
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,358
Hee-young / Is because no one told you

1090
01:05:06,368 --> 01:05:08,427
Hee-young / That’s why I didn’t tell you either

1091
01:05:08,437 --> 01:05:11,663
Hee-young / I didn’t want to badmouth anyone
Han-kyul / I didn’t think you were

1092
01:05:11,673 --> 01:05:12,664
Hee-young / Right, but

1093
01:05:12,674 --> 01:05:13,966
Hee-young / You went and confronted her

1094
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:16,145
Hee-young / And now it feels like I did something wrong

1095
01:05:17,913 --> 01:05:20,205
Hee-young / That’s why I didn’t say anything

1096
01:05:20,215 --> 01:05:21,406
Hee-young / But then you kept asking me

1097
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:22,875
Hee-young / So I told you a bit of what happened

1098
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:24,443
Hee-young / And you went straight there and said it

1099
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:26,488
Hee-young / So it’s my fault for saying anything
Han-kyul / No, it’s my fault...

1100
01:05:29,057 --> 01:05:31,083
Hee-young / It’s my fault

1101
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:33,752
Hee-young / I shouldn’t have said anything

1102
01:05:33,762 --> 01:05:39,158
Hee-young / I get it now, just...

1103
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:42,127
Han-kyul / I’m sorry for being so...

1104
01:05:42,137 --> 01:05:45,607
Hee-young / No, it’s my fault. I was careless

1105
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:50,202
Han-kyul / I just wanted to know if it was really my fault

1106
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,237
Seo-yeon / You didn’t mean anything bad by it

1107
01:05:52,247 --> 01:05:54,873
Seo-yeon / But maybe just go upstairs and take a break

1108
01:05:54,883 --> 01:05:56,041
Ri-won / You didn’t know

1109
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:59,111
Han-kyul / I really want to apologize

1110
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,713
Han-kyul / Because today

1111
01:06:01,723 --> 01:06:02,858
Han-kyul / I don’t even know

1112
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,551
Ri-won / Life’s just hard sometimes

1113
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:07,820
Han-kyul / I got picked for a date

1114
01:06:07,830 --> 01:06:11,500
Han-kyul / What was I even supposed to say in that situation?

1115
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:25,003
Han-kyul / I seriously didn’t know anything... like an idiot

1116
01:06:25,013 --> 01:06:27,482
Han-kyul / I look like such a fool

1117
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,244
Hee-young / What even is this now?

1118
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:34,947
Seo-yeon / Seriously, on the last night...

1119
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:38,517
Hee-young / How did it suddenly turn into this?

1120
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:43,555
Hee-young / I kept trying not to talk about it...

1121
01:06:43,565 --> 01:06:48,337
Hee-young / It’s my fault it’s all my fault

1122
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:58,403
Hee-young / I really tried my best

1123
01:06:58,413 --> 01:07:03,785
Hee-young / I didn’t even do anything but...

1124
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:32,162
Ri-won / So when you talked, was Jin-ah upset?

1125
01:07:32,172 --> 01:07:36,162
Han-kyul / No, she had a poker face—it was honestly kind of scary

1126
01:07:36,172 --> 01:07:38,602
Ri-won / Jin-ah did?

1127
01:07:38,612 --> 01:07:43,362
Han-kyul / But to be honest

1128
01:07:43,372 --> 01:07:46,242
Han-kyul / in that situation

1129
01:07:46,252 --> 01:07:50,242
Han-kyul / she said something that made it seem like

1130
01:07:50,252 --> 01:07:53,122
Han-kyul / she wanted to develop our relationship

1131
01:07:53,132 --> 01:07:56,322
Han-kyul / So I felt like we should clear the air first

1132
01:07:56,332 --> 01:07:58,442
Ri-won / Oh, she said she wanted to get closer to you?
 

1133
01:07:58,452 --> 01:08:00,922
Ri-won / Oh, she said she wanted to get closer to you?
Han-kyul / Yeah, that was pretty much all she said

1134
01:08:00,932 --> 01:08:02,202
Ri-won / Really?

1135
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:04,802
Han-kyul / At that point she was saying that after this

1136
01:08:04,812 --> 01:08:08,122
Han-kyul / she wanted to show her professional side

1137
01:08:08,132 --> 01:08:10,762
Han-kyul / So to me, it felt less like she wanted

1138
01:08:10,772 --> 01:08:16,682
Han-kyul / to build a deeper emotional connection with me

1139
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:20,842
Han-kyul / and more like we should first sort out the tension between us

1140
01:08:20,852 --> 01:08:22,452
Han-kyul / That’s what I meant

1141
01:08:23,572 --> 01:08:26,122
Han-kyul / But honestly I don’t kno...

1142
01:08:26,132 --> 01:08:30,732
Han-kyul / I don’t even know if I can say I didn’t know...

1143
01:08:33,812 --> 01:08:35,612
Han-kyul / How did things even end up like this?

1144
01:08:36,852 --> 01:08:38,722
Ri-won / You had good feelings

1145
01:08:38,732 --> 01:08:41,412
Ri-won / toward Jin-ah from a long time ago

1146
01:08:41,812 --> 01:08:46,562
Han-kyul / I didn’t kno... I wasn’t keeping track of everything before and after...

1147
01:08:46,572 --> 01:08:48,962
Ri-won / Regardless of that, you genuinely

1148
01:08:48,972 --> 01:08:51,642
Ri-won / had positive feelings about Jin-ah herself

1149
01:08:51,652 --> 01:08:53,762
Han-kyul / Honestly, by the time we went on that date

1150
01:08:53,772 --> 01:08:56,442
Han-kyul / I didn’t have any of those feelings anymore

1151
01:08:56,452 --> 01:08:59,162
Han-kyul / Then what should I have done in that moment?

1152
01:08:59,172 --> 01:09:00,802
Han-kyul / I couldn’t suddenly just say

1153
01:09:00,812 --> 01:09:04,442
Han-kyul / “I suddenly don’t like you anymore,” that’d be weird too

1154
01:09:04,452 --> 01:09:05,802
Ri-won / That would’ve been better

1155
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:10,322
Ri-won / Like, "This is how I felt then, but thinking about it..."

1156
01:09:10,332 --> 01:09:13,162
Ri-won / "My feelings are different now"

1157
01:09:13,172 --> 01:09:16,162
Ri-won / No one can say anything—it’s your feeling

1158
01:09:16,172 --> 01:09:18,242
Ri-won / But to say directly

1159
01:09:18,252 --> 01:09:20,602
Ri-won / “Go clear things up with Hee-young first”

1160
01:09:20,612 --> 01:09:22,162
Ri-won / If you say that

1161
01:09:22,172 --> 01:09:24,522
Ri-won / then like Hee-young said

1162
01:09:24,532 --> 01:09:28,602
Ri-won / that’s exactly what Jin-ah would think too

1163
01:09:28,612 --> 01:09:30,042
Ri-won / She’d think Jin-ah

1164
01:09:30,052 --> 01:09:32,252
Ri-won / is just doing whatever suits her best

1165
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:40,291
Han-kyul / I should’ve understood everything from the beginning...

1166
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:45,381
리원 / 한결이는 진짜 모르고 그렇게 얘기를 한 건데

1167
01:09:45,387 --> 01:09:48,177
Ri-won / I don’t even know how to fix this

1168
01:09:48,187 --> 01:09:50,297
Ri-won / I have no idea where to start

1169
01:09:50,307 --> 01:09:52,657
Ri-won / This is already a spilled rule

1170
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:55,977
Ri-won / And filming ends tomorrow

1171
01:09:55,987 --> 01:09:57,697
Ri-won / I’m feeling so overwhelmed too

1172
01:09:57,707 --> 01:10:00,617
Ri-won / And I’m really worried about Han-kyul’s state of mind

1173
01:10:00,627 --> 01:10:02,457
Han-kyul / The part where I mentioned

1174
01:10:02,467 --> 01:10:04,217
Han-kyul / Hee-young’s name to Jin-ah

1175
01:10:04,227 --> 01:10:07,097
Han-kyul / No matter how I try to frame it

1176
01:10:07,107 --> 01:10:10,217
Han-kyul / there were definitely parts where I was wrong

1177
01:10:10,227 --> 01:10:12,017
Han-kyul / About that part...

1178
01:10:12,017 --> 01:10:14,510
한결 / 계속 사과할 생각이긴 한데

1179
01:10:14,519 --> 01:10:17,149
Han-kyul / No matter what I say

1180
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:21,079
Han-kyul / I don’t think I can explain it away, and that keeps weighing on me

1181
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:28,213
Hee-young / Because my name came up again

1182
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:29,548
Hee-young / On the last night

1183
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,794
Hee-young / My mental state really took a hit

1184
01:10:39,968 --> 01:10:42,938
Da-gyo / Ha...

1185
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:52,848
Hee-young / I just want to leave quickly

1186
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:55,818
Ri-won / I want to go home too
