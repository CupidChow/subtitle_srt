1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,474
Hee-young / Oh no what do I do?

2
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:10,099
Seo-yeon / Have you decided who to send your note to?

3
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:11,334
Hee-young / Do you think I have?

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:15,582
Hee-young / Do you think I have?
Seo-yeon / You haven’t?

5
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,641
Seo-yeon / The one sailing smoothly

6
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,075
Hee-young / What do you mean smoothly

7
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:21,821
Seo-yeon / Did you two fight today?

8
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,257
Hee-young / We didn’t fight really...

9
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,027
Hee-young / We were talking and got interrupted

10
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,420
Hee-young / I was trying to listen but

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,165
Hee-young / I didn’t even know what she was saying

12
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,025
Hee-young / I was waiting for a sincere moment

13
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,459
Hee-young / That’s what I was hoping for

14
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:39,095
Seo-yeon / You were hoping for sincerity from Jin-ah?

15
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:42,375
Hee-young / She kept saying that to me from the start

16
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,901
Hee-young / Even though I thought it was too fast

17
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:45,835
Hee-young / I still thought okay fine

18
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:46,880
Hee-young / Let’s take it slow

19
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,804
Hee-young / It felt too fast

20
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:50,173
Hee-young / So I decided I want to get to know her

21
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:52,018
Hee-young / I started focusing

22
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,221
Hee-young / But suddenly she kept changing

23
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:55,822
Hee-young / And now she’s saying the same thing to me

24
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:57,824
Hee-young / While crying

25
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:59,415
Hee-young / So what am I supposed to feel?

26
00:00:59,425 --> 00:01:02,318
Seo-yeon / I think Jin-ah meant what she said

27
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,752
Seo-yeon / She said she wanted to take it slow

28
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:06,523
Seo-yeon / But deep down she wanted more clear signs

29
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,301
Seo-yeon / I think she wanted more reassurance

30
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,711
Right?

31
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,401
Jin-ah / I’ve got a lot to do today

32
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,576
Jin-ah / There are two notes

33
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,611
Jin-ah / One for who I want to spend the night with

34
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,880
Jin-ah / One for the rival in love

35
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,805
Jin-ah / The night I want is a passionate one

36
00:01:56,815 --> 00:02:00,342
Jin-ah / But I thought the night I should send was for talking

37
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:03,723
Jin-ah / So I sent it as a night of conversation

38
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,826
Ri-won / One person you'd like to spend the night with?

39
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,534
Mi-rang / I just wanted to have a one-on-one talk

40
00:02:14,567 --> 00:02:17,026
Min-woo / To the person I want to spend the night with tonight

41
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,038
Min-woo / That person was always on my mind

42
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:21,608
Min-woo / I was ready to write it down right away

43
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:22,932
Da-gyo / One is the rival

44
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,878
Da-gyo / One is the person you want to spend the night with

45
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,044
Han-kyul / More than a love rival

46
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,213
Han-kyul / It was more like "I was just really jealous"

47
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,792
Han-kyul / That’s the feeling I had writing it

48
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,898
Jin-ah / I guess I should use my left hand for the rival note

49
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,088
Ri-won / I said that yesterday right? Or was it the day before?

50
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,368
Ri-won / I totally lost track of time

51
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,587
Ri-won / Why do you look so out of it though?

52
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,689
Mi-rang / Did you talk for a long time?

53
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,925
Ri-won / I guess she had a lot to talk about

54
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,458
Hee-young / I felt confused and flustered

55
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:31,004
Hee-young / And I couldn’t even understand some of the things she said

56
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,339
Hee-young / So to make things clearer

57
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,409
Hee-young / I went to talk to her again

58
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,097
Jin-ah / Just do what you were going to do

59
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,660
Hee-young / I came to finish the talk from earlier

60
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,905
Hee-young / I came to talk

61
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:07,640
Jin-ah / Yeah

62
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,309
Hee-young / Why?

63
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,346
Jin-ah / I just said I want to be alone

64
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,214
Hee-young / Seriously?

65
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,641
Hee-young / We can’t talk?

66
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,452
Jin-ah / No

67
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:23,323
Jin-ah / I don’t know I just want to be alone sorry

68
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,193
Hee-young / Can’t we talk just a bit?

69
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,388
Hee-young / We stopped midway earlier

70
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,133
Hee-young / I didn’t get to explain what I think

71
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,402
Hee-young / I didn’t have time to say it

72
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,894
Hee-young / So if there’s a misunderstanding

73
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,363
Hee-young / I want to clear it up

74
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,675
Hee-young / Instead of both stressing out

75
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,110
Hee-young / Without even knowing what it is

76
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:47,213
Hee-young / Wouldn't it be better to talk it out?

77
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:48,915
Hee-young / But if it’s too hard and you need time

78
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,373
Hee-young / I can wait

79
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:54,087
Hee-young / Yeah? Will that be okay?

80
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,057
Hee-young / So did you already tell me everything

81
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:10,002
Hee-young / About how you feel?

82
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,605
Jin-ah / To sum it up it’s just...

83
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,898
Jin-ah / I’ve liked you this whole time

84
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:19,278
Jin-ah / I like you

85
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,648
Jin-ah / I can’t change that feeling

86
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:27,410
Hee-young / I wanted to say I like you too
Jin-ah / I like you

87
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,714
Jin-ah / But I worried that saying it might pressure you

88
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,350
Jin-ah / Like what if you’re seeing someone else

89
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:41,758
Jin-ah / Even one date with someone else gets to me
Hee-young / So you couldn’t make sense of it all?

90
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:45,328
Jin-ah / Even with the note yesterday

91
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,297
Jin-ah / I wrote it thinking I’d match with the person I liked

92
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,743
Jin-ah / But I forgot it was drawn randomly

93
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,044
Jin-ah / I totally forgot

94
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,971
Jin-ah / When it asked about my feelings

95
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,775
Jin-ah / I thought I had to write someone else

96
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,353
Hee-young / Oh the feelings note?

97
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,178
Jin-ah / Yeah like on the first day too

98
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,191
Jin-ah / If we write two notes a day

99
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,849
Jin-ah / I thought maybe I’m supposed to try someone new

100
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:13,121
Jin-ah / Like maybe we’re meant to switch up matches

101
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:16,592
Jin-ah / So I tried to express things to you in other ways

102
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,161
Jin-ah / Because I’m still human too

103
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:21,864
Jin-ah / Not sending you a note

104
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:27,269
Jin-ah / I was afraid if I explained that

105
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,807
Jin-ah / You’d think I was just apologizing

106
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,642
Jin-ah / Not that I liked you

107
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:36,779
Jin-ah / Like I was just saying it to avoid guilt

108
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:40,259
Jin-ah / So I wanted to express that I really do like you

109
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,862
Jin-ah / Maybe I was wrong to think that

110
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,064
Jin-ah / Because getting your note made me so happy

111
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:48,623
Jin-ah / On our second day’s date

112
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:54,974
Jin-ah / Even though we came here to get to know others

113
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:59,502
Jin-ah / I just wanted to feel even one more drop

114
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,638
Jin-ah / Of something between us

115
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,684
Jin-ah / That was my feeling

116
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:05,985
Jin-ah / But since I didn’t say it clearly

117
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:12,859
Jin-ah / It was open to interpretation

118
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,485
Jin-ah / And today too I got called out first

119
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:19,922
Jin-ah / I was worried it would cause a misunderstanding

120
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,890
Jin-ah / Like “Jin-ah matched with someone else”

121
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,937
Jin-ah / I didn’t want it to look like that

122
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,331
Jin-ah / And I thought you didn’t pick me

123
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,245
Jin-ah / Like it wasn’t me choosing someone else

124
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,669
Jin-ah / But you choosing someone else

125
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,250
Jin-ah / That’s why we didn’t match right?

126
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:43,689
Jin-ah / Because I picked you. That’s what I wanted to say

127
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:51,187
Jin-ah / But I didn’t want to go on a date with someone else

128
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:56,292
Jin-ah / Just because things were awkward with you

129
00:08:56,302 --> 00:09:00,540
Jin-ah / But now it’s like...

130
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:04,366
Jin-ah / I don’t even know what I did that upset you

131
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:05,401
Jin-ah / I don’t know

132
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:15,555
Jin-ah / It’s just I’m really scared of being avoided like that

133
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,916
Jin-ah / When I was younger and working in broadcasting

134
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:24,564
Jin-ah / I got bullied pretty badly for a bit

135
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,733
Jin-ah / I really like you as a woman

136
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:33,796
Jin-ah / But once you started  avoiding me during the kart ride

137
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,576
Jin-ah / I thought clinging to you would just make it worse

138
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:40,970
Jin-ah / So I stayed away and ended up totally alone

139
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,217
Jin-ah / No one was around me anymore

140
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,153
Jin-ah / So I just...

141
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:57,019
Jin-ah / I really didn’t mean for anything to turn out that way

142
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:03,269
Jin-ah / It’s just my traum a made things really hard for me

143
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:09,332
Jin-ah / I was scared I’d start resenting you

144
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:15,681
Jin-ah / For reasons that aren’t even our real issue

145
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:24,714
Jin-ah / It’s not your fault and I just

146
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:32,254
Jin-ah / Even if we don’t end up together I still want us to be okay

147
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,723
Jin-ah / I really don’t care

148
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,692
Jin-ah / It’s fine even if you don’t like me

149
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,605
Jin-ah / That’s not what this is about

150
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,741
Hee-young / I get it I get it calm down

151
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,342
Hee-young / Let me know when you’re ready to hear me out

152
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,968
Hee-young / Let me know when you’re ready to hear me out
Jin-ah / I’ m okay

153
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:50,172
Hee-young / Then for me…

154
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:56,044
Hee-young / When I first came in and talked to everyone

155
00:10:56,054 --> 00:10:59,314
Hee-young / The reason I asked you on the first date

156
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:01,827
Hee-young / Was because I was drawn to you

157
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,721
Hee-young / But honestly for me to feel drawn to someone

158
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,299
Hee-young / Or curious about someone

159
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,435
Hee-young / That rarely happens

160
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,459
Hee-young / That’s something I was really worried about

161
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,795
Hee-young / Even before I came here

162
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:16,398
Hee-young / But when I saw you I was really happy

163
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:20,269
Hee-young / And when you told me you had written the note later

164
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,348
Hee-young / I was happy to hear that too

165
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:29,422
Hee-young / So I was really glad to know that

166
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,858
Hee-young / And even though I’ve only known you for a short time

167
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:33,716
Hee-young / Spending this time together and talking

168
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,996
Hee-young / Made me realize I might’ve rushed things

169
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,256
Hee-young / My head was a mess and I was getting ahead of myself

170
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,601
Hee-young / I think I rushed my feelings a bit

171
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:47,697
Hee-young / And you seemed uncomfortable with silence

172
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,009
Hee-young / So I kept talking

173
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,913
Hee-young / And I started going into deep topics nonstop

174
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,003
Hee-young / Just kept talking

175
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:57,049
Hee-young / From your values and beliefs and all that

176
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,274
Hee-young / From your values and beliefs
Jin-ah / During t he first date?

177
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,042
Hee-young / Even before the date started

178
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,378
Hee-young / But it was okay until then

179
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,523
Hee-young / You were clear and good at explaining yourself

180
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,048
Hee-young / I thought you just really wanted to share things

181
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,316
Hee-young / You wanted to express who you are

182
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,584
Hee-young / That was my first impression

183
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:11,764
Hee-young / And I thought your values

184
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,389
Hee-young / Really matched well with mine

185
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,824
Hee-young / So it made me want to know you more

186
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,368
Hee-young / That’s how I felt

187
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,570
Hee-young / Then on the date

188
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,962
Hee-young / We were supposed to get to know each other

189
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,408
Hee-young / But I felt like it was going a bit fast

190
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,165
Hee-young / It felt a bit fast
Jin-ah / Yeah I get that

191
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,543
Hee-young / But I told you that didn’t I?

192
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,514
Hee-young / That I prefer to take things slow

193
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,106
Hee-young / Even during the second vote on the first day

194
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:32,807
Hee-young / I kept writing to you

195
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:35,778
Hee-young / And I never had a second choice

196
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:40,015
Hee-young / I wasn’t interested in anyone else

197
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,461
Hee-young / I didn’t even look at anyone else seriously

198
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,330
Hee-young / I was just smiling and chatting

199
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:48,100
Hee-young / But deep down I was really…

200
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,736
Jin-ah / Let me cover this up

201
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,776
Hee-young / I think your values

202
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,110
Hee-young / And the things I really admire

203
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,678
Hee-young / You have so many of those

204
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,203
Hee-young / You really do

205
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,105
Hee-young / And I know how rare and hard that is

206
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,274
Hee-young / I think it's amazing

207
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,043
Hee-young / You’re kind of the ideal I hope to be

208
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:10,956
Hee-young / But because I value sincerity so much

209
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,015
Hee-young / I kept thinking about how that would come across

210
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,351
Hee-young / And how aware the other person really is of their own feelings

211
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,419
Hee-young / Even if it takes a long time

212
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,422
Hee-young / I’m really willing to wait

213
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,734
Hee-young / However long it takes

214
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,860
Hee-young / I’m not in a hurry

215
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,640
Hee-young / But maybe that led to some misunderstandings

216
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:31,233
Hee-young / I still thought I was showing you with my actions

217
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,935
Hee-young / Even if I couldn’t give you clear words

218
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,770
Hee-young / But from the start

219
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,272
Hee-young / You talked a lot about sincerity

220
00:13:37,282 --> 00:13:39,885
Hee-young / And then later you’d suddenly tell me you liked me

221
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,577
Hee-young / So I believed all of it

222
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:44,046
Hee-young / But then your actions felt inconsistent to me

223
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,747
Hee-young / Like you said "If someone lacks sincerity"

224
00:13:45,757 --> 00:13:47,259
Hee-young / "They’re just not attractive"

225
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,286
Hee-young / That kind of talk was honestly a bit much for me

226
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,498
Hee-young / But when we were alone together

227
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,556
Hee-young / You’d suddenly say how much you liked me

228
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:58,093
Hee-young / So I just believed you completely

229
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,805
Hee-young / But to me, your actions didn’t match your words

230
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,141
Hee-young / To me, they felt different
Jin-ah / Like with the note and stuff?

231
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,209
Hee-young / That too

232
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,033
Hee-young / I mean, it’s just a note, but still

233
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:07,202
Hee-young / You’d respond like "Oh okay" or "That’s how it is"

234
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:09,905
Hee-young / "Sure I get it" and just move on

235
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:10,806
Hee-young / And even today

236
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:13,409
Hee-young / When you were going out for the date

237
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,711
Hee-young / From my side it was like "You’re the one going"

238
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,023
Hee-young / And I was confused

239
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,358
Jin-ah / That’s why I wanted to explain it to you

240
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,015
Hee-young / But that felt like...

241
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,695
Jin-ah / Did it not come across that way?

242
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,187
Hee-young / "I'm only going out with someone else because of you"

243
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,455
Hee-young / That’s how it sounded

244
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,990
Hee-young / From my side it was really confusing

245
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,959
Hee-young / You said it sarcastically

246
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:34,429
Hee-young / Then you were like "I picked you, silly" and walked out

247
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,075
Hee-young / So what was I supposed to say to that?

248
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,476
Hee-young / I’m the one who picked you

249
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,478
Hee-young / So then I started thinking "Was she lying?"

250
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,838
Hee-young / "Did she really say she picked me?" It got to that point

251
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:43,883
Hee-young / Because right now

252
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,584
Hee-young / You're not someone I can trust

253
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,678
Hee-young / I’m just being honest, I can’t help it

254
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,181
Hee-young / And today, we won the game

255
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,717
Hee-young / So I thought I had to pick someone right away

256
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,153
Hee-young / I thought we had to choose and go right then

257
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,788
Hee-young / But when I got excited about winning

258
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,023
Hee-young / That thought suddenly hit me

259
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,625
Hee-young / "Wait what do I do?"

260
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:05,594
Hee-young / "Who do I pick?"

261
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,765
Hee-young / Honestly the whole thing is just really hard for me

262
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:10,976
Hee-young / Do you understand now?

263
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,672
Hee-young / So if there was still

264
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,807
Hee-young / Even a small misunderstanding

265
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,243
Hee-young / I wanted to leave room for possibility

266
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,512
Hee-young / But earlier when you were honest with me

267
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,881
Hee-young / And shared your side

268
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:26,859
Hee-young / It just felt like

269
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:30,686
Hee-young / You were confirming everything I had felt so far

270
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,333
Hee-young / So I think...

271
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,406
Hee-young / It’s better if we just stay friends like sisters

272
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:48,304
Jin-ah / I don’t know if this is right

273
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,339
Jin-ah / Let me say something again

274
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,942
Jin-ah / Let me say something again
Hee-young / Say what?

275
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,111
Jin-ah / I don’t think I want to be here anymore... sorry

276
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,980
Jin-ah / I don’t think I want to be here anymore... sorry
Hee-young / You mean you want to leave?

277
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,349
Jin-ah / I think so

278
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:03,452
Jin-ah / I’ve been so emotionally messy all day

279
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,931
Jin-ah / That’s just how things were for me

280
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,533
Jin-ah / I’m really fine with you

281
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,825
Jin-ah / Even if you don’t have feelings for me, that’s totally fine

282
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,293
Jin-ah / That’s why I came here

283
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,571
Hee-young / No

284
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,539
Jin-ah / No it is, that’s why I came

285
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:14,229
Jin-ah / No it is, that’s why I came
Hee-young / No it’s not

286
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,297
Hee-young / Then what did I just say to you today?

287
00:16:16,307 --> 00:16:18,600
Jin-ah / No it’s okay, I’m fine being friends

288
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,938
Jin-ah / But as a human being, as a person on this show, I can’t stay

289
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,506
Hee-young / So you’ve made up your mind?

290
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,909
Jin-ah / Yeah I need to talk about how to handle things after

291
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,455
Jin-ah / I think I should talk to them

292
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,713
Hee-young / So you’ve decided

293
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,257
Hee-young / And now you’re thinking about the aftermath?

294
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,426
Hee-young / And now you’re thinking about the aftermath?
Jin-ah / Yeah I think I should talk to them

295
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:58,907
Seo-yeon / Hey~

296
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,110
Mi-rang / I’m going out for a smoke

297
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,490
Seo-yeon / That’s not a good sign...

298
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:17,770
Jin-ah / She said "Of course we can get along like sisters"

299
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:18,627
Jin-ah / But still

300
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:25,778
Jin-ah / I just had a feeling that wouldn’t be possible

301
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:29,271
Jin-ah / "How am I supposed to live in this house now?"

302
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,950
Jin-ah / I kept worrying about that

303
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,362
Hee-young / Ugh...

304
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,309
Hee-young / Hmm...

305
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,980
Hee-young / Would it be okay if I went for a walk real quick?

306
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,350
Hee-young / When my mind gets noisy

307
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,730
Hee-young / I like to do walking meditation to calm myself

308
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,333
Hee-young / And there just happened to be a beautiful trail

309
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:58,627
Hee-young / That opened up in front of me while I was walking without thinking

310
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,229
Hee-young / So I walked slowly

311
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:03,208
Hee-young / And tried to calm my heart

312
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,775
Min-woo / Still, it’s lonely being alone

313
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,787
Da-gyo / Hahaha

314
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,347
Da-gyo / I’m curious who you wrote your note to

315
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,559
Da-gyo / Who do you have feelings for?

316
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:26,932
Min-woo / I’ve been interested in Han-kyul all along

317
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,459
Min-woo / But I feel like that might change

318
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,693
Da-gyo / Really?

319
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,205
Da-gyo / To who?

320
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,302
Da-gyo / Is it just curiosity? About her?

321
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,215
Da-gyo / Or is there another reason?

322
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,907
Min-woo / Something happened that made me feel that way

323
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,219
Da-gyo / Really?

324
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:53,692
Da-gyo / I’m curious now

325
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,129
Da-gyo / Is it Seo-yeon by any chance?

326
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,490
Da-gyo / No?

327
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,769
Da-gyo / It’s okay if not

328
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,537
Da-gyo / No?

329
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,307
Da-gyo / I just thought maybe, since you’re roommates haha

330
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,902
Da-gyo / No?

331
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,338
Da-gyo / Is it?

332
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:17,216
Da-gyo / Who is it then

333
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:20,252
Min-woo / My face is about to explode you okay?

334
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,022
Da-gyo / My face gets red easily

335
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,548
Min-woo / Oh right what was your MBTI again?

336
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,859
Min-woo / Oh right what was your MBTI again?
Da-gyo / I’m ESTJ

337
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,619
Min-woo / Oh right ESTJ

338
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,821
Min-woo / That explains your bold personality

339
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:36,225
Da-gyo / So I...

340
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,337
Da-gyo / I feel kind of stuck being here

341
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,263
Min-woo / You need to make a move for things to progress

342
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,731
Min-woo / For something to develop

343
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,299
Min-woo / For it to be meaningful

344
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,611
Da-gyo / That’s why we came here

345
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:46,134
Min-woo / Yeah but

346
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,081
Min-woo / I really hate feeling like I’m wasting time too

347
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,317
Da-gyo / You have to take action

348
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,509
Da-gyo / If you have feelings, show them clearly

349
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,688
Da-gyo / You have to be bold and move

350
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,214
Da-gyo / That’s why I think

351
00:20:59,224 --> 00:21:01,660
Da-gyo / Mi-rang is really cool in that way

352
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,161
Da-gyo / That’s what I think

353
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,965
Mi-rang / Were you two here together?
Da-gyo / Yeah

354
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,435
Min-woo / Wait, hasn’t it only been two days?

355
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,470
Mi-rang / For you, yeah

356
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,306
Da-gyo / It’s been three days for us

357
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,338
Min-woo / Honestly, if I’m being real

358
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,741
Min-woo / I really like Hee-young right now

359
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,653
Da-gyo / Hee-young?

360
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,410
Da-gyo / The Hee-young here?

361
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,222
Da-gyo / You mean the one that owns that outfit?

362
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,593
Da-gyo / I see

363
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,018
Da-gyo / Did you like her from the beginning, or

364
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:38,096
Da-gyo / Did your mind change after the date today?

365
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,531
Min-woo / I didn’t have those thoughts before

366
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,266
Da-gyo / But after the date today?

367
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,935
Da-gyo / The date today changed that for you?

368
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,537
Da-gyo / So you saw Hee-young in a new light?

369
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,863
Da-gyo / That’s how you explained it to me

370
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:51,066
Da-gyo / What kind of person is she in a one-on-one setting?

371
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,277
Da-gyo / What’s different?

372
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,304
Da-gyo / Mi-rang was there too at that moment

373
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,815
Da-gyo / And I was losing it

374
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,450
Da-gyo / I was kind of curious too

375
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,776
Da-gyo / But she was sitting right next to me

376
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:04,489
Da-gyo / So I didn’t know how to act

377
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,986
Min-woo / We were on the same kart team

378
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,531
Min-woo / Then we went to make pottery together

379
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,423
Min-woo / And went for a drive with everyone

380
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,291
Min-woo / And talked

381
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:20,172
Min-woo / Seeing all that just made me

382
00:22:20,205 --> 00:22:21,630
Da-gyo / Really?
Min-woo / Yeah

383
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,066
Min-woo / The moment we got free time, I came here because I was curious about her

384
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,777
Min-woo / Right away

385
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,670
Da-gyo / So that’s why you came to our room earlier

386
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,016
Da-gyo / Even when we were stepping out together

387
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:34,953
Min-woo / Yeah, otherwise I wouldn’t have had a reason to come

388
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:36,611
Min-woo / Even during dinner earlier

389
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,347
Min-woo / I made sure to sit next to her

390
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,426
Min-woo / All the way to the end

391
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:58,477
Hee-young / She said she's leaving

392
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,380
Seo-yeon / No way, seriously?

393
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,971
Hee-young / So I’ve been desperately trying to stop her

394
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:07,018
Hee-young / With everything I’ve got

395
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,989
Seo-yeon / But even you trying to stop her, Hee-young...

396
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,815
Hee-young / I really hope she doesn’t leave

397
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:17,018
Hee-young / I sincerely tried my best to clear things up

398
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:19,231
Hee-young / And I was honest with her

399
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:25,971
Hee-young / So I went to write the note but the questions were just...

400
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:27,406
Seo-yeon / Yeah, true

401
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:33,078
Hee-young / She said she couldn’t do it and wanted some fresh air

402
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:42,377
Hee-young / But now I feel like I can't do anything

403
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:47,182
Seo-yeon / But it's not your fault, Hee-young

404
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,752
Seo-yeon / This isn't your responsibility

405
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,621
Hee-young / She said she knows that

406
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:53,855
Seo-yeon / Then why?

407
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,791
Hee-young / We really had a clear conversation

408
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,803
Hee-young / And understood each other

409
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,062
Hee-young / I told her to sleep on it

410
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,975
Hee-young / What I want is to live well here because of her

411
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,533
Hee-young / I can’t stop her, but

412
00:24:05,543 --> 00:24:07,402
Hee-young / I told her to  think it through after a night's sleep

413
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:10,905
Hee-young / That might help us both sort things out

414
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:16,844
Hee-young / But today she felt rejected by me

415
00:24:16,854 --> 00:24:20,415
Hee-young / I don't think it’s my fault but

416
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,049
Hee-young / For her to handle it

417
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:25,153
Hee-young / She said the whole situation felt too violent

418
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:25,821
Hee-young / Because of me

419
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:30,268
Hee-young / She couldn’t even talk to others

420
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,737
Hee-young / She felt completely isolated

421
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:37,332
Hee-young / She must be thinking about it in a really extreme way

422
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:39,344
Hee-young / It’s heartbreaking

423
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,278
Hee-young / This isn’t it

424
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,714
Hee-young / This isn’t it
Seo-yeon / No it’s not

425
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,649
Hee-young / I shared how I felt

426
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:48,243
Hee-young / And explained my perspective from the beginning

427
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,988
Hee-young / But now I don’t know what to do

428
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,178
Hee-young / I really don’t

429
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:53,482
Seo-yeon / But there’s nothing for you to do

430
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,583
Seo-yeon / This isn’t your fault

431
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,863
Hee-young / I just got caught up in it

432
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,633
Hee-young / I feel completely trapped

433
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:07,806
Hee-young / Like I’ve been locked between two blades

434
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,580
Hee-young / Alright

435
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:18,106
Hee-young / Thank you for being someone I could talk to

436
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,585
Hee-young / I really had no one to talk to

437
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:35,460
Da-gyo /Can you help me tie this ribbon here?

438
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:36,328
Hee-young / How do you want it tied?

439
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,029
Da-gyo / Just here on the shoulder strap

440
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,833
Hee-young / Ah~ you're wearing something cute

441
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,169
Da-gyo / I can’t tie it by myself

442
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,050
Ri-won / Got a message

443
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,927
Hee-young / Heart note!

444
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,196
Hee-young / Oh my gosh!

445
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,356
Ri-won / I just want Han-kyul to be happy

446
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,282
Ri-won / Ever since the first day we got here

447
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:43,985
Ri-won / The one I kept spending the night with was Han-kyul

448
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:47,489
Ri-won / And if I can keep sleeping next to someone

449
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,324
Ri-won / I hope it’s Han-kyul

450
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,027
Ri-won / And we just have matching sleep patterns

451
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:55,407
Ri-won / We're the ones who sleep the earliest and wake up the latest

452
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,768
Han-kyul / I knew Ri-won kept

453
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:03,038
Han-kyul / Giving her vote to me consistently

454
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:06,184
Han-kyul / It was harder not to notice

455
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,011
Ri-won / Hey, did you get a rival note?

456
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,046
Han-kyul / No

457
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,280
Ri-won / You didn’t get a rival note?

458
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,324
Han-kyul / I didn’t

459
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,861
Ri-won / I'm really curious about that rival note

460
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,304
Ri-won / What is this?

461
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:33,935
Ri-won / Since there are two, I hoped one of them was from Han-kyul

462
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:35,970
Ri-won / That’s just what I thought

463
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,781
Damn it

464
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:42,377
Min-woo / At dinner time

465
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,345
Min-woo / I was trying to get Hee-young to sit next to me

466
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:45,156
Min-woo / But Ri-won kept

467
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,582
Ri-won / Hee-young, come here! Over here!

468
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,985
Min-woo / If it were me and I wasn’t interested in Hee-young

469
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,054
Min-woo / And someone asked her to sit down

470
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:56,291
Min-woo / I don’t think I would’ve insisted she come over

471
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,793
Min-woo / Even if I liked someone else

472
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,629
Min-woo / The way Ri-won acted in the middle

473
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:04,165
Min-woo / Whether intentional or not

474
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:07,335
Min-woo / It felt like she was getting in the way

475
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:10,371
Min-woo / Rather than trying to compete

476
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,884
Min-woo / I had this bigger urge to

477
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,353
Min-woo / Just make Hee-young mine

478
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,423
Ri-won / Ugh~ what is this

479
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,617
Ri-won / Ha~

480
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,729
Ri-won / This is so annoying!

481
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:29,100
Jin-ah / To. Ri-won But don’t worry too much

482
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:34,229
Jin-ah / I wrote it with my left hand because I was a little scared of you

483
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:37,132
Jin-ah / I could really see the human side of Han-kyul

484
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:39,334
Jin-ah / And I started to feel curious about her

485
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,936
Jin-ah / It’s just this feeling of curiosity

486
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,305
Jin-ah / So I tried my best

487
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,474
Jin-ah / Not to give off that “I’m your rival” vibe

488
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,586
Jin-ah / When I wrote the rival note

489
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,323
Ri-won / What is this?

490
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,663
Ri-won / She wrote this with her left hand

491
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,822
Han-kyul / Two letters? There were two, but from one person?

492
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,457
Han-kyul / Two letters, but one person wrote them?

493
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,603
Ri-won / No, different people...

494
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,430
Ri-won / I don’t know, I really don’t know

495
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,166
Ri-won / What is this?

496
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,310
Ri-won / I seriously have no idea

497
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,080
Ri-won / What is it?

498
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,307
Ri-won / Feels like both letters came from rivals

499
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:22,443
Ri-won / What? Did someone who likes Han-kyul send them?

500
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,144
Ri-won / Or maybe

501
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,014
Ri-won / She was just excited from winning the kart race? I thought that too

502
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,759
Ri-won / I really don’t know

503
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,660
Seo-yeon / I knew this would happen

504
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,672
Seo-yeon / Uh~ this is tough

505
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,136
Seo-yeon / But somehow I expected it

506
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:51,506
Seo-yeon / No one has shown interest in me

507
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,720
Seo-yeon / And no one seems to be trying to block anyone either

508
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:06,865
Mi-rang / There's one note, and I think it’s a rivalry one

509
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,666
Seo-yeon / To. Mi-rang

510
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,335
Seo-yeon / Alright

511
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,539
Seo-yeon / That was also around the time I was about to give up on Da-gyo

512
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,619
Seo-yeon / And I’ve always spent the nights in the house

513
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,010
Seo-yeon / With Mi-rang

514
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,892
Seo-yeon / So I wanted to stay as roommates going forward too

515
00:31:34,025 --> 00:31:38,419
Seo-yeon / As a your roommate, that's why I wrote Mi-rang's name

516
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:40,632
Seo-yeon / I picked Mi-rang

517
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,735
Min-woo / Don’t you miss me?

518
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:05,013
Seo-yeon / To. Min-woo, sleep well

519
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:08,583
Seo-yeon / Because you seemed so close with Mi-rang

520
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,486
Seo-yeon / I was jealous of you once

521
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,999
Seo-yeon / I don’t dislike you, Min-woo

522
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:18,159
Seo-yeon / So while it’s a bit of a block, it’s not really in a bad way

523
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:21,328
Seo-yeon / I wanted to say it with a bit of affection too

524
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:25,076
Seo-yeon / That’s why I wrote ‘sleep well’

525
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:27,402
Min-woo / That ‘sleep well’

526
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,137
Min-woo / Maybe they knew I usually have trouble sleeping

527
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,005
Min-woo / That’s what I thought

528
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,406
Min-woo / That message felt really meaningful

529
00:32:32,416 --> 00:32:34,776
Min-woo / It seemed to carry a lot

530
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,055
Min-woo / I felt like it was definitely a positive note

531
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:40,692
Min-woo / It felt like a good sign

532
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:44,628
Han-kyul / To. Min-woo, thank you for saying i'm pretty

533
00:32:44,628 --> 00:32:47,732
It was something i really wanted to hear

534
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:51,325
Han-kyul / It’s not that I want to spend the night with you

535
00:32:51,335 --> 00:32:54,429
Han-kyul / But you chose me for the first 1:1 date

536
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:58,109
Han-kyul / And complimented me a lot on my looks

537
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,766
Han-kyul / Honestly, in my life

538
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:02,370
Han-kyul / I’ve rarely been told I stand out for my looks

539
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,649
Han-kyul / So I just wanted to say thanks

540
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:05,984
Han-kyul / I think that’s what this note was

541
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,419
Han-kyul / A simple thank-you to Min-woo

542
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:12,480
Han-kyul / Just a message of gratitude

543
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,615
Min-woo / I knew this one was from Han-kyul

544
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,584
Min-woo / I said those words to her

545
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:17,919
Min-woo / In front of everyone

546
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:22,256
Min-woo / So I was touched that she acknowledged that

547
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:23,925
Min-woo / I was grateful

548
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,404
Min-woo / Reading the note honestly made me smile

549
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:32,043
Min-woo / It made me feel like this pace is okay

550
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,340
Ri-won / To. Min-woo: No way... right?

551
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,343
Ri-won / The only person I could think of was Min-woo, because

552
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,747
Ri-won / The one who went on a date with Han-kyul was Min-woo

553
00:33:45,757 --> 00:33:49,017
Ri-won / So right away I thought, “Why would she choose Han-kyul

554
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,886
Ri-won / To go on a date with, of all people?”

555
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:55,056
Ri-won / “Could it be that Min-woo is interested in Han-kyul?”

556
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:56,100
Ri-won / I started to worry

557
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:01,396
Min-woo / I was completely sure that last note was a warning note

558
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,731
Min-woo / And I really wanted to respond to her

559
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,077
Min-woo / I really wanted to respond to her

560
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,874
Da-gyo / I was kind of hoping for a rival note

561
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:15,943
Da-gyo / Since I have interest in  Mi-rang

562
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:17,811
Da-gyo / And she’s been really direct with me

563
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:20,058
Da-gyo / I thought someone might not like that

564
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,226
Da-gyo / So I was curious who else might like her

565
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,728
Da-gyo / I really wanted to know

566
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,299
Da-gyo / Ah~ it’s cold

567
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,330
Mi-rang / To. Da-gyo

568
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,567
Mi-rang / I want to have more one-on-one conversations with you

569
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,779
Mi-rang / And I miss you too

570
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,517
Da-gyo / Huh? Why?

571
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,610
Da-gyo / Why didn’t anyone... why, why, why? I was curious

572
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,912
Da-gyo / Am I too direct or something?

573
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,948
Da-gyo / Do other people just not find that appealing?

574
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:55,249
Da-gyo / I mean it feels good but also

575
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,763
Da-gyo / A little disappointing, I wanted to get one too

576
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:03,067
Da-gyo / But in the end, it's good, I guess, if no one likes her

577
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,502
Hee-young / What do I do?

578
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,581
Hee-young / It’s nice here

579
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:42,974
Da-gyo / To. Hee-young, i wish you wouldn't say no one like you

580
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:45,743
Da-gyo / I’ve always been curious about you

581
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,179
Da-gyo / I wanted to write this to let you know

582
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,747
Da-gyo / Since I didn’t show it much

583
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,471
Da-gyo / I wanted you to notice me

584
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:52,874
Da-gyo / Because if not today

585
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:55,409
Da-gyo / I might not get another chance

586
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,288
Da-gyo / Who knows what’ll happen

587
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,046
Da-gyo / So I just went with my gut

588
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,526
Da-gyo / I’d already told Mi-rang yesterday

589
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,287
Da-gyo / ‘Let’s do that’

590
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:08,032
Da-gyo / So I wrote it to Hee-young

591
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,270
Hee-young / I didn’t even need to check the handwriting

592
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,928
Hee-young / I just read it and went ‘It’s Da-gyo!’

593
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:17,241
Hee-young / I think I just knew it instinctively

594
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,744
Hee-young / I didn’t know about the others, but that one I was sure of

595
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,313
Hee-young / It was the first one I opened too

596
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,917
Hee-young / It made me really happy, and I was so grateful

597
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,049
Jin-ah / To. Hee-young

598
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:39,253
Jin-ah / What did I do to upset you so much? I’m sorry Jin-ah / I kept staying by myself

599
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:40,965
Jin-ah / It hurt so much emotionally

600
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,601
Jin-ah / I made it very obvious I’m Kim Jin-ah

601
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:47,638
Jin-ah / I kept approaching you with soft words

602
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,297
Jin-ah / I just wanted us to talk as people

603
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:56,147
Jin-ah / So I could face the rest of the days here more comfortably

604
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,038
Min-woo / To. Hee-young

605
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:00,908
Min-woo / I'm curious about the bubble bath you brought

606
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:03,411
Min-woo / When I moved in, you said

607
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:07,114
Min-woo / “There’s a bathtub here, so I brought a bubble bomb”

608
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,426
Min-woo / That stuck in my head

609
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,928
Min-woo / And I found myself wanting to try it with you

610
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,097
Min-woo / But I wanted you to know it was from me

611
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,690
Min-woo / So when I made kimchi fried rice

612
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,059
Min-woo / I mentioned how I used big pieces of spam

613
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,539
Min-woo / So I added that detail to the note too

614
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,911
Hee-young / Don’t come near me!

615
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,704
Hee-young / Go away!

616
00:37:30,714 --> 00:37:34,785
Mi-rang / I’ll just turn on the heater and leave

617
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,113
Mi-rang / To. Hee-young

618
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,916
Mi-rang / Please have a sweet romantic talk

619
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,352
Mi-rang / With someone other than the person you chose

620
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:49,333
Mi-rang / Because Da-gyo said she had feelings for someone else

621
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,369
Mi-rang / And that someone was you

622
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,011
Hee-young / What’s she even talking about

623
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:04,071
Hee-young / I have no idea

624
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:08,919
Hee-young / She sounded weird, honestly just came off strange

625
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:21,999
Han-kyul / To. Hee-young

626
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:27,862
Han-kyul / I don’t know if I ever said this, but I’ve always admired you

627
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:31,098
Han-kyul / It wasn’t so much rivalry but more like “I envy you”

628
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:34,402
Han-kyul / That’s the feeling I wrote with

629
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:39,073
Han-kyul / I want to have the charm that you have

630
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:43,788
Han-kyul / I meant it in the sense of admiration and respect

631
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,556
Han-kyul / That kind of rival

632
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:49,383
Hee-young / What even is this?

633
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:53,364
Hee-young / What is she saying?

634
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:00,261
Da-gyo / To. Jin-ah

635
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:02,239
Da-gyo / Jin-ah makes me nervous

636
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,275
Da-gyo / But she’s also a lovable rival

637
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,133
Da-gyo / We’ve shared deep talks

638
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:09,180
Da-gyo / So I kind of know how she feels about Mi-rang

639
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,815
Da-gyo / But since she's such a lovable person

640
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,407
Da-gyo / I think I just wrote “lovable rival” with that in mind

641
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,119
Da-gyo / That’s the feeling I had

642
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,355
Da-gyo / So that’s what I wrote in the note

643
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,387
Min-woo / Who's trying to block me?

644
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:27,621
Min-woo / At least make it obvious

645
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:29,790
Min-woo / I think someone’s trying to block me

646
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,125
Mi-rang / What does it say?

647
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,227
Min-woo / What does it say?

648
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,696
Min-woo / Something like “No way, right?”

649
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,632
Min-woo / “No way... right?” like that

650
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,578
Min-woo / What’s not supposed to be?

651
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,580
Da-gyo / I can’t stay there

652
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:48,619
Min-woo / Isn’t this definitely a block?

653
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,896
Min-woo / So what if I'm right? hahaha

654
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:07,895
Mi-rang / I’m just holding this pot and—

655
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,473
Da-gyo / I’ll check it for you

656
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,146
Hee-young / Why why why?

657
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,222
Ri-won / This is serious

658
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:27,281
Ri-won / I'm gonna go crazy

659
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,682
Ri-won / They’re switching roommates today

660
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,284
Han-kyul / No! That means the rooms will change too

661
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:31,328
Han-kyul / The rooms won’t stay the same?

662
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:36,200
Ri-won / Don’t you think the rooms will change too?
Han-kyul / No, I really love this room

663
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,626
Ri-won / My heart dropped

664
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,138
Ri-won / Because I wanted to keep sharing a room with Han-kyul

665
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:45,566
Ri-won / Honestly, if I’m with Han-kyul

666
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:48,602
Ri-won / Whether it’s Building 1, 1st or 2nd floor

667
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,806
Ri-won / Or Building 2, 1st or 2nd floor, or even the living room

668
00:40:51,816 --> 00:40:54,275
Ri-won / I honestly don’t care

669
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,921
Ri-won / I just really wanted to stay roommates with Han-kyul

670
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,346
Han-kyul / I really don’t want to change this room

671
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:02,049
Ri-won / What about me?
Han-kyul / Huh?

672
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:04,385
Ri-won / Am I not enough?
Han-kyul / No, that’s not it

673
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:08,222
Han-kyul / I wish we could stay here together forever
Ri-won / I feel the same way

674
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,724
Han-kyul / All the way until the end of this

675
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,159
Ri-won / I’m still the one you feel most comfortable with, right?

676
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,863
Han-kyul / Yeah, I told you—you feel like home to me

677
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,499
Han-kyul / I don’t want to be apart from this

678
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,434
Ri-won / I want to stay by your side
Han-kyul / This place is my safe zone

679
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:22,803
Ri-won / I want to take care of you, I keep worrying

680
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,638
Han-kyul / But isn’t that hard for you?

681
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,874
Ri-won / What’s hard? It’s not hard at all

682
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,076
Han-kyul / I didn’t want to end up in this parenting role

683
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,512
Han-kyul / Like I’m raising someone or something

684
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,881
Ri-won / But like I said, you can’t help it

685
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:36,851
Ri-won / So even when I talk to the others

686
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,252
Ri-won / I couldn’t be sure of anything

687
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:40,030
Ri-won / Because I didn’t know your age

688
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,166
Ri-won / I still don’t know how old you are, but

689
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,526
Ri-won / I know you’re younger than me

690
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:48,329
Ri-won / I’ve lived longer

691
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,464
Ri-won / Been through more rough times

692
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:52,943
Ri-won / So I just want to help where I can

693
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,836
Ri-won / But if the roles were reversed

694
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,005
Ri-won / If I were younger and Han-kyul were older

695
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,350
Ri-won / Wouldn’t she have done the same for me?

696
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,443
Ri-won / So don’t feel sorry about it

697
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:04,678
Ri-won / Or think it’s some kind of burden

698
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,924
Ri-won / I really hope you don’t think that way

699
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,617
Han-kyul / Thank you

700
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,019
Ri-won / If someone else were crying or having a hard time

701
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,231
Ri-won / I think Han-kyul would’ve done the same for her too

702
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:18,269
Ri-won / So I hope you don’t overthink that kind of stuff

703
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:21,805
Ri-won / Right?

704
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:23,397
Ri-won / We can’t help it

705
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,033
Ri-won / It’s not like you can change your age just because you want to

706
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,947
Han-kyul / No, I actually love being the younger one

707
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,239
Han-kyul / I do like being young, but when I got here

708
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:33,207
Han-kyul / Why does it feel like

709
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,252
Han-kyul / I have to be self-conscious about it?

710
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,677
Ri-won / Don’t be self-conscious

711
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,390
Han-kyul / I’m not even that young, honestly

712
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,720
Da-gyo / Today is roommate switch day

713
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:50,524
Da-gyo / Seo-yeon, who picked the four-leaf clover, gets the roommate & date privilege

714
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,526
Da-gyo / When did this happen...

715
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,562
Da-gyo / Didn’t you pretend you didn’t pick it?

716
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,996
Mi-rang / Wait a sec

717
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,608
Da-gyo / You’re so sneaky

718
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,333
Mi-rang / Hurry over here

719
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,735
Mi-rang / I need to go suck up a little

720
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,947
Da-gyo / Hey~

721
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,217
Mi-rang / Here, take this enzyme

722
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,611
Mi-rang / For your health, have some enzyme

723
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,246
Da-gyo / What’s with that posture haha

724
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,515
Da-gyo / When did you pick the four-leaf clover?

725
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,016
Seo-yeon / You should’ve caught the news sooner

726
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,963
Da-gyo / I had no idea

727
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:49,827
Da-gyo / Huh?

728
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:52,763
Han-kyul / Huh?

729
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,725
Da-gyo / How many leaves are on that?

730
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,503
Mi-rang / Three

731
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:00,970
Ri-won / I have three too

732
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,973
Ri-won / I guess I need to get four now

733
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,041
Da-gyo / Mine's three too

734
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:07,001
Seo-yeon / (Min-woo) That's three, right?

735
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:07,611
Mi-rang / She’s the Queen

736
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,613
Seo-yeon / Yay queen!

737
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,710
Da-gyo / Why didn’t you say anything?

738
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,945
Da-gyo / Seriously

739
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:21,281
Da-gyo / I was shocked someone actually picked it

740
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,560
Seo-yeon / Of course someone did

741
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:27,755
Mi-rang / Hey! Stop acting fake! Get out

742
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,123
Mi-rang / Hey! Stop acting fake! Get out
Hee-young / There’s a date privilege too

743
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,602
Seo-yeon / Of course there is

744
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,795
Da-gyo / In 20 minutes?

745
00:44:34,805 --> 00:44:36,030
Seo-yeon / A four-leaf clover

746
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,732
Seo-yeon / Isn’t something you find that easily

747
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,644
Hee-young / What’s with your tone

748
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,236
Da-gyo / So funny

749
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:43,270
Da-gyo / So funny
Hee-young / Roommate decision rights?

750
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,074
Hee-young / So she can change all the housemates?

751
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:49,510
Hee-young / Rooms and houses

752
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,745
Seo-yeon / Houses too... really?

753
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,814
Hee-young / Then she can even change that

754
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:54,882
Da-gyo / A total overhaul

755
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,950
Hee-young / 18 minutes left
Mi-rang / So once 20 minutes pass

756
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,485
Mi-rang / It’s revoked revoked revoked

757
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,753
Mi-rang / Revoked revoked revoked
Seo-yeon / Oh no I can’t waste time

758
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:00,387
Hee-young / Is it revoked?

759
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,156
Hee-young / Is it revoked?
Mi-rang / Don’t let her leave

760
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,257
Seo-yeon / No no!

761
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:04,702
Seo-yeon / No no!
Hee-young / Lock her up!

762
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,097
Hee-young / That’s fine

763
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,965
Hee-young / As long as it’s not that room, I’m good

764
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:13,867
Hee-young / As long as we don’t share a room, I’m good

765
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:14,968
Hee-young / That’s what I thought

766
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:18,405
Hee-young / And I was curious how things would unfold

767
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:22,619
Hee-young / depending on how the roommate arrangement went

768
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:29,650
Seo-yeon / I’m the center

769
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,362
Seo-yeon / Today’s queen~

770
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,035
Min-woo / It'll be cold if you sit over there

771
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,138
Min-woo / In the middle

772
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,940
Seo-yeon / This is overwhelming

773
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,141
Min-woo / Should I sit here?

774
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,511
Seo-yeon / I’m not good with sudden attention like this

775
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:58,946
Min-woo / Gotta make your rounds

776
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:03,617
Min-woo / So the benefit from the lottery yesterday—

777
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:05,753
Min-woo / The winner gets a privilege today

778
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,831
Min-woo / So we better be in her good graces

779
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,132
Ri-won / I forced out my nonexistent cuteness

780
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,276
Ri-won / I forced out my nonexistent cuteness
Seo-yeon / That was rare footage

781
00:46:19,543 --> 00:46:22,636
Han-kyul / I really don’t want to move my stuff

782
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:27,107
Han-kyul / I didn’t even unpack because I didn’t want to zip my suitcase again

783
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,277
Han-kyul / I just take things out when I need them

784
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,813
Han-kyul / But the thought of having to repack everything to switch rooms...

785
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:36,784
Han-kyul / Just thinking about packing up all my stuff again

786
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,418
Han-kyul / totally overwhelmed me

787
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,654
Han-kyul / I was already mentally exhausted

788
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,557
Han-kyul / and now imagining the chaos of packing just stressed me out more

789
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:46,460
Han-kyul / So I went to Seo-yeon and begged her

790
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,807
Han-kyul / Please let us keep our current room

791
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:55,202
Seo-yeon / First, should we divide into House 1 and House 2?

792
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:58,172
Seo-yeon / I’ll pick first

793
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:00,107
Ri-won / I’m loving this, it’s so fun

794
00:47:00,117 --> 00:47:02,776
Seo-yeon / I really hate having to move, so

795
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,611
Ri-won / So you’ll go with the first floor

796
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:05,479
Seo-yeon / That’s right

797
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,780
Seo-yeon / I’ll stay exactly where I am

798
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:07,881
Seo-yeon / I’ll stay exactly where I am
Ri-won / Building 2, first floor

799
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,827
Seo-yeon / Building 2, first floor

800
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,130
Ri-won / You just said you hate moving

801
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,667
Ri-won / Seo-yeon over here

802
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,626
Mi-rang / Since when did she ever put her hands together so politely?

803
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:22,206
Seo-yeon / Does anyone want to room with me?

804
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,167
Seo-yeon / No one?

805
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,735
Min-woo / Maybe it's because it's public

806
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:29,646
Min-woo / They might not be able to say it

807
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:35,676
Min-woo / I was glad that Seo-yeon had the roommate change card

808
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,978
Min-woo / But I didn’t know how she felt

809
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:41,215
Min-woo / So I didn’t want to tell her

810
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,316
Min-woo / who I wanted to room with

811
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:46,230
Min-woo / I wasn’t confident either way

812
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,323
Seo-yeon / Then for now

813
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,568
Seo-yeon / I’ll go with a fellow ‘93

814
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:55,806
Hee-young / Is it me?

815
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,508
Ri-won / I like this pairing, it's fun

816
00:47:58,775 --> 00:48:00,734
Hee-young / I was chosen by the queen

817
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:01,778
Hee-young / Queen’s choice

818
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,447
Ri-won / Bear the weight of the crown

819
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,213
Min-woo / I wondered if Seo-yeon was interested in Hee-young

820
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,250
Min-woo / So my mind got more tangled

821
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,253
Hee-young / I was confused why Seo-yeon picked me

822
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,955
Hee-young / She once told me

823
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:24,224
Hee-young / that she picked me in the first impression vote

824
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,593
Hee-young / On the first day, when I went on my first date

825
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,462
Hee-young / she said it was hard for her

826
00:48:28,472 --> 00:48:31,632
Hee-young / I wondered if she wanted to try something with me

827
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:35,569
Hee-young / But we also had good conversations as friends

828
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,071
Hee-young / So maybe that’s why she picked me

829
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,150
Hee-young / Anyway, I liked being on the first floor

830
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:42,776
Min-woo / I like being close to the bathroom too

831
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:43,510
Ri-won / First floor?

832
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,821
Min-woo / First floor

833
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:46,613
Da-gyo / I hate climbing stairs too

834
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,182
Seo-yeon / You two hate stairs?

835
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,952
Min-woo / I don’t like the attic
Da-gyo / But I don’t mind

836
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,186
Min-woo / I prefer the first floor

837
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:54,421
Seo-yeon / You prefer the first floor?

838
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,534
Da-gyo / I’ll go with whatever you want

839
00:49:04,975 --> 00:49:06,877
Mi-rang / I'm nervous

840
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:09,703
Da-gyo / I'm so nervous

841
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,538
Da-gyo / The suspense is killing me

842
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:14,284
Seo-yeon / You said you didn’t mind, right?

843
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:18,188
Da-gyo / I... I don’t... mind

844
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,057
Hee-young / Everyone’s malfunctioning

845
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,583
Seo-yeon / But I love this taste of power

846
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:25,485
Ri-won / I'm going crazy from jealousy

847
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:27,421
Hee-young / If you want something, speak up

848
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,766
Seo-yeon / People are trembling from just my hand gesture

849
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,026
Ri-won / I want the second floor, Queen

850
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:34,795
Ri-won / I really love the second floor

851
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,198
Han-kyul / Me too, moving the suitcase is just...

852
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:39,676
Seo-yeon / Second floor!

853
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,782
Hee-young / But that's Building 1

854
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,953
Mi-rang / I like being close to the gym

855
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,355
Mi-rang / So I prefer Building 1

856
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,090
Seo-yeon / You prefer Building 1?

857
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,826
Hee-young / Do you want first floor or second floor?

858
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,504
Seo-yeon / Okay

859
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,200
Da-gyo / I wanted to be in Building 1

860
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,768
Da-gyo / I already shared a room with Hee-young

861
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,813
Da-gyo / I honestly wanted to try rooming with Mi-rang

862
00:50:21,885 --> 00:50:22,676
Mi-rang / Wait a second

863
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,878
Ri-won / Mi-rang, your eyes...

864
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:27,314
Mi-rang / You’re doing a great job

865
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:29,249
Mi-rang / As expected… you're a true PD

866
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:30,327
Ri-won / So desperate

867
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,763
Mi-rang / I can’t even read the letters here

868
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,960
Mi-rang / I was very satisfied

869
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,195
Mi-rang / What I wanted the most was

870
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,731
Mi-rang / to have one-on-one time because we hadn’t talked much

871
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:48,135
Mi-rang / My biggest goal was to have a private talk

872
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,669
Da-gyo / I wasn’t sure how Seo-yeon felt

873
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,071
Da-gyo / She wanted to go on a date with me

874
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,472
Da-gyo / Then wouldn’t splitting us up be right?

875
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:55,409
Da-gyo / Why did she put us in the same room?

876
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:57,210
Da-gyo / I was curious about that

877
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,445
Da-gyo / But still

878
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,148
Da-gyo / I got to be with the person I wanted

879
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,417
Da-gyo / So I was satisfied

880
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:09,689
Seo-yeon / Honestly, by that time, I was starting to give up on Da-gyo

881
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,159
Seo-yeon / The sketchbook was a big turning point for me

882
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:18,532
Seo-yeon / I wanted a big event or

883
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:22,035
Seo-yeon / something decisive enough to let go of it all

884
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:26,239
Seo-yeon / And at that moment, the lucky four-leaf clover popped up

885
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,675
Seo-yeon / So I asked Mi-rang

886
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:31,311
Seo-yeon / If you could change roommates

887
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:36,116
Seo-yeon / Would you want to room with Da-gyo?

888
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:39,019
Seo-yeon / And when she said yes

889
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,655
Seo-yeon / I put them together

890
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:44,267
Seo-yeon / Does anyone else want to be on the first floor?

891
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,027
Seo-yeon / Anyone for the first floor?

892
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,895
Ri-won / I want the second floor

893
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:50,931
Seo-yeon / Okay, second floor

894
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:51,675
Ri-won / Kim Ri-won

895
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,010
Han-kyul / Me too

896
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:56,546
Ri-won / Han-kyul

897
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,272
Hee-young / She’s appealing

898
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:02,375
Han-kyul / Jeong Han-kyul

899
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:06,389
Min-woo / But it’s all up to Seo-yeon anyway

900
00:52:25,408 --> 00:52:27,667
Ri-won / Seo-yeon, I’m really thankful

901
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:30,013
Ri-won / I want to buy you something delicious

902
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,706
Ri-won / I’m seriously so grateful, it made me so happy

903
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:35,242
Ri-won / And I was even happier because Han-kyul liked it too

904
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:39,980
Ri-won / Still, by day four I must’ve given Han-kyul

905
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,415
Ri-won / A good impression

906
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,384
Ri-won / Even if I wasn’t someone she gave a note to

907
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:47,721
Ri-won / We could still keep being roommates

908
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:51,258
Ri-won / And the fact that Han-kyul, instead of someone else

909
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,193
Ri-won / Said “I want to keep being roommates with Ri-won”

910
00:52:53,203 --> 00:52:55,762
Ri-won / I was just so happy to hear that

911
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,931
Ri-won / Today I was just really, really happy

912
00:52:57,941 --> 00:53:00,367
Min-woo / Only Jin-ah is left now

913
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,412
Min-woo / So just put her down

914
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,410
Min-woo / I ended up with Jin-ah

915
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,546
Min-woo / But I was crying with Hee-young

916
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:15,749
Min-woo / I realized it’s actually more comfortable

917
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:16,893
Min-woo / to keep my competitor nearby

918
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:24,267
Min-woo / It’s easier to plan strategy when I can see everything

919
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,703
Seo-yeon / That’s how it will be done

920
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:29,763
Seo-yeon / Are you satisfied?

921
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:32,809
Ri-won / Yes, I love it, Queen Seo-yeon

922
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,534
Ri-won / Princess Seo-yeon

923
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,402
Min-woo / I’m good with it

924
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:36,980
Ri-won / Not queen—just the king!

925
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,239
Seo-yeon / Queen!

926
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:42,108
Seo-yeon / We resolved it as democratically as possible

927
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:44,477
Seo-yeon / I tried to gather everyone’s opinions

928
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:48,114
Seo-yeon / and become a wise and benevolent ruler

929
00:53:48,124 --> 00:53:50,827
Min-woo / Ah, but moving the luggage will be a bit tough

930
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:54,331
Da-gyo / I’m just glad it’s in Building 1

931
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,617
Jin-ah / Seo-yeon got to decide the roommates

932
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:24,918
Jin-ah / and I wasn’t there for it

933
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:26,920
Jin-ah / so I was curious

934
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,257
Jin-ah / And honestly, I was scared I might end up with Hee-young again

935
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:34,537
Jin-ah / I had a lot of emotions, even fear

936
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,768
Ri-won / I'm just so happy

937
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,536
Han-kyul / Nothing’s changing

938
00:54:43,546 --> 00:54:45,348
Ri-won / Aren’t I just so happy right now?

939
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,619
Han-kyul / I was so scared the room would change

940
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,211
Han-kyul / I couldn’t even unpack my suitcase

941
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,790
Ri-won / You can unpack comfortably now

942
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,883
Ri-won / Go ahead and fully relax
Han-kyul / I'm happy

943
00:54:56,893 --> 00:54:58,551
Ri-won / Me too
Han-kyul / This is the happiest I’ve been here so far

944
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:01,021
Ri-won / Me too

945
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,956
Ri-won / I’m so satisfied

946
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,492
Han-kyul / How long do you think everyone will take to unpack?

947
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:09,839
Ri-won / At least 30 minutes to an hour?
Han-kyul / Time for bed then

948
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:13,109
Mi-rang / Was Seo-yeon into Hee-young or something?

949
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,335
Min-woo / She might not know how I feel, right?

950
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:16,503
Mi-rang / Who?

951
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,481
Min-woo / Jin-ah

952
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:22,609
Min-woo / I was dying of curiosity

953
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,145
Min-woo / so I kept barging into Building 1

954
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,781
Min-woo / But now that we’re in the same building, I like it better

955
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:31,184
Mi-rang / Building 1? Ah, right, we…

956
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,396
Min-woo / I won’t have to barge in anymore

957
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:39,993
Min-woo / I was really relieved to be rooming with Jin-ah

958
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,127
Min-woo / It made me even more curious

959
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:44,564
Min-woo / Why couldn’t she come to the meeting?

960
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:46,333
Min-woo / What kind of situation was it?

961
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,768
Min-woo / Because it had to do with someone I liked

962
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:50,570
Min-woo / I wanted to understand

963
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,882
Min-woo / I was genuinely curious

964
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,012
Da-gyo / I seriously thought I was gonna die

965
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,047
Min-woo / Good thing it’s the first floor

966
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:01,848
Da-gyo / Imagine if it were the second floor

967
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,094
Min-woo / Yeah, imagine the second floor, seriously

968
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:11,658
Min-woo / Jin-ah, we’re roommates

969
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:12,525
Min-woo / Same room

970
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,894
Jin-ah / When Min-woo came in saying “I’m your new roommate”

971
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:18,164
Jin-ah / I was so happy

972
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,532
Jin-ah / The Min-woo I know

973
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,369
Jin-ah / had a very sharp first impression

974
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:26,973
Jin-ah / But inside that sharpness, there seemed to be flexibility

975
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:30,510
Jin-ah / A strong but neutral vibe

976
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:35,115
Jin-ah / So I was really happy it was Min-woo

977
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:38,551
Do I take the bed inside?

978
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,553
I’ll take the inner bed

979
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,656
Da-gyo / This is the first time someone’s made me do something this rough

980
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,668
Mi-rang / I feel like I’m in some drama

981
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:51,531
Da-gyo / I usually even sit down to work… guess not this time

982
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,334
Da-gyo / I guess I can do my makeup here now

983
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:55,668
Da-gyo / Come to think of it

984
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,537
Da-gyo / I wanted to try the second floor

985
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,616
Mi-rang / Me too, actually
Da-gyo / I’ve never used it before

986
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:06,756
Da-gyo / Am I panting too much?

987
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,994
Da-gyo / The cushion feel is definitely different

988
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:16,032
Mi-rang / Right?

989
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:25,031
Mi-rang / You look so cool while shooting

990
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:28,701
Da-gyo / I bought this recently just to take pictures of myself

991
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,371
Mi-rang / Let’s shoot in the evening, I’ll take them for you

992
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,573
Da-gyo / Yeah, take them when I have my makeup on

993
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,018
Mi-rang / I will

994
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,389
Min-woo / I’m so happy it’s just a two-person room

995
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:22,722
Min-woo / Da-gyo and Mi-rang moved upstairs

996
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:24,924
Min-woo / So it’s going to get noisy here too

997
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:27,704
Min-woo / Now it’s split four to four

998
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:33,166
Min-woo / I really wanted a two-person room, seriously

999
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,667
Jin-ah / It’s my first time in a two-person room too

1000
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,904
Min-woo / Honestly… if not a solo room

1001
00:58:37,914 --> 00:58:40,917
Min-woo / I wanted a two-person one

1002
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:49,215
Min-woo / Jin-ah looked like she was about to cry

1003
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,684
Min-woo / I didn’t want to ignore her and leave her alone

1004
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:55,088
Min-woo / I was curious and wanted to draw her out

1005
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,257
Min-woo / Personally

1006
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:59,092
Min-woo / when I saw her sitting there all pouty

1007
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:00,026
Min-woo / I actually smiled

1008
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:00,894
Min-woo / earlier

1009
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:03,730
Min-woo / She looked cute, and honestly, people who see that

1010
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,164
Min-woo / find it charming

1011
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:06,900
Jin-ah / No, I wasn’t pouting

1012
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,869
Jin-ah / I just didn’t want to get in the way of what others were doing

1013
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,872
Min-woo / No, I described it wrong by saying pouty

1014
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:16,409
Min-woo / Your lips were just like this

1015
00:59:16,419 --> 00:59:18,811
Min-woo / I tapped you like this and this

1016
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:20,213
Min-woo / It looked cute

1017
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,825
Jin-ah / I was holding back tears so I wouldn’t cry

1018
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,465
Jin-ah / One of my missions here

1019
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:35,004
Jin-ah / is that I’ve never had anyone with long hair approach me

1020
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:38,831
Jin-ah / I used to be a sports announcer

1021
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,900
Jin-ah / So everyone I met was athletic

1022
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,803
Jin-ah / I wanted to try dating someone with a new look

1023
00:59:43,813 --> 00:59:44,771
Jin-ah / That person was Hee-young

1024
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,773
Jin-ah / But honestly, yesterday

1025
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,675
Jin-ah / It wasn’t about romantic feelings

1026
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,810
Jin-ah / It’s just that you didn’t say a word to me

1027
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:55,715
Jin-ah / The only time anyone spoke to me

1028
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:56,649
Jin-ah / was when Min-woo came in

1029
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,161
Jin-ah / and I finally said something

1030
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,220
Jin-ah / But then she left

1031
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,922
Jin-ah / and when I asked, “Did you lose something?”

1032
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:06,502
Jin-ah / It was like…

1033
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:09,128
Min-woo / Really?

1034
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:10,964
Jin-ah / Yeah, I was just so caught off guard

1035
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,032
Jin-ah / Not in a bad way, though

1036
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,834
Jin-ah / But from then on

1037
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,569
Jin-ah / ever since the cart mission

1038
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:19,405
Jin-ah / I kept forcing myself to look upbeat

1039
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:23,620
Jin-ah / I got so stressed I had a panic attack

1040
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:26,045
Min-woo / Trying to find someone

1041
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,925
Min-woo / who would talk with me was so stressful

1042
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:33,252
Min-woo / So even if it wasn’t intentional avoidance

1043
01:00:33,262 --> 01:00:35,632
Min-woo / it still really hurt

1044
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:40,727
Min-woo / Objectively, from a third-person perspective

1045
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:44,497
Min-woo / when someone puts their whole heart into relationships and love

1046
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:46,242
Min-woo / they get anxious, tear up

1047
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,067
Min-woo / and get worked up over this?

1048
01:00:48,077 --> 01:00:49,402
Min-woo / Even the smallest things?

1049
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:52,205
Min-woo / Honestly, people have priorities

1050
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,073
Min-woo / But when you focus too much on those

1051
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,409
Min-woo / you tend to ignore everything else

1052
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:58,911
Min-woo / As you get older, that just happens?

1053
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:01,014
Min-woo / And especially in situations like this

1054
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,416
Min-woo / a lot of people just go straight for their goal

1055
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:06,763
Min-woo / But Jin-ah, you care about everything

1056
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,254
Min-woo / So you worry more

1057
01:01:08,264 --> 01:01:09,288
Min-woo / But I think

1058
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:11,591
Min-woo / that kind of personality

1059
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,426
Min-woo / doesn’t look bad at all

1060
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,204
Min-woo / Even if people misunderstand it

1061
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,466
Min-woo / Even those misunderstandings can seem cute

1062
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:22,268
Min-woo / You give off that kind of vibe

1063
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:25,905
Min-woo / If it were me crying, I’d look pathetic

1064
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:29,308
Min-woo / But if Jin-ah cries

1065
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:32,979
Min-woo / people just go “Oh, Jin-ah’s crying”

1066
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,714
Min-woo / That’s just how you are

1067
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:36,683
Min-woo / So just be yourself

1068
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,551
Min-woo / Cry, worry

1069
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:39,652
Min-woo / If you want to date, go for it

1070
01:01:39,662 --> 01:01:40,797
Min-woo / If not, then don’t

1071
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,656
Min-woo / If you want to get to know someone, be brave

1072
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,224
Min-woo / When else will you get the chance to be brave?

1073
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,060
Min-woo / That’s what we’re here for

1074
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:49,005
Jin-ah / Hearing that made me feel so understood

1075
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:53,366
Jin-ah / It was such a comforting moment

1076
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:58,604
Min-woo / I learned new sides of both Hee-young and Jin-ah

1077
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:00,106
Min-woo / You just wanted

1078
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:02,475
Min-woo / to be seen in a good light by the person you like

1079
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,153
Min-woo / That’s what it felt like

1080
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:47,463
Mi-rang / You didn’t write me a note, did you?

1081
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:52,391
Da-gyo / It’s a secret…

1082
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:54,794
Da-gyo / Did you get a note today?

1083
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,529
Da-gyo / Did you get a lot yesterday?

1084
01:02:56,539 --> 01:03:00,877
Mi-rang / That’s a secret

1085
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:04,403
Mi-rang / You kept it a secret too…

1086
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:09,342
Mi-rang / Honestly, I really don’t know

1087
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:13,780
Mi-rang / But I just keep saying I don’t know

1088
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:17,416
Da-gyo / Were you the most confused after getting that note yesterday?

1089
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:19,185
Da-gyo / You can’t figure that person out?

1090
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,220
Mi-rang / I kept thinking only about you

1091
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:26,592
Mi-rang / I didn’t think about any other feelings

1092
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:28,694
Da-gyo / So after getting the note yesterday

1093
01:03:28,704 --> 01:03:30,897
Da-gyo / and thinking about it now

1094
01:03:30,907 --> 01:03:32,098
Da-gyo / that’s how it ended up?

1095
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:35,434
Mi-rang / Yeah, but I still don’t know exactly

1096
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:39,315
Mi-rang / Because it could just be a misunderstanding

1097
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:44,343
Mi-rang / It might be a mistake

1098
01:03:44,353 --> 01:03:47,947
Mi-rang / I felt really good, then suddenly really down

1099
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:49,225
Mi-rang / I just wanted to talk about it

1100
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:57,056
Mi-rang / How do you show interest

1101
01:03:57,066 --> 01:04:00,493
Mi-rang / when you like someone?

1102
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:03,162
Da-gyo / Me? Once I choose, I express it well and go all in

1103
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:06,342
Mi-rang / Without being confusing?

1104
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:10,069
Da-gyo / But right now…

1105
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:10,870
Da-gyo / suddenly switching rooms

1106
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,349
Da-gyo / and then saying you weren’t feeling good…

1107
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:19,011
Da-gyo / I don’t know… I just feel bad

1108
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,357
Mi-rang / Why are you crying?

1109
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,384
Mi-rang / Did someone say they felt bad?

1110
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:28,020
Da-gyo / You did

1111
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:31,624
Mi-rang / I said that? When?

1112
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:34,804
Mi-rang / No way, when did I say that? No~

1113
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:43,069
Da-gyo / You really did…

1114
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,705
Mi-rang / Where? Where?... When?

1115
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,707
Da-gyo / You said after switching rooms, you were happy

1116
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:48,975
Da-gyo / but then you weren’t

1117
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:52,388
Mi-rang / I think that’s a misunderstanding

1118
01:04:57,293 --> 01:05:00,620
Da-gyo / You clearly looked happy after switching rooms

1119
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,855
Da-gyo / Then suddenly weren’t

1120
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,657
Da-gyo / You said something like that

1121
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,092
Da-gyo / So my heart got all tangled

1122
01:05:06,102 --> 01:05:08,194
Da-gyo / I started worrying if your feelings faded

1123
01:05:08,204 --> 01:05:10,897
Da-gyo / Because things can change overnight

1124
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,775
Da-gyo / I started worrying

1125
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,700
Mi-rang / It hurt so much

1126
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:18,204
Mi-rang / Seeing you cry hurt me too

1127
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,816
Mi-rang / I’ve been thinking a lot as well

1128
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:24,520
Mi-rang / I think Da-gyo’s tears came from a complicated place too

1129
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:28,557
Mi-rang / I said that?

1130
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:32,385
Da-gyo / So I was really worried

1131
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,086
Mi-rang / After we wrote our room requests

1132
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,621
Mi-rang / I said that right after?

1133
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:37,823
Da-gyo / No, just a little earlier

1134
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:40,226
Mi-rang / Ah… a little earlier?

1135
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:43,963
Mi-rang / I didn’t mean I felt bad about switching rooms

1136
01:05:43,973 --> 01:05:46,242
Mi-rang / I just thought I’d get a letter from you

1137
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:51,203
Mi-rang / But when I asked, and you said it was a secret

1138
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:53,539
Mi-rang / that’s what threw me off

1139
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:57,343
Mi-rang / I thought the note was from you

1140
01:05:57,353 --> 01:05:59,221
Mi-rang / and I felt so happy in the morning

1141
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:04,483
Mi-rang / But then I started thinking

1142
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,652
Mi-rang / 'What if it wasn’t from you?'

1143
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:09,165
Mi-rang / That thought crossed my mind

1144
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:13,025
Mi-rang / If you didn’t give me many notes

1145
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:14,837
Mi-rang / it means you gave them to someone else

1146
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,697
Mi-rang / So when I said my mood dropped

1147
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:20,266
Mi-rang / that’s what I meant

1148
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:22,268
Mi-rang / I'm really happy to be rooming with you

1149
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:23,469
Mi-rang / I feel like tonight

1150
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,672
Mi-rang / we’ll have a lot to talk about again…

1151
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:28,975
Mi-rang / So I’m happy

1152
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,009
Da-gyo / Got it

1153
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:31,377
Da-gyo / I was just sharing how I felt

1154
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:34,357
Da-gyo / I was just a little bothered, that’s all

1155
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,817
Da-gyo / I thought I’d be fine but…

1156
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:38,851
Da-gyo / When you look upset

1157
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:41,764
Da-gyo / of course I care

1158
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:49,061
Da-gyo / It made me sad…

1159
01:06:49,071 --> 01:06:52,965
Mi-rang / Anyway, I mean, we haven’t really

1160
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:55,444
Mi-rang / figured it all out yet

1161
01:06:57,546 --> 01:06:59,505
Mi-rang / But talking like this

1162
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:03,175
Mi-rang / helped me feel a little better

1163
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:07,413
Mi-rang / But if I can say one thing

1164
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:10,016
Mi-rang / If someone keeps making me question things

1165
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,294
Mi-rang / I usually stop trying

1166
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,988
Da-gyo / Okay, I get it

1167
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:18,924
Mi-rang / That can mean two things

1168
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:24,663
Mi-rang / One is that you want me to show my feelings more

1169
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:27,243
Mi-rang / The other is… secrets?

1170
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:28,167
Da-gyo / Secrets?

1171
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:29,769
Mi-rang / You like secrets too

1172
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:30,536
Da-gyo / I don’t like secrets…

1173
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,737
Da-gyo / I only said it was a secret once earlier

1174
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:33,582
Da-gyo / I don’t like keeping secrets

1175
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:35,541
Da-gyo / If I liked secrets

1176
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,787
Da-gyo / would I have spoken so honestly yesterday?

1177
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,780
Mi-rang / But I do want to clear up one misunderstanding

1178
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:42,448
Mi-rang / Actually, more than a misunderstanding

1179
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,594
Mi-rang / remember the talk we had yesterday?

1180
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,953
Mi-rang / I’m not lying, really

1181
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:51,457
Mi-rang / But the way you said it…

1182
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:52,858
Da-gyo / You think I was being vague?

1183
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:56,462
Da-gyo / You think I was being vague?
Mi-rang / Yeah, I think you were

1184
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,097
Mi-rang / You didn’t clearly express

1185
01:07:58,107 --> 01:07:59,698
Mi-rang / what your feelings were

1186
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,834
Mi-rang / You said A, then B

1187
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:02,234
Mi-rang / then C…

1188
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,703
Mi-rang / and then came back to A, it was like that

1189
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:06,505
Mi-rang / So I was like, “Are you sorry to me?”

1190
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,974
Mi-rang / “Do you like me?”

1191
01:08:08,984 --> 01:08:11,911
Mi-rang / “Are you asking me to understand you?” Honestly, I…

1192
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,923
Mi-rang / I just didn’t get it

1193
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:17,817
Mi-rang / And in that state, I couldn’t just say

1194
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:19,185
Mi-rang / “What were you trying to say yesterday?”

1195
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:20,653
Mi-rang / “Honestly, I didn’t get it”

1196
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:23,689
Mi-rang / I couldn’t just come out and say that

1197
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:25,624
Mi-rang / So I kept thinking

1198
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:27,827
Mi-rang / and overthinking by myself

1199
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:28,928
Da-gyo / To be clear

1200
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:32,031
Da-gyo / I told you I liked both Hee-young  and you

1201
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,309
Da-gyo / I had feelings for both

1202
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:35,968
Da-gyo / So I wrote the letter

1203
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:37,536
Da-gyo / and went on a date with her

1204
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:38,504
Da-gyo / And I wanted to ask

1205
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,072
Da-gyo / if you’d be okay with me

1206
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:41,373
Da-gyo / going on a date with Hee-young

1207
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,109
Da-gyo / Would that be okay?

1208
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,543
Mi-rang / “Since you dated me”

1209
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:46,178
Mi-rang / “You want to date her too?”

1210
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:47,379
Mi-rang / Or is it

1211
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:51,050
Mi-rang / “I like Hee-young more than you”?

1212
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,586
Da-gyo / I haven’t dated her yet, and this is all about

1213
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:55,554
Da-gyo / getting to know people

1214
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,389
Da-gyo / So if I get the chance

1215
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,635
Da-gyo / I wanted to ask if it’s okay to go for it

1216
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:02,471
Mi-rang / What if I said I don’t want you to?

1217
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:06,342
Da-gyo / If you said that?

1218
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:09,979
Da-gyo / Then I won’t

1219
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:18,220
Da-gyo / Should I not?

1220
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:22,258
Mi-rang / I hope you don’t

1221
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:25,995
Da-gyo / Okay

1222
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:30,055
Mi-rang / I thought I wasn’t the jealous type

1223
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:31,934
Mi-rang / But I think I am

1224
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:41,433
Mi-rang / I felt like she chose me over Hee-young

1225
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:43,913
Mi-rang / and I was so thankful for that
