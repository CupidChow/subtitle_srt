1
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,509
Seo-yeon / Ah...

2
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,055
Seo-yeon / Do you have a lot of stuff?

3
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,224
Hee-young / Got a lot to carry?
Seo-yeon / Yeah

4
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,750
Seo-yeon / It still doesn't feel real

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,420
Seo-yeon / Feels like we'll still be spending time together

6
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,422
Seo-yeon / Like we’ll still be cooking and eating together

7
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,524
Seo-yeon / Like I’ll still be sending notes at night

8
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,725
Seo-yeon / And living together like this

9
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,694
Seo-yeon / There might be moments that hurt

10
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,428
Seo-yeon / I don’t know

11
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,107
Seo-yeon / I still can’t believe how this feels

12
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,834
Hee-young / There may be some regrets

13
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:47,036
Hee-young / But I tried my best every moment without regrets

14
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,906
Hee-young / I gave it my all with sincerity and effort

15
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,275
Hee-young / What I learned here by pushing myself

16
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,144
Hee-young / That’s what stuck with me the most

17
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:58,013
Hee-young / So today when I make my final choice

18
00:00:58,023 --> 00:00:59,082
Hee-young / I decided to follow my heart

19
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,783
Hee-young / That’s how I got up this morning

20
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:03,453
Ri-won / Han-kyul, are you all ready?
Han-kyul / Yeah

21
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,422
Han-kyul /I organized all my thoughts the night before

22
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:08,958
Han-kyul / and woke up feeling at ease

23
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,060
Han-kyul / Because after coming here

24
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,796
Han-kyul / nothing went the way I expected

25
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:16,199
Han-kyul / and nothing turned out how I imagined

26
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,801
Han-kyul / But even so

27
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:20,903
Han-kyul / I learned so much

28
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:22,905
Han-kyul / and thought, 'That’s enough, that was good'

29
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:24,974
Han-kyul / So I just felt a bit

30
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,654
Han-kyul / relieved inside

31
00:01:28,086 --> 00:01:31,112
Min-woo / Ugh why is my makeup flaking?

32
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:33,081
Min-woo / I think my skin's too dry

33
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:35,283
Jin-ah / Min-woo! Use that one! That one

34
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:37,619
Jin-ah / I use it every morning
Min-woo / Which one?

35
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:38,787
Jin-ah / This pad

36
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:41,589
Jin-ah / I wipe my face, elbows, and neck with it every day

37
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,723
Jin-ah / I do it daily

38
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:43,391
Min-woo / Really?
Jin-ah / Yeah it's good

39
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:45,527
Jin-ah / Seriously, when I first got here

40
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:46,861
Jin-ah / Like second and third day

41
00:01:46,871 --> 00:01:49,097
Jin-ah / My skin was freaking out from dryness

42
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:52,033
Jin-ah / But after using this...

43
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:54,803
Jin-ah / It’s like a peeled egg, doesn’t my skin look good?

44
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,371
Min-woo / Yeah, no cracks

45
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:57,605
Min-woo / I don't get why mine’s so flaky

46
00:01:57,615 --> 00:01:59,607
Jin-ah / It soothes too

47
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:01,986
Jin-ah / Makes it moist and helps makeup stay on better

48
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:04,479
Jin-ah / Look at this!
Min-woo / Gotta be moist for that...

49
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:06,681
Jin-ah / It’s super rich and moisturizing
Min-woo / You’re right

50
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,817
Jin-ah / It’s packed full, try it out, stick it on

51
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:11,429
Min-woo / It really is

52
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:24,542
Min-woo / So moisturizing

53
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:35,643
Min-woo / You can stick it on and get ready with makeup

54
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:39,414
Jin-ah / Yeah I usually put it on and have breakfast

55
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:42,993
Min-woo / It’s got that collagen-y feel to it

56
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,368
Min-woo / Mmm~ I like it!

57
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:01,946
Mi-rang / You're such a fool

58
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,372
Da-gyo / What?
Mi-rang / I said you’re such a fool

59
00:03:04,382 --> 00:03:07,108
Da-gyo / You're even more of one!

60
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:09,110
Da-gyo / Seriously you are

61
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,547
Da-gyo / You didn’t understand what kind of tears I was crying

62
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:14,048
Da-gyo / What I really meant

63
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:17,195
Mi-rang / That’s cause you didn’t explain it clearly

64
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,964
Da-gyo / When did I not explain clearly?

65
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:23,324
Mi-rang / I don’t think you did

66
00:03:23,334 --> 00:03:26,694
Da-gyo / The letter I got yesterday, it wasn't just out of affection...

67
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:28,997
Da-gyo / It wasn’t written just because they liked me

68
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,965
Da-gyo / Some people wrote just to thank me

69
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:32,066
Da-gyo / It was mixed

70
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:35,436
Da-gyo / I wasn’t crying because of romantic feelings

71
00:03:35,446 --> 00:03:36,738
Mi-rang / Was that what it said?

72
00:03:36,748 --> 00:03:40,241
Da-gyo / It was the last day and they wrote to thank me

73
00:03:40,251 --> 00:03:42,110
Da-gyo / Those words were in there

74
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,613
Da-gyo / That’s what made me cry

75
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:49,484
Da-gyo / I even asked you out yesterday

76
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:52,487
Da-gyo / And I sent you a note too

77
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:53,554
Da-gyo / I thought I expressed

78
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:55,190
Da-gyo / Everything I could

79
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,892
Da-gyo / But maybe it wasn’t enough for you

80
00:03:57,902 --> 00:04:00,028
Da-gyo / And I understand what made you upset

81
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:02,597
Da-gyo / So I cried like that

82
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,766
Da-gyo / And that probably made you dislike it more

83
00:04:04,776 --> 00:04:08,169
Da-gyo / I understand that too

84
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:10,715
Da-gyo / I get it

85
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:14,676
Mi-rang / I didn’t like it
Da-gyo / Right

86
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:15,844
Da-gyo / I know

87
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:19,657
Da-gyo / That’s just how I am, I cry when I relate deeply

88
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:22,894
Da-gyo / That’s who I am, I can’t help it!

89
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:27,155
Mi-rang / Is that what it was?

90
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:29,657
Da-gyo / But honestly, even though I understand

91
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:32,861
Da-gyo / Why you got upset at what I said

92
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:38,843
Da-gyo / I still wish you could’ve tried to understand how hard it was for me

93
00:04:39,344 --> 00:04:41,069
Da-gyo / Just a little bit

94
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,837
Da-gyo / That’s how I felt too

95
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,906
Mi-rang / It’s because I always

96
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,274
Mi-rang / Even before

97
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:49,277
Mi-rang / I kept thinking about you more than myself

98
00:04:49,287 --> 00:04:50,445
Mi-rang / Even when I was struggling

99
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:51,789
Mi-rang / Yesterday especially

100
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:55,350
Mi-rang / I waited for so much, for such a long time...

101
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,352
Da-gyo / And I really tried to explain

102
00:04:57,362 --> 00:05:00,488
Da-gyo / That wasn’t what it meant when we met

103
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:03,258
Mi-rang / I get that but still

104
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:05,260
Mi-rang / From my side of things

105
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,106
Mi-rang / I was really hurting and struggling

106
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:11,633
Mi-rang / And then you kept crying in front of me again

107
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:13,735
Da-gyo / Yeah but I get your feelings too

108
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:18,139
Da-gyo / You probably didn’t want to deal with that, I get it

109
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:20,642
Da-gyo / Some people feel that way

110
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,410
Da-gyo / Some people don’t cry

111
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,522
Da-gyo / And some do

112
00:05:24,555 --> 00:05:25,980
Mi-rang / And I was next to you

113
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,484
Mi-rang / I felt like you didn’t really care about me

114
00:05:29,494 --> 00:05:33,888
Mi-rang / I was kind of... sulking yesterday
Da-gyo / I was sulking too

115
00:05:33,898 --> 00:05:37,625
Mi-rang / Why were you sulking?

116
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:39,594
Mi-rang / I had it harder

117
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:44,465
Da-gyo / No, seriously

118
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:47,068
Da-gyo / I told Hee-young I wouldn’t go on a date with her

119
00:05:47,078 --> 00:05:50,004
Da-gyo / From that day on

120
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:53,007
Da-gyo / My feelings stayed the same

121
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:54,709
Da-gyo / I kept telling you that

122
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:57,545
Da-gyo / So I didn’t hold back my feelings either

123
00:05:57,555 --> 00:06:00,915
Da-gyo / I really gave you my heart

124
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:03,718
Da-gyo / I kept giving it to you

125
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:06,421
Da-gyo / So of course I was hurt too

126
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:08,389
Da-gyo / I told you I didn’t cry for that reason

127
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,124
Da-gyo / I explained it to you

128
00:06:10,134 --> 00:06:13,328
Da-gyo / But you kept misunderstanding me

129
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:16,130
Da-gyo / So I went to you and tried to explain again

130
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,267
Da-gyo / But I get how you felt too

131
00:06:19,277 --> 00:06:21,803
Da-gyo / So there’s nothing I can really say

132
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:23,614
Da-gyo / I just ended up blaming myself

133
00:06:24,082 --> 00:06:26,617
Mi-rang / Don’t blame yourself

134
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,803
Mi-rang / It’s not that I didn’t like you

135
00:06:55,813 --> 00:06:57,739
Mi-rang / I gave it to you thinking, ‘Let me take care of her one last time’

136
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,340
Mi-rang / That’s how I felt when I gave it to you

137
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,753
Mi-rang / And also to make peace

138
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:27,879
Da-gyo / Did you give me this?
Mi-rang / Yeah

139
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,383
Da-gyo / Thank you~

140
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:30,098
Jin-ah / Just like it was our final activity, on the board

141
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,466
Jin-ah / I was the first one

142
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:33,601
Jin-ah / To write my thoughts on the 7 days

143
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:37,171
Jin-ah / As I wrote each word, the word was ‘excitement’

144
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:39,273
Jin-ah / Just because I’m leaving the house

145
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:41,275
Jin-ah / Doesn’t mean my love ends here

146
00:08:41,285 --> 00:08:44,612
Jin-ah / I realized I could feel excited for the love that lies ahead

147
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:47,415
Jin-ah / And that made my heart flutter

148
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:50,518
Jin-ah / So I wrote each word with a fluttering heart

149
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:53,064
Jin-ah / Thinking of those feelings

150
00:09:00,738 --> 00:09:02,773
Jin-ah / It was good

151
00:09:14,585 --> 00:09:17,211
Seo-yeon / I thought about how to summarize these 7 days

152
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,514
Seo-yeon / In a simple, concise way

153
00:09:19,524 --> 00:09:21,048
Seo-yeon / That’s what I had in mind

154
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:25,920
Seo-yeon / Because those 7 days were full of people, moments

155
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,989
Seo-yeon / And honesty

156
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:33,271
Seo-yeon / I think I captured that well in my sentence

157
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:40,234
Da-gyo / During those 7 days

158
00:09:40,244 --> 00:09:43,771
Da-gyo / There was love, friendship, fights

159
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:45,239
Da-gyo / Misunderstandings too

160
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:47,074
Da-gyo / I think we really went through everything women can go through together

161
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:48,976
Da-gyo / We poured it all in

162
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:50,945
Da-gyo / As all that flashed by

163
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:52,547
Da-gyo / It felt really meaningful

164
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:54,115
Da-gyo / I think I’ll remember it for a long time

165
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,761
Da-gyo / What if I hadn’t come on the show

166
00:09:57,295 --> 00:10:01,132
Mi-rang / I felt so many emotions coming here

167
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:05,927
Mi-rang / So many people were kind to me in such a short time

168
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:08,229
Mi-rang / So many took care of me

169
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:10,364
Mi-rang / That’s what I wrote on the board

170
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:12,600
Hee-young / Every single day

171
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,603
Hee-young / My thoughts and feelings changed so much

172
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:19,607
Hee-young / Emotionally, I wavered a lot

173
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:21,709
Hee-young / There were times I felt anxious and scared

174
00:10:21,719 --> 00:10:24,912
Hee-young / I really felt so many emotions every day

175
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:26,581
Hee-young / One thing I kept repeating to myself

176
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:30,685
Hee-young / Was to treasure my heart, I must cherish myself

177
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:32,320
Hee-young / That’s what I kept thinking

178
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,890
Hee-young / I feel so much love now, and I hope everyone

179
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,792
Hee-young / Can feel those emotions too

180
00:10:37,802 --> 00:10:40,027
Hee-young / And love like that

181
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:42,206
Hee-young / That’s the heart I had when I wrote on the board

182
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,923
Han-kyul / Honestly, I don’t think I shot any romance here

183
00:10:59,056 --> 00:11:01,082
Han-kyul / It always felt like...

184
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:04,518
Han-kyul / I wasn’t true to my feelings

185
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:06,887
Han-kyul / Rather than feeling excited with someone

186
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:09,300
Han-kyul / Or sharing emotions

187
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,326
Han-kyul / I think I focused more on

188
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,629
Han-kyul / My own personal changes

189
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,767
Han-kyul / That’s how I felt when I wrote my message

190
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:21,737
Ri-won / I'm just so grateful I got to be here

191
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:24,006
Ri-won / and I don’t regret a single thing

192
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,974
Ri-won / And to have made such good memories

193
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:30,112
Ri-won / with such wonderful people

194
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,390
Ri-won / made me really happy

195
00:12:10,528 --> 00:12:14,021
Hee-young / Seo-yeon, I never told you this...

196
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:17,592
Hee-young / Thank you for picking me as your first impression

197
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:20,771
Seo-yeon / You were super popular with the first impressions

198
00:12:20,772 --> 00:12:24,332
Hee-young / What do you mean, popular?

199
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:26,467
Hee-young / What’s the first thing you wanna do when you go home?

200
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:28,870
Seo-yeon / Eat black bean noodles

201
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,482
Seo-yeon / And fried chicken

202
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,851
Hee-young / Chicken~

203
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:36,177
Seo-yeon / I miss my dog

204
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:38,679
Hee-young / You have a dog?

205
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:43,351
Jin-ah / I’m jealous that you seem to have done everything without regret

206
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:47,231
Jin-ah / I was crying and sobbing like a mess

207
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,525
Jin-ah / When will I ever grow up

208
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:54,362
Min-woo / Starting today, you're an adult

209
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:56,765
Ri-won / Han-kyul, who did you write to yesterday? The note

210
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:01,569
Han-kyul / I wrote to Da-gyo
Ri-won / Da-gyo?

211
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:05,073
Ri-won / I just want Han-kyul

212
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,175
Ri-won / to do whatever she wants to do

213
00:13:07,185 --> 00:13:11,513
Ri-won / Honestly, same here

214
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:17,519
Ri-won / I think it was really great that you wrote to Da-gyo yesterday

215
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,154
Han-kyul / I don’t know, it just feels like

216
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:22,457
Han-kyul / I’ve only been acting on instinct or something

217
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:23,858
Han-kyul / like nothing else really

218
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:27,172
Ri-won / Just relax and be yourself

219
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:52,820
Jin-ah / The mission to write that last note really continued to the end

220
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,756
Jin-ah / I had a feeling it would lead to the final choice

221
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,492
Jin-ah / I thought I knew what I would feel when making my final decision

222
00:13:57,502 --> 00:14:01,295
Jin-ah / But the actual feelings were so different—it was surprising

223
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:04,132
Jin-ah / I was amazed by how surprising everything was, even on the last day

224
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:07,135
Jin-ah / This ToGetHer House really is...

225
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:10,037
Jin-ah / Just full of surprises till the very end

226
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:12,583
Jin-ah / This ToGetHer House...

227
00:14:18,122 --> 00:14:19,380
Han-kyul / I felt so relieved

228
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,285
Han-kyul / Honestly, until now, I was always wondering ‘Who should I write to?’

229
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:25,653
Han-kyul / That thought was always there

230
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:27,155
Han-kyul / But today, it was just

231
00:14:27,165 --> 00:14:31,292
Han-kyul / After clearing out all my emotions

232
00:14:31,302 --> 00:14:34,462
Han-kyul / I walked there thinking only of one person

233
00:14:34,472 --> 00:14:36,063
Han-kyul / ‘I’m going to write to her’

234
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:39,734
Han-kyul / I made up my mind completely, and walked to write the note

235
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:42,270
Han-kyul / And it felt so much more freeing than I thought

236
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,907
Da-gyo / I'm off!
Mi-rang / Bye

237
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:49,987
Da-gyo / Take care!
Mi-rang / Don’t go, don’t go

238
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:55,883
Da-gyo / Honestly, I thought there was so much time left

239
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:58,719
Da-gyo / But looking back, even a whole day

240
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:02,390
Da-gyo / Feels both long and short—so many emotions in such a short time

241
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,258
Da-gyo / I didn’t expect that, honestly

242
00:15:04,268 --> 00:15:07,962
Da-gyo / Since it’s the last note, I wanted to write it well

243
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:09,630
Da-gyo / I was thinking hard about what to say

244
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,509
Da-gyo / I already knew who I’d write it to

245
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:17,415
Hee-young / Bye
Seo-yeon / Bye

246
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,118
Seo-yeon / Once I joined, I didn’t want to have any regrets

247
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:32,753
Seo-yeon / I wanted to express myself

248
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:35,857
Seo-yeon / To be honest and true to my feelings

249
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:38,626
Seo-yeon / Regardless of the result

250
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:42,740
Seo-yeon / I already had a clear answer about who I’d write to

251
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:47,411
Hee-young / I’m heading out!

252
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:53,007
Hee-young / I like getting to know someone slowly

253
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:55,443
Hee-young / But I’m not someone who easily starts

254
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:59,213
Hee-young / Wanting to get to know someone

255
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:01,415
Hee-young / I was worried I’d leave

256
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:04,485
Hee-young / Without ever even starting something

257
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:05,920
Hee-young / I had a lot on my mind

258
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,156
Hee-young / But you kept showing your sincerity

259
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,191
Hee-young / And I was grateful

260
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:13,905
Hee-young / So I got ready to go write the note with that heart

261
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:23,504
Mi-rang / Honestly, I really didn’t want to go home

262
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:26,574
Mi-rang / All the time we spent together kept flashing through my mind

263
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:27,808
Mi-rang / And it made me emotional

264
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:29,243
Mi-rang / My heart felt heavy

265
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:31,279
Mi-rang / Just hearing the word ‘last’

266
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:33,414
Mi-rang / Honestly, I didn’t want to write that

267
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:36,884
Mi-rang / Because even after leaving here, it’s not really the end

268
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:39,186
Mi-rang / I just wanted to say everything I wanted

269
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:40,932
Mi-rang / That’s how I felt

270
00:16:43,301 --> 00:16:44,325
Min-woo / I struggled with it

271
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:47,328
Min-woo / Wondering what choice I wouldn’t regret

272
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:49,163
Min-woo / After we talked yesterday

273
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:52,166
Min-woo / I thought maybe I was over those feelings

274
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:54,001
Min-woo / But I kept wondering, ‘Is there something left?’

275
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:56,914
Min-woo / ‘Am I just reacting emotionally?’

276
00:16:57,548 --> 00:17:00,274
Min-woo / I kept checking in with myself

277
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:03,311
Min-woo / Telling myself, ‘Let this be the most honest moment’

278
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,022
Min-woo / I think I made that promise to myself

279
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:19,728
Ri-won / I felt relieved

280
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,396
Ri-won / and kind of calm too

281
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:25,367
Ri-won / Even as I went to write it, I pretty much knew how it would end

282
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,837
Ri-won / and I had already made up my mind by then

283
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:32,907
Ri-won / So I tried to condense all the emotions I felt during the week

284
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,409
Ri-won / and all the things I wanted to say

285
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:37,889
Ri-won / into that last note

286
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,834
Ri-won / Meeting face to face...

287
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:03,614
Seo-yeon / And then, from...

288
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,998
Ri-won / I think I just wrote it without overthinking

289
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,499
Ri-won / Like the words just came out of me

290
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:33,234
Ri-won / Whatever came to mind

291
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:35,837
Ri-won / I wasn’t planning to write much, but as I went on

292
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:39,451
Ri-won / it just ended up turning into a long letter

293
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:42,610
Da-gyo / What I really wanted to say most was “I like you”

294
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,313
Da-gyo / I really wanted to write that in my note

295
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:49,394
Da-gyo / As I was writing, my heart felt warm and fuzzy

296
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:52,587
Mi-rang / Whether I got picked or not, I just didn’t want to regret anything

297
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:55,533
Mi-rang / So I decided to follow my heart

298
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,568
Mi-rang / I don’t think I really hesitated much

299
00:18:58,169 --> 00:18:59,494
Han-kyul / If there had been

300
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:02,430
Han-kyul / Someone here I felt connected with

301
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,332
Han-kyul / Or someone I might’ve continued with

302
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:07,535
Han-kyul / I thought, “Maybe I could have felt something more”

303
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:12,049
Han-kyul / So I felt a little disappointed about that

304
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,545
Hee-young / In any case

305
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:21,149
Hee-young / I feel like I only really talked for one full day

306
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,251
Hee-young / So I kept thinking

307
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:24,752
Hee-young / How can I express myself

308
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:28,666
Hee-young / Without being too much, without making things hard

309
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:35,163
Min-woo / Honestly, I hesitated a bit

310
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,865
Min-woo / My hand didn’t move right away

311
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:41,002
Min-woo / But the way I wrote was just how I felt yesterday

312
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:43,247
Min-woo / It came out the same

313
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:51,712
Seo-yeon / I even had a speech planned

314
00:19:51,722 --> 00:19:53,514
Seo-yeon / But once I sat down to write the note

315
00:19:53,524 --> 00:19:55,049
Seo-yeon / The words wouldn’t come out easily

316
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,618
Seo-yeon / So I thought really hard about it

317
00:19:57,628 --> 00:20:00,788
Seo-yeon / How can I best express my feelings?

318
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:02,557
Seo-yeon / How can I end this well?

319
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:06,270
Seo-yeon / How can I not make them feel pressured?

320
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:10,398
Hee-young / When I sat down to write my last note

321
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:13,701
Jin-ah / My thoughts on love, which I’ve always had

322
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:17,371
Jin-ah / Were reflected in that moment, and I loved that

323
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:20,775
Jin-ah / To the members who shared these 7 days of life with me

324
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:23,077
Jin-ah / I felt like I could end it

325
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:25,890
Jin-ah / With a healthy final message

326
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:44,268
Han-kyul / Actually, the day before, I had that kind of talk with Ri-won

327
00:21:44,702 --> 00:21:48,128
Ri-won / I just want to be someone you need

328
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:50,708
Ri-won / I'm happy just being next to you

329
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:52,199
Ri-won / Back then, you told me

330
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:54,501
Ri-won / “It feels like I’ve gained a big sister,” something like that

331
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:58,072
Ri-won / That doesn’t bother me at all
Han-kyul / Ah, I’ve always wanted a sister

332
00:21:58,082 --> 00:22:01,308
Ri-won / I can be that too

333
00:22:01,318 --> 00:22:02,419
Ri-won / I really don’t mind

334
00:22:03,153 --> 00:22:06,313
Han-kyul / Hearing her say that helped me整理 my feelings

335
00:22:06,323 --> 00:22:08,949
Han-kyul / So honestly, I felt relieved

336
00:22:08,959 --> 00:22:10,751
Han-kyul / But from her side

337
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:13,120
Han-kyul / as she said those words, I felt like

338
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,933
Han-kyul / maybe there was a bit of emptiness too

339
00:22:38,389 --> 00:22:40,014
Ri-won / The road was so beautiful

340
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:41,515
Ri-won / It was so pretty, that path

341
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:43,751
Ri-won / and at the end, I saw Han-kyul

342
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:45,753
Ri-won / At first, I was super nervous

343
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:46,921
Ri-won / as I walked there

344
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:48,989
Ri-won / But the moment I saw her from behind

345
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:51,825
Ri-won / I smiled without even realizing it

346
00:22:51,835 --> 00:22:57,097
Ri-won / I was kind of scared to hand her the note in person...

347
00:22:57,107 --> 00:23:00,935
Ri-won / but in the end, I thought, “I’m glad I can give it to her myself”

348
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:04,838
Ri-won / I think that’s why I smiled, without meaning to

349
00:23:04,848 --> 00:23:07,017
Ri-won / Just seeing Han-kyul

350
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:36,070
Ri-won / To. Han-kyul

351
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,571
Ri-won / Hi Han-kyul

352
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:41,208
Ri-won / So much has happened in these 7 days and 6 nights

353
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:45,846
Ri-won / If I had to choose someone to write my last note to, it would be you, without hesitation

354
00:23:45,856 --> 00:23:50,050
Ri-won / Before joining, I kept saying in every meeting that I would never cry

355
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,655
Ri-won / and that I was jealous of people who cried on shows like this

356
00:23:54,665 --> 00:24:01,028
Ri-won / But thanks to you, I got to feel emotions like this and realize again who I really am

357
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,565
Ri-won / I figured out what happiness and love mean to me

358
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:08,902
Ri-won / Two days ago, when you said I could write all my remaining notes to you

359
00:24:08,912 --> 00:24:12,072
Ri-won / When you said I’d be the first person that came to mind

360
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:15,809
Ri-won / And when you said things would’ve been so hard without me

361
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:17,644
Ri-won / That was more than enough for me

362
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:21,882
Ri-won / Seeing you start to smile more and more made me so happy

363
00:24:21,892 --> 00:24:25,853
Ri-won / Thank you so much, let’s really go to Thailand together

364
00:24:25,863 --> 00:24:29,089
Ri-won / I’ll show you that there are people who keep their promises

365
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:32,002
Ri-won / See you soon. From Ri-won

366
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,896
Ri-won / I just wanted to explain

367
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:37,765
Ri-won / why I had no choice but to choose Han-kyul

368
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:40,367
Ri-won / This past week, thanks to her

369
00:24:40,377 --> 00:24:43,570
Ri-won / I was able to reconnect with emotions I had forgotten

370
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,274
Ri-won / And in the end, she started to smile more and more

371
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:50,588
Ri-won / Just that alone made me really happy

372
00:24:50,587 --> 00:24:53,047
Ri-won / I wrote something like, “Let’s keep in touch!”

373
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:55,249
Ri-won / In a calm tone

374
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:58,085
Han-kyul / I thought it’d be short and simple

375
00:24:58,095 --> 00:25:00,521
Han-kyul / But she gave me such a long letter

376
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,589
Han-kyul / Even at the very end

377
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:05,426
Han-kyul / I wondered if she just had so much more to say to me

378
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:08,829
Han-kyul / And that made me feel even more sorry in a way

379
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:10,964
Han-kyul / But also, at the same time

380
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:14,935
Han-kyul / she’s such a thoughtful and caring person

381
00:25:14,945 --> 00:25:17,337
Han-kyul / So I feel like

382
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:20,641
Han-kyul / someone really good is waiting for her in the future

383
00:25:20,651 --> 00:25:24,478
Han-kyul / So honestly, I don’t feel that guilty anymore

384
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:27,014
Han-kyul / I’m just curious now

385
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:28,749
Han-kyul / about who she’ll meet someday

386
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:31,185
Han-kyul / But since I received something from her

387
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:33,464
Han-kyul / and I couldn’t give anything back

388
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,756
Han-kyul / I just hope she gets to love someone fully

389
00:25:35,766 --> 00:25:37,801
Han-kyul / That’s really how I feel

390
00:25:40,404 --> 00:25:42,306
Han-kyul / I have something to give you too

391
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:51,004
Han-kyul / Please accept my gift too

392
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:53,517
Han-kyul / It’s my favorite book of poetry

393
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,781
Han-kyul / It’s called “To Deserve the Light”

394
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:01,915
Han-kyul / I’m not very good

395
00:26:01,925 --> 00:26:04,017
Han-kyul / at writing handwritten letters or things like that...

396
00:26:04,027 --> 00:26:05,953
Han-kyul / but it’s kind of romantic?

397
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:08,956
Han-kyul / So if I give you a book filled with sweet words

398
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:12,726
Han-kyul / it’s like I can share my feelings with you indirectly

399
00:26:12,736 --> 00:26:16,697
Ri-won / The gift I prepared is pajamas

400
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:19,566
Ri-won / Soft, peach-fabric pajamas

401
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:21,735
Ri-won / The material is really nice

402
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:25,339
Ri-won / I heard it also means, “I give you all of myself”

403
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:27,040
Ri-won / I actually have the exact same pajamas

404
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,108
Ri-won / back at my place

405
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:31,221
Ri-won / We bought them together, as a matching set

406
00:26:44,935 --> 00:26:49,663
Han-kyul / This note probably won’t follow my instincts

407
00:26:49,673 --> 00:26:51,498
Han-kyul / And that’s why I feel even more sorry

408
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:53,867
Han-kyul / I'm sorry I never replied, not even once

409
00:26:53,877 --> 00:26:55,936
Han-kyul / But thank you for giving me your heart anyway

410
00:26:55,946 --> 00:26:57,681
To. Ri-won, From. Han-kyul

411
00:27:06,356 --> 00:27:09,626
Ri-won / Thank you... for giving it to me

412
00:27:10,961 --> 00:27:13,420
Han-kyul / And yet, the conclusion I came to is

413
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,922
Ri-won / Yeah

414
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:17,167
Han-kyul / I wasn't someone who deserved

415
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:20,594
Han-kyul / the love of someone like you

416
00:27:20,604 --> 00:27:21,772
Han-kyul / And that

417
00:27:23,006 --> 00:27:25,165
Han-kyul / probably has nothing to do

418
00:27:25,175 --> 00:27:29,503
Han-kyul / with your sincerity—it's just about me

419
00:27:29,513 --> 00:27:35,442
Han-kyul / everything now—all the hopes, regrets

420
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:37,711
Han-kyul / or the lingering guilt I had in my heart

421
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:40,480
Han-kyul / I wanted to let all of that go

422
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,516
Han-kyul / and for the first time from beginning to end

423
00:27:42,526 --> 00:27:44,985
Han-kyul / write a reply to someone

424
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:48,655
Han-kyul / who was always just kind to me

425
00:27:48,665 --> 00:27:50,357
Han-kyul / I won’t be making a choice

426
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:53,026
Han-kyul / Because this note...

427
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:58,041
Han-kyul / isn’t a sign of choosing—it’s an apology

428
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:01,201
Ri-won / That’s why I told you this morning

429
00:28:01,211 --> 00:28:05,248
Ri-won / Just... do whatever feels right to you

430
00:28:06,617 --> 00:28:09,376
Ri-won / Thank you

431
00:28:09,386 --> 00:28:11,211
Han-kyul / Thank you too

432
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:12,322
Ri-won / Me too

433
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:18,785
Ri-won / I never expected she would give something to me

434
00:28:18,795 --> 00:28:19,953
Ri-won / Not at all

435
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:21,722
Ri-won / But honestly, even before that

436
00:28:21,732 --> 00:28:23,256
Ri-won / I felt like I was going to cry

437
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:25,258
Ri-won / Just the moment I saw Han-kyul's face

438
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:27,861
Ri-won / All the emotions from the past week rushed over me

439
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:30,731
Ri-won / I kept telling myself, "Don’t cry in front of Han-kyul!"

440
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:34,101
Ri-won / I really made up my mind not to cry

441
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:36,737
Ri-won / So I held it in

442
00:28:36,747 --> 00:28:39,306
Ri-won / But after receiving that letter

443
00:28:39,316 --> 00:28:42,609
Ri-won / it hit me that this was really the end

444
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:47,080
Ri-won / I had never even held her hand once

445
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:47,791
Ri-won / So...

446
00:28:52,596 --> 00:28:53,830
Ri-won / Can I give you a hug?

447
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:58,568
Ri-won / I’ve never hugged you before

448
00:29:27,998 --> 00:29:31,935
Ri-won / I was trying not to cry...

449
00:29:51,054 --> 00:29:53,356
Han-kyul / Don’t cry!

450
00:29:57,394 --> 00:30:00,864
Han-kyul / I should be the one crying—don’t cry!

451
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:10,173
Ri-won / Thank you!

452
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,672
Ri-won / Still, for me, the last...

453
00:30:18,682 --> 00:30:22,909
Ri-won / The fact that you gave that note to me meant so much!

454
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,579
Han-kyul / The last note...

455
00:30:25,589 --> 00:30:28,125
Han-kyul / There wasn't anyone who hesitated to write it

456
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:33,420
Ri-won / I'm good now

457
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:37,167
Ri-won / And we'll keep seeing each other anyway

458
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:42,305
Ri-won / Thank you

459
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:46,777
Han-kyul / For not hating someone like me

460
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:52,172
Han-kyul / I'm thankful too

461
00:30:52,182 --> 00:30:54,241
Ri-won / All the hurt feelings

462
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:58,512
Ri-won / All the discomfort and the sharp edges of my heart

463
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:01,114
Ri-won / I think they just melted away like snow

464
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:04,851
Ri-won / Thanks to that last note from Han-kyul

465
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:10,190
Ri-won / I felt like I was being compensated for everything up until now

466
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,093
Ri-won / I was just... really happy

467
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:17,974
Ri-won / I think this last memory will remain so beautifully

468
00:31:19,676 --> 00:31:21,077
Han-kyul / Don’t cry!

469
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:25,982
Ri-won / I really wasn’t going to cry, though

470
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:29,820
Ri-won / It's okay, we’ll see each other again anyway

471
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:32,088
Ri-won / We're going to Thailand too

472
00:31:35,192 --> 00:31:37,160
Ri-won / Now go! It’s too cold

473
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:40,654
Han-kyul / Bye!

474
00:31:40,664 --> 00:31:43,099
Ri-won / Go on!

475
00:32:03,186 --> 00:32:06,413
Han-kyul / I didn’t feel like I was leaving her behind

476
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:08,248
Han-kyul / Not at all

477
00:32:08,258 --> 00:32:10,717
Han-kyul / If anything, it felt like she was the one

478
00:32:10,727 --> 00:32:12,586
Han-kyul / leaving me behind

479
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:16,323
Han-kyul / To receive the same kind of love she gave me

480
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:19,960
Han-kyul / I felt I needed to first regain my own self-worth

481
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:21,828
Han-kyul / That had to come first

482
00:32:21,838 --> 00:32:24,497
Han-kyul / I don't think she's someone

483
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,333
Han-kyul / who’s fragile enough to be cut away

484
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:27,534
Han-kyul / From what I’ve seen of her

485
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:30,103
Han-kyul / she’s someone who expresses her feelings

486
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:32,539
Han-kyul / with conviction and strength

487
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:35,942
Han-kyul / So I always thought that on her path

488
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:38,812
Han-kyul / there would always be someone to give her love

489
00:32:38,822 --> 00:32:42,659
Han-kyul / That’s what I believed

490
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:12,078
Mi-rang / I was hoping Da-gyo would come

491
00:33:12,088 --> 00:33:16,149
Mi-rang / Once I leave here, I think I’ll miss her a lot

492
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,329
Mi-rang / Whether I got chosen or not, I just didn’t want to regret

493
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:23,289
Mi-rang / So I decided to follow my heart

494
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:26,202
Mi-rang / I didn’t think too much about it

495
00:34:27,263 --> 00:34:29,422
Da-gyo / I was nervous wondering who would show up

496
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:32,592
Da-gyo / I also thought, “What if the person I wrote to doesn’t come?”

497
00:34:32,602 --> 00:34:36,606
Da-gyo / “What should I say then?”—those thoughts came up too

498
00:35:07,703 --> 00:35:10,096
Hee-young / This is just the beginning

499
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:12,365
Hee-young / As we get to know each other, things can grow

500
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:15,678
Hee-young / My feelings aren’t super deep yet

501
00:35:15,878 --> 00:35:18,471
Hee-young / So I just wanted Da-gyo to feel at ease for her final choice

502
00:35:18,481 --> 00:35:19,615
Hee-young / That’s all I thought about

503
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,178
Da-gyo / Honestly, I was surprised

504
00:35:25,188 --> 00:35:28,014
Da-gyo / Yesterday, when we talked 1 /1

505
00:35:28,024 --> 00:35:29,816
Da-gyo / You told me no matter what decision you made

506
00:35:29,826 --> 00:35:33,519
Da-gyo / You wanted it to be one with no regrets

507
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:36,589
Da-gyo / And thinking that your choice was me

508
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,624
Da-gyo / I was really thankful

509
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:40,860
Hee-young / Hi

510
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:45,298
Da-gyo / I waited for so long
Hee-young / Really? You didn’t know?

511
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:48,177
Da-gyo / Today’s...

512
00:35:48,644 --> 00:35:53,005
Da-gyo / My outfit perfectly matches today’s gift

513
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:56,719
Jin-ah / You match too—did you plan it?

514
00:36:04,627 --> 00:36:07,854
Hee-young / I wanted to tell you in person rather than just writing it

515
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:09,689
Da-gyo / What you wrote in the note?

516
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:13,493
Hee-young / No, the note was short

517
00:36:13,503 --> 00:36:17,406
Da-gyo / Can I see what you wrote?

518
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:30,877
I want to get to know what kind of person you are

519
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:32,522
Hee-young

520
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:40,019
Hee-young / But this is how I feel right now

521
00:36:40,029 --> 00:36:43,833
Hee-young / I don’t know what choice you made

522
00:36:47,303 --> 00:36:50,763
Hee-young / I’m sad that I realized it late

523
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:57,003
Hee-young / If I hadn’t, maybe we could’ve had more time to get to know each other

524
00:36:57,013 --> 00:36:58,948
Hee-young / But you really have no regrets

525
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:01,874
Da-gyo / Is this a choice you won’t regret?

526
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:04,877
Hee-young / Yes, because I’ve always been sincere

527
00:37:04,887 --> 00:37:07,079
Hee-young / So there’s no regret about realizing late

528
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:09,015
Hee-young / Or anything like that

529
00:37:09,025 --> 00:37:14,453
Hee-young / But I do think things are probably

530
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:16,589
Hee-young / Complicated for you right now

531
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:18,991
Hee-young / I just hope it’s not too hard on you

532
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:21,193
Da-gyo / Thank you

533
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:26,009
Hee-young / I really am okay

534
00:37:26,008 --> 00:37:31,771
Da-gyo / Thank you, I’m just glad

535
00:37:31,781 --> 00:37:34,183
Da-gyo / That you made your choice without regrets

536
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,913
Da-gyo / Thinking that your choice was me

537
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:42,815
Da-gyo / Made me really thankful

538
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:45,484
Da-gyo / I’m sure you could tell who I was interested in

539
00:37:45,494 --> 00:37:48,187
Da-gyo / You must’ve already known

540
00:37:48,197 --> 00:37:51,467
Da-gyo / But the fact that you wrote to me...

541
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:53,826
Hee-young / Just the fact that I got to experience

542
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:56,696
Hee-young / Something like this here, thanks to you

543
00:37:56,706 --> 00:38:00,633
Hee-young / And I hope you don’t struggle too much

544
00:38:00,643 --> 00:38:05,181
Hee-young / I think I said that in other words

545
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,785
Hee-young / You’re cute

546
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:14,790
Hee-young / Here, this is my gift for you

547
00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:18,527
Da-gyo / Thank you...

548
00:38:18,828 --> 00:38:21,086
Jin-ah / Prepare a gift for the person you became a final couple with

549
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:22,764
Jin-ah / And explain why you chose that gift

550
00:38:22,765 --> 00:38:24,700
Jin-ah / Tell them the reason behind it

551
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:28,371
Hee-young / My gift is...

552
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:33,576
Hee-young / Your photo album is...

553
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:40,216
Hee-young / I wanted to take pictures

554
00:38:40,217 --> 00:38:46,123
Hee-young / And get them printed and keep those memories

555
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:48,848
Hee-young / It means I hope you create lots of memories

556
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:52,685
Min-woo / Are you saying we should fill up the whole box?

557
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:55,497
Hee-young / Oh that? We can just buy more

558
00:38:57,867 --> 00:39:00,092
Min-woo / Okay okay...

559
00:39:00,102 --> 00:39:03,105
Hee-young / That’s how it is

560
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:07,282
Hee-young / Later on...

561
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:08,613
Hee-young / When I get the film camera photos developed

562
00:39:08,623 --> 00:39:10,807
Hee-young / Once those are printed

563
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:12,683
Da-gyo / I took some too, with your digital cam

564
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,244
Hee-young / I’ll give those to you—put some of them in the album too

565
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:19,040
Hee-young / Because I’m cheering for your life

566
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,910
Da-gyo / Me too

567
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,477
Hee-young / So I just want you to be happy

568
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:26,967
Hee-young / Keep lots of those memories

569
00:39:26,977 --> 00:39:29,284
Hee-young / And treasure them in your album

570
00:39:29,298 --> 00:39:32,168
Da-gyo / Thank you, really

571
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:39,099
Hee-young / Giving this gift

572
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:40,601
Hee-young / I thought of whoever I might meet

573
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,140
Hee-young / That’s what the gift was prepared for

574
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:47,118
Hee-young / So as I gave her

575
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,288
Hee-young / The album

576
00:39:49,298 --> 00:39:53,224
Hee-young / With lots of memories

577
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:54,960
Hee-young / That’s what I was thinking

578
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,963
Hee-young / As I handed it to her

579
00:40:03,096 --> 00:40:06,332
Da-gyo / Really, thank you

580
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,541
Hee-young / Don’t cry

581
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:15,379
Da-gyo / I’m not crying

582
00:40:15,383 --> 00:40:19,110
Da-gyo / I’m just so happy and thankful

583
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:34,485
Da-gyo / I was really happy that I was your no-regret choice

584
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:39,827
Da-gyo / Just...

585
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,408
Da-gyo / I want to say I’ll carry your heart with me

586
00:40:42,418 --> 00:40:44,457
Da-gyo / That’s what I want to tell you

587
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,933
Da-gyo / And also that you worked really hard

588
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:54,687
Hee-young / Da-gyo

589
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:58,478
Hee-young / Thank you for liking me

590
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:03,888
Hee-young / I’m sorry I realized it so late

591
00:41:03,898 --> 00:41:07,765
Hee-young / But seeing you so happy now makes me happy too

592
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,217
Hee-young / You’re people I care about deeply, all of you are great people

593
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,481
Hee-young / I hope you experience love again

594
00:41:14,491 --> 00:41:18,465
Hee-young / And make even more new memories

595
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,793
Hee-young / Fighting!

596
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,984
Seo-yeon / I was really nervous

597
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,643
Seo-yeon / Really nervous, but

598
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:47,964
Seo-yeon / Since I had some idea of

599
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,723
Seo-yeon / How it would turn out

600
00:41:49,737 --> 00:41:52,747
Seo-yeon / Since I knew how Mi-rang felt

601
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:56,981
Seo-yeon / I was half nervous, half calm

602
00:41:56,979 --> 00:41:58,981
Seo-yeon / Unnie

603
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:07,331
Seo-yeon / Did you know I’d show up?

604
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,460
Mi-rang / No, I didn’t

605
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,895
Seo-yeon / Didn't you?

606
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,357
Seo-yeon / Why?

607
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,880
Mi-rang / I thought you were into Da-gyo

608
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,140
Mi-rang / Honestly, I didn’t think Seo-yeon would pick me

609
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:23,007
Mi-rang / When I found out it was Seo Yeon, I felt grateful.

610
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,476
Mi-rang / Even though I was always looking at Da-gyo

611
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,263
Mi-rang / You found the courage to come to me at the end

612
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:31,284
Mi-rang / That felt a bit sad but also really touching

613
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:35,085
Mi-rang / Oh but yesterday... the note? After reading it...

614
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:39,594
Seo-yeon / I talked with Da-gyo and sorted it out

615
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:43,160
Seo-yeon / And...

616
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,817
Seo-yeon / I just sorted through my own feelings

617
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,519
Seo-yeon / Giving it in person

618
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:56,537
Seo-yeon / Felt way more satisfying

619
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,275
Seo-yeon / So it felt like a relief

620
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,983
Seo-yeon / I felt liberated

621
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:09,888
Seo-yeon / TO. Mi-rang

622
00:43:09,898 --> 00:43:15,926
Seo-yeon / I’m sorry, I hope you’ll be happy

623
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:19,666
Seo-yeon / From. Seo-yeon

624
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:22,516
Mi-rang / Really

625
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:24,310
Mi-rang / Thank you

626
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,650
Seo-yeon / It’s okay I’m used to one-sided love

627
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:33,030
Seo-yeon / Honestly, I wasn’t going to give you a gift

628
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,623
Seo-yeon / I was just going to give a note

629
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,957
Seo-yeon / But then I thought about it

630
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,554
Seo-yeon / As I was preparing this gift

631
00:43:43,564 --> 00:43:46,820
Seo-yeon / I realized it wasn’t about living happily ever after

632
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:49,387
Seo-yeon / Lovey-dovey with my future lover or anything

633
00:43:49,397 --> 00:43:51,284
Seo-yeon / That’s not why I chose it

634
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,551
Seo-yeon / Like I said before

635
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:58,765
Seo-yeon / The person who receives this gift

636
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,737
Seo-yeon / Just like the meaning of ruby

637
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,407
Seo-yeon / I hope they walk a path full of passionate love

638
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:05,709
Seo-yeon / That love will accompany their future

639
00:44:05,716 --> 00:44:07,673
Seo-yeon / That’s the intention I had

640
00:44:07,683 --> 00:44:09,503
Seo-yeon / When I prepared it

641
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:17,165
Seo-yeon / So I want you to have this

642
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,732
Mi-rang / I’ll accept it with gratitude

643
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,842
Seo-yeon / The gift I prepared is...

644
00:44:30,852 --> 00:44:32,537
Seo-yeon / A ruby bracelet

645
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:40,207
Seo-yeon / Ruby is my birthstone

646
00:44:40,217 --> 00:44:44,815
Seo-yeon / And the meaning of ruby

647
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:47,480
Seo-yeon / So I hope the person I matched with

648
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,773
Seo-yeon / Will walk a future full of that passion

649
00:44:49,783 --> 00:44:52,543
Seo-yeon / That’s the meaning behind the gift

650
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:55,471
Mi-rang / Here is what I have prepared.

651
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,161
Mi-rang / It’s not something you wear?

652
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:00,603
Mi-rang / Just something to keep?

653
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,153
Seo-yeon / No, you can wear it

654
00:45:02,163 --> 00:45:03,717
Jin-ah / This is packaging, right?

655
00:45:03,732 --> 00:45:05,000
Mi-rang / Oh, it's just the packaging?

656
00:45:05,008 --> 00:45:06,776
Jin-ah / Isn’t the person supposed to remove this?

657
00:45:12,815 --> 00:45:15,444
Da-gyo / This is too funny

658
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,653
Seo-yeon / Want to take a look like this?

659
00:45:19,663 --> 00:45:21,354
Hee-young / It sparkles beautifully.

660
00:45:21,364 --> 00:45:21,955
Mi-rang / It's pretty

661
00:45:21,965 --> 00:45:22,903
Da-gyo / It suits you well

662
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:25,421
Min-woo / It looks even better when worn

663
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:28,471
Jin-ah / Yeah, it looks totally different on

664
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:30,273
Seo-yeon  / And I didn't confuse you.

665
00:45:30,273 --> 00:45:33,092
Seo-yeon / I really liked you

666
00:45:35,876 --> 00:45:39,056
Mi-rang / I didn’t even talk to you outside, remember?

667
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:39,880
Seo-yeon / When?

668
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:42,437
Mi-rang / I barely spoke to you

669
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,406
Mi-rang / I mean, that was...

670
00:45:43,416 --> 00:45:48,011
Seo-yeon / Don’t... ah... don’t say it!

671
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:51,162
Mi-rang / I'm sorry about that too

672
00:45:51,172 --> 00:45:53,581
Seo-yeon / Oh right, unnie, about that...

673
00:45:53,591 --> 00:45:55,119
Seo-yeon / When you talked about the emptiness

674
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,711
Seo-yeon / I was honestly really shocked

675
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:58,854
Seo-yeon / You unintentionally

676
00:45:58,864 --> 00:46:01,461
Seo-yeon / Hurt me without knowing it

677
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,926
Seo-yeon / I realized that not long ago

678
00:46:02,937 --> 00:46:04,227
Seo-yeon / Just hours before that

679
00:46:04,237 --> 00:46:06,750
Seo-yeon / I was saying harsh things to you

680
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,100
Seo-yeon / But a few hours later I understood

681
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:12,236
Seo-yeon / So I felt really sorry

682
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,230
Seo-yeon / But if I said too much here like

683
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,043
Seo-yeon / “I’m really sorry,” it might feel like a burden

684
00:46:16,053 --> 00:46:19,276
Seo-yeon / So I didn’t say anything

685
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,934
Seo-yeon / I just felt like

686
00:46:22,944 --> 00:46:24,440
Seo-yeon / In a moment like this

687
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,364
Seo-yeon / It’s better to say it plainly

688
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,505
Seo-yeon / Take care, unnie

689
00:46:34,456 --> 00:46:37,826
Seo-yeon / Okay?

690
00:46:38,797 --> 00:46:42,366
Seo-yeon / I’ll go now, unnie

691
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:51,680
Seo-yeon / If Mi-rang sees me crying

692
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:52,947
Seo-yeon / Would she feel like this?

693
00:46:52,957 --> 00:46:54,543
Seo-yeon / That thought crossed my mind

694
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,980
Seo-yeon / It hurt but I wanted her to be happy

695
00:46:56,996 --> 00:47:00,562
Seo-yeon / I was thankful too

696
00:47:00,572 --> 00:47:02,246
Seo-yeon / And I hoped she wouldn’t cry

697
00:47:02,256 --> 00:47:06,456
Seo-yeon / I just really want her to be happy from now on

698
00:47:06,463 --> 00:47:07,854
Mi-rang / Seo-yeon always

699
00:47:07,864 --> 00:47:09,800
Mi-rang / Was someone who didn’t talk much

700
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:10,860
Mi-rang / Even when we all hung out

701
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,231
Mi-rang / She liked being alone

702
00:47:14,216 --> 00:47:18,332
Mi-rang / I thought she was shy and introverted

703
00:47:18,337 --> 00:47:20,903
Mi-rang / But she still mustered up courage for me

704
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:23,941
Mi-rang / And kept approaching me till the end

705
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,843
Mi-rang / She kept giving me notes

706
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,460
Mi-rang / I was so thankful for that

707
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,704
Mi-rang / And also sorry

708
00:48:04,703 --> 00:48:07,508
Mi-rang / I'm the type to doubt and think negatively

709
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:09,416
Mi-rang / That way I get hurt less

710
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:11,288
Mi-rang / So I kept thinking she wouldn't come

711
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:15,158
Mi-rang / I kept thinking “she’s probably not coming”

712
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:52,191
Da-gyo / Honestly, I didn’t know who it would be because

713
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:54,257
Da-gyo / I went on a date with four people the day before

714
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,691
Da-gyo / So I didn’t know who’d write the letter among them

715
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:01,361
Da-gyo / But I was hoping it was Mi-rang and walked out

716
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,224
Da-gyo / And there she was, waiting for me

717
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,036
Mi-rang / Da-gyo came walking over all shy

718
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:08,520
Mi-rang / Looking so embarrassed

719
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,361
Mi-rang / She was so cute

720
00:49:10,371 --> 00:49:13,238
Mi-rang / I didn’t think she’d choose me

721
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:15,144
Mi-rang / So I was thankful she came

722
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:19,143
Mi-rang / I thought I’d cry if she came but when I saw her

723
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:21,757
Mi-rang / I was just too happy

724
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:23,683
Mi-rang / I couldn’t stop smiling

725
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:25,524
Da-gyo / I came

726
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,798
Mi-rang / You came?

727
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,301
Da-gyo / I came to you

728
00:49:34,311 --> 00:49:38,030
Mi-rang / I thought you wouldn’t choose me

729
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:38,964
Da-gyo / Really?

730
00:49:38,974 --> 00:49:39,841
Mi-rang / Yeah

731
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:43,979
Da-gyo / We even talked about it this morning

732
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:01,197
Da-gyo / To. Mi-rang unnie

733
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,494
Da-gyo / Thank you for always staying by my side and expressing yourself

734
00:50:04,504 --> 00:50:07,838
Da-gyo / That time when you confidently said “I'm not curious about anyone else but you”

735
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:10,480
Da-gyo / I still remember that moment

736
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:14,001
Da-gyo / Just like you said, I’m coming to you now

737
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,378
Da-gyo / I like you, Mi-rang

738
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:21,043
Mi-rang / To Da-gyo

739
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:24,317
Mi-rang / Sorry for being selfish when things were hard for you yesterday

740
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:27,661
Mi-rang / But when I saw your face this morning, you looked so pretty

741
00:50:27,671 --> 00:50:30,861
Mi-rang / I saw you in winter, so I want to see you this summer too

742
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:33,209
Mi-rang / Thank you, I’m sorry, and I like you

743
00:50:33,219 --> 00:50:34,577
Mi-rang / From Mi-rang

744
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:37,261
Da-gyo / How was it?

745
00:50:37,271 --> 00:50:39,403
Mi-rang / It was touching

746
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,307
Da-gyo / You told me

747
00:50:41,317 --> 00:50:45,108
Da-gyo / That you’re only curious about me

748
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:48,007
Da-gyo / And you...

749
00:50:48,017 --> 00:50:49,246
Da-gyo / You told me...

750
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,040
Mi-rang / Are you nervous?

751
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,079
Da-gyo / Yeah

752
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,276
Da-gyo / "Even if you go on dates with others

753
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:55,181
Da-gyo / I feel like you’ll end up choosing me"

754
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:57,037
Da-gyo / You told me that, remember?

755
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:58,623
Da-gyo / That really came to mind today

756
00:50:59,836 --> 00:51:01,561
Da-gyo / Even though later you did say

757
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:05,128
Da-gyo / "Don’t go"

758
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,087
Mi-rang / I was jealous
Da-gyo / But still...

759
00:51:07,097 --> 00:51:10,100
Da-gyo / Are you satisfied that things turned out like you said?

760
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:13,257
Mi-rang / Totally 100%

761
00:51:13,823 --> 00:51:16,153
Da-gyo / Thank you I really love flowers

762
00:51:16,163 --> 00:51:19,664
Mi-rang / Here! Please accept these flowers

763
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:21,957
Da-gyo / You have to wear this, not that

764
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:24,181
Da-gyo / I got you a gift too

765
00:51:25,603 --> 00:51:28,211
Mi-rang / Oh come on that’s so embarrassing

766
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,621
Ri-won / I’m curious about the flowers

767
00:51:30,631 --> 00:51:32,422
Jin-ah / Me too, I want to see them

768
00:51:36,996 --> 00:51:39,286
Mi-rang / But why is everyone staring at me?

769
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:40,395
Ri-won / Is it you, Mi-rang?

770
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,327
Da-gyo / Were you just guessing?

771
00:51:42,337 --> 00:51:43,395
Jin-ah / But yeah, it kinda looked that way

772
00:51:43,405 --> 00:51:44,966
Mi-rang / You're right

773
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:45,636
Da-gyo / Really?

774
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:46,360
Jin-ah / Oh my gosh

775
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,737
Jin-ah / I mean, we’ve been here a few days, so we can tell now

776
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:55,562
Mi-rang / Receiving flowers in a special moment like this

777
00:51:55,572 --> 00:51:57,937
Mi-rang / I hope that when we become a couple later

778
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,873
Mi-rang / Every moment we meet

779
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:02,224
Mi-rang / Will feel just as special, that’s why I prepared this

780
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,356
Da-gyo / It was so hard to choose

781
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:17,861
Da-gyo / So what I picked was...

782
00:52:17,871 --> 00:52:22,839
Da-gyo / A scarf and gloves

783
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:24,837
Da-gyo / If we became the final couple

784
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,083
Da-gyo / I wanted this winter

785
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:28,870
Da-gyo / To be remembered

786
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:30,997
Da-gyo / And since winter is cold

787
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:32,200
Da-gyo / I wanted that memory

788
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:33,816
Da-gyo / To be remembered warmly

789
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,442
Da-gyo / That’s why I picked something cozy on purpose

790
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:39,480
Da-gyo / I ordered it with that warm feeling in mind

791
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,759
Da-gyo / And how do I know it’s warm?

792
00:52:40,769 --> 00:52:42,327
Da-gyo / Because I have the same one

793
00:52:42,337 --> 00:52:43,543
Da-gyo / I own it too

794
00:52:43,558 --> 00:52:45,784
Ri-won / Ah, the same exact one?

795
00:52:45,794 --> 00:52:48,517
Da-gyo / It’s one of my favorite scarves...

796
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,650
Da-gyo / I ordered the same one for you

797
00:52:50,656 --> 00:52:52,105
Mi-rang / Is it the same color?
Da-gyo / Why am I so embarrassed

798
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:54,002
Da-gyo / The color is not the same

799
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,668
Da-gyo / And just buying that felt a bit lacking

800
00:52:55,678 --> 00:52:56,640
Da-gyo / So I got gloves too

801
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:58,496
Ri-won / Couple items then

802
00:52:58,522 --> 00:53:00,730
Da-gyo / So that's how I prepared it

803
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,007
Da-gyo / I really love flowers

804
00:53:05,017 --> 00:53:08,518
Mi-rang / I’ll buy you lots

805
00:53:08,616 --> 00:53:10,350
Da-gyo / I’m so nervous

806
00:53:10,352 --> 00:53:12,254
Mi-rang / Me too

807
00:53:12,921 --> 00:53:13,816
Da-gyo / But it’s nice, right?

808
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:14,648
Mi-rang / I love it

809
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:16,449
Da-gyo / Right? Me too

810
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:19,861
Mi-rang / Let’s go

811
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:31,043
Mi-rang / Thank you for coming out to me

812
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,684
Da-gyo / Of course

813
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:33,502
Da-gyo / But why did you think...

814
00:53:33,508 --> 00:53:36,101
Da-gyo / Why did you think I wouldn’t come?

815
00:53:36,111 --> 00:53:38,810
Mi-rang / Your expression this morning was really off

816
00:53:39,010 --> 00:53:41,812
Da-gyo / You’re such a fool

817
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:43,750
Da-gyo / You’re a total fool

818
00:53:43,752 --> 00:53:47,212
Mi-rang / I almost cried

819
00:53:47,222 --> 00:53:49,083
Da-gyo / Be honest, you’re younger than me, right?

820
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:51,224
Mi-rang / Am I?

821
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:56,286
Da-gyo / I feel like you are

822
00:53:56,290 --> 00:54:01,029
Mi-rang / Anyway, thank you so much for choosing me and...

823
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:03,680
Mi-rang / For being so genuine with me in this short time

824
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,940
Mi-rang / I'm really thankful

825
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:10,747
Mi-rang / I just want to keep seeing you

826
00:54:10,743 --> 00:54:11,700
Mi-rang / Until “I like you” eventually

827
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:16,139
Mi-rang / Turns into “I love you”

828
00:54:16,149 --> 00:54:21,378
Da-gyo / I’m really thankful that you only had eyes for me

829
00:54:21,388 --> 00:54:25,278
Da-gyo / Charging forward from the start is never easy

830
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:27,102
Da-gyo / But you didn’t care about others watching

831
00:54:27,108 --> 00:54:28,867
Da-gyo / And still chose me in the end

832
00:54:28,877 --> 00:54:30,944
Da-gyo / I just want to say thank you

833
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:36,175
Da-gyo / And that I like you

834
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:38,129
Da-gyo / Your name is...

835
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:40,075
Mi-rang / Oh, I’m Kim Mi-rang

836
00:54:41,977 --> 00:54:44,903
Mi-rang / Kim Mi-rang

837
00:54:44,913 --> 00:54:47,882
Da-gyo / Rang... Rang?

838
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:51,684
Da-gyo / Honestly for me

839
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,670
Da-gyo / Out of the three cards

840
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:00,962
Mi-rang / Honestly, I didn’t care about the art, I just...

841
00:55:00,972 --> 00:55:02,634
Mi-rang / Wanted to go on a date with you

842
00:55:02,644 --> 00:55:06,114
Da-gyo / Oh... really?

843
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:11,163
Da-gyo / No, it’s not like that, I hadn’t tried yet...

844
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:13,776
Da-gyo / I just came out here to find out more anyway

845
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:16,002
Da-gyo / So if there was a chance, I thought I’d see how it is

846
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:18,284
Da-gyo / Just see what it’s like

847
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:21,070
Mi-rang / If I said no, would you not go?

848
00:55:22,036 --> 00:55:25,071
Da-gyo / If you didn’t want me to?

849
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,704
Da-gyo / Then I won’t go, in that case

850
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,811
Mi-rang / Did you write a note to Hee-young?

851
00:55:31,835 --> 00:55:33,370
Da-gyo / Today? No

852
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:45,671
Da-gyo / I sent it to you I sent it right away

853
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:47,940
Mi-rang / Is it complicated?

854
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:48,650
Da-gyo / No

855
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:52,810
Da-gyo / I was just exhausted

856
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:59,648
Da-gyo / I talked to a lot of people today

857
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:03,460
Da-gyo / And that really wore me out

858
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:09,758
Da-gyo / I used too much emotion all at once

859
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:14,043
Mi-rang / It’s not because of this dating show

860
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:17,262
Mi-rang / I really like you

861
00:56:17,272 --> 00:56:19,107
Mi-rang / I still do

862
00:56:23,570 --> 00:56:25,237
Da-gyo / Me too

863
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,720
Jin-ah / To. Min-woo

864
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:13,190
Jin-ah / Thank you for listening to this older girl who acts younger

865
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:15,934
Jin-ah / For comforting me and talking with me

866
00:57:15,944 --> 00:57:18,902
Jin-ah / You've helped me become someone

867
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,197
Jin-ah / Who can be more honest in love, face situations head-on

868
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:25,613
Jin-ah / And have more conversations with myself

869
00:57:25,623 --> 00:57:28,016
Jin-ah / Thank you for helping me grow

870
00:57:28,026 --> 00:57:29,243
Jin-ah / From Jin-ah

871
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:31,844
Jin-ah / After I wrote to Da-gyo yesterday

872
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:34,503
Jin-ah / I thought, “I want to write two notes!”

873
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:39,044
Jin-ah / Da-gyo, who shared half the time at the house with me

874
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:40,743
Jin-ah / And my other roommate, Min-woo

875
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:41,994
Jin-ah / It was a short time

876
00:57:42,004 --> 00:57:45,865
Jin-ah / But I wanted to express my sincere feelings

877
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:48,601
Jin-ah / To those precious people I spent all day with

878
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:49,449
Jin-ah / Thank you

879
00:57:49,455 --> 00:57:51,714
Jin-ah / I had fun thanks to you

880
00:57:51,724 --> 00:57:55,710
Jin-ah / I think this memory will stay beautiful for a long time because of you

881
00:57:58,012 --> 00:58:00,809
Min-woo / Hm~

882
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,244
Min-woo / I didn’t exactly raise you

883
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:07,151
Min-woo / But thank you for growing up so well

884
00:58:17,722 --> 00:58:20,883
Min-woo / I won’t make a final choice

885
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,215
Min-woo / But I want to write a note to the person

886
00:58:23,225 --> 00:58:25,905
Min-woo / Who supported me the most

887
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:35,237
Min-woo / To. Seo-yeon

888
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,803
Min-woo / Meeting you

889
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:39,203
Min-woo / I was able to acknowledge my weaknesses.

890
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:42,071
Min-woo / Thank you, my pine tree

891
00:58:42,096 --> 00:58:44,794
Seo-yeon / Min-woo, if your bed’s okay

892
00:58:44,794 --> 00:58:46,262
Min-woo / I didn’t have strong romantic feelings for you

893
00:58:46,262 --> 00:58:50,243
Seo-yeon / Want to share it with me?

894
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:53,589
Min-woo / But I think you were the best person

895
00:58:53,595 --> 00:58:56,783
Min-woo / The only one I could open up to honestly

896
00:58:56,810 --> 00:58:57,500
Min-woo / And talk to

897
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:00,037
Min-woo / You gave me good hints to guide me

898
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,775
Min-woo / In the right direction

899
00:59:01,785 --> 00:59:05,162
Min-woo / Maybe you’re someone who shares similar thoughts with me

900
00:59:05,182 --> 00:59:08,773
Min-woo / Like a friend who’s not too close or too far

901
00:59:08,783 --> 00:59:11,014
Min-woo / That’s why you felt like a pine tree to me

902
00:59:11,029 --> 00:59:13,814
Min-woo / So I wrote “Thank you, my pine tree!” at the end

903
00:59:13,824 --> 00:59:15,649
Min-woo / Seo-yeon, the unrequited love expert!

904
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:18,845
Min-woo / Now your love life will never be lonely again

905
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:22,771
Min-woo / Never again

906
00:59:24,210 --> 00:59:26,211
Seo-yeon / Out of the 7 in ToGetHer House

907
00:59:26,231 --> 00:59:29,121
Seo-yeon / The one I most want to cheer on in love is

908
00:59:29,131 --> 00:59:30,096
Seo-yeon / Min-woo

909
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:33,769
Seo-yeon / Min-woo is more charming than people think

910
00:59:33,783 --> 00:59:36,786
Seo-yeon / She's funny, pretty, and

911
00:59:40,323 --> 00:59:43,260
Seo-yeon / Except for the bikini party here.

912
00:59:45,447 --> 00:59:47,123
Seo-yeon / If Min-woo had been able to focus

913
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:48,878
Seo-yeon / A bit more on dating

914
00:59:48,898 --> 00:59:50,612
Seo-yeon / It could have been better

915
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:52,539
Seo-yeon / Even outside the ToGetHer House

916
00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:55,378
Seo-yeon / I hope she’ll focus more on romance

917
00:59:55,392 --> 00:59:58,542
Seo-yeon / And show us that side of her

918
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:02,622
Seo-yeon / Min-woo, back then it was right to be considerate

919
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:03,756
Seo-yeon / But now if you say we should share a bed

920
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:07,814
Seo-yeon / It might mean something else

921
01:00:07,872 --> 01:00:11,933
Seo-yeon / Min-woo! I’ll be rooting for your love! Fighting!

922
01:00:11,952 --> 01:00:14,623
Hee-young / Our Seo-yeon

923
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:16,965
Hee-young / I’m really rooting for you

924
01:00:16,992 --> 01:00:18,444
Hee-young / Find the cute girlfriend you love

925
01:00:18,457 --> 01:00:21,583
Hee-young / And be happy

926
01:00:21,593 --> 01:00:24,413
Hee-young / Let’s go on a double date sometime

927
01:00:24,432 --> 01:00:26,649
Hee-young / Seo-yeon! I’ll cheer for your love

928
01:00:26,659 --> 01:00:28,457
Mi-rang / Hee-young

929
01:00:28,472 --> 01:00:31,372
Mi-rang / You're full of charm and your chest is big

930
01:00:33,285 --> 01:00:37,294
Mi-rang / You're playful

931
01:00:37,312 --> 01:00:40,062
Mi-rang / And you cry a lot too

932
01:00:40,072 --> 01:00:41,411
Mi-rang / You seem strong outside

933
01:00:41,417 --> 01:00:45,543
Mi-rang / But you're soft inside

934
01:00:45,553 --> 01:00:48,906
Mi-rang / Call me whenever you're having a hard time

935
01:00:48,912 --> 01:00:52,877
Mi-rang / You can totally meet someone great

936
01:00:52,887 --> 01:00:56,749
Mi-rang / Let’s keep our 'Hee-rang' friendship forever

937
01:00:56,759 --> 01:01:00,286
Mi-rang / Hee-young! I hope you meet someone amazing! Fighting!

938
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,748
Ri-won / Oh, Mi-rang!

939
01:01:02,758 --> 01:01:06,051
Ri-won / You know, inside here

940
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:07,586
Ri-won / we never really went on a date

941
01:01:07,596 --> 01:01:09,988
Ri-won / Because both of us were seriously

942
01:01:09,998 --> 01:01:12,858
Ri-won / deeply into someone else

943
01:01:12,868 --> 01:01:14,426
Ri-won / But I think even that

944
01:01:14,436 --> 01:01:16,395
Ri-won / felt just like us, and I liked that

945
01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:18,897
Ri-won / And I’m so glad I got to know you

946
01:01:18,907 --> 01:01:21,300
Ri-won / As hard as it was in here

947
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:23,101
Ri-won / you ended up with Da-gyo in the end

948
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:25,671
Ri-won / So I hope things go beautifully for you two outside

949
01:01:25,681 --> 01:01:28,473
Ri-won / But if Da-gyo ever dumps you

950
01:01:28,483 --> 01:01:31,253
Ri-won / come to me! I’ll heal you!

951
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,510
Ri-won / Be happy!

952
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,957
Ri-won / Mi-rang! I’ll be rooting for your love!

953
01:01:35,974 --> 01:01:40,366
Da-gyo / I just felt so happy and grateful

954
01:01:40,376 --> 01:01:43,789
Da-gyo / Can you ever have an experience like this in life?

955
01:01:43,814 --> 01:01:46,865
Da-gyo / I got to go on dates with 4 women in one day

956
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:50,238
i've got a big heart! I feel the same way.

957
01:01:50,254 --> 01:01:51,704
Da-gyo / Everyone was so precious

958
01:01:51,714 --> 01:01:54,909
Da-gyo / Let's go out and see it!

959
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:57,135
Han-kyul / Out of all the final couples here

960
01:01:57,145 --> 01:02:00,566
Han-kyul / Mi-rang and Da-gyo’s relationship

961
01:02:00,576 --> 01:02:03,186
Han-kyul / Is the one I’m most excited about

962
01:02:03,196 --> 01:02:05,388
Han-kyul / As someone watching from the outside

963
01:02:05,398 --> 01:02:07,584
Han-kyul / As a viewer of a romantic drama

964
01:02:07,594 --> 01:02:13,084
Han-kyul / I will cheer passionately for your love.

965
01:02:13,094 --> 01:02:15,518
Han-kyul / And many others will too

966
01:02:15,528 --> 01:02:20,297
Han-kyul / I think your future relationships will be more mature

967
01:02:20,307 --> 01:02:22,899
Han-kyul / And even more romantic

968
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:24,443
Han-kyul / Because everyone here

969
01:02:24,453 --> 01:02:26,984
Han-kyul / I think it’ll remain as a lifelong memory, etched in our hearts

970
01:02:26,984 --> 01:02:29,946
Han-kyul / It will be a wonderful memory for a lifetime!
