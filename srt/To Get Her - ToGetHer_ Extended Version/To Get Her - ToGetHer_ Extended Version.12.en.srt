1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,325
Da-gyo / Are we taking this car?

2
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:10,855
Mi-rang / Yeah hop in

3
00:00:13,535 --> 00:00:17,735
Da-gyo / I'm finally seeing you drive

4
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:20,485
Mi-rang / I look awkward getting in

5
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:23,285
Da-gyo / What are you doing?

6
00:00:23,295 --> 00:00:24,855
Mi-rang / Wait what do I do

7
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:28,925
Mi-rang / It's my first time driving this car

8
00:00:28,935 --> 00:00:30,165
Da-gyo / Oh you used this one before?

9
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:30,935
Mi-rang / Yeah

10
00:00:31,055 --> 00:00:31,925
Da-gyo / I see

11
00:00:31,935 --> 00:00:36,455
Mi-rang / Another girl sat here before you

12
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:39,445
Da-gyo / That’s funny

13
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:42,335
Mi-rang / She sat here yesterday

14
00:00:44,095 --> 00:00:47,575
Da-gyo / It's not like... I mean yeah okay

15
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,245
Da-gyo / I’m...

16
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:52,885
Da-gyo / I’m a chill person

17
00:00:52,895 --> 00:00:56,205
Da-gyo / Probably...

18
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:58,285
Da-gyo / I think it smells like Seo-yeon in here

19
00:00:58,295 --> 00:00:58,765
Mi-rang / Really?

20
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:01,215
Da-gyo / Yeah like her perfume in this seat?

21
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,815
Da-gyo / Like her hair scent?

22
00:01:04,575 --> 00:01:07,645
Da-gyo / It hit me just now

23
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:10,455
Mi-rang / Can we roll the windows down?

24
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:11,445
Da-gyo / Be my guest~
 

25
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:13,855
Da-gyo / Be my guest~
Mi-rang / I wanna feel the Jeju breeze

26
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:15,365
Mi-rang / While we're driving

27
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:19,335
Da-gyo / But the weather today is kind of... is it nice?

28
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,615
Da-gyo / Isn’t it too nice?

29
00:01:22,895 --> 00:01:25,245
Da-gyo / It feels good being in the car though

30
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:28,925
Mi-rang / Right? I really wanted to drive around Jeju

31
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:32,165
Mi-rang / Honestly I didn’t even see the view yesterday

32
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,925
Da-gyo / Were you chatting while driving too?
Mi-rang / Yeah

33
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:35,325
Da-gyo / Seriously?

34
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:36,245
Mi-rang / I kept calming her down

35
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:38,175
Mi-rang / Like “Why are you crying?”

36
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:42,375
Mi-rang / Oh? Look a horse!

37
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:44,965
Da-gyo / I saw one coming and going

38
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:47,805
Mi-rang / Really? While on a date with someone else?

39
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:48,965
Da-gyo / No no no

40
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,045
Mi-rang / Then?

41
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:52,925
Da-gyo / I just saw it yesterday but I was alone

42
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:56,895
Da-gyo / Just saw it while riding in the car

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,607
Da-gyo / It was just there

44
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:01,695
Da-gyo / I mean if there’s a horse you can’t ignore it

45
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:02,685
Mi-rang / True

46
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:05,685
Da-gyo / So I just went, “Oh look a horse”

47
00:02:05,695 --> 00:02:09,125
Da-gyo / I saw it on the first day too, during check-in

48
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:11,095
Da-gyo / Coming and going... It’s Jeju after all

49
00:02:11,535 --> 00:02:13,925
Mi-rang / So I’m not the first person you saw a horse with

50
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:14,775
Da-gyo / What?!

51
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:18,175
Da-gyo / So I’m the second girl in this seat?

52
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,005
Da-gyo / Is the first horse that important?

53
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:24,085
Mi-rang / Oh right you’re the second

54
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:25,445
Da-gyo / Second girl in the passenger seat

55
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:28,045
Da-gyo / Is the first horse that big a deal?

56
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:30,615
Da-gyo / I need some air can you roll it down

57
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:32,445
Mi-rang / Sure sure

58
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:35,805
Mi-rang / Let’s get some fresh air while we drive

59
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:38,095
Da-gyo / But really it’s so pretty

60
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:43,055
Today’s perfect

61
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:50,565
Mi-rang / It’s so beautiful

62
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:53,335
Da-gyo / Me?

63
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:58,525
Mi-rang / I mean I’m getting shy

64
00:02:58,535 --> 00:03:01,525
Da-gyo / No I just feel like I’m kind of

65
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:03,455
Da-gyo / I think I look okay today

66
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:09,055
Mi-rang / You’ve got a new charm

67
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:10,645
Da-gyo / Do I?

68
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:15,445
Mi-rang / Yeah you’re pretty you’ve always been pretty

69
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:19,005
Mi-rang / I drove with Seo-yeon before right?

70
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:22,245
Mi-rang / But to be honest I really really wanted

71
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:25,245
Mi-rang / To go on this date with you Da-gyo

72
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,885
Mi-rang / I wanted to show you my driving

73
00:03:27,895 --> 00:03:30,895
Mi-rang / And maybe score some points with you

74
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:44,005
Da-gyo / Wow

75
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:44,485
Mi-rang / What?

76
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:46,815
Da-gyo / The view ahead is wide open it’s so pretty

77
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,445
Da-gyo / The weather is amazing

78
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:50,485
Mi-rang / Whoa

79
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:51,975
Da-gyo / Right this is what we came for

80
00:03:52,735 --> 00:03:54,605
Da-gyo / This isn’t the time for photos

81
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:55,485
Mi-rang / It’s so good

82
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:58,045
Da-gyo / This is exactly why we came up here

83
00:03:58,055 --> 00:04:01,775
Mi-rang / Wanna have a photo battle? See who takes better pics?

84
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,205
Da-gyo / I’m not confident in my photography

85
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:09,205
Mi-rang / I’ll take your back view then

86
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:11,725
Da-gyo / How about the side view?

87
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:14,255
Da-gyo / Do I look pretty in it?

88
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:20,365
Mi-rang / She was the one I really wanted to go on a date with

89
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:24,215
Mi-rang / And being in a new place together

90
00:04:24,455 --> 00:04:29,045
Mi-rang / We built different memories than anyone else and I loved that

91
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,365
Mi-rang / Let’s go

92
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,605
Mi-rang / But I’m wearing heels so it’s kinda hard to go down

93
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:36,085
Mi-rang / Isn’t this path easier?

94
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:38,095
Da-gyo / I think this one’s bumpier though

95
00:04:42,775 --> 00:04:45,525
Da-gyo / I wore heels to look pretty

96
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,495
Mi-rang / I know

97
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:54,125
Mi-rang / This is fun I like outdoor dates

98
00:04:54,135 --> 00:04:56,045
Mi-rang / Are you playful?

99
00:04:56,055 --> 00:04:57,365
Mi-rang / Like do you joke a lot?

100
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,005
Da-gyo / Not really I don’t think so

101
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:01,485
Mi-rang / How do you express it when you like someone?

102
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:02,525
Mi-rang / Do you make it obvious?

103
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:05,005
Da-gyo / I just say it

104
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:10,045
Mi-rang / Oh not like flirting—just straight-up?

105
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:12,375
Da-gyo / That kind of thing is a skill I can't just teach you

106
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:15,045
Mi-rang / Oh it's a skill?

107
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:16,205
Mi-rang / You’re sly

108
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,085
Mi-rang / That’s how I got lured in...

109
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:19,925
Mi-rang / That’s how I got lured in...

110
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:22,205
Da-gyo / That’s something you need to figure out yourself

111
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:24,055
Mi-rang / But honestly, you weren’t flirting with me, right?

112
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:27,725
Da-gyo / Why do you think that?

113
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:31,495
Mi-rang / You... You... were, right?

114
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:32,855
Da-gyo / I don’t know

115
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,285
Mi-rang / All the things I thought were cute

116
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,885
Mi-rang / Were those all flirting?

117
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:39,845
Da-gyo / Could be

118
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:41,965
Mi-rang / You do have a cute side~

119
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:45,005
Mi-rang / But I really feel this way

120
00:05:45,015 --> 00:05:49,685
Mi-rang / If someone just keeps being cute to me

121
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,245
Mi-rang / That’s the best

122
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,085
Da-gyo / If you fall for cuteness, there’s no way out

123
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:56,685
Mi-rang / Have you ever dated someone cute?

124
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:59,925
Da-gyo / I dunno~

125
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,295
Mi-rang / You're dodging the question well

126
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:05,125
Da-gyo / You said everyone you dated

127
00:06:05,135 --> 00:06:06,845
Da-gyo / Was kind of different from each other?

128
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:10,095
Mi-rang / Yeah but all my friends say the same thing

129
00:06:11,815 --> 00:06:12,455
Mi-rang / There’s this one thing

130
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:15,838
Da-gyo / I mean I revealed a secret yesterday

131
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,810
Da-gyo / The reason for keeping it a secret

132
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:20,365
Da-gyo / Even if someone’s interested in me

133
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,205
Da-gyo / I have such a strong ideal type

134
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,245
Da-gyo / They might not approach me

135
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,805
Mi-rang / Oh you’re right

136
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:27,605
Da-gyo / Even if they like me

137
00:06:27,615 --> 00:06:29,525
Da-gyo / If I don’t look like their type

138
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:32,405
Da-gyo / They might think “Da-gyo only goes for that kind of person”

139
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:33,565
Da-gyo / That could happen

140
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:34,485
Mi-rang / True

141
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,775
Da-gyo / After I said it, you looked so my style

142
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:43,125
Da-gyo / That’s why it was so funny saying it out loud

143
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:45,405
Da-gyo / I meant to keep it secret

144
00:06:45,415 --> 00:06:51,285
Da-gyo / But now I’m saying it with even more certainty about my ideal type

145
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,525
Da-gyo / I just can’t help it

146
00:06:53,535 --> 00:06:55,005
Mi-rang / I kept thinking, “Why is that a secret?”

147
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,285
Mi-rang / I really thought that a lot

148
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:57,245
Mi-rang / Maybe others thought the same...
Da-gyo / What did you expect?

149
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:58,245
Mi-rang / I didn’t try to guess...

150
00:06:58,255 --> 00:07:00,085
Mi-rang / I just thought I’d ask you

151
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,285
Mi-rang / That was my plan

152
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,725
Mi-rang / But now that you’ve told me?

153
00:07:02,735 --> 00:07:04,925
Mi-rang / I get why you kept it a secret

154
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:07,335
Mi-rang / It makes total sense now

155
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:12,685
Mi-rang / I was honestly really curious

156
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:13,685
Mi-rang / What kind of style you like

157
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:15,325
Mi-rang / We all had to keep quiet

158
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:16,325
Mi-rang / But I was most curious about yours

159
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,015
Mi-rang / “Who would she go for?”

160
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:21,565
Mi-rang / Because you said you had interest in two people

161
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,205
Mi-rang / When I heard that I was like...

162
00:07:23,215 --> 00:07:27,165
Mi-rang / One had short hair and the other had long hair

163
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:29,045
Da-gyo / But that doesn’t matter

164
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:31,525
Mi-rang / So I was like “Huh? What’s going on?”

165
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,365
Da-gyo / When did you cut your hair?

166
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,045
Mi-rang / When I was 23

167
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:35,045
Da-gyo / 23?

168
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:36,285
Da-gyo / I’m curious

169
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:38,015
Mi-rang / About my long hair?

170
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:41,125
Mi-rang / I got told I looked pretty with it a lot

171
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:44,375
Da-gyo / I figured you would

172
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:53,295
Da-gyo / What is this?

173
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:57,685
Da-gyo / What do you think it is?

174
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:02,005
Mi-rang / No it's too... too...

175
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,245
Mi-rang / I have no idea what to expect

176
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:07,645
Mi-rang / What if other couples are there too?

177
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:11,495
Da-gyo / I don’t know we’ll see...

178
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:13,015
What the?

179
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:48,125
Da-gyo / Huh? What’s this?

180
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:49,935
Da-gyo / Whoa no way!

181
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:06,135
Da-gyo / Today... Today... um...

182
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:09,335
Mi-rang / Cozy night?

183
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:12,965
Da-gyo / I wasn’t expecting to stay out

184
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:15,445
Mi-rang / I had no idea that’s what it meant either

185
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,095
Da-gyo / It’s just...

186
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:23,135
Da-gyo / I’m so surprised I’m speechless

187
00:09:26,615 --> 00:09:27,655
Mi-rang / Cozy night?

188
00:09:31,575 --> 00:09:33,445
Da-gyo / Let’s sit down first

189
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:38,485
Da-gyo / The note on the table said

190
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:43,965
Da-gyo / “A cozy night for two, twice the happiness?”

191
00:09:43,975 --> 00:09:45,525
Da-gyo / That’s literally what it said

192
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:48,405
Da-gyo / The wording was so suggestive

193
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:51,045
Da-gyo / I was like “Is this okay?”

194
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:54,885
Mi-rang / I do like going out, but

195
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,365
Mi-rang / When you’re home with your partner

196
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,525
Mi-rang / You don’t have to worry about people staring

197
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:02,845
Mi-rang / You can do more things, so I actually

198
00:10:02,855 --> 00:10:05,205
Mi-rang / Prefer home dates too

199
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:07,485
Da-gyo / This place is spacious

200
00:10:07,495 --> 00:10:09,325
Mi-rang / There’s another room in the back

201
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:11,415
Mi-rang / Should we check that room first?

202
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:19,295
Mi-rang / Oh we're sleeping here?

203
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,495
Da-gyo / This is a bit...

204
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,485
Da-gyo / We can’t do this(?)

205
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,085
Da-gyo / I really didn’t expect this at all

206
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,325
Da-gyo / I thought we'd definitely go back to the house

207
00:10:30,335 --> 00:10:32,765
Da-gyo / I never imagined we’d get

208
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:34,365
Da-gyo / A whole day alone like this

209
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,135
Da-gyo / So I was just really surprised

210
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:51,485
Mi-rang / Do you think the double means

211
00:10:51,495 --> 00:10:54,325
Mi-rang / There are two bathrooms here

212
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,965
Mi-rang / So maybe later on...

213
00:10:55,975 --> 00:10:58,215
Mi-rang / Other couples might show up?

214
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:00,205
Da-gyo / It says right here

215
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:04,765
Da-gyo / “Just the two of you at your own private lodging”

216
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:08,615
Da-gyo / What am I even supposed to do?

217
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,445
Mi-rang / Oh?! There's a projector too

218
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:13,415
Da-gyo / What else is in here?

219
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:18,455
Mi-rang / This looks fun

220
00:11:25,295 --> 00:11:28,525
Mi-rang / Let’s skip the “Day 1” stuff since we can’t do that

221
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:31,125
Da-gyo / Just the things we can do
Mi-rang / Just what we can do

222
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:32,525
Da-gyo / Yeah yeah

223
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:35,125
Mi-rang / We’re not even dating yet

224
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:39,095
Mi-rang / So let’s skip the tricky questions

225
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:40,735
Mi-rang / Physical affection?

226
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:43,975
Da-gyo / No like this part is...

227
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,365
Mi-rang / I'm gonna fill it in

228
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:53,245
Da-gyo / We’re supposed to answer based on the other person, right?

229
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:55,125
Da-gyo / Oh and I have to write this?

230
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:57,695
Da-gyo / My hand’s shaking too much to write

231
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:12,325
Mi-rang / What did you write?

232
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:14,375
Da-gyo / I chose all of them

233
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:18,765
Mi-rang / Seriously

234
00:12:18,775 --> 00:12:19,285
Da-gyo / What?

235
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:19,885
Mi-rang / That’s bold

236
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:21,668
Da-gyo / Isn’t it obvious though?

237
00:12:21,678 --> 00:12:24,243
Da-gyo / All

238
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:31,015
Mi-rang / I said “Anything if she wants it”

239
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,085
Da-gyo / This is hilarious

240
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:38,255
Mi-rang / I’m seriously so embarrassed

241
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:40,765
Da-gyo / I’m just hot...

242
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:43,295
Da-gyo / I'm just endlessly embarrassed right now

243
00:12:43,855 --> 00:12:46,015
Da-gyo / Every one of these moments

244
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,215
Mi-rang / It's in moments like this I get butterflies for you

245
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:57,495
Mi-rang / Wait you didn’t turn on the vibration or anything, right?

246
00:13:08,015 --> 00:13:08,725
Mi-rang / Done?

247
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,605
Da-gyo / Yeah

248
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:11,775
Da-gyo / I like that you don’t confuse me

249
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:16,685
Da-gyo / “I like that you don’t make me feel uncertain”

250
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:18,685
Mi-rang / When you wrote that

251
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:22,908
Mi-rang / It made me feel good, I was thankful

252
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:25,325
Mi-rang / Every morning I see you I feel like you're too pretty

253
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:28,565
Mi-rang / When you gently touch me twice

254
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,725
Mi-rang / You were flirting with me weren’t you?

255
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:31,925
Da-gyo / Yeah that was flirting

256
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:35,405
Mi-rang / Oh really?

257
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,095
Mi-rang / I knew it

258
00:13:37,335 --> 00:13:40,275
Da-gyo / That was flirting

259
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,895
Da-gyo / I’m a conservative woman

260
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:51,325
Da-gyo / What else was there?

261
00:13:51,335 --> 00:13:52,885
Mi-rang / Oh let’s try this one

262
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:58,325
Mi-rang / How would you relieve your partner’s stress?

263
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:01,125
Mi-rang / Show up and be empathetic

264
00:14:01,135 --> 00:14:02,885
Da-gyo / Be empathetic and say “Let’s meet”

265
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:04,005
Da-gyo / Kinda similar?

266
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:07,085
Mi-rang / So we’d have to meet every time we’re stressed...

267
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:09,845
Da-gyo / Right seeing each other when stressed is the best

268
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:11,565
Mi-rang / Yeah when I see your face

269
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:13,055
Mi-rang / My stress just melts away

270
00:14:13,575 --> 00:14:15,445
Da-gyo / I don’t get tired

271
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:16,765
Mi-rang / Same

272
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:19,525
Mi-rang / (Let’s say) I got stressed because of my partner

273
00:14:19,535 --> 00:14:21,725
Da-gyo / Like what?

274
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,085
Mi-rang / Honestly I lied to you

275
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:26,165
Mi-rang / I'm actually out drinking right now

276
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:27,685
Da-gyo / You’re crazy

277
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:29,245
Mi-rang / So would you come see me?

278
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:30,325
Da-gyo / No way!

279
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:30,965
Mi-rang / Then?

280
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:33,685
Da-gyo / I’d just let you be and do your thing

281
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:35,405
Da-gyo / Let you party and I’ll just go to bed

282
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:37,805
Mi-rang / Sleep? You wouldn't even say anything?

283
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:38,925
Da-gyo / I’d sleep and talk to you the next day

284
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:40,815
Da-gyo / Once I’ve sobered up

285
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:44,565
Da-gyo / Arguing drunk is totally pointless

286
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:48,405
Da-gyo / I’d wait until I wake up and then tell you off

287
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:51,285
Da-gyo / But I seriously hate lying the most

288
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:52,605
Mi-rang / Lying?

289
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:54,005
Da-gyo / If you actually did that

290
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:54,885
Da-gyo / What would you do?

291
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,485
Mi-rang / I think I’d go find you

292
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,005
Da-gyo / Seriously?! You’d go there?

293
00:14:59,015 --> 00:14:59,965
Mi-rang / If it’s within reach...

294
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:00,765
Da-gyo / That’s scary

295
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,165
Mi-rang / If it’s a distance I can manage I think I’d go

296
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:05,685
Mi-rang / But first I’d send them home

297
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:07,965
Da-gyo / Really?

298
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:08,845
Mi-rang / I’d send them home

299
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:11,725
Mi-rang / And then the next day I’d scold them hard

300
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:13,685
Mi-rang / “Were you out of your mind yesterday?”

301
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:16,325
Mi-rang / You get exactly three chances

302
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:19,085
Da-gyo / I just irresponsibly said “I’m not going!”

303
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:21,855
Da-gyo / But you said you’d go right away

304
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:25,165
Mi-rang / There were questions I’ve always been curious about

305
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:30,245
Mi-rang / So this was a chance to get to know Da-gyo better

306
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:32,325
Mi-rang / And this…

307
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:34,365
Mi-rang / If we do end up dating

308
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,765
Mi-rang / We should fill out the rest

309
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:39,565
Mi-rang / And exchange it with each other

310
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:41,045
Mi-rang / If we end up dating

311
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,685
Mi-rang / If you choose me

312
00:15:42,695 --> 00:15:44,125
Mi-rang / Anyway...

313
00:15:44,135 --> 00:15:44,725
Da-gyo / Got it got it

314
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,925
Mi-rang / You never know until the end

315
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:49,045
Mi-rang / Don’t think I’m a fish you already caught, okay?

316
00:15:49,055 --> 00:15:51,885
Da-gyo / I don’t think that

317
00:15:51,895 --> 00:15:55,245
Da-gyo / You think that just because I called you yesterday...

318
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,165
Da-gyo / Who knows~

319
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:57,135
Mi-rang / Where are you going?

320
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:58,565
Mi-rang / Going to eat tangerines?

321
00:15:58,575 --> 00:15:59,765
Da-gyo / Yup

322
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:01,335
Da-gyo / I’m going to eat some

323
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:06,485
Ri-won / Hey, let’s eat, us leftovers!

324
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:07,765
Hee-young / Don’t say that!

325
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:09,655
Ri-won / I’m a leftover too

326
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:13,445
Ri-won / Ugh... it's over

327
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:15,165
Seo-yeon / Should we cook the pork belly?

328
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,655
Ri-won / Yeah I want to eat this one

329
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,006
Ri-won / I just thought, let’s at least eat something filling!

330
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,407
Ri-won / That was kind of the idea

331
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,520
Ri-won / Eating something tasty always lifts your mood

332
00:16:28,622 --> 00:16:30,732
Hee-young / Should I grill the meat?

333
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:31,372
Ri-won / Will you? I bet it’ll taste better if you do it
 

334
00:16:31,382 --> 00:16:33,212
Ri-won / Will you? I bet it’ll taste better if you do it
Hee-young / We don’t have tongs

335
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:33,852
Hee-young / I’m good at grilling though

336
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:36,462
Ri-won / We didn’t have tongs so I’ve been using this

337
00:16:37,462 --> 00:16:41,572
Hee-young / Honestly, everyone here made me feel really comfortable

338
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:45,652
Hee-young / And that comfort means the most to me right now

339
00:16:45,662 --> 00:16:48,092
Hee-young / And Min-woo yesterday really showed

340
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:49,772
Hee-young / How firm her thoughts are

341
00:16:49,782 --> 00:16:53,172
Hee-young / And it came off as really cool

342
00:16:53,182 --> 00:16:58,652
Ri-won / I think I need to talk to her today

343
00:16:58,662 --> 00:17:01,212
Min-woo / Living together with Hee-young

344
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:03,452
Min-woo / I did want to build a connection

345
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:05,452
Min-woo / We both lean a little introverted

346
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:08,852
Min-woo / And I’m the kind of person who tries to make others comfortable indirectly

347
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,812
Min-woo / I’m not the type to suddenly go all-in directly

348
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,922
Min-woo / So staying at the house felt right

349
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,893
Ri-won / The weather was so nice yesterday too

350
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,862
Seo-yeon / It’s the perfect weather for a date

351
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,831
Ri-won / What kind of date do you think they’re on today?
Hee-young / Hm?

352
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,433
Min-woo / I mean, those who went out

353
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,502
Min-woo / They’re probably on an actual date, right?

354
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,471
Ri-won / The thing yesterday—it wasn’t a note but a phone call

355
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,883
Ri-won / Did anyone know in advance?

356
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,274
Hee-young / How would anyone know that?

357
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,042
Ri-won / I knew!

358
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,619
Hee-young / What! How?

359
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,745
Ri-won / So basically

360
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:40,826
Ri-won / Han-kyul got a call from Jin-ah

361
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,018
Ri-won / And then Han-kyul

362
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,420
Ri-won / Was so caught off guard

363
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,999
Ri-won / She was like, “How did you get this number?”

364
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,291
Ri-won / That’s what she asked

365
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:49,858
Ri-won / And then Jin-ah

366
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,493
Ri-won / I don’t know exactly what she said

367
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,596
Ri-won / But Han-kyul said, “I wanted to say the same thing too”

368
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,999
Ri-won / And then she hung up

369
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,368
Ri-won / Because it was a short call, I thought

370
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,870
Ri-won / “Wait, was that a phone call? Not a note today?”

371
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,206
Ri-won / So I kind of figured it out early

372
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,308
Ri-won / “Ah, it’s a phone call today”

373
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:08,110
Ri-won / That’s why I wasn’t as surprised

374
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,389
Ri-won / But for everyone else, it must’ve been a shock

375
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,281
Ri-won / Because it was a call

376
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,849
Seo-yeon / Yeah, it was pretty surprising

377
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,284
Min-woo / But once you hear the voice, it’s clear

378
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,485
Min-woo / So I actually like it

379
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,697
Ri-won / For me, the phone call was harder

380
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,667
Min-woo / Really?
Hee-young / Why?

381
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:26,305
Ri-won / Because you’re interacting in real time

382
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,341
Seo-yeon / A call definitely feels more direct

383
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,938
Hee-young / That’s so sad...

384
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,973
Hee-young / I got chills

385
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:41,176
Ri-won / Han-kyul thought I kept voting for her

386
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,311
Ri-won / Because I didn’t want her to get zero votes

387
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,346
Ri-won / That’s what she assumed

388
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,447
Hee-young / She really thought that?

389
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,748
Ri-won / Yeah, and then

390
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:50,552
Ri-won / She told me, “If there’s someone else you want to write to”

391
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,888
Ri-won / “You don’t have to worry about me”

392
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,723
Ri-won / And starting today

393
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,225
Ri-won / She said to write a note to the person I actually like

394
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,126
Ri-won / So in my head

395
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,795
Ri-won / I was like, “Okay, then I’ll keep writing to Han-kyul”

396
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,908
Ri-won / That’s what I thought, but since it’s a call this time

397
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:07,102
Ri-won / I was worried she might be flustered or feel bad

398
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,437
Ri-won / That’s why I was hesitant

399
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,306
Ri-won / The phone call was definitely harder

400
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,543
Hee-young / But have you ever seriously told her how you feel?

401
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,078
Hee-young / Like, “I don’t feel that way out of pity”

402
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,746
Hee-young / “I truly mean it when I treat you this way”?

403
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:21,283
Ri-won / I kind of… I did talk to her a bit yesterday

404
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,051
Ri-won / But I don’t know

405
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,987
Hee-young / Like what...

406
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,265
Ri-won / She seems frustrated

407
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,462
Hee-young / Ugh… That breaks my heart

408
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:37,342
Hee-young / You gave her so much genuine

409
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:42,604
Hee-young / Care and love so sincerely

410
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,207
Hee-young / Before I fully understood it

411
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,676
Hee-young / I just thought, “Oh, she must’ve been sad”

412
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:53,515
Hee-young / But once I felt how real that was, it hit me too

413
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,250
Hee-young / And I got sad with you

414
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,053
Seo-yeon / So how did you feel when you found out Han-kyul’s age yesterday?

415
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,322
Ri-won / I was surprised—she’s younger than I thought

416
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:04,126
Ri-won / But it didn’t really change my feelings

417
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,261
Ri-won / Turns out Han-kyul

418
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,732
Ri-won / Thought I looked really young just by appearance

419
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:14,012
Ri-won / I was more worried she’d be shocked when she found out

420
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,339
Hee-young / You're seriously such a sweetheart

421
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,107
Ri-won / And after I told her my age

422
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,819
Ri-won / She suddenly started using formal speech again

423
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,712
Hee-young / Yeah, yeah, I noticed that too

424
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,014
Min-woo / But it wasn’t just about revealing age

425
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:27,516
Min-woo / There were other things behind it too

426
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,819
Min-woo / And I liked that those reasons really showed her personality

427
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,223
Min-woo / So I think I’ve kind of figured out

428
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,492
Min-woo / What I want to do going forward

429
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,695
Min-woo / Actually not kind of—almost completely

430
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,331
Ri-won / Wait, does that mean there’s someone you like?

431
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,500
Min-woo / Yup!

432
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,337
Ri-won / I’m so happy, I’m really happy

433
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,583
Min-woo / You are?
Ri-won / Yeah, I think it’s going to be fun to watch

434
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:54,686
Ri-won / I love it

435
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,023
Min-woo / You do?

436
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,458
Ri-won / Yeah

437
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,261
Ri-won / What? Is it Han-kyul?

438
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,554
Hee-young / Why did that suddenly get scary?

439
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,832
Min-woo / I mean, Han-kyul is really pretty

440
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,836
Min-woo / Just kidding
Ri-won / She is pretty, for real

441
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,629
Ri-won / Whoa, that scared me

442
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,130
Ri-won / I was surprised

443
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,341
Hee-young / That was hilarious

444
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:19,582
Min-woo / The person I felt most clear with was probably Seo-yeon

445
00:21:20,502 --> 00:21:21,652
Seo-yeon / Yeah I felt clear too but

446
00:21:21,662 --> 00:21:24,252
Seo-yeon / When I heard everyone else's stories

447
00:21:24,262 --> 00:21:26,612
Seo-yeon / I was honestly pretty shocked

448
00:21:26,622 --> 00:21:29,212
Seo-yeon / Like they’ve been deep thinkers all along

449
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:29,892
Seo-yeon / But I misunderstood

450
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:31,462
Seo-yeon / That’s on me

451
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:36,302
Seo-yeon / Now I get where they were coming from...

452
00:21:36,822 --> 00:21:39,452
Seo-yeon / A lot of my confusion got cleared up

453
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:41,252
Seo-yeon / So it ended up being a really meaningful time

454
00:21:41,262 --> 00:21:43,902
Hee-young / You were honestly the most misunderstood...

455
00:21:45,422 --> 00:21:48,772
Min-woo / I still can’t get used to calling you “you”

456
00:21:48,782 --> 00:21:50,852
Hee-young / Why? Because we’re the same age?

457
00:21:50,862 --> 00:21:53,132
Min-woo / You still feel like unnie...

458
00:21:53,142 --> 00:21:55,412
Min-woo / You look younger though

459
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:56,852
Seo-yeon / Yeah totally

460
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:59,972
Min-woo / I keep forgetting and then remembering again

461
00:21:59,982 --> 00:22:01,172
Min-woo / Why do I keep forgetting?

462
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:03,052
Hee-young / Because you don’t care

463
00:22:03,062 --> 00:22:04,412
Min-woo / That’s not it

464
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:05,542
Hee-young / It is, because you don’t care

465
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:10,319
Ri-won / I kind of felt like Min-woo and Hee-young

466
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,555
Ri-won / Had some kind of connection going on

467
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:16,458
Ri-won / And I think that was kind of interesting to me

468
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:19,861
Ri-won / Like their back-and-forth seems to really click

469
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,229
Ri-won / That’s what I thought at least

470
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,009
Ri-won / But today I think I felt it more clearly

471
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,069
Hee-young / Thanks

472
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:41,109
Min-woo / It’s far, that’s why

473
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,389
Min-woo / Your arms are short, thought it’d be hard for you

474
00:22:44,399 --> 00:22:46,159
Min-woo / So I helped out

475
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:52,189
Min-woo / Actually, there’s a reason I wore an off-shoulder top today

476
00:22:52,199 --> 00:22:54,309
Min-woo / You have a moon on your shoulder too

477
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,229
Min-woo / I wanted us to both show it

478
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,789
Min-woo / I don’t think Hee-young would ever

479
00:22:57,799 --> 00:22:59,349
Min-woo / Get a tattoo for no reason

480
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,829
Min-woo / She doesn’t seem like someone who’d mark herself without meaning

481
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,589
Min-woo / So by showing my moon too

482
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,749
Min-woo / I wanted to create some kind of visual connection

483
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:11,079
Min-woo / To build some sort of bond

484
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,199
Min-woo / And naturally ease my way in

485
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:24,759
Min-woo / Let’s talk Hee-young, let’s go out

486
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:29,069
Seo-yeon / Have a good talk

487
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:29,829
Ri-won / What the?

488
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:32,069
Hee-young / We’re going to talk

489
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,949
Ri-won / But you said you’d make kimchi stew

490
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:34,949
Seo-yeon / Make it after you get back

491
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:36,509
Ri-won / Okay go

492
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,069
Min-woo / It’s cold out...

493
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,709
Min-woo / I think Hee-young already knew

494
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:43,629
Min-woo / That I had feelings for her

495
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:47,509
Min-woo / And I was curious how she felt about that

496
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,989
Min-woo / I also wanted to know what happened with Jin-ah

497
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:53,389
Min-woo / I’d heard her side of the story

498
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:58,799
Min-woo / But I wanted to hear a bit directly from Hee-young too

499
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:03,029
Min-woo / We just didn’t have enough time

500
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,909
Min-woo / So I wanted to talk

501
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:06,669
Min-woo / She looked drained

502
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,749
Min-woo / But I didn’t want to be

503
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,949
Min-woo / Just another burden to her
 

504
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:13,069
Min-woo / Just another burden to her
Hee-young / What do you mean?

505
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,199
Min-woo / I just wanted you to get some real rest first

506
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,109
Min-woo / Then if you had questions or thoughts

507
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:24,279
Min-woo / We could talk when you're ready

508
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:28,189
Hee-young / Okay!

509
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:30,429
Hee-young / I thought, "This is something I needed to do eventually"

510
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:31,869
Hee-young / That’s what came to mind

511
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:33,589
Hee-young / I was grateful that you had the courage

512
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,759
Hee-young / To ask me to go out and get some fresh air

513
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:46,919
Hee-young / Maybe I’ll get to see a different side of Min-woo

514
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,519
Hee-young / Thanks!

515
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:55,989
Min-woo / Oh wow

516
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,959
Hee-young / What is this?

517
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:04,709
Min-woo / Mmm~

518
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:05,309
Min-woo / Is it good?

519
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,759
Hee-young / Yeah

520
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:13,669
Hee-young / I don’t know what it is

521
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,669
Hee-young / I don’t know what it is but it tastes good

522
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,599
Min-woo / Your face totally gives it away

523
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:25,719
Hee-young / I’m really bad at lying

524
00:25:28,719 --> 00:25:31,629
Min-woo / Well it’s not like I ever had the chance to say anything

525
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:33,069
Hee-young / True

526
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:35,789
Min-woo / About your feelings and all that

527
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,629
Min-woo / Honestly, I didn’t want to make you feel pressured

528
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:41,589
Min-woo / That’s not something that works by force

529
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:43,869
Min-woo / But I was curious

530
00:25:43,879 --> 00:25:46,629
Min-woo / About whether things really ended with Jin-ah

531
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:50,079
Min-woo / And if so, what the biggest reason was—if you can share

532
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,785
Min-woo / I want to understand what you like and dislike

533
00:25:56,719 --> 00:25:58,309
Hee-young / With Jin-ah

534
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,469
Hee-young / We talked about serious things… very future-oriented

535
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,309
Hee-young / That kind of stuff

536
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,239
Hee-young / That’s actually a really important topic for me

537
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:08,509
Hee-young / So I was curious about what her thoughts were

538
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:09,879
Hee-young / I just wanted to hear her out

539
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:12,629
Hee-young / But when we went on our first date

540
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,439
Hee-young / I felt like our pace didn’t really match

541
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:18,829
Hee-young / I think actions matter more than words

542
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:22,509
Hee-young / And her actions didn’t line up with what she said

543
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:24,029
Hee-young / She kept not choosing me

544
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,119
Hee-young / But still kept saying she liked me

545
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:29,909
Hee-young / For me, there was never a second option

546
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,229
Hee-young / It wasn’t like I was head over heels or anything

547
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:34,749
Hee-young / It was just that

548
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,909
Hee-young / Coming here, I felt that way

549
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:42,749
Min-woo / Hearing it directly was really shocking and surprising

550
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,149
Min-woo / I didn’t expect it

551
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,309
Min-woo / I realized we just had different perspectives

552
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,109
Min-woo / It wasn’t intentional or anything

553
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,109
Min-woo / Just a personality difference

554
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:55,069
Min-woo / I ended up rooming with Seo-yeon, right?

555
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:55,869
Min-woo / So I thought

556
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:58,559
Min-woo / That Seo-yeon might be interested in you

557
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,810
Hee-young / Not me

558
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,779
Min-woo / Because

559
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:06,721
Min-woo / I don’t think she’d call someone she’s just supporting

560
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,683
Min-woo / I don’t think she would’ve done it without a reason

561
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,886
Hee-young / She said she first realized her orientation

562
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:12,808
Hee-young / in 12th grade

563
00:27:12,785 --> 00:27:14,343
Hee-young / And I was in 12th grade too

564
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,691
Hee-young / But we lived such different lives

565
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:20,115
Hee-young / I’ve also been through a lot and struggled

566
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:22,648
Hee-young / But she said she had no one to talk to about it

567
00:27:22,627 --> 00:27:24,148
Hee-young / She went through all of it alone

568
00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:26,321
Hee-young / And that made me want to support her

569
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:28,708
Hee-young / That was the biggest reason

570
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,381
Hee-young / Of course I was torn at the time too

571
00:27:30,386 --> 00:27:35,642
Hee-young / And told me how you felt

572
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:39,022
Hee-young / I was really grateful but

573
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:41,906
Hee-young / I thought calling someone is different from just being thankful

574
00:27:41,882 --> 00:27:44,079
Min-woo / That’s why I liked it

575
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:46,275
Min-woo / I realized you’re not someone who sends messages

576
00:27:46,252 --> 00:27:48,284
Min-woo / Out of guilt or simple gratitude

577
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:51,396
Hee-young / I could never do that

578
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:53,989
Min-woo / So I was relieved too

579
00:27:53,999 --> 00:27:56,946
Min-woo / If you’d only messaged me out of gratitude

580
00:27:56,965 --> 00:27:59,226
Min-woo / I think I’d have been really confused

581
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:03,468
Hee-young / Oh… so that’s how you felt

582
00:28:03,471 --> 00:28:04,605
Hee-young / That’s nice

583
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:11,881
Hee-young / It feels like you really saw me for who I am

584
00:28:11,885 --> 00:28:17,135
Min-woo / Honestly, if I don’t relate to something deeply

585
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:20,266
Min-woo / I have a hard time empathizing

586
00:28:20,904 --> 00:28:23,098
Min-woo / But when I like someone

587
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:25,629
Min-woo / Empathy becomes the foundation

588
00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:28,131
Min-woo / And first of all, she’s really curious and tries hard to understand

589
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:30,307
Min-woo / Why they said what they did

590
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:34,721
Min-woo / Why they called someone, what they were feeling

591
00:28:34,744 --> 00:28:37,393
Min-woo / What they like and dislike

592
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:40,892
Min-woo / But I just never got the chance to ask

593
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:42,711
Min-woo / I’ve always wanted to know

594
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:45,525
Hee-young / You were curious about me?

595
00:28:46,005 --> 00:28:49,147
Min-woo / I always was

596
00:28:50,265 --> 00:28:52,823
Hee-young / Thank you

597
00:28:52,833 --> 00:28:56,333
Min-woo / So... um...

598
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:02,432
Min-woo / So...

599
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,106
Hee-young / Hm?

600
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:16,267
Min-woo / Something got in my eye

601
00:29:16,285 --> 00:29:17,408
Hee-young / Are you okay?

602
00:29:17,418 --> 00:29:19,873
Min-woo / Me? Yeah

603
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:21,009
Hee-young / Did something happen?

604
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:22,139
Min-woo / Me?

605
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:25,038
Min-woo / I’m usually not good at expressing myself

606
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:28,752
Min-woo / If we don’t set time like this to talk

607
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:32,612
Min-woo / It'll suddenly be the final decision day

608
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:33,558
Min-woo / That’s what it felt like

609
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:39,560
Min-woo / That’d make all my efforts feel wasted

610
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:43,619
Min-woo / That’s how I felt...

611
00:29:44,085 --> 00:29:47,167
Hee-young / All that time I didn’t know...

612
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,042
Hee-young / You were thinking about me

613
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:53,499
Hee-young / And trying to make me feel comfortable

614
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:55,049
Hee-young / All those unseen efforts

615
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,279
Min-woo / Yeah

616
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,151
Hee-young / I really had no idea

617
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:03,425
Hee-young / That you had your own way of doing things

618
00:30:04,518 --> 00:30:06,719
Min-woo / I thought there were lots of people like me

619
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:09,851
Min-woo / But turns out if I don’t speak, no one really knows

620
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:12,485
Min-woo / It’s really hard to show or say how I feel

621
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:15,456
Min-woo / But here, if you don’t make it obvious

622
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:16,535
Hee-young / No one notices here if you don’t show it
 

623
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:19,137
Hee-young / No one notices here if you don’t show it
Min-woo / Yeah that’s what I think too

624
00:30:19,144 --> 00:30:22,113
Min-woo / That’s why I’m gathering up my courage to say it

625
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:30,216
Hee-young / You’re right, no one knows

626
00:30:30,226 --> 00:30:32,065
Hee-young / I just found out now

627
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:36,581
Hee-young / Before, when someone showed interest in subtle or direct ways

628
00:30:36,591 --> 00:30:37,958
Hee-young / I thought

629
00:30:37,964 --> 00:30:39,356
Hee-young / “Do they not take me seriously?”

630
00:30:39,366 --> 00:30:41,986
Hee-young / That’s the kind of feeling I used to get

631
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:46,070
Hee-young / But when someone expresses their feelings sincerely like this

632
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,912
Hee-young / I really do feel very thankful

633
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:52,341
Hee-young / And makes me think “People like this do exist”

634
00:30:52,405 --> 00:30:54,212
Hee-young / I think my feelings for him grew stronger

635
00:30:54,924 --> 00:30:57,050
Min-woo / I feel like we’ve gotten closer

636
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:00,307
Min-woo / Even if my way of expressing is kind of grumbly

637
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:01,816
Min-woo / When I said those things

638
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,704
Min-woo / Her eyes looked genuinely surprised

639
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,402
Min-woo / It made me think “Hee-young might actually be”

640
00:31:07,412 --> 00:31:09,658
Min-woo / “The most sensitive person here”

641
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:19,902
Da-gyo / It feels so nice right now because it’s warm

642
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,825
Mi-rang / Do you like summer or winter better?

643
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:23,505
Da-gyo / Summer

644
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:24,806
Mi-rang / Summer? Me too

645
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,095
Da-gyo / I don’t like winter

646
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:27,705
Mi-rang / I hate the cold

647
00:31:35,245 --> 00:31:36,402
Da-gyo / Whoa that scared me

648
00:31:36,412 --> 00:31:37,505
Mi-rang / Huh? What the?

649
00:31:45,318 --> 00:31:46,176
Da-gyo / Who are you?

650
00:31:46,186 --> 00:31:47,759
Mi-rang / Who are you? hahaha

651
00:31:48,485 --> 00:31:49,918
Mi-rang / What is this?

652
00:31:53,938 --> 00:31:55,939
Mi-rang / Huh? What is happening?

653
00:31:57,908 --> 00:31:59,261
Mi-rang / Who are you?

654
00:31:59,271 --> 00:32:02,300
Hello there~

655
00:32:07,037 --> 00:32:07,828
Da-gyo / Oh?! Hello

656
00:32:07,838 --> 00:32:10,352
Why is no one helping me?

657
00:32:10,358 --> 00:32:12,052
I’m carrying so much stuff right now

658
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:44,006
Da-gyo / I was really surprised

659
00:32:44,018 --> 00:32:46,452
Mi-rang / I totally didn’t expect it

660
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:47,883
Mi-rang / They just showed up suddenly

661
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:50,920
Mi-rang / And I thought “Ah, that’s why it’s a double date”

662
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:52,805
Mi-rang / That’s what I realized

663
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:55,786
Bi-bi / What were you doing?

664
00:32:58,005 --> 00:33:00,082
Mi-rang / No, seriously

665
00:33:00,092 --> 00:33:02,128
Mi-rang / I really didn’t know you all were coming

666
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:04,088
Da-gyo / Not at all

667
00:33:04,098 --> 00:33:05,389
Bi-bi / Surprise success

668
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,770
Mi-rang / We already know each other and—

669
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,832
Mi-rang / She’s this unnie’s girlfriend

670
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:11,476
Da-gyo / Ah right right

671
00:33:11,478 --> 00:33:14,395
Mi-mi / It’s been almost 10 years, hasn’t it?

672
00:33:14,405 --> 00:33:15,439
Bi-bi / That long?

673
00:33:15,444 --> 00:33:17,045
Mi-mi / Yeah it’s been forever

674
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:18,552
Mi-mi / I don’t know how they first met

675
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:22,433
Mi-rang / I think they might’ve met once through a mutual acquaintance

676
00:33:22,453 --> 00:33:24,388
Mi-rang / And since I had a shop...

677
00:33:25,578 --> 00:33:27,138
Bi-bi / Wow that’s a long time

678
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:29,283
Mi-mi / Or maybe not that long?

679
00:33:29,293 --> 00:33:32,587
Bi-bi / I was introduced when I met her

680
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:34,556
Mi-rang / I didn’t know from the start either

681
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:37,575
Bi-bi / I’d just say hi when I stopped by the shop sometimes

682
00:33:37,585 --> 00:33:40,738
Da-gyo / This is my first time hearing all this

683
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:43,058
Mi-rang / I didn’t expect you to come here

684
00:33:45,165 --> 00:33:46,328
Mi-mi / Are we interrupting?

685
00:33:46,338 --> 00:33:47,245
Da-gyo / No no

686
00:33:47,645 --> 00:33:50,599
Mi-mi / I was like “Why are we even here?”

687
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:54,142
Da-gyo / No way, I’m loving this

688
00:33:54,152 --> 00:33:58,446
Bi-bi / Actually, we have something to give you

689
00:34:00,358 --> 00:34:01,716
Da-gyo / go ahead...

690
00:34:01,726 --> 00:34:05,147
Da-gyo / There’s been so many surprises today

691
00:34:08,325 --> 00:34:10,755
Today’s date is a double date

692
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:15,040
Enjoy your double date with the Mi-mi & Bi-bi couple

693
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:19,734
Da-gyo / No wonder it felt like a lot

694
00:34:19,744 --> 00:34:21,503
Da-gyo / I was like “Why is this place so big?”

695
00:34:21,513 --> 00:34:23,515
Mi-mi / Their reaction’s way better than expected

696
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:28,276
Mi-rang / Should we go over the groceries we bought?

697
00:34:28,286 --> 00:34:30,812
Bi-bi / Should we check it out together and start cooking?

698
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:32,557
Mi-mi / I heard Mi-rang is a great cook

699
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:35,517
Mi-rang / Oh I’m actually not good...

700
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:39,730
Bi-bi / Let’s put on our aprons first

701
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:43,391
Mi-rang / Are we wearing aprons too?

702
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:46,661
Bi-bi / Yeah since we’re all cooking together

703
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:50,742
Bi-bi / Looks like someone’s about to step into something

704
00:34:50,842 --> 00:34:53,668
Da-gyo / I'll tie it in the back for you

705
00:34:53,678 --> 00:34:57,248
Da-gyo / Is this tight enough?

706
00:35:13,565 --> 00:35:16,101
Bi-bi / So here’s what we prepared

707
00:35:18,002 --> 00:35:19,894
Mi-mi / Let’s take everything out first

708
00:35:19,904 --> 00:35:21,696
Mi-mi / Help me out a bit here

709
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:23,508
Mi-mi / Don’t just stand there

710
00:35:23,675 --> 00:35:25,266
Da-gyo / You're too far away...

711
00:35:25,276 --> 00:35:27,102
Mi-rang / Don’t be scary

712
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:29,214
Mi-mi / Take it slow

713
00:35:29,881 --> 00:35:32,807
Mi-mi / We’ll make steak, then tomato pasta

714
00:35:32,817 --> 00:35:34,509
Mi-mi / And one more, canapés

715
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:37,112
Mi-mi / The easiest one is canapés so you can do that

716
00:35:37,122 --> 00:35:38,313
Mi-mi / I’ll show you how

717
00:35:38,323 --> 00:35:40,448
Mi-rang / Yes please teach me

718
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:44,485
Mi-rang / This feels fun like a cooking class

719
00:35:44,496 --> 00:35:48,290
Da-gyo / I was supposed to cook dinner today

720
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:49,958
Da-gyo / Guess we’re doing it here instead

721
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:52,002
Mi-rang / Oh right

722
00:35:52,003 --> 00:35:55,029
Mi-rang / Do you two usually cook at home?

723
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,099
Bi-bi / Pretty much all the time

724
00:35:58,109 --> 00:36:01,369
Mi-mi / I’m usually the one who cooks

725
00:36:01,379 --> 00:36:04,372
Mi-mi / Unnie doesn’t cook at all

726
00:36:04,382 --> 00:36:05,639
Bi-bi / It’s not that I don’t

727
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:07,085
Bi-bi / I’m just not good at it

728
00:36:08,787 --> 00:36:11,946
Bi-bi / So I handle the dishes and cleanup

729
00:36:11,956 --> 00:36:13,615
Mi-rang / But that’s important too

730
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,617
Da-gyo / Oh?! Then I can do that too

731
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:18,586
“What? Are you gonna live with me?”

732
00:36:18,596 --> 00:36:21,532
Mi-rang / Gotcha! Are you saying you’ll live with me?

733
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:24,669
Da-gyo / It was just a metaphor

734
00:36:24,903 --> 00:36:26,227
Mi-mi / On this one here

735
00:36:26,237 --> 00:36:28,006
Mi-mi / Put mayonnaise on one

736
00:36:28,206 --> 00:36:29,908
Mi-mi / And cream cheese on the other

737
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,406
Da-gyo / How many should we make?

738
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:42,176
Mi-rang / Let’s make a lot

739
00:36:42,186 --> 00:36:43,144
Da-gyo / How many is “a lot”?

740
00:36:43,154 --> 00:36:45,547
Mi-rang / I think I could eat a lot today

741
00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:46,925
Da-gyo / But you always eat a lot?

742
00:36:46,991 --> 00:36:49,250
Mi-rang / What are you talking about~

743
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,296
Da-gyo / Why are you acting like it’s new?

744
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:55,023
Bi-bi / You must be really hungry

745
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:57,302
Da-gyo / No, Mi-rang said to make a lot

746
00:36:58,136 --> 00:36:59,527
Bi-bi / She said “make a ton”?

747
00:36:59,537 --> 00:37:04,242
Da-gyo / Yeah she was like “Lots, we need lots no matter what”

748
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,979
Da-gyo / Mi-rang eats really well...

749
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:09,504
Mi-rang / I don’t have to eat it?

750
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:21,583
Mi-rang / I think a bit of onion would be good

751
00:37:21,593 --> 00:37:23,618
Da-gyo / You want to put onion in here?

752
00:37:23,628 --> 00:37:24,285
Mi-rang / Should we try one?

753
00:37:24,295 --> 00:37:26,164
Da-gyo / Yeah you eat it unnie

754
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:29,133
Mi-rang / Come on I’ll make one for you

755
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:32,370
Da-gyo / No it’s not that just...

756
00:37:32,637 --> 00:37:33,761
Mi-rang / You don’t trust me?

757
00:37:33,771 --> 00:37:37,264
Da-gyo / No I’m fine with onion actually

758
00:37:37,274 --> 00:37:40,068
Mi-rang / Just try one with onion, seriously

759
00:37:40,078 --> 00:37:42,246
Mi-rang / Just once, please

760
00:37:48,286 --> 00:37:50,188
Mi-rang / It’s good right? Not bad?

761
00:37:57,595 --> 00:38:00,732
Da-gyo / I usually don’t like raw onions

762
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:03,401
Mi-rang / Why didn’t you say something?

763
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,705
Da-gyo / I only ate it because you gave it to me

764
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:10,140
Mi-rang / Here eat this

765
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:12,634
Da-gyo / Honestly I don’t like onions

766
00:38:12,644 --> 00:38:13,902
Da-gyo / If it were someone else

767
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:16,237
Da-gyo / I would’ve said no

768
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:18,339
Mi-mi / Wait are you eating something?

769
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:19,450
Mi-mi / You look like you got caught sneaking food

770
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:24,122
Mi-mi / You’re totally slacking off and eating right now huh?

771
00:38:25,623 --> 00:38:27,892
Da-gyo / That’s because she fed me

772
00:38:28,126 --> 00:38:29,527
Mi-rang / Then spit it back out

773
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:31,729
Da-gyo / Too late I already swallowed it

774
00:38:32,697 --> 00:38:35,934
Bi-bi / The canapés are so pretty Nice job

775
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:39,371
Mi-mi / Isn’t this basically a housewarming party?

776
00:38:47,278 --> 00:38:49,103
Bi-bi / Are we done with this now?

777
00:38:49,113 --> 00:38:52,006
Mi-mi / We still need chicken stock, hold on

778
00:38:52,016 --> 00:38:54,184
Bi-bi / What’s that?
Mi-mi / Gotta season it with chicken stock

779
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:57,088
Mi-mi / Let’s add some chicken stock

780
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:12,927
Bi-bi / I think it’s a little bland

781
00:39:12,937 --> 00:39:15,529
Mi-mi / Try it and let me know, I’ll finish this

782
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:16,497
Mi-mi / Is it a bit bland?

783
00:39:16,507 --> 00:39:19,644
Mi-mi / I’ll add more chicken stock

784
00:39:24,682 --> 00:39:26,951
(Try this at least)

785
00:39:40,098 --> 00:39:42,457
Mi-rang / Da-gyo said she’s not good at cooking

786
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:45,493
Mi-rang / And I’m not good at Western food either

787
00:39:45,503 --> 00:39:49,497
Mi-rang / But having Mi-mi and Bi-bi here to teach us how to cook

788
00:39:49,507 --> 00:39:51,499
Mi-rang / And getting to see Da-gyo cook too

789
00:39:51,509 --> 00:39:53,301
Mi-rang / I’m really happy I got to see that today

790
00:39:53,311 --> 00:39:57,538
Da-gyo / It was great she ate so well it was funny

791
00:39:57,548 --> 00:39:59,540
Da-gyo / Even while cooking she kept

792
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,953
Da-gyo / Putting stuff in her mouth

793
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:04,846
Da-gyo / That was kind of funny but also cute

794
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:08,382
Da-gyo / She really looked out for me too

795
00:40:08,392 --> 00:40:09,894
Da-gyo / It left a strong impression

796
00:40:26,577 --> 00:40:29,380
Bi-bi / Should we light the cake and eat together?

797
00:40:30,815 --> 00:40:31,639
Da-gyo / What is this?

798
00:40:31,649 --> 00:40:33,274
Mi-mi / It’s to celebrate the double date

799
00:40:33,284 --> 00:40:36,477
Mi-mi / We prepared this for the occasion

800
00:40:36,487 --> 00:40:38,546
Mi-mi / Also today is our 2000-day anniversary

801
00:40:38,556 --> 00:40:40,358
Bi-bi / Yep today is our 2000th day

802
00:40:52,303 --> 00:40:54,672
Mi-mi / Let’s all make a wish together

803
00:40:54,939 --> 00:40:57,308
Mi-rang / Oh congrats! So uh...

804
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:02,113
Mi-rang / Congrats on your 2000-day anniversary

805
00:41:06,384 --> 00:41:10,945
Da-gyo / Even after this ends, I hope things go well with Mi-rang

806
00:41:10,955 --> 00:41:13,514
Mi-rang / I prayed we could go on more dates like this

807
00:41:13,524 --> 00:41:16,461
Mi-rang / That we’d get another chance like this together

808
00:41:41,185 --> 00:41:42,977
Mi-rang / Oh the wine’s good

809
00:41:42,987 --> 00:41:45,089
Bi-bi / Thanks for the meal

810
00:42:13,317 --> 00:42:14,475
Mi-rang / It’s so good

811
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:19,647
Bi-bi / By the way, how did you two end up coming here together?

812
00:42:19,657 --> 00:42:24,018
Da-gyo / We called each other yesterday

813
00:42:24,028 --> 00:42:26,797
Bi-bi / You each called the one you wanted?

814
00:42:27,865 --> 00:42:31,092
Bi-bi / So only the pairs who liked each other came here?

815
00:42:31,102 --> 00:42:32,693
Da-gyo / Yeah

816
00:42:32,703 --> 00:42:36,130
Mi-rang / There were “single” and “double” options

817
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,432
Mi-rang / I just felt the vibe for “double”

818
00:42:38,442 --> 00:42:39,867
Mi-rang / So I picked double

819
00:42:39,877 --> 00:42:42,136
Mi-mi / Da-gyo, would you say Mi-rang fits your ideal type?

820
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:44,649
Mi-mi / Do you think she suits you?

821
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:48,219
I’m curious…

822
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:52,980
Mi-mi / You really seem curious

823
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,759
Mi-mi / Your ear’s twitching right now

824
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:58,496
Da-gyo / She’s just the same

825
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:01,289
Da-gyo / Like she matches exactly with the image in my mind

826
00:43:01,299 --> 00:43:03,024
Da-gyo / Like 100% the same

827
00:43:03,034 --> 00:43:04,692
Mi-mi / She’s just like your ideal type?

828
00:43:04,702 --> 00:43:06,727
Bi-bi / Do you mean her appearance?

829
00:43:06,737 --> 00:43:08,863
Bi-bi / Or her personality and everything?

830
00:43:08,873 --> 00:43:13,267
Da-gyo / Looks, of course...

831
00:43:13,277 --> 00:43:16,571
Da-gyo / But also she expresses her feelings so openly

832
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:18,382
Da-gyo / And I really like that…

833
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:20,408
Mi-mi / So did she take the lead at first?

834
00:43:20,418 --> 00:43:21,542
Mi-mi / Did she express interest first?

835
00:43:21,552 --> 00:43:23,110
Mi-mi / Like, you weren’t interested at first

836
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:27,048
Mi-mi / But then Mi-rang kept showing she was into you?

837
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:30,451
Da-gyo / When you’re inside the house...

838
00:43:30,461 --> 00:43:32,853
Da-gyo / This kind of situation was new to me

839
00:43:32,863 --> 00:43:35,533
Da-gyo / So I wasn’t sure if she was flirting or just being nice

840
00:43:36,534 --> 00:43:38,693
Da-gyo / I couldn’t tell with girls

841
00:43:38,703 --> 00:43:40,494
Mi-mi / Like is she nice to everyone

842
00:43:40,504 --> 00:43:41,862
Mi-mi / Or just to me?

843
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:43,297
Mi-mi / You weren’t sure at first?

844
00:43:43,307 --> 00:43:48,135
Da-gyo / Yeah so I kept wondering if I was just imagining things…

845
00:43:48,145 --> 00:43:50,304
Da-gyo / So during our first date

846
00:43:50,314 --> 00:43:52,673
Da-gyo / I just asked her everything

847
00:43:52,683 --> 00:43:54,408
Da-gyo / Like bluntly

848
00:43:54,418 --> 00:43:57,545
Da-gyo / Were all those things you did actually flirting?

849
00:43:57,555 --> 00:43:58,823
Da-gyo / And she said yeah

850
00:43:58,923 --> 00:44:01,616
Mi-mi / Wow that’s such a confident question

851
00:44:01,626 --> 00:44:02,727
Mi-mi / What if she had said no…

852
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,012
Bi-bi / I think it was love at first sight

853
00:44:09,034 --> 00:44:10,925
Mi-rang / At first sight huh?

854
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:13,761
Mi-rang / There were a few I found attractive right away

855
00:44:13,771 --> 00:44:17,041
Mi-rang / Honestly, some looked really good

856
00:44:17,275 --> 00:44:21,245
Mi-rang / But the one I kept thinking about at night…

857
00:44:28,486 --> 00:44:31,178
Mi-rang / Are you two living together?

858
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:33,581
Mi-mi / Yes we live together

859
00:44:33,591 --> 00:44:36,217
Mi-mi / And we’ve been together for about five years

860
00:44:36,227 --> 00:44:38,729
Mi-mi / We haven’t spent a single day apart

861
00:44:40,398 --> 00:44:41,555
Mi-mi / Every single day

862
00:44:41,565 --> 00:44:43,014
Mi-mi / From day one

863
00:44:43,024 --> 00:44:45,982
Mi-mi / There hasn’t been a single day we haven’t seen each other

864
00:44:47,705 --> 00:44:48,762
Bi-bi / You've never been apart?

865
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:51,832
Mi-mi / I was always with her no matter where we went

866
00:44:51,842 --> 00:44:53,934
Mi-mi / Even if I just had to drop her off

867
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:55,146
Mi-mi / I stayed close

868
00:44:57,248 --> 00:44:58,472
Da-gyo / How is that even possible?

869
00:44:58,482 --> 00:44:59,907
Mi-mi / When you’re dating

870
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:03,688
Mi-mi / Is there something you’d absolutely not want to deal with?

871
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:09,272
Mi-mi / I guess I just like everything
Bi-bi / I guess everything still feels good for now

872
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:10,818
Mi-mi / Do you ever think like

873
00:45:10,828 --> 00:45:12,653
Mi-mi / “I want to get married someday”

874
00:45:12,663 --> 00:45:14,889
Mi-mi / Or “I want to wear a wedding dress”?

875
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:17,358
Da-gyo / I do want a wedding and to wear a dress

876
00:45:17,368 --> 00:45:18,826
Mi-mi / Do you want to invite everyone?

877
00:45:18,836 --> 00:45:20,695
Mi-mi / Or keep it small?

878
00:45:20,705 --> 00:45:22,430
Da-gyo / Even if I invite everyone, it’s not that many

879
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,608
Mi-mi / Even invite the press?

880
00:45:25,509 --> 00:45:27,702
Mi-mi / That would be a bit much...

881
00:45:27,712 --> 00:45:30,338
Mi-mi / But you know how the press shows up

882
00:45:30,348 --> 00:45:35,076
Da-gyo / If it works out, it’s not like I don’t want it

883
00:45:35,086 --> 00:45:36,554
Da-gyo / I do want to get married

884
00:45:38,155 --> 00:45:41,826
Mi-rang / Even if your parents have to be there?

885
00:45:42,126 --> 00:45:44,785
Da-gyo / Parents? Of course, they have to be there

886
00:45:44,795 --> 00:45:47,521
Mi-rang / I ask because some of the people I know

887
00:45:47,531 --> 00:45:50,524
Mi-rang / Who’ve had weddings

888
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:54,362
Mi-rang / They usually don’t invite their parents

889
00:45:54,372 --> 00:45:56,497
Mi-rang / It’s mostly just their friends

890
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:57,732
Mi-rang / That happens a lot

891
00:45:57,742 --> 00:45:59,467
Da-gyo / If they don’t come, that’s their choice

892
00:45:59,477 --> 00:46:01,669
Mi-mi / Still it’s brave of you to be open about it

893
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:03,537
Bi-bi / I think they’ll come though?

894
00:46:03,547 --> 00:46:06,273
Da-gyo / I’d absolutely ask them to

895
00:46:06,283 --> 00:46:07,641
Mi-mi / So you’re definitely thinking about marriage

896
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:10,478
Mi-mi / Most of the people around me weren’t thinking about it

897
00:46:10,488 --> 00:46:12,490
Mi-mi / That’s what I heard a lot

898
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,615
Mi-mi / They’re like “What’s the point of marriage?”

899
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:15,716
Mi-mi / Because honestly

900
00:46:15,726 --> 00:46:18,619
Mi-mi / There’s nothing concrete holding it together

901
00:46:18,629 --> 00:46:20,154
Mi-mi / It’s not like legal marriage, right?

902
00:46:20,164 --> 00:46:22,089
Mi-mi / In straight relationships

903
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:25,393
Mi-mi / The goal is often marriage or having kids

904
00:46:25,403 --> 00:46:27,628
Mi-mi / And there’s a path you follow

905
00:46:27,638 --> 00:46:29,163
Mi-mi / With legal documents and all

906
00:46:29,173 --> 00:46:32,309
Mi-mi / Straight couples have something lasting on paper, but we don’t

907
00:46:32,476 --> 00:46:34,478
Da-gyo / Yeah that’s the biggest issue

908
00:46:34,745 --> 00:46:36,470
Mi-mi / From my side, that feels unfair

909
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,905
Mi-mi / It’s not great but

910
00:46:37,915 --> 00:46:39,774
Mi-mi / It makes us work harder constantly

911
00:46:39,784 --> 00:46:42,309
Mi-mi / We don’t settle because we don’t have that legal tie

912
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:45,189
Mi-mi / So I try to keep up with myself too

913
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:46,791
Bi-bi / And you are doing that right?

914
00:46:48,526 --> 00:46:50,060
Mi-mi / Am I not doing enough?

915
00:46:50,528 --> 00:46:52,997
Mi-rang / I mean, you are in a way

916
00:46:53,197 --> 00:46:57,391
Bi-bi / When we first moved to Jeju?

917
00:46:57,401 --> 00:47:00,571
Bi-bi / Around our first year, we did a wedding shoot

918
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:04,687
Bi-bi / It’s my third time coming to Jeju Island

919
00:47:04,709 --> 00:47:08,947
Bi-bi / We wore dresses and shot near the ocean

920
00:47:09,113 --> 00:47:12,616
Bi-bi / Apparently that spot is popular for newlywed couples

921
00:47:12,817 --> 00:47:14,408
Bi-bi / But we were both women

922
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:17,645
Bi-bi / So everyone kept staring at us

923
00:47:17,655 --> 00:47:19,370
Mi-rang / You both wore dresses?

924
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,271
Bi-bi / We’re both wearing dresses

925
00:47:21,281 --> 00:47:22,750
Mi-mi / We had to walk there

926
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:25,019
Mi-mi / It was over a 5-minute walk

927
00:47:25,029 --> 00:47:27,521
Bi-bi / Honestly, I was so embarrassed back then...

928
00:47:27,531 --> 00:47:28,566
Mi-mi / Our outfits were pretty revealing too

929
00:47:28,578 --> 00:47:33,850
Mi-mi / She’s the one who brought the bed and equipment

930
00:47:33,872 --> 00:47:34,596
Mi-mi / I was so startled

931
00:47:34,572 --> 00:47:35,663
Mi-mi / We were shooting and suddenly

932
00:47:35,673 --> 00:47:36,530
Mi-mi / A camera...

933
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,210
Mi-mi / A different camera crew came pointing at us

934
00:47:40,744 --> 00:47:44,672
Mi-mi / I was like “Why is the camera coming toward us?”

935
00:47:44,682 --> 00:47:45,940
Mi-mi / There were many couples there

936
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,875
Mi-mi / But we were the only woman-woman couple

937
00:47:47,885 --> 00:47:49,977
Mi-mi / So people kept staring at us

938
00:47:51,645 --> 00:47:54,604
Mi-mi / Especially since some of the shots have to be taken up close

939
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,183
Mi-mi / I personally liked it, but...

940
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,661
Mi-mi / Her face turned bright red

941
00:47:58,395 --> 00:48:00,954
Mi-rang / In other countries, they don’t even care

942
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:02,566
Mi-rang / Like really…

943
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,737
Mi-mi / And that’s when we started walking

944
00:48:04,747 --> 00:48:06,069
Mi-mi / Just the two of us

945
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:08,038
Mi-mi / We even sang together quietly

946
00:48:08,872 --> 00:48:11,041
Mi-mi / I just wanted to do it naturally

947
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,067
Bi-bi / I don’t remember that

948
00:48:13,077 --> 00:48:15,101
Mi-mi / You’re a T so you wouldn’t

949
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:18,572
Bi-bi / Did we sing?
Mi-rang / I sang “dun dun da-daaan” remember?

950
00:48:18,582 --> 00:48:20,941
Mi-mi / I started to feel this sense of responsibility

951
00:48:20,951 --> 00:48:23,944
Mi-mi / I didn’t even notice people staring anymore

952
00:48:23,954 --> 00:48:27,381
Mi-mi / It felt like just the two of us existed

953
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:29,559
Mi-mi / That moment meant a lot to me

954
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,618
Bi-bi / It left a big impression on me too

955
00:48:31,628 --> 00:48:37,090
Bi-bi / That’s why Jeju is such a meaningful place for us

956
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,960
Mi-mi / And this place too—if things go well

957
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,805
Mi-mi / Could become really meaningful too

958
00:48:42,273 --> 00:48:44,131
Bi-bi / Just like it was for us

959
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:45,565
Da-gyo / I really needed that kind of moment

960
00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:46,333
Da-gyo / A time when someone

961
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:48,969
Da-gyo / Could share those kinds of stories with me?

962
00:48:48,979 --> 00:48:51,338
Da-gyo / It helped clear up some things I was wondering about

963
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:52,706
Da-gyo / And made me realize

964
00:48:52,716 --> 00:48:53,807
Da-gyo / How much I can learn by getting to know someone

965
00:48:53,817 --> 00:48:55,276
Da-gyo / It’s such a good feeling

966
00:48:55,286 --> 00:48:57,044
Mi-rang / They shared how they dated

967
00:48:57,054 --> 00:49:00,023
Mi-rang / And how they got through tough times

968
00:49:00,024 --> 00:49:02,358
Mi-rang / They even set up a cooking session with us

969
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:04,652
Mi-rang / That part was so thoughtful too

970
00:49:04,662 --> 00:49:08,031
Mi-rang / I’d say my satisfaction with today’s double date is 100%

971
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:12,703
Seo-yeon / Shall we cook~

972
00:49:16,073 --> 00:49:17,507
Ri-won / What are you doing, Seo-yeon?

973
00:49:17,508 --> 00:49:19,033
Seo-yeon / Time to cook

974
00:49:19,043 --> 00:49:19,909
Ri-won / What about Da-gyo?

975
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,668
Seo-yeon / She’s on a date, remember?

976
00:49:21,678 --> 00:49:23,713
Ri-won / She’s not back yet?

977
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:25,549
Ri-won / Let’s cook together then

978
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,641
Seo-yeon / Today's menu

979
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:31,989
Seo-yeon / Pork kimchi stew, grilled fish, and rolled omelet

980
00:49:32,468 --> 00:49:34,861
Ri-won / Originally, Seo-yeon and Da-gyo

981
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:37,263
Ri-won / Were supposed to make dinner

982
00:49:37,273 --> 00:49:39,632
Ri-won / But Da-gyo was late because of her date

983
00:49:39,642 --> 00:49:42,936
Ri-won / And I thought it would be too much for Seo-yeon to handle alone

984
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,637
Ri-won / I’ve lived alone for a long time

985
00:49:44,647 --> 00:49:46,606
Ri-won / So I can cook reasonably well

986
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:49,075
Ri-won / I just wanted to help out where I could

987
00:49:49,085 --> 00:49:50,787
Ri-won / That’s why I joined in

988
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:55,702
Seo-yeon / I was actually supposed to cook with Da-gyo today

989
00:49:55,712 --> 00:49:57,136
Seo-yeon / We were on kitchen duty

990
00:49:57,146 --> 00:50:00,573
Seo-yeon / But I can’t lie—it kinda made me sad

991
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:03,309
Seo-yeon / I think I was secretly hoping for something

992
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:05,587
Seo-yeon / Because doing something alone

993
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:08,290
Seo-yeon / With someone you like for the first time...

994
00:50:08,724 --> 00:50:14,531
Seo-yeon / So yeah, it kind of left me feeling weird and sad

995
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:18,558
Seo-yeon / Oh you’re back?

996
00:50:18,568 --> 00:50:19,969
Han-kyul / Hello

997
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:20,984
Seo-yeon / Did you have a good time out?

998
00:50:21,985 --> 00:50:23,539
Hello~

999
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,364
Ri-won / Your hair still looks cute

1000
00:50:24,374 --> 00:50:28,110
Han-kyul / Hello my princesses

1001
00:50:28,244 --> 00:50:29,745
Han-kyul / It’s freezing

1002
00:50:29,746 --> 00:50:31,003
Ri-won / Was it cold outside?

1003
00:50:31,013 --> 00:50:31,714
Han-kyul / Yeah

1004
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,219
Ri-won / You’ve worked hard

1005
00:50:33,229 --> 00:50:35,254
Ri-won / I looked at Han-kyul’s face first

1006
00:50:35,264 --> 00:50:37,657
Ri-won / To see if she had fun or felt happy

1007
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,093
Ri-won / Or if it wasn’t great, I was just curious

1008
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:44,497
Ri-won / Actually, even more than after the call yesterday

1009
00:50:44,507 --> 00:50:46,299
Ri-won / After today’s date

1010
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:49,669
Ri-won / Han-kyul seemed even more complicated and subtle

1011
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,814
Ri-won / So I was curious why

1012
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:53,840
Ri-won / Did something happen today?

1013
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:54,807
Han-kyul / What do you mean?

1014
00:50:54,817 --> 00:50:55,908
Ri-won / On the date?

1015
00:50:55,918 --> 00:50:56,642
Han-kyul / No

1016
00:50:56,652 --> 00:50:59,088
Ri-won / Nothing special happened?

1017
00:51:00,156 --> 00:51:03,926
Ri-won / I thought something had happened

1018
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:09,889
Han-kyul / I just don’t want to create any events

1019
00:51:09,899 --> 00:51:13,393
Ri-won / I feel the same way

1020
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,961
Min-woo / How was it?

1021
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:17,273
Min-woo / How was the date today? Was it okay?

1022
00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:23,536
Jin-ah / Just... a fun time

1023
00:51:23,546 --> 00:51:25,605
Min-woo / Then that’s all that matters

1024
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,640
Jin-ah / We came back from our date

1025
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:31,544
Jin-ah / But our accommodations were different, so we were separated

1026
00:51:31,554 --> 00:51:34,781
Jin-ah / I wanted to bring her to my place

1027
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:39,719
Jin-ah / But I was really scared to face Ri-won

1028
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:44,924
Jin-ah / We each had a date with the person we chose

1029
00:51:44,934 --> 00:51:47,827
Jin-ah / ‘Why do I feel like I have to walk on eggshells?’

1030
00:51:47,837 --> 00:51:49,028
Jin-ah / Honestly, it was scary

1031
00:51:49,038 --> 00:51:53,699
Jin-ah / It was our first time going out and talking

1032
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:55,535
Jin-ah / We ate and took a walk after

1033
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,046
Jin-ah / I wanted to talk more

1034
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:00,173
Ri-won / Can you taste this?
Han-kyul / Okay

1035
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,818
Ri-won / Hold on

1036
00:52:03,953 --> 00:52:05,778
Han-kyul / Can I just get one bite of solid stuff?

1037
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:06,846
Ri-won / Do you want it that badly?

1038
00:52:06,856 --> 00:52:08,481
Han-kyul / I seriously feel like I’m going to faint

1039
00:52:08,491 --> 00:52:11,584
Ri-won / You know that vibe of sneaking a bite late at night

1040
00:52:11,594 --> 00:52:15,765
Han-kyul / That feeling of fishing out pork secretly

1041
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,106
Han-kyul / Wow thank you

1042
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:25,331
Ri-won / I think it’s hot

1043
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:28,034
Han-kyul / No, you don’t have to do that

1044
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:29,168
Ri-won / What if you burn yourself

1045
00:52:29,178 --> 00:52:31,714
Ri-won / Is it hot hot or not hot?

1046
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:35,184
Ri-won / See if the seasoning is right

1047
00:52:39,288 --> 00:52:40,446
Ri-won / Is it good?

1048
00:52:40,456 --> 00:52:41,958
Ri-won / Okay then stop

1049
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:43,950
Ri-won / That’s it then

1050
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,285
Han-kyul / It’s not too salty, it’s just right!

1051
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:48,831
Ri-won / And I’m going to grill fish too
Han-kyul / Wow!

1052
00:52:50,366 --> 00:52:51,691
Ri-won / You said you like fish

1053
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:53,436
Han-kyul / Yes!

1054
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:15,224
Seo-yeon / Ah...
Ri-won / Why?

1055
00:53:15,558 --> 00:53:17,326
Seo-yeon / Oh my gosh

1056
00:53:27,069 --> 00:53:30,563
Ri-won / Oh wow, double was the right choice

1057
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:34,667
Seo-yeon / Of course, everything is better in doubles

1058
00:53:34,677 --> 00:53:36,479
Ri-won / I didn’t even think of that

1059
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:41,417
Seo-yeon / I shouldn’t have touched the rice

1060
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:44,710
Seo-yeon / My heart dropped again

1061
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,580
Seo-yeon / They’re roommates now, but still

1062
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,882
Seo-yeon / There’s that word “overnight”

1063
00:53:49,892 --> 00:53:51,551
Seo-yeon / Just the two of them

1064
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:55,588
Seo-yeon / Going on a 2-day-1-night trip in a new place

1065
00:53:55,598 --> 00:54:01,661
Seo-yeon / It was... something I really didn’t want to imagine

1066
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,273
Seo-yeon / Yeah, I really didn’t want to imagine it

1067
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,220
Min-woo / Wow seriously

1068
00:54:17,453 --> 00:54:20,413
Min-woo / This is ridiculous

1069
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,416
Min-woo / It’s basically a newlywed house
Jin-ah / Sorry but... we’re alone too

1070
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:23,883
Min-woo / Huh?

1071
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,518
Jin-ah / We’re alone too

1072
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:31,357
Jin-ah / They’re going to eat and sleep outside anyway

1073
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:32,391
Min-woo / Huh?

1074
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:35,528
Min-woo / Wait, so they’re sleeping somewhere else?

1075
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:36,562
Jin-ah / Look
Min-woo / Wait a second

1076
00:54:36,572 --> 00:54:38,764
Jin-ah / The two of them will be staying

1077
00:54:38,774 --> 00:54:41,734
Jin-ah / Alone at a separate place

1078
00:54:41,744 --> 00:54:43,703
Jin-ah / And spending quality time together

1079
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:46,439
Min-woo / So... that dinner plan over there

1080
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,640
Min-woo / That was supposed to be for everyone

1081
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:48,708
Jin-ah / For us...

1082
00:54:48,718 --> 00:54:49,976
Jin-ah / For us, tonight

1083
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,110
Jin-ah / It’s just the two of us staying here

1084
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,144
Min-woo / Ah...

1085
00:54:52,154 --> 00:54:55,715
Jin-ah / So we’re also staying just the two of us

1086
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:56,659
Min-woo / That’s wild

1087
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,430
Jin-ah / Insane right?

1088
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:05,068
Min-woo / Wait wait... they're spending the night?

1089
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:06,970
Jin-ah / An overnight stay? That's wild

1090
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,876
Seo-yeon / Come on in

1091
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:14,511
Hee-young / What’s for dinner?

1092
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:15,412
Ri-won / You’re back?

1093
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:16,880
Hee-young / Yeah

1094
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,381
Seo-yeon / Kimchi stew

1095
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:24,587
Seo-yeon / You’re back
Jin-ah / I’m back~ We’re back~

1096
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:28,882
Ri-won / Honestly, I didn’t look her

1097
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,483
Ri-won / Because when Jin-ah came here

1098
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,919
Ri-won / The person she liked kept changing

1099
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:35,155
Ri-won / I was worried Han-kyul might get hurt

1100
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,957
Ri-won / So that worried me a bit

1101
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:40,961
Ri-won / And that’s why just now, I felt a bit...

1102
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:43,630
Ri-won / Like I... I hated... I hate her

1103
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,200
Ri-won / I still kind of hate her and worry at the same time

1104
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:53,840
Ri-won / So I was kind of trying... not to look at her

1105
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,476
Ri-won / I should act mature too, but

1106
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:59,479
Ri-won / When it comes to love

1107
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:03,516
Ri-won / I’m really not mature at all

1108
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,851
Ri-won / So it’s hard for me

1109
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:09,165
Ri-won / I kind of... hate myself for being like this too

1110
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:13,126
Ri-won / It's embar... I mean, I’m embarrassed

1111
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:15,338
Ri-won / That I feel this way

1112
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,142
Hee-young / That’s huge

1113
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:21,311
Oh it’s pork kimchi stew

1114
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,279
It smells amazing

1115
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:24,514
We worked hard on it

1116
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,987
Let’s dig in

1117
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,660
Ri-won / Oh pass that to Hee-young...

1118
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,130
Ri-won / I didn’t see it

1119
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,365
Ri-won / I didn’t see it

1120
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:45,435
Min-woo / I couldn’t reach over that far

1121
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:46,736
Hee-young / Thank you

1122
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,871
Ri-won / I didn’t catch it

1123
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,110
Han-kyul / Oh! I brought something

1124
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:55,278
Han-kyul / Here

1125
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:56,446
Ri-won / Then give it to me

1126
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,248
Han-kyul / It’s a new pair of chopsticks

1127
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,950
Han-kyul / Thanks again

1128
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:06,413
Ri-won / Please leave a review

1129
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:07,791
Ri-won / Five stars

1130
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,064
Hee-young / Mom!

1131
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:16,533
Hee-young / This kimchi stew is so good

1132
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,834
Ri-won / How is it? Doesn’t it taste like something your mom would make?

1133
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:19,926
Ri-won / Right, right

1134
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:22,361
Hee-young / I really love kimchi stew

1135
00:57:22,371 --> 00:57:24,941
Hee-young / I’ve been craving it so bad
Ri-won / Same here

1136
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:28,701
Hee-young / Mmm it's good

1137
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:29,469
Ri-won / Is it?

1138
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:30,036
Hee-young / Yeah

1139
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:30,780
Ri-won / Thank you

1140
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:41,647
Ri-won / It kind of tastes like Japanese-style rolled omelet

1141
00:57:41,657 --> 00:57:43,426
Hee-young / Right, right

1142
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:46,319
Seo-yeon / Butter

1143
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,221
Hee-young / So good, everyone did great

1144
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:49,255
Ri-won / Is it good?

1145
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:52,158
Ri-won / Oh right, we got a message earlier

1146
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,659
Ri-won / About the double keyword

1147
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:56,062
Ri-won / We thought it meant a double date

1148
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:57,463
Hee-young / But I guessed it right

1149
00:57:57,473 --> 00:57:59,432
Hee-young / I was the one who brought up the bed

1150
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:01,500
Hee-young / So I was like “Is it the room?” and stuff

1151
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,412
Hee-young / And I got it right

1152
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,871
Min-woo / Are Mi-rang and Da-gyo

1153
00:58:05,881 --> 00:58:06,647
Min-woo / sleeping out tonight?

1154
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,684
Ri-won / I think so, they’ve totally hit it off

1155
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:14,957
Ri-won / Honestly, I’m jealous

1156
00:58:16,058 --> 00:58:18,451
Ri-won / Lucky them

1157
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:20,363
Seo-yeon / While we were eating

1158
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:23,466
Seo-yeon / I kept thinking about Mi-rang and Da-gyo

1159
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:26,603
Seo-yeon / I can’t lie, it really hurt

1160
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,271
Ri-won / What about the singles? Where did you go?

1161
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,372
Han-kyul / Singles?

1162
00:58:29,372 --> 00:58:31,875
Han-kyul / LP café. A record café

1163
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,945
Min-woo / Record café?
Ri-won / LP café

1164
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:38,481
Ri-won / Do you want more grilled fish?

1165
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:41,618
Ri-won / Just a little?

1166
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,887
Han-kyul / I feel like such a pig

1167
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,622
Ri-won / You’re not a pig, you’re just growing

1168
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:48,658
Ri-won / You’re in a phase of...

1169
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:51,394
Ri-won / Spiritual growth right now

1170
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:53,229
Ri-won / You need the calories

1171
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:55,598
Han-kyul / I guess I’m going through growing pains

1172
00:58:55,598 --> 00:58:57,200
Ri-won / Calories are essential

1173
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:02,038
Jin-ah / Ri-won unnie treats Han-kyul like a baby bird

1174
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:05,742
Jin-ah / She debones the food, takes care of her

1175
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,710
Jin-ah / Even putting everything else aside

1176
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,947
Jin-ah / I wasn’t bold enough with my own feelings

1177
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:13,650
Jin-ah / And I’m not proud of that

1178
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:19,022
Jin-ah / I want to be brave and honest and confident

1179
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:25,828
Jin-ah / About my interest, affection, and love

1180
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:29,432
Jin-ah / But here I keep shrinking away

1181
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:33,169
Jin-ah / And that’s been really hard for me

1182
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:39,976
Jin-ah / This has been a tough time
