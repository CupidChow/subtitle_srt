1
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,276
Jin-ah / I’ll be back

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,012
Jin-ah / Here I go

3
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,067
Jin-ah / Honestly I always find writing the notes so hard

4
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:38,762
Jin-ah / I go in thinking “who do I even write to?”

5
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,774
Jin-ah / Huh?

6
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,639
Jin-ah / What kind of phone is this?

7
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,875
Jin-ah / I had no clue what was going on

8
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,487
Jin-ah / How am I supposed to make a call?

9
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,635
Hello?

10
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,361
Jin-ah / Hey it's Jin-ah

11
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,239
Han-kyul / Of course I'm the one overthinking again

12
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,107
Ri-won / Oh? Someone’s calling

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,133
Han-kyul / Hello?

14
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,813
Jin-ah / Hey, it’s me, Jin-ah

15
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,016
Jin-ah / Hello? It’s Jin-ah

16
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,885
Han-kyul / Huh?

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,290
Han-kyul / How did you get this number?

18
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:38,120
Jin-ah / I don’t have much time

19
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,556
Jin-ah / But I’m so glad we talked earlier

20
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,625
Jin-ah / I really am

21
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:46,228
Jin-ah / You’ll understand what I mean later

22
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:47,106
Jin-ah / Okay?

23
00:01:47,139 --> 00:01:48,908
Han-kyul / You know what?

24
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,277
Han-kyul / I wanted to say the same thing

25
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,871
Jin-ah / Where are you?

26
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:59,709
Han-kyul / I don’t know where I am

27
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,155
Jin-ah / I... Oh no, it cut off

28
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:10,663
Jin-ah / Ugh

29
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:21,764
Jin-ah / That 30-second phone call

30
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,710
Jin-ah / was too short to say what I wanted

31
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,114
Jin-ah / but too long to hide my embarrassment

32
00:02:31,717 --> 00:02:34,653
Jin-ah / This is crazy

33
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,724
Jin-ah / Ahhh

34
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:41,160
Jin-ah / Seriously, this is crazy

35
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:44,453
Jin-ah / Honestly, I’ve had such a hard time yesterday and today

36
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:46,455
Jin-ah / But then...

37
00:02:46,465 --> 00:02:49,892
Jin-ah / Love snuck in during all of that

38
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:52,738
Jin-ah / And suddenly, everything just feels fun

39
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:57,510
Jin-ah / So after the call, I actually felt really good

40
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,219
Ri-won / What the heck?

41
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,977
Ri-won / How did she get this number?

42
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,814
Han-kyul / Wait, my heart's about to explode

43
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,150
Ri-won / Why? Why’s your heart about to explode?

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,220
Han-kyul / My first thought was “how did she know this number?”

45
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,732
Han-kyul / That was the first thing that hit me

46
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,226
Han-kyul / So it seriously felt like my heart would burst

47
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,029
Han-kyul / Like “did she dig around to get my number?”

48
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,263
Han-kyul / That’s what I was thinking

49
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:30,466
Han-kyul / And then when I realized that wasn’t it

50
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,111
Han-kyul / Ah... I accepted it

51
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,104
Han-kyul / Still feels like my heart will explode

52
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,283
Ri-won / How did she get your number though?

53
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,347
Han-kyul / I can’t do this

54
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:48,094
Han-kyul / I gave up on my face but now I don’t want to give up

55
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,588
Ri-won / I think Jin-ah was getting a call

56
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,122
Ri-won / I kind of expected it, honestly

57
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,791
Ri-won / So what I thought was

58
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,927
Ri-won / For a second, I was like, 'How did she get my number?'

59
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:02,232
Ri-won / 'Did she ask when we were in the room?' That’s what I thought

60
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,934
Ri-won / Then I thought, 'Oh, maybe it’s a phone call this time'

61
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:05,745
Because

62
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,805
Ri-won / Because if it were that, the call would've been longer

63
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,442
Ri-won / Since the call was short, I figured there must’ve been a time limit

64
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,321
Ri-won / So I realized, oh, it wasn’t a note today—it was a phone call

65
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:18,047
Hee-young / Feels good, right? You looked so at ease earlier

66
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,717
Seo-yeon / Yeah, it’s like nothing is weighing on me now

67
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,019
Seo-yeon / So that’s why

68
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:23,720
Hee-young / What is?

69
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,199
Seo-yeon / I mean, I saw someone else

70
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,057
Seo-yeon / and thought it suited them well

71
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:31,237
Seo-yeon / But when you wear it, it looks hip

72
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,197
Seo-yeon / And hearing other people’s secrets too

73
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:37,133
Seo-yeon / makes me go “ah, so that’s why”

74
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,679
Hee-young / But you really went through a lot

75
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,038
Seo-yeon / Yeah, I really did

76
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,239
Hee-young / That must’ve been tough, because

77
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,041
Hee-young / if you had said it from the start

78
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:47,010
Hee-young / either I or the others around you

79
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,280
Hee-young / would’ve understood and seen you for who you are

80
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,991
Hee-young / There would’ve been no misunderstandings

81
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,854
Seo-yeon / Huh? Oh never mind, it’s just yours

82
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,088
Seo-yeon / Just take that and go

83
00:04:59,098 --> 00:04:59,889
Seo-yeon / Yours is over there

84
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,102
Hee-young / You sure you’re okay? Your hair’s caught

85
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,139
Seo-yeon / It actually suits you, look in the mirror

86
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,776
Seo-yeon / See? It suits you, now go

87
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,567
Hee-young / No no

88
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,402
Seo-yeon / No?

89
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,770
Hee-young / It looks good, but not today

90
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,240
Seo-yeon / It’s my style though

91
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,119
Hee-young / You keep throwing these at me

92
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,020
Seo-yeon / Go on

93
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,123
Hee-young / I’ll be back

94
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,592
Hee-young / This is insane

95
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,487
Hee-young / Ugh...

96
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,801
Hee-young / As I learned more secrets and things

97
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,402
Hee-young / and even their ages

98
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,938
Hee-young / everyone started to look so different

99
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,798
Hee-young / It’s driving me crazy

100
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,801
Hee-young / And once their full picture clicked into place

101
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,848
Hee-young / I understood them and they all became so attractive

102
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,133
Hee-young / Honestly, I thought I should call Da-gyo

103
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,244
Hee-young / or maybe Min-woo

104
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:21,814
Hee-young / since they showed interest in me

105
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,418
Hee-young / Ugh... I’m running out of time

106
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,197
Hello?

107
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,399
Hee-young / Hello

108
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,134
Yes?

109
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,277
Seo-yeon / Hello?

110
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,044
Hee-young / Hello?

111
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,013
Seo-yeon / Yes?

112
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,973
Hee-young / I was told to call the person I’m interested in

113
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,117
Hee-young / So I did

114
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,086
Seo-yeon / Huh? That can’t be right!

115
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,043
Hee-young / Sorry?

116
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,222
Seo-yeon / You called the wrong number

117
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,160
Hee-young / No I didn’t

118
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:07,760
Seo-yeon / What?

119
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,129
Hee-young / I dialed the right number!

120
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,567
Seo-yeon / Oh... oh... really?

121
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,530
Hee-young / But I’m running out of time

122
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,875
Hee-young / Bye

123
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,037
Hee-young / But I’m running out of time

124
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,850
Hee-young / Bye

125
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,377
Seo-yeon / A few seconds before it cut off, ah!

126
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,679
Seo-yeon / I realized it was a call system and then

127
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,815
Seo-yeon / Oh! It's Hee-young

128
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,159
Seo-yeon / I figured it out right then

129
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:43,453
Seo-yeon / But honestly, it still doesn’t feel real

130
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:48,057
Seo-yeon / If it was based on first impressions...

131
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,237
Seo-yeon / If it were the emotions from back then

132
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,639
Seo-yeon / I think I would’ve felt really good too, but

133
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,299
Seo-yeon / It’s become more of a friendship zone now

134
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,144
Seo-yeon / My feelings are more like a friend’s

135
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,603
Hee-young / When that secret was revealed

136
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,483
Hee-young / Seo-yeon made such a strong impact

137
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:04,917
Hee-young / And because I saw how she struggled

138
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,919
Hee-young / I wanted to support her as a friend

139
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,411
Hee-young / I really wanted to cheer her on

140
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,080
Hee-young / And that came from a genuine, human affection

141
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,014
Hee-young / It was support from that place

142
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:15,284
Hee-young / I just hoped she wouldn’t be bound by it too much

143
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,252
Hee-young / Really hoped that

144
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,521
Hee-young / And with the little time we have left

145
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:21,357
Hee-young / I thought we should give it another try here

146
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,293
Hee-young / I used to think she was just doing everything herself

147
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:27,039
Hee-young / And struggling with something unknown

148
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,842
Hee-young / But I realized that wasn’t the case

149
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,744
Hee-young / So I decided to call Seo-yeon

150
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,352
Seo-yeon / What the heck?

151
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,155
Seo-yeon / What the heck?

152
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,726
Seo-yeon / Oh no

153
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,317
Seo-yeon / Ugh... again today

154
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:51,831
Seo-yeon / I failed at expressing my feelings

155
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,689
Hee-young / You failed at expressing your feelings?

156
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:54,357
Seo-yeon / Yeah

157
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,691
Hee-young / Why?

158
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,938
Seo-yeon / I don’t know, I just failed

159
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,197
Seo-yeon / Ugh I can't do it today

160
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:01,998
Hee-young / Are you crying again?

161
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:02,798
Seo-yeon / No no

162
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,166
Hee-young / Why?

163
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,168
Seo-yeon / No I just can't do it today

164
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:06,779
Hee-young / Why?

165
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,971
Seo-yeon / I mean it’s call day today

166
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,206
Hee-young / Call day?

167
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,407
Seo-yeon / I just can’t make a call today

168
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,408
Hee-young / Why?

169
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,610
Seo-yeon / Then why does it say Hoban Construction University?

170
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,923
Hee-young / What are you even talking about?

171
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:17,823
Seo-yeon / Wasn’t it you?

172
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,027
Hee-young / It said to call the person you’re interested in

173
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,655
Seo-yeon / I thought it said Hoban Construction University

174
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,200
Hee-young / What are you saying

175
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,527
Seo-yeon / Ugh... now I’m overthinking it again

176
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:35,131
Hee-young / So who were you interested in?

177
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,976
Hee-young / Call them!

178
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,844
Seo-yeon / Ugh...

179
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,202
Hee-young / What?

180
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,338
Seo-yeon / It's not that easy

181
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,973
Hee-young / Why?

182
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,885
Seo-yeon / It's just not that easy

183
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,178
Hee-young / Why are you being shy again?

184
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,523
Hee-young / Don’t overthink it

185
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,281
Hee-young / Just call the person you're drawn to

186
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:56,462
Seo-yeon / How could I just call?

187
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:58,764
Hee-young / Are you crying?

188
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,324
Hee-young / Are you crying?

189
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,526
Seo-yeon / How could I just call?

190
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,771
Hee-young / Why why why why why? What’s the reason?

191
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,645
Hee-young / How can’t you call?

192
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:13,479
Seo-yeon / Yeah

193
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,204
Hee-young / Why can’t you?

194
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,806
Hee-young / Do you live your life not calling people?

195
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,918
Hee-young / You have phone anxiety?

196
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,821
Hee-young / Are you a phobiac? Phone phobia?

197
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,958
Hee-young / Call phobia maybe?
Seo-yeon / How do I even call?

198
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:28,384
Hee-young / Have you written a note so far?

199
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,963
Seo-yeon / At least I’ve written notes

200
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,091
Hee-young / So you've made a choice

201
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:38,760
Seo-yeon / But I can't make a call

202
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:41,641
Hee-young / You have to let them know you exist so they recognize you

203
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,966
Hee-young / And weren’t you happy I called you?

204
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,879
Seo-yeon / But you...

205
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,438
Hee-young / I called with sincerity

206
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,441
Hee-young / This wasn’t just because you were the first...

207
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,520
Hee-young / Not because we haven’t met

208
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,379
Hee-young / The way you’ve been so far

209
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:59,848
Hee-young / I’ve come to understand it, and it gave life

210
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,950
Hee-young / to your character

211
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,830
Hee-young / So the things you’ve done actually feel good to me

212
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,499
Seo-yeon / Because you understand me?

213
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,891
Hee-young / If your actions hadn’t come from your real self

214
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,302
Hee-young / maybe I wouldn’t get it

215
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,494
Hee-young / But once I knew, I felt

216
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,895
Hee-young / you were really being honest

217
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,974
Hee-young / That really struck me

218
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:16,241
Seo-yeon / Really?

219
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,110
Hee-young / Yeah that’s how I felt

220
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,272
Hee-young / Is this mine?

221
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,941
Hee-young / Hello?

222
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,911
Yeah... what are you doing?

223
00:11:29,921 --> 00:11:32,091
Hee-young / Who is this?

224
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,296
Min-woo / This is Min-woo

225
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,056
Hee-young / Ah... ah... uh...

226
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,959
Min-woo / Where are you? What are you doing?
Hee-young / I’m in my... room

227
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,640
Min-woo / You're in your room? Hmm...

228
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,085
Hee-young / What the! It’s over!

229
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,190
Hee-young / I thought it wouldn’t come if I didn’t do it

230
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,748
Hee-young / But at some point, she’s always right beside me

231
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:09,962
Hee-young / She expresses it so I can’t not know

232
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,230
Hee-young / Thank you

233
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,740
Min-woo / I guess I should head to the room...

234
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,534
Min-woo / When I saw I could make a 30-second call

235
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,838
Min-woo / I knew I had to call Hee-young no matter what

236
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:33,342
Min-woo / I felt that might be the only way she’d even start to get it

237
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,744
Min-woo / She doesn’t seem like someone

238
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,012
Min-woo / who likes people coming on too strong

239
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,391
Min-woo / So I didn’t want to overwhelm her

240
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,050
Min-woo / But I didn’t realize 30 seconds would feel that short

241
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,396
Seo-yeon / Was it Min-woo?

242
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,721
Hee-young / Huh? I don’t know!

243
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,857
Seo-yeon / It was Min-woo, come on

244
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:48,991
Seo-yeon / Min-woo’s nice

245
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,160
Hee-young / I really have no clue

246
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,372
Seo-yeon / Min-woo's nice and pretty too

247
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,513
Seo-yeon / Ugh... I’m going crazy
Hee-young / You should do it

248
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,918
Seo-yeon / What happens if I don’t?
Hee-young / Hey, do it for yourself, not for someone else

249
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,554
Hee-young / Not for others
Seo-yeon / What happens if I don’t?

250
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,257
Hee-young / Then you don’t, that’s all

251
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,890
Seo-yeon / Ah

252
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,326
Seo-yeon / I was going to just let it all go

253
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,361
Seo-yeon / But today’s a special call day

254
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:27,862
Seo-yeon / It’s not like the anonymous notes

255
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:31,700
Seo-yeon / You can recognize me by my voice

256
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,670
Seo-yeon / And I can hear and feel their voice too

257
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,950
Seo-yeon / We can share something through that

258
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,587
Seo-yeon / It’s a chance to tell them directly, “I’m interested in you”

259
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,346
Seo-yeon / It’s a rare opportunity

260
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,548
Seo-yeon / So I thought I should at least try or I’d regret it

261
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:49,829
Seo-yeon / I didn’t want to be left wondering

262
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,996
Hello?

263
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,466
Seo-yeon / Hi

264
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:41,347
Da-gyo / Hello?

265
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,883
Da-gyo / Huh? Hello?

266
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,643
Seo-yeon / Hi

267
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:51,690
Da-gyo / Huh? Hello?

268
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:59,131
Seo-yeon / Hi
Da-gyo / Huh? Hi?

269
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,504
Da-gyo / What...

270
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,543
Da-gyo / Huh?

271
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,744
Seo-yeon / It was really short, I was so surprised

272
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,645
Seo-yeon / But after it ended

273
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,748
Seo-yeon / It wasn’t even anything big, but still

274
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:31,086
Seo-yeon / I wasn’t trying to get her to understand my feelings

275
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,155
Seo-yeon / I just wanted to feel a little lighter

276
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,301
Seo-yeon / I think I just wanted to get rid of any regrets

277
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,203
Seo-yeon / It felt kind of freeing

278
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,863
Seo-yeon / Like really...

279
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,765
Seo-yeon / Like I finally had no lingering feelings

280
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:45,577
Seo-yeon / It felt clean

281
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,641
Da-gyo / Huh?

282
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,453
Da-gyo / Like this?

283
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:58,747
Da-gyo / Did you hear what they said?

284
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,548
Mi-rang / No

285
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,617
Da-gyo / Okay

286
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,852
Da-gyo / It was just those two words

287
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,920
Da-gyo / But hearing the weight of it

288
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,056
Da-gyo / I thought, “Was that Seo-yeon?”

289
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:11,593
Da-gyo / I think I guessed it was Seo-yeon because of the secret

290
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,295
Da-gyo / Since she said she’d never dated

291
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,175
Da-gyo / I was just really thankful she had the courage to call

292
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,936
Mi-rang / Hee-young! You shared a room with Da-gyo

293
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,104
Mi-rang / And she had feelings for you

294
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:25,551
Mi-rang / She definitely flirted with you

295
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:28,687
Mi-rang / Didn’t that make you feel a little drawn to her?

296
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,526
Da-gyo / Honestly I was like, “How do I make this call?”

297
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,561
Da-gyo / It was driving me crazy

298
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,186
Da-gyo / The whole thing was just so embarrassing

299
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:40,055
Da-gyo / I knew exactly who I wanted to call

300
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,891
Da-gyo / But actually calling them...

301
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,670
Da-gyo / I had no idea what to say

302
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,578
Da-gyo / What should I say?

303
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,503
Da-gyo / I kept thinking about what I wanted to say

304
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,938
Da-gyo / It’s only 30 seconds, so what can I even say?

305
00:16:56,948 --> 00:16:59,040
Da-gyo / Anyway, when I heard her secret that day

306
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,610
Da-gyo / That she had ADHD

307
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,544
Da-gyo / I felt a little sorry

308
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,723
Da-gyo / But even so, she tried so hard to be kind to me

309
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,091
Da-gyo / She remembered what I said

310
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,984
Da-gyo / And tried to take care of me in all these ways

311
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,520
Da-gyo / So today I didn’t want to be vague

312
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,399
Da-gyo / That’s why I made the call

313
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,558
Mi-rang / Hello?

314
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:20,094
Da-gyo / Unnie, it’s me, Da-gyo

315
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,440
Mi-rang / Hello?

316
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:25,544
Da-gyo / Mi-rang, it’s me, Da-gyo

317
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:29,748
Da-gyo / I heard your secret today

318
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:34,443
Da-gyo / I think I beat around the bush too much yesterday

319
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,512
Da-gyo / I felt really bad about that

320
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,491
Da-gyo / It wasn’t confusing today, was it?

321
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:44,263
Mi-rang / Yeah, you were honest

322
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,655
Mi-rang / So I understood everything
Da-gyo / Okay

323
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,634
Mi-rang / Alright, hang up

324
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:56,542
Mi-rang / Ah

325
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,681
Mi-rang / What’s wrong with her?

326
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,216
Da-gyo / When she said it wasn’t confusing today

327
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:18,964
Da-gyo / My face turned bright red as I came out

328
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,633
Da-gyo / I was just really happy

329
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,893
Da-gyo / Ugh, it’s so hot

330
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,772
Da-gyo / Oh gosh

331
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,697
Mi-rang / Did you fall?

332
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,532
Da-gyo / Whoa! What? Why are you here?

333
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,845
Da-gyo / Oh, you were here

334
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,248
Da-gyo / No, I didn’t fall...

335
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,539
Da-gyo / I have so much to say, but I’ll just stay quiet

336
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:40,775
Da-gyo / My heart’s racing too fast

337
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:44,545
Mi-rang / Things to say? I guess for me too

338
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:47,926
Mi-rang / That moment has to come before I can say them?

339
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,852
Da-gyo / I don’t know I don’t know I don’t know

340
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,221
Da-gyo / You haven’t done yours yet either

341
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:56,058
Da-gyo / Ever since I came here

342
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,827
Da-gyo / My health’s been bad

343
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,307
Da-gyo / My heart's not doing well

344
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:17,589
Mi-rang / I’ll be back—ahh!

345
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:22,227
Mi-rang / This is so hard to decide

346
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,790
Mi-rang / I kept thinking, "How can I express my feelings"

347
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,337
Mi-rang / "in a clearer way?"

348
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,106
Mi-rang / So I tried to organize what to say

349
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:37,109
Mi-rang / Ah seriously

350
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,713
Mi-rang / Ah... 30 seconds

351
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:51,323
Mi-rang / I thought I wouldn’t be nervous, but I was shaking so much

352
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,231
Da-gyo / Mi-rang left and the phone didn’t ring

353
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,533
Da-gyo / So I was like, what’s going on?

354
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,305
Mi-rang / Ugh... I’m so nervous

355
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,313
Da-gyo / Hello?

356
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:27,426
Mi-rang / It’s me, Mi-rang

357
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,527
Da-gyo / Yeah

358
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,399
Da-gyo / Huh?

359
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:38,293
Mi-rang / I like you more each day

360
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:42,931
Mi-rang / I miss you, and I get jealous too

361
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,376
Mi-rang / And...

362
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:54,776
Mi-rang / Anyway, I miss you even now

363
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:58,857
Mi-rang / I’m coming to see you right now

364
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:09,067
Mi-rang / I think I fully expressed how I feel

365
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:18,000
Da-gyo / Even after the call, my heart felt like it would burst

366
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,634
Da-gyo / I was so embarrassed

367
00:21:19,644 --> 00:21:21,813
Da-gyo / A note is just writing

368
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,149
Da-gyo / But hearing her voice...

369
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,375
Da-gyo / And when all this ends

370
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,586
Da-gyo / We still have to sleep in the same room

371
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,554
Da-gyo / What do I do tonight?

372
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,856
Da-gyo / That’s what I’m thinking

373
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,929
Da-gyo / Why’d you get here so fast?

374
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,875
Da-gyo / Is it because your legs are long?

375
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:51,599
Da-gyo / Are your legs that long? Why so fast...

376
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:53,578
Mi-rang / I ran
Da-gyo / You ran?

377
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:54,246
Mi-rang / Yeah

378
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:54,913
Da-gyo / Why?

379
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,251
Da-gyo / Why’d you run?

380
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,820
Da-gyo / I just hung up and you were already back

381
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:02,988
Da-gyo / You scared me...

382
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:03,955
Da-gyo / Wow

383
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:10,852
Mi-rang / I think it’s even more embarrassing since we share a room

384
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:16,368
Da-gyo / Weren’t you the one who wanted to share a room?

385
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:21,073
Da-gyo / At this rate, my face is going to explode

386
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,810
Mi-rang / Ah... What do I do

387
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,975
Da-gyo / This whole situation is driving me crazy

388
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,977
Da-gyo / We're both losing it

389
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,046
Da-gyo / We’re so close, but it’s overwhelming

390
00:22:39,056 --> 00:22:41,449
Da-gyo / I don’t know what to do

391
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:44,162
Da-gyo / Thinking back on it, it’s just too...

392
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,465
Da-gyo / Too hot in here

393
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:50,702
Ri-won / Oh! A letter of the heart!

394
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,942
Han-kyul / Wait a sec

395
00:22:57,776 --> 00:23:00,045
Han-kyul / I... I’ll head out in ten seconds

396
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,213
Han-kyul / 10, 9

397
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:08,186
Han-kyul / 8, 7, 6

398
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,388
Ri-won / Go on

399
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,289
Han-kyul / I’ll be back

400
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:18,296
Han-kyul / Let’s get it

401
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:49,017
Han-kyul / I felt like I had to reply to the one who called me

402
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:51,420
Han-kyul / And I had something I wanted to say too

403
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,833
Han-kyul / It was the perfect time to say it

404
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,565
Jin-ah / Hold on

405
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:04,866
Jin-ah / Hello?

406
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:07,312
Han-kyul / Hello?

407
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,080
Jin-ah / Ugh this is so unfair

408
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,950
Jin-ah / Just because I called first

409
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,944
Jin-ah / Ugh...

410
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,980
Jin-ah / Now I made this boring

411
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:22,049
Han-kyul / I... I’m Han-kyul

412
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:25,030
Jin-ah / Of course I know, I recognize your voice

413
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,522
Han-kyul / I...

414
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:31,136
Han-kyul / From what I’ve heard here, someone’s...

415
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:36,308
Han-kyul / ...past story

416
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,013
Jin-ah / Is he stupid?

417
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:48,310
Han-kyul / That story... was yours

418
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,923
Han-kyul / Oh, it was 30 seconds

419
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:55,817
Han-kyul / It really was 30 seconds

420
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,487
Han-kyul / I just saw the keyword "call" and rushed it

421
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,367
Han-kyul / I didn’t realize how short 30 seconds really is

422
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,303
Han-kyul / But it was...

423
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,263
Han-kyul / I thought it was beautiful

424
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,376
Han-kyul / Honestly, I was a bit flustered

425
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,868
Han-kyul / The call had ended but

426
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:15,480
Han-kyul / I just kept talking

427
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,707
Han-kyul / I just wanted to say it

428
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:22,554
Jin-ah / Everyone here is just a bunch of fools

429
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,111
Da-gyo / Why?

430
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,490
Jin-ah / Did you say everything you wanted to in 30 seconds?

431
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,516
Da-gyo / Everything? Yeah, I did

432
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,819
Jin-ah / I got cut off mid-sentence

433
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,087
Jin-ah / After the call ended, that girl...

434
00:25:33,097 --> 00:25:35,824
Jin-ah / must have felt so awkward

435
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,126
Jin-ah / And thinking about that

436
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,228
Jin-ah / I felt embarrassed for no reason

437
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,463
Jin-ah / So I just blamed myself

438
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,507
Jin-ah / "Ugh, Jin-ah!"

439
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:46,234
Jin-ah / "Why did you go first and make it boring?"

440
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,946
Jin-ah / If I hadn’t taken those 5 seconds

441
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:50,916
Jin-ah / She might not have looked like such a fool

442
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:52,840
Jin-ah / It was funny though

443
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,810
Jin-ah / Honestly, ever since I got to the house

444
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,623
Jin-ah / That whole conversation up to now

445
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,760
Jin-ah / Was heaven

446
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,353
Ri-won / Did you write your heart letter?

447
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,288
Han-kyul / I feel like throwing up

448
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,422
Ri-won / You were so fast

449
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,967
Han-kyul / The time was seriously...

450
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,634
Ri-won / Huh?

451
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,303
Han-kyul / They gave no time at all

452
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:11,836
Ri-won / Huh?

453
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,094
Han-kyul / Really, no time at all

454
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,406
Ri-won / What do you mean?

455
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,430
Ri-won / They rushed you?

456
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,099
Han-kyul / You'll know once you go see
Ri-won / Really?

457
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,845
Ri-won / I really want to write it quickly though

458
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:23,682
Han-kyul / Phew~

459
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:29,878
Ri-won / I think Han-kyul called Jin-ah

460
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,547
Ri-won / What is it that I don't have?

461
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:35,216
Ri-won / That Jin-ah has

462
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,952
Ri-won / What do I lack?

463
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:41,289
Ri-won / What was it about Jin-ah that moved Han-kyul’s heart?

464
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:45,427
Ri-won / And Han-kyul vaguely said she had only dated younger people before

465
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,028
Ri-won / And that she wanted to date someone her age

466
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,598
Ri-won / To have a more equal kind of relationship

467
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,876
Ri-won / But Jin-ah’s not young

468
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,442
Ri-won / Ugh, I think it's me

469
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,344
Han-kyul / Go on now

470
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,578
Ri-won / Okay, I’m going

471
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,323
Han-kyul / This time, I really want to say this

472
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,426
Han-kyul / Don’t go to the same person again. Go to someone else!

473
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,620
Ri-won / Okay, I’ll call a person

474
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,357
Han-kyul / I think this is your only chance to do that

475
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,801
Han-kyul / It could be a turning point

476
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,572
Han-kyul / So go!
Ri-won / Okay

477
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:26,034
Han-kyul / With Ri-won, I kept thinking, 'Why is she caring about me and not herself?'

478
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:30,939
Han-kyul / So I felt thankful and sorry at the same time

479
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:36,021
Han-kyul / But to be honest, I didn’t really feel any romantic feelings

480
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,196
Ri-won / I really hate this

481
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:55,096
Ri-won / Normally I don’t take long to write a note

482
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,966
Ri-won / But I really hesitated when it came to calling

483
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,002
Ri-won / Because you get an immediate response on the phone

484
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,505
Ri-won / You can instantly see their reaction too

485
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,306
Ri-won / Right before I left, Han-kyul said

486
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,677
Ri-won / “Don’t call the person you’ve been writing notes to!”

487
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,455
Ri-won / That’s what she told me

488
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:14,616
Ri-won / So I thought, ‘Should I call someone else for her sake?’

489
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:19,531
Ri-won / But… that would be a lie

490
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,549
Ri-won / Hello?

491
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,953
Ri-won / Uh...

492
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,181
Ri-won / Hmm

493
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:51,886
Ri-won / It’s just… ever since the date today

494
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:56,458
Ri-won / They said to call the person you like

495
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,939
Han-kyul / You really don't listen, do you

496
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,432
Ri-won / I called the person I like

497
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,945
Ri-won / Yeah...

498
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,821
Han-kyul / Don’t keep making me feel bad, seriously...!

499
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,925
Ri-won / From Han-kyul’s perspective

500
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,028
Ri-won / I don’t think she understands why I like her

501
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,797
Ri-won / Like, “Why me?”

502
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,209
Ri-won / She seems to keep wondering that

503
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,201
Ri-won / I'm not a fool, you know

504
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:41,503
Ri-won / I know too

505
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,471
Ri-won / Of course I know

506
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,708
Ri-won / But I just...

507
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,476
Ri-won / Ended up liking Han-kyul

508
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:52,080
Ri-won / When I first sent her a note

509
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,315
Ri-won / It wasn’t really like that

510
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:58,429
Ri-won / But without realizing it, little by little...

511
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,755
Ri-won / That’s how it happened

512
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:02,934
Ri-won / What am I supposed to do

513
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,663
Ri-won / Why are you scolding me?

514
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,064
Han-kyul / Ri-won!

515
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,433
Han-kyul / I told you, didn’t I

516
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,102
Ri-won / Why are you getting mad?

517
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:18,106
Han-kyul / I told you to go for someone else

518
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,643
Ri-won / But you also told me to call the person I like

519
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,978
Han-kyul / Still

520
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:27,015
Han-kyul / That feeling of...

521
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,894
Han-kyul / Waiting for a reply that might never come—don’t you regret that time?

522
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:32,353
Ri-won / I don’t regret it at all

523
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,699
Han-kyul / But then you don’t gain anything

524
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:39,204
Ri-won / Why do you think that?

525
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:42,040
Han-kyul / Do you think there’s still something to gain from this?

526
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:46,044
Ri-won / Yes!

527
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,982
Han-kyul / Geez...

528
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:55,019
Han-kyul / Seriously...

529
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,690
Han-kyul / Why do you keep making me feel so sorry

530
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:03,885
Ri-won / You said you were sorry about that before

531
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,264
Ri-won / But today...

532
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:14,839
Han-kyul / Please stop making me feel bad

533
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,400
Ri-won / What do you want me to do?

534
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:23,838
Han-kyul / Can’t you open yourself up to other possibilities with different people?

535
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,783
Han-kyul / I think you still have enough time to do that

536
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:33,024
Ri-won / I’m just not the kind of person who can do that

537
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,160
Ri-won / I felt like I was about to cry

538
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,430
Ri-won / So I didn’t think I could say anything more

539
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,009
Ri-won / I was holding back tears so much

540
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,203
Ri-won / I’m going to go get some water

541
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,715
Han-kyul / I’m gonna have a beer

542
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:18,059
Ri-won / I could never cry in front of Han-kyul

543
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,595
Ri-won / So I just stayed in the bathroom

544
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:25,410
Ri-won / Ever since the phone call

545
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:28,102
Ri-won / I kept feeling like I was going to cry, even though I didn’t want to

546
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,214
Ri-won / So I went back in

547
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:35,510
Ri-won / But if I cry, how would Han-kyul feel?

548
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,748
Ri-won / I’ll never cry in front of Han-kyul again

549
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:44,262
Ri-won / Never in front of Han-kyul

550
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,836
Jin-ah / I didn’t say this because I thought I had a delusion of grandeur

551
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:04,449
Jin-ah / And Ri-won unnie told me she liked Han-kyul

552
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,550
Jin-ah / She said it clearly

553
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,875
Jin-ah / But then with Han-kyul and me

554
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:11,389
Jin-ah / Ever since we talked about my job and books

555
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:15,016
Jin-ah / We’ve been making eye contact so much

556
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:20,621
Jin-ah / Before that, we never made eye contact
Da-gyo / With Han-kyul?

557
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:24,625
Jin-ah / I was even avoiding talking to her
Da-gyo / You talked a lot today though

558
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,404
Jin-ah / That’s because

559
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,797
Jin-ah / Han-kyul suddenly stopped calling me unnie

560
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,466
Jin-ah / and started calling me “you”

561
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,968
Da-gyo / Seriously? Since when?

562
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,747
Jin-ah / I was giving an example with younger people

563
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:36,904
Da-gyo / Right after that?

564
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:37,805
Da-gyo / When did you talk about that?

565
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:42,086
Da-gyo / After your secret talk? While sitting?
Jin-ah / Yeah, after the secret talk, we had a chat

566
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:46,957
Jin-ah / I was worried it’d leave a trauma in her subconsciously
Da-gyo / After that conversation

567
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,627
Jin-ah / The experience I kept feeling here

568
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,285
Jin-ah / The shrinking experience

569
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:54,032
Jin-ah / Being all timid in front of members

570
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,125
Jin-ah / Should we go to the living room?

571
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,036
Da-gyo / Shall we head out?

572
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,002
Jin-ah / Like calling names, for example

573
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:10,314
Jin-ah / Until now it’s always been "Unnie, I’m your fan"

574
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,283
Jin-ah / "Unnie, let’s talk about books" and then suddenly

575
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,841
Jin-ah / From that moment she started saying “you too”

576
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,643
Jin-ah / Like that, nonstop

577
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,111
Da-gyo / That’s honestly really cute though

578
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,825
Da-gyo / You can tell when someone’s being obvious like that
Jin-ah / That too, yeah

579
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:24,662
Da-gyo / So did you call Han-kyul today?

580
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:28,132
Jin-ah / That Han-kyul is such a dummy

581
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:31,636
Jin-ah / She just dropped the call knowing I know her past

582
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,632
Da-gyo / Wait what? She called you?

583
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,833
Da-gyo / You two called each other?

584
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:39,410
Jin-ah / Yep hehe

585
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,403
Jin-ah / And the funniest thing is

586
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,282
Jin-ah / Han-kyul said she asked me out yesterday

587
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:45,550
Da-gyo / Seriously?

588
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,574
Jin-ah / That’s why it got messy

589
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:49,787
Jin-ah / That mess with Hee-young unnie yesterday

590
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,589
Jin-ah / They couldn’t go on the date

591
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,192
Da-gyo / Oh my gosh, really?

592
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:59,831
Da-gyo / I’m seriously shocked~

593
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,357
Jin-ah / During the kart ride, Han-kyul told me

594
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:05,493
Jin-ah / She asked me out

595
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:09,340
Jin-ah / What kind of girl says "I asked you out"? That’s exciting

596
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,174
Jin-ah / How could I not feel butterflies?

597
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,982
Jin-ah / So it’s funny to me

598
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:19,717
Jin-ah / We weren’t even having a serious emotional call

599
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,075
Jin-ah / Saying “I like you” or anything

600
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:23,845
Da-gyo / Yeah, I was really surprised too honestly

601
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,914
Da-gyo / I really didn’t see that coming

602
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,549
Jin-ah / What I thought was—

603
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:32,085
Jin-ah / If she were older than me, I think I would’ve liked her

604
00:35:32,095 --> 00:35:33,431
Jin-ah / You know that kind of vibe?

605
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,701
Da-gyo / I seriously love this kind of relationship

606
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,459
Da-gyo / I never saw that coming
Jin-ah / That’s why I find it fun now

607
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,928
Jin-ah / Now that I’ve fallen into this relationship too

608
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:43,040
Jin-ah / At first I was only clinging to Hee-young unnie

609
00:35:43,074 --> 00:35:44,242
Jin-ah / But now

610
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,934
Jin-ah / Honestly speaking, I knew we weren’t a match

611
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,368
Jin-ah / But I kept trying to make it work

612
00:35:48,378 --> 00:35:50,013
Jin-ah / And I think that’s what caused this mess

613
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,460
Min-woo / But now

614
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,129
Min-woo / I got three notes yesterday

615
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:11,058
Min-woo / Not all of them were nice, though

616
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:15,006
Min-woo / One of them looked like your handwriting

617
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:19,400
Mi-rang / Huh? Me?, I didn’t write anything to you

618
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,104
Min-woo / No, not a love note
Mi-rang / A sabotage one?

619
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,206
Mi-rang / Not at all

620
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,942
Mi-rang / What’s wrong with my handwriting, seriously

621
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,788
Mi-rang / Why does everyone assume the messy one is mine?

622
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,627
Mi-rang / I wrote a sabotage note to Hee-young

623
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,522
Min-woo / Oh then maybe the two of you...

624
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:45,403
Min-woo / Maybe there really *is* something going on

625
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:51,731
Mi-rang / But today, after their date

626
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:54,178
Mi-rang / They seem a lot closer now

627
00:36:55,112 --> 00:37:00,051
Mi-rang / I feel like Hee-young might’ve called Da-gyo

628
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,146
Min-woo / But now

629
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:08,526
Min-woo / From what I feel

630
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,531
Min-woo / Since I share a room with Seo-yeon

631
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,334
Min-woo / We say it’s friendship but

632
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:18,869
Min-woo / I thought it was Seo-yeon

633
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,674
Min-woo / I think it was after she revealed her secret

634
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,500
Min-woo / Hee-young is more emotional than I thought

635
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,670
Min-woo / She has more sensitivity

636
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,516
Min-woo / That’s the impression I got

637
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:50,434
Mi-rang / Unnie!

638
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,670
Mi-rang / What’s wrong?

639
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,093
Ri-won / Don’t talk to me

640
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:40,374
Ri-won / If you’re feeling uncomfortable right now

641
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:45,890
Ri-won / I really don’t have any intention of making you feel that way

642
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,318
Ri-won / I keep picking you, right?

643
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:54,131
Ri-won / Is that maybe too much for you? Does it feel uncomfortable?

644
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,493
Han-kyul / I’m going to be really honest

645
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,897
Han-kyul / Is there really no one else here you’re interested in besides me?

646
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:07,268
Ri-won / If I go back to the beginning

647
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:12,540
Ri-won / When I first got here, there wasn’t anyone I liked

648
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,109
Ri-won / I didn’t have anyone in mind

649
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,579
Ri-won / But they told us to pick someone based on first impression

650
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:22,216
Ri-won / Seo-yeon’s smile looked really pretty

651
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,952
Ri-won / So I picked Seo-yeon and said “You have a nice smile”

652
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:28,566
Ri-won / Then I started talking to you

653
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:33,861
Ri-won / And somehow I started developing feelings for you

654
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,331
Ri-won / Then when I had to write a note

655
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:40,067
Ri-won / I couldn’t think of anyone else but you

656
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:45,139
Ri-won / So I wrote you the note, and my feelings grew stronger

657
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:49,920
Ri-won / I kept writing it because I liked you

658
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,549
Ri-won / If I write one again, it’ll be for you

659
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,785
Ri-won / But if that’s too much for you

660
00:39:57,795 --> 00:40:00,755
Ri-won / And if it makes you feel sorry or uncomfortable

661
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:04,058
Ri-won / Then I’ll write to someone else if you want me to

662
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:09,206
“But it won’t be because I like that person”

663
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:21,242
Ri-won / I kind of felt like you kept feeling sorry toward me

664
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:25,556
Ri-won / That’s how it felt to me

665
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:31,385
Ri-won / But I’ve never once expected you to write a note for me

666
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:32,853
Ri-won / Not even once

667
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:36,924
Han-kyul / But that makes me feel even more sorry

668
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:42,596
Han-kyul / Why don’t you even consider writing to someone else?

669
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,499
Han-kyul / Is it just because you’re worried I’ll get zero votes?

670
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,202
Ri-won / It wasn’t like that the whole time—it was just at first

671
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:50,738
Ri-won / Just at the beginning

672
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:56,610
Han-kyul / But if you don’t write one for me, you think I’ll end up with zero votes

673
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,792
Han-kyul / But I wouldn’t be hurt by that

674
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,819
Han-kyul / And even if you keep writing to me

675
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,787
Han-kyul / I won’t get annoyed

676
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:11,158
Han-kyul / But I think I’ll just keep feeling sorry about it

677
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:22,146
Han-kyul / So if you don’t want to pretend, just be honest with yourself

678
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,548
Ri-won / Yeah, honestly, I don’t want to pretend

679
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,974
Ri-won / That’s not who I am

680
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,344
Ri-won / And I want you

681
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:34,758
Ri-won / To keep writing to the person you really want to

682
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:45,726
Ri-won / When I got here and looked around

683
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:48,295
Ri-won / You just looked like a good person to me

684
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,798
Ri-won / So I just kept writing to you

685
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:53,901
Ri-won / But because you keep feeling sorry, I start overthinking it

686
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,603
Ri-won / You really don’t need to feel sorry

687
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,848
Han-kyul / But I do feel sorry

688
00:41:57,948 --> 00:41:59,683
Han-kyul / And you feel bothered that I feel that way

689
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,577
Ri-won / But there’s no reason to

690
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:07,014
Ri-won / It’s not like this is my last chance in life or anything

691
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,082
Han-kyul / Of course it’s not

692
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,628
Ri-won / So why do you keep apologizing?

693
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,859
Han-kyul / Maybe...

694
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:22,306
Han-kyul / Feeling sorry itself might actually be ignoring your feelings

695
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:37,988
Han-kyul / It’s your heart—we can’t tell you what to do with it

696
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:43,217
Han-kyul / Honestly, at first, I just felt sorry

697
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,830
Han-kyul / I kept thinking, “Why is she caring about me instead of herself?”

698
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,834
Han-kyul / I felt thankful and sorry

699
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:54,662
Han-kyul / But now that I think about it, maybe being sorry itself

700
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:58,365
Han-kyul / Might be kind of rude, in a way

701
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:02,413
Han-kyul / Because I’m not really in a position to make a choice here

702
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:07,107
Han-kyul / Feelings like guilt, anxiety, gratitude

703
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:09,653
Han-kyul / Trying to balance all those emotions

704
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:15,626
"I’m trying to stay centered in comfort"

705
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,997
"I just want you to be happy"

706
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:33,410
"and doing well"

707
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,537
Han-kyul / You’re already doing well enough

708
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:40,174
Han-kyul / So you don’t have to worry about me so much

709
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:44,178
Han-kyul / I’ve already received so much of your heart

710
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:47,157
"Thank you so much"

711
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:52,386
Han-kyul / Since sharing a room has been hard on you

712
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,555
Han-kyul / I thought maybe you were worried

713
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,901
Han-kyul / That my note box would be empty, so you kept filling it

714
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:03,197
Han-kyul / Just do whatever you feel like doing

715
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:07,878
Han-kyul / I’ll do the same
Ri-won / Yeah, do what you want

716
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,858
Seo-yeon / What do you think we’ll do today?

717
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:34,361
Hee-young / Have you ever seen me try to guess?

718
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:35,496
Seo-yeon / True

719
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,898
Hee-young / I just go, “Oh, so that’s what we’re doing”

720
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:40,901
Hee-young / and go along with it

721
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:44,271
Hee-young / It’s just the two of us in the room now instead of three

722
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:44,972
Hee-young / I love it

723
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,409
Hee-young / We get more space in the closet now

724
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:52,446
Hee-young / And I changed the bedsheets

725
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:55,259
Hee-young / I feel... really good

726
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:00,587
Seo-yeon / What’s that?

727
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:02,356
Seo-yeon / Hinoki?

728
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,457
Hee-young / Want me to spray it?

729
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:04,535
Seo-yeon / No, I’m good

730
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,860
Seo-yeon / It smells so nice

731
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,728
Hee-young / Right? It’s good, huh?
 

732
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:08,328
Hee-young / Right?
Seo-yeon / Yeah

733
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,531
Hee-young / I’ve always liked hinoki wood

734
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:11,965
Seo-yeon / When I woke up this morning

735
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:14,902
Seo-yeon / Having a new roommate felt unfamiliar

736
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,703
Seo-yeon / I could still feel

737
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:17,938
Seo-yeon / Mi-rang unnie’s absence a little

738
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,807
Seo-yeon / But since we’re friends, it felt nice too

739
00:45:20,817 --> 00:45:21,985
Seo-yeon / It felt fresh and good

740
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,054
Ri-won / I was feeling really unsettled yesterday

741
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,957
Ri-won / So I couldn’t bring myself to speak easily

742
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,025
Ri-won / I kept thinking, ‘What should I even say?’

743
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:41,605
Ri-won / I think I spent the time preparing while thinking about that

744
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:53,073
Mi-rang / The person I wanted to see first in the morning was Da-gyo

745
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,753
Mi-rang / I felt butterflies when I opened my eyes and saw her beside me

746
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,283
Mi-rang / Oh, there was water
Da-gyo / Yeah

747
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:04,795
Mi-rang / It’s cold

748
00:46:06,496 --> 00:46:07,988
Da-gyo / Thanks

749
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:11,291
Da-gyo / To be honest, compared to when I shared with Hee-young unnie

750
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:14,828
Da-gyo / I was more conscious when I woke up this morning

751
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,296
Da-gyo / That feeling was the biggest

752
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:19,142
Da-gyo / I kept being aware of it when I woke up

753
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,337
Jin-ah / But I slept so well in that room

754
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,772
Da-gyo / It was so peaceful

755
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:29,343
Min-woo / It’s been so long since I slept that soundly

756
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:33,747
Jin-ah / I need total silence when I sleep
Min-woo / I just passed out

757
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:37,251
Min-woo / I love that the room feels bigger now

758
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,820
Min-woo / Once it became a 1-on-1 room, I slept really well

759
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,255
Min-woo / I felt so refreshed

760
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:44,201
Min-woo / And Jin-ah, she’s actually really funny

761
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:45,926
Da-gyo / Jin-ah unnie!

762
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:46,660
Jin-ah / Yeah?

763
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,128
Da-gyo / You have to let me know when you leave

764
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,096
Jin-ah / Let’s go together

765
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,330
Jin-ah / How could I go alone?

766
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,175
Jin-ah / I’m totally nervous right now

767
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,512
Da-gyo / Don’t be nervous, girl~

768
00:46:55,912 --> 00:46:59,339
Jin-ah / Ri-won unnie kind of yelled at me last night

769
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:01,842
Jin-ah / I felt bad for hurting her feelings

770
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:04,745
Jin-ah / But I found out the person I liked liked me back

771
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:07,447
Jin-ah / So, um...

772
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:12,486
Jin-ah / This morning felt like that happiness got a bit shattered

773
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:15,999
Jin-ah / So I went feeling pretty scared

774
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:21,995
Hee-young / Your face looks good

775
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,763
Hee-young / You actually look more relaxed

776
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:26,199
Ri-won / I feel like my craziness is coming back

777
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:28,535
Da-gyo / You totally look like an idol

778
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:29,235
Hee-young / That’s encouraging

779
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:31,338
Ri-won / I feel more like myself again

780
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,907
Hee-young / Pretty girls are the best

781
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:36,243
Ri-won / Han-kyul’s swelling is completely gone today, right?

782
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,254
Hee-young / Oh, you’re right!

783
00:47:37,253 --> 00:47:39,145
Ri-won / What the—what did you do? What did you do before bed?

784
00:47:39,155 --> 00:47:40,347
Hee-young / She hasn’t been crying lately

785
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,792
Han-kyul / Yeah, I didn’t cry last night

786
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:46,086
Ri-won / This is what your face really looks like without the puffiness

787
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,388
Ri-won / You kind of looked like a steamed dumpling before

788
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:50,223
Hee-young / That’s one way to put it

789
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:50,991
Ri-won / It was cute though

790
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:54,304
Han-kyul / Dumpling

791
00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:57,907
Mi-rang / We’re all going to be doing this random-draw thing again today

792
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:14,080
Seo-yeon / I thought I was okay

793
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:19,285
Seo-yeon / But when I saw “Kim Mi-rang ♥ Park Da-gyo” written

794
00:48:19,295 --> 00:48:21,354
Seo-yeon / My heart dropped again

795
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:26,392
Seo-yeon / Seeing it materialized so directly

796
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:30,206
Seo-yeon / It kind of made me sad

797
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,233
Mi-rang / Double double

798
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,535
Da-gyo / You want to go double? Can we talk about it first?

799
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:36,402
Da-gyo / What do you want to do, Han-kyul?

800
00:48:36,412 --> 00:48:37,537
Mi-rang / Between single and double

801
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:40,650
Mi-rang / I don’t think this is about beds though

802
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:43,586
Han-kyul / Then what is it? Hamburgers...?

803
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:46,880
Seo-yeon / That was my style

804
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,884
Han-kyul / I don’t know, maybe double is better?

805
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,686
Min-woo / Since they already went on a date

806
00:48:53,696 --> 00:48:55,455
Min-woo / They might want to try double again

807
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:58,758
Min-woo / And this side might be okay with one-on-one

808
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:00,360
Da-gyo / I hope this side makes the choice

809
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,162
Min-woo / So the choice goes to these folks

810
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:04,607
Han-kyul / Single date, double date

811
00:49:07,243 --> 00:49:10,036
Min-woo / Or did you think you’d be dating yourself?

812
00:49:10,046 --> 00:49:12,972
Han-kyul / No no, I meant one-on-one

813
00:49:12,982 --> 00:49:16,075
Da-gyo / I like one-on-one

814
00:49:16,085 --> 00:49:18,044
Mi-rang / Thank you

815
00:49:18,054 --> 00:49:19,813
Mi-rang / I’m just curious what it is

816
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:22,081
Da-gyo / What kind of keyword is it?

817
00:49:22,091 --> 00:49:23,550
Mi-rang / Da-gyo didn’t really want this

818
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,387
Mi-rang / I just thought, compared to a single date

819
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:30,523
Mi-rang / A double date might be more exciting

820
00:49:30,533 --> 00:49:32,335
Mi-rang / So I picked that one

821
00:49:32,735 --> 00:49:34,093
Da-gyo / Honestly, I didn’t mind either way

822
00:49:34,103 --> 00:49:35,795
Da-gyo / Since we’ve already been on one date

823
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:38,932
Da-gyo / I wanted to let the ones who haven’t go first

824
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,877
Da-gyo / And I think it worked out well

825
00:49:41,277 --> 00:49:42,969
Han-kyul / Gradually the conversation

826
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,672
Han-kyul / Started sounding like this was about single and double dates

827
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,308
Han-kyul / That’s the assumption people were making

828
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:52,212
Han-kyul / Since we exchanged emotions yesterday anyway

829
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,713
Han-kyul / I wanted to talk to her again

830
00:49:53,723 --> 00:49:56,015
Han-kyul / I wanted to get more immersed in each other

831
00:49:56,025 --> 00:49:57,250
Han-kyul / That’s how I felt

832
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,896
Han-kyul / So I said, “I think single would be better”

833
00:50:00,496 --> 00:50:04,357
Jin-ah / “Jeong Han-kyul ♥ Kim Jin-ah” made me afraid again

834
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:06,326
Jin-ah / “What if they hate me for this?”

835
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,560
Jin-ah / That fear

836
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:10,396
Jin-ah / I think that fear has no place in love

837
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:13,233
Jin-ah / Honestly, deep inside

838
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:15,935
Jin-ah / I was so happy thinking about going on a date

839
00:50:15,945 --> 00:50:17,403
Jin-ah / But being tormented by

840
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:20,240
Jin-ah / Something so unnecessary felt really pitiful to me

841
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:23,009
Min-woo / Who was on meal duty the past few days?

842
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:25,111
Ri-won / Should we raise our hands if we’ve done it?

843
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:26,246
Min-woo / Uh...
 

844
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:27,547
Min-woo / Uh...
Jin-ah / We... ah... I didn’t, I think

845
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,082
Min-woo / Didn’t we make the meal yesterday?

846
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:29,959
Min-woo / Doesn’t that count as meal duty?

847
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,192
Da-gyo / You and I didn’t do it with Seo-yeon, huh?

848
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,695
Seo-yeon / Then from the people I’ve worked with

849
00:50:42,705 --> 00:50:45,832
Seo-yeon / One of you who’s staying home

850
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:48,535
Seo-yeon / Since Da-gyo is going out

851
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,304
Da-gyo / I’ll be back around dinner time

852
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:54,317
Ri-won / That’s why the ones on a date come back early

853
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,045
Min-woo / Then how about just the two of you do it?

854
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:01,791
Da-gyo / Sure, but what should we make?

855
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:05,785
Min-woo / I’d like to use whatever ingredients we already have

856
00:51:05,795 --> 00:51:07,453
Min-woo / Something we can make with that

857
00:51:07,463 --> 00:51:10,056
Da-gyo / I seriously can’t cook. Unnie, are you good at cooking?

858
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,591
Da-gyo / You haven’t cooked in a year?

859
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:12,525
Da-gyo / That’s worse than me

860
00:51:12,535 --> 00:51:15,195
Min-woo / Things like rolled omelets and spam are fine too, honestly

861
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,897
Hee-young / Then I want to eat kimchi stew

862
00:51:17,907 --> 00:51:19,933
Hee-young / I’ll make the kimchi stew

863
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:22,679
Hee-young / I’ll help with it and then run away
Seo-yeon / Oh, I’ll help too...

864
00:51:23,813 --> 00:51:26,105
Da-gyo / Then that’s just everyone doing it

865
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:27,106
Hee-young / Didn’t you say you wanted egg rolls and stuff?
 

866
00:51:27,116 --> 00:51:29,609
Hee-young / Didn’t you say you wanted egg rolls and stuff?
Min-woo / I actually know a great kimchi stew recipe

867
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:30,143
Hee-young / Then you make it!
 

868
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,278
Hee-young / Then you make it!
Min-woo / I’ll help you with it

869
00:51:32,288 --> 00:51:34,691
Da-gyo / Everyone’s saying they’ll do it now

870
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:37,494
Ri-won / Are you trying to flirt with your cooking skills right now?

871
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:38,718
Min-woo / I just want to make sure

872
00:51:38,728 --> 00:51:41,154
Min-woo / Everyone enjoys a good meal tonight

873
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,256
Min-woo / So we’ll all pitch in for the kimchi stew

874
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,223
Min-woo / Let’s go with that

875
00:51:44,233 --> 00:51:47,360
Min-woo / Kimchi stew, fried eggs, spam

876
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:48,461
Min-woo / Something simple like that

877
00:51:48,471 --> 00:51:49,362
Da-gyo / Keep it simple

878
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:50,463
Min-woo / Keep it simple, yeah?

879
00:51:50,473 --> 00:51:51,574
Da-gyo / Sounds good, sounds good

880
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,450
Ri-won / Should I do your hair, Han-kyul?
Han-kyul / My hair?

881
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,776
Ri-won / Your hair’s kinda wild right now
Han-kyul / Wild?

882
00:52:03,786 --> 00:52:06,178
Ri-won / Should I do it like last time?

883
00:52:06,188 --> 00:52:09,181
Ri-won / Let’s fix it up a bit

884
00:52:09,191 --> 00:52:11,427
Ri-won / Should I? Come sit down

885
00:52:13,162 --> 00:52:16,622
Ri-won / Did you like it last time when I did it?

886
00:52:16,632 --> 00:52:19,525
Han-kyul / Honestly, I can't really tell what my hair looks like

887
00:52:19,535 --> 00:52:21,304
Ri-won / Well, your hair’s naturally curly

888
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:29,702
Ri-won / Yesterday I cried so much and felt so overwhelmed

889
00:52:29,712 --> 00:52:33,339
Ri-won / But after crying, I felt kind of settled

890
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:38,978
Ri-won / In the end, what I really wanted was for Han-kyul to be happy

891
00:52:38,988 --> 00:52:41,480
Ri-won / So even during the date

892
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:46,085
Ri-won / I just hoped Han-kyul would have fun and enjoy herself

893
00:52:46,095 --> 00:52:49,188
Ri-won / And since she always cares about how she looks

894
00:52:49,198 --> 00:52:52,625
Ri-won / I wanted her to look even prettier today

895
00:52:52,635 --> 00:52:55,261
Ri-won / And I can do hair, so I did it for her

896
00:52:55,271 --> 00:53:00,032
Han-kyul / You don’t have to make it round
Ri-won / Yes, I do!

897
00:53:00,042 --> 00:53:02,201
Ri-won / Your swelling is down today

898
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:04,680
Ri-won / I think your face will look the best today

899
00:53:05,147 --> 00:53:07,216
Han-kyul / Think about your own face

900
00:53:07,316 --> 00:53:09,809
Han-kyul / Don’t worry about someone else’s

901
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,911
Ri-won / I always look pretty

902
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:13,856
Han-kyul / Facts

903
00:53:15,925 --> 00:53:18,551
Han-kyul / She did my hair like I was a princess

904
00:53:18,561 --> 00:53:21,764
Han-kyul / Of course I was thankful, but more than that

905
00:53:21,964 --> 00:53:24,657
Han-kyul / I kept thinking, ‘Why is she doing all this for me?’

906
00:53:24,667 --> 00:53:26,726
Han-kyul / I felt a lot of pressure

907
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:28,961
Han-kyul / She really didn’t have to do it

908
00:53:28,971 --> 00:53:31,908
Han-kyul / But still, I was grateful because she did

909
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:38,071
Jin-ah / I kinda want to wear this

910
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:38,905
Min-woo / Yeah, it looks cute

911
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:40,907
Jin-ah / Does this look better? Or that?

912
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:41,984
Jin-ah / Got it!

913
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,609
Min-woo / I’m torn, because

914
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:46,079
Min-woo / My date is someone else this time

915
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:47,747
Jin-ah / I want to do that thing, the...

916
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:49,315
Min-woo / What thing?

917
00:53:49,325 --> 00:53:52,485
Jin-ah / Han-kyul and I have completely different styles

918
00:53:52,495 --> 00:53:56,823
Jin-ah / I want to really show that difference

919
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:59,125
Jin-ah / I haven’t told anyone this before

920
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:01,994
Jin-ah / When I went on a date with Hee-young unnie

921
00:54:02,004 --> 00:54:04,397
Jin-ah / I wasn’t nervous at all

922
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:08,868
Jin-ah / But now I feel this overwhelming shyness

923
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:13,282
Jin-ah / And that makes me think, “Oh, this is what a crush feels like”

924
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,608
Han-kyul / Thanks for helping me

925
00:54:15,618 --> 00:54:17,310
Ri-won / What are you thanking me for?

926
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,911
Ri-won / I’ll do it for you every day until we leave

927
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:22,749
Han-kyul / Whoa… I feel like I should be paying you

928
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,128
Ri-won / You don’t need to pay

929
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:28,231
Han-kyul / I’ll get going now
Ri-won / Go ahead~

930
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,956
Han-kyul / Thank you
Ri-won / Have fun~

931
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,290
Hee-young / Can I come up?

932
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,468
Ri-won / Yes

933
00:54:34,203 --> 00:54:37,964
Hee-young / Wow, you look so pretty

934
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:41,411
Hee-young / Off on a date, huh?

935
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:51,043
Han-kyul / Jin-ah gave off this deep, emotional vibe

936
00:54:51,053 --> 00:54:55,314
Han-kyul / I wanted to take away that lonely feeling she had

937
00:54:55,324 --> 00:54:59,152
Han-kyul / Honestly, the keyword “responsibility” was really big for me

938
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:03,699
Han-kyul / I wanted to change her emotions, comfort her

939
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,532
Da-gyo / Whoa, you look gorgeous today

940
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:14,277
Han-kyul / Shall we go now?

941
00:55:20,716 --> 00:55:22,442
Mi-rang / Shall we go?

942
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,811
Mi-rang / Want to go?

943
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,713
Mi-rang / Da-gyo, would you like to go with me?

944
00:55:27,723 --> 00:55:29,248
Jin-ah / Go out into the world!

945
00:55:29,258 --> 00:55:33,286
Jin-ah / I was like, “What do I do with this younger woman full of mature charm?”

946
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,154
Jin-ah / She really dressed up beautifully

947
00:55:35,164 --> 00:55:39,025
Jin-ah / When someone you’re interested in usually looks casual

948
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:42,595
Jin-ah / And then dresses up just for a date with you

949
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:45,508
Jin-ah / That feeling is seriously thrilling

950
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:56,853
Jin-ah / I’m glad the weather is nice today

951
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,046
Han-kyul / Isn’t the sun too strong?

952
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,592
Jin-ah / No, it’s fine

953
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,551
Jin-ah / I really wanted to go out

954
00:56:05,561 --> 00:56:07,887
Jin-ah / I didn’t go out yesterday

955
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,756
Jin-ah / I stayed in during the pottery too

956
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:12,625
Han-kyul / You stayed inside all that time?

957
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:15,972
Han-kyul / So it’s your first time out in two days?

958
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:17,940
Jin-ah / Fresh air...

959
00:56:58,113 --> 00:57:01,340
Jin-ah / The place we went for our date

960
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:03,475
Jin-ah / Was a vinyl cafe

961
00:57:03,485 --> 00:57:07,913
Jin-ah / I looked at Han-kyul next to me and saw this wild look in her eyes

962
00:57:07,923 --> 00:57:12,918
Jin-ah / Like she had so much to say and was super interested

963
00:57:12,928 --> 00:57:14,620
Jin-ah / It was nice to see

964
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:16,955
Jin-ah / I thought, “This is a good date”

965
00:57:16,965 --> 00:57:20,392
Han-kyul / Collecting vinyl is my hobby at home

966
00:57:20,402 --> 00:57:23,428
Han-kyul / Music is kind of my specialty

967
00:57:23,438 --> 00:57:26,265
Han-kyul / So I felt like I wanted to show that off a little

968
00:57:26,275 --> 00:57:28,400
Han-kyul / That’s how I felt

969
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:31,436
Han-kyul / So I explained a bit about the player too

970
00:57:31,446 --> 00:57:32,504
Han-kyul / I thought that would be nice

971
00:57:32,514 --> 00:57:35,674
Han-kyul / And that made my eyes light up a little

972
00:57:35,684 --> 00:57:40,879
Jin-ah / I actually have a clear reason why I wanted to say something

973
00:57:40,889 --> 00:57:42,114
Han-kyul / Oh? Now I’m curious

974
00:57:42,124 --> 00:57:43,282
Jin-ah / Should we sit down?

975
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:44,316
Jin-ah / Can I sit here?

976
00:57:44,326 --> 00:57:46,695
Han-kyul / Around here?

977
00:57:52,768 --> 00:57:55,561
Jin-ah / How do you listen to this?

978
00:57:55,571 --> 00:57:58,797
Han-kyul / Just plug in the headset

979
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:02,668
Han-kyul / Normally you just listen through the headphones

980
00:58:02,678 --> 00:58:05,871
Han-kyul / The side with the cable is usually the left

981
00:58:05,881 --> 00:58:07,406
Han-kyul / The side with the cable

982
00:58:07,416 --> 00:58:12,444
Han-kyul / For wired headphones, anyway

983
00:58:12,454 --> 00:58:13,645
Jin-ah / It’s making weird sounds

984
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:15,714
Han-kyul / Yeah, so this player

985
00:58:15,724 --> 00:58:18,851
Han-kyul / It makes really tiny scratching noises

986
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:20,619
Han-kyul / The headphones just amplify that

987
00:58:20,629 --> 00:58:21,753
Han-kyul / The headphones...

988
00:58:21,763 --> 00:58:24,723
Han-kyul / Amplify those tiny sounds like this

989
00:58:24,733 --> 00:58:27,726
Han-kyul / So even if it’s not plugged in

990
00:58:27,736 --> 00:58:29,394
Han-kyul / If you put your ear to the needle

991
00:58:29,404 --> 00:58:32,197
Han-kyul / You can still hear the song

992
00:58:32,207 --> 00:58:35,500
Jin-ah / I’m glad I came here, you’re so cool

993
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:38,470
Han-kyul / I have three players at home

994
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,539
Han-kyul / Some for interior decor, some for actual use

995
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:42,341
Han-kyul / I just started collecting them

996
00:58:42,351 --> 00:58:45,277
Jin-ah / Hearing that makes me want to start too

997
00:58:45,287 --> 00:58:48,280
Jin-ah / Can I go first and play something? Because

998
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:50,549
Jin-ah / I really like a song called “Cigarettes After Sex”

999
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:51,783
Jin-ah / There’s a song I love...

1000
00:58:51,793 --> 00:58:53,018
Han-kyul / What is it?

1001
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:57,022
Jin-ah / Just... some really popular ones?

1002
00:58:57,032 --> 00:59:00,525
Jin-ah / Stuff like that, but they’re not here

1003
00:59:00,535 --> 00:59:04,229
Han-kyul / My favorite album has the song “Cry” in it

1004
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:08,600
Han-kyul / I really love the lyrics of that song

1005
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:12,905
Han-kyul / It says, “If you love me, I’ll probably make you cry”

1006
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:16,008
Han-kyul / But it feels like the one saying that

1007
00:59:16,018 --> 00:59:18,911
Han-kyul / Is actually the one crying more on the inside

1008
00:59:18,921 --> 00:59:22,724
Jin-ah / I really got that feeling too

1009
00:59:25,861 --> 00:59:28,887
Han-kyul / “Because I’m someone who can’t love deeply or for long

1010
00:59:28,897 --> 00:59:32,234
Han-kyul / If we love, you’re going to cry”

1011
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:35,994
Han-kyul / That’s what it says, but while listening

1012
00:59:36,004 --> 00:59:37,963
Han-kyul / I felt like the person saying that

1013
00:59:37,973 --> 00:59:41,166
Han-kyul / Is actually crying even more inside

1014
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:43,669
Han-kyul / Like they were pretending or covering it up

1015
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:45,180
Han-kyul / That’s what I thought

1016
00:59:46,014 --> 00:59:49,441
Jin-ah / I’m so glad you know how to do this

1017
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:53,121
Jin-ah / I probably would’ve asked the staff for help

1018
00:59:54,723 --> 00:59:58,760
Jin-ah / Oh I can hear it

1019
01:00:22,284 --> 01:00:25,744
Han-kyul / The song is called “Cry” and the lyrics are

1020
01:00:25,754 --> 01:00:28,947
Han-kyul / “There’s something I need to tell you first”

1021
01:00:28,957 --> 01:00:32,351
Han-kyul / “If we fall in love, you’re bound to cry”

1022
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:35,520
Han-kyul / I once cried just listening to that alone

1023
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:38,623
Han-kyul / So I kind of wanted to share

1024
01:00:38,633 --> 01:00:42,270
Han-kyul / “This is what resonates with me as a person”

1025
01:00:47,242 --> 01:00:50,379
Jin-ah / I almost cried... I was kind of...

1026
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:53,305
Han-kyul / Did it get through to you?

1027
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:55,674
Jin-ah / Yeah, well...

1028
01:00:55,684 --> 01:01:00,445
Jin-ah / First of all, it’s the lyrics and the voice

1029
01:01:00,455 --> 01:01:03,882
Han-kyul / Right? The voice really has... conviction

1030
01:01:03,892 --> 01:01:06,785
Jin-ah / That part when they sing “Cry”...

1031
01:01:06,795 --> 01:01:09,554
Jin-ah / It felt... it felt like you

1032
01:01:09,564 --> 01:01:12,791
Han-kyul / I used to play it late at night and cry alone

1033
01:01:12,801 --> 01:01:15,971
Jin-ah / Seriously, that’s such a “Han-kyul pick”

1034
01:01:23,879 --> 01:01:26,815
Jin-ah / This part

1035
01:01:31,553 --> 01:01:36,181
Han-kyul / Even in music preferences like this

1036
01:01:36,191 --> 01:01:39,818
Han-kyul / I felt like we had a connection. Like this was fate

1037
01:01:39,828 --> 01:01:41,353
Han-kyul / That’s what I thought

1038
01:01:41,363 --> 01:01:43,789
Jin-ah / With Han-kyul’s sparkling eyes

1039
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:46,591
Jin-ah / We went on a date while sharing music

1040
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:50,796
Jin-ah / I’m also someone who really takes lyrics to heart

1041
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:52,664
Jin-ah / I pick songs based on that

1042
01:01:52,674 --> 01:01:55,400
Jin-ah / It went beyond “we get along well when we talk”

1043
01:01:55,410 --> 01:02:01,239
Jin-ah / Han-kyul’s eyes at that moment were just so cool

1044
01:02:01,249 --> 01:02:04,609
Jin-ah / Yeah, I liked that part too

1045
01:02:04,619 --> 01:02:06,912
Han-kyul / We both cried in the past

1046
01:02:06,922 --> 01:02:08,747
Han-kyul / And we both picked songs with “Cry”

1047
01:02:08,757 --> 01:02:12,828
Han-kyul / That felt kind of symbolic

1048
01:02:13,728 --> 01:02:17,189
Han-kyul / But it’s okay, crying is a meaningful experience

1049
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:20,592
Jin-ah / Crying really helped me let things out, and also

1050
01:02:20,602 --> 01:02:23,161
Jin-ah / You all joke about my “cool act”

1051
01:02:23,171 --> 01:02:25,831
Jin-ah / But my coolness is being cheerful

1052
01:02:25,841 --> 01:02:27,766
Han-kyul / Cheerfulness is your version of cool?

1053
01:02:27,776 --> 01:02:30,602
Jin-ah / I never want to show weakness in front of others

1054
01:02:30,612 --> 01:02:33,338
Han-kyul / But do you think you only gain positives

1055
01:02:33,348 --> 01:02:36,942
Han-kyul / By always doing that?

1056
01:02:36,952 --> 01:02:39,411
Jin-ah / No! I don’t usually act like that outside

1057
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:41,446
Jin-ah / But I think I did that more here

1058
01:02:41,456 --> 01:02:45,917
Han-kyul / But when you keep suppressing things like that

1059
01:02:45,927 --> 01:02:47,352
Han-kyul / It eventually just bursts out

1060
01:02:47,362 --> 01:02:51,356
Jin-ah / Honestly, it’s not about liking or disliking people

1061
01:02:51,366 --> 01:02:53,735
Jin-ah / Some people just don’t click with you, you know?

1062
01:02:55,437 --> 01:03:01,433
Jin-ah / I don’t really engage with people I don’t click with

1063
01:03:01,443 --> 01:03:03,268
Jin-ah / There’s no need to

1064
01:03:03,278 --> 01:03:06,438
Han-kyul / I’ve realized that too in life

1065
01:03:06,448 --> 01:03:08,740
Han-kyul / People call it “being on the same wavelength”

1066
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:11,843
Han-kyul / But you don’t find that very often

1067
01:03:11,853 --> 01:03:14,579
Han-kyul / So when you do meet someone like that

1068
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:17,149
Han-kyul / You shouldn't let them go so easily

1069
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:21,586
Han-kyul / I used to have this image of older women

1070
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:22,587
Han-kyul / A certain idea, like

1071
01:03:22,597 --> 01:03:25,023
Han-kyul / Someone really overwhelmingly cool

1072
01:03:25,033 --> 01:03:26,591
Jin-ah / Hee-young? Oh yeah yeah yeah

1073
01:03:26,601 --> 01:03:28,927
Han-kyul / I kind of thought

1074
01:03:28,937 --> 01:03:33,231
Han-kyul / If I could be with someone like that, that would be great

1075
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:35,367
Han-kyul / I wanted to be loved like that

1076
01:03:35,377 --> 01:03:40,105
Han-kyul / I thought that was the kind of person I was

1077
01:03:40,115 --> 01:03:43,842
Han-kyul / So I kept hinting at it indirectly

1078
01:03:43,852 --> 01:03:48,446
Han-kyul / Like saying I wanted to do a fan meeting or something

1079
01:03:48,456 --> 01:03:51,449
Han-kyul / But then suddenly I started thinking

1080
01:03:51,459 --> 01:03:54,986
Han-kyul / You were always alone, hurting and crying

1081
01:03:54,996 --> 01:03:57,222
Han-kyul / Your eyes were always teary

1082
01:03:57,232 --> 01:03:58,690
Han-kyul / Watching that

1083
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,325
Han-kyul / I couldn’t take it anymore

1084
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:03,328
Han-kyul / I couldn’t just keep watching you like that

1085
01:04:03,338 --> 01:04:07,999
Han-kyul / Because I felt like, “I wouldn’t make her feel that way”

1086
01:04:08,009 --> 01:04:09,067
Han-kyul / If it were me?

1087
01:04:09,077 --> 01:04:12,037
Han-kyul / So in a way

1088
01:04:12,047 --> 01:04:15,473
Han-kyul / Age or who leads the relationship

1089
01:04:15,483 --> 01:04:17,509
Han-kyul / Those things aren’t everything

1090
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:19,678
Han-kyul / That’s what I realized

1091
01:04:19,688 --> 01:04:24,349
Han-kyul / Then I wanted to make you happy

1092
01:04:24,359 --> 01:04:27,586
Han-kyul / But honestly, I can’t say things like that so easily

1093
01:04:27,596 --> 01:04:30,589
Han-kyul / Because I’m not the type who can offer instant security

1094
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:32,190
Han-kyul / I’m not that kind of person

1095
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:37,062
Han-kyul / Even so, if you’re crying and hurting and sad like that

1096
01:04:37,072 --> 01:04:39,898
Han-kyul / I didn’t want to leave you like that

1097
01:04:39,908 --> 01:04:42,367
Han-kyul / I didn’t want that to continue

1098
01:04:42,377 --> 01:04:45,470
Han-kyul / But then I revealed my age

1099
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:48,139
Han-kyul / And I honestly thought that once I did

1100
01:04:48,149 --> 01:04:50,609
Han-kyul / No one would be interested in me

1101
01:04:50,619 --> 01:04:52,110
Han-kyul / That they wouldn’t give me a chance

1102
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,478
Han-kyul / So I just gave up

1103
01:04:53,488 --> 01:04:56,114
Han-kyul / But that night, you called me

1104
01:04:56,124 --> 01:04:59,284
Han-kyul / And by doing that, you gave me hope

1105
01:04:59,294 --> 01:05:03,355
Han-kyul / So I wanted to take that chance

1106
01:05:03,365 --> 01:05:05,890
Han-kyul / I wanted to give it a shot

1107
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,939
Han-kyul / Willingly and wholeheartedly

1108
01:05:12,374 --> 01:05:15,667
Jin-ah / I was sitting next to Han-kyul

1109
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:20,105
Jin-ah / And I thought, “She’s so beautiful”

1110
01:05:20,115 --> 01:05:24,075
Jin-ah / I’ve never loved someone with long hair before

1111
01:05:24,085 --> 01:05:26,945
Jin-ah / She’s both cool and pretty

1112
01:05:26,955 --> 01:05:28,647
Jin-ah / She has a kind of beauty that’s different from mine

1113
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:32,150
Jin-ah / Honestly, it felt like when I had my very first girlfriend

1114
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,488
Jin-ah / It was like a whole new expansion in loving women

1115
01:05:36,498 --> 01:05:38,223
Jin-ah / For me personally

1116
01:05:38,233 --> 01:05:41,026
Jin-ah / It was such a wondrous moment

1117
01:05:41,036 --> 01:05:43,361
Han-kyul / I just wanted to say, “I hope you’re happy”

1118
01:05:43,371 --> 01:05:46,131
Han-kyul / But I felt like if I said only that

1119
01:05:46,141 --> 01:05:49,901
Han-kyul / It might not sound convincing enough

1120
01:05:49,911 --> 01:05:52,237
Han-kyul / So I kind of tried to hint

1121
01:05:52,247 --> 01:05:53,505
Han-kyul / That maybe she could see me

1122
01:05:53,515 --> 01:05:57,252
Han-kyul / As someone she could date

1123
01:06:08,563 --> 01:06:10,689
Jin-ah / I was wondering earlier

1124
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:13,658
Jin-ah / When was the last time you came to Jeju?

1125
01:06:13,668 --> 01:06:16,194
Han-kyul / July 2022

1126
01:06:16,204 --> 01:06:16,995
Jin-ah / Why? Just for fun?

1127
01:06:17,005 --> 01:06:18,963
Han-kyul / Yeah, just a trip...

1128
01:06:18,973 --> 01:06:26,438
Jin-ah / I was on this road last spring too, I think

1129
01:06:26,448 --> 01:06:28,606
Jin-ah / I love this area, Aewol

1130
01:06:28,616 --> 01:06:31,609
Han-kyul / This really feels like Jeju, you know?

1131
01:06:31,619 --> 01:06:33,688
Jin-ah / I’m so happy right now

1132
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,720
Jin-ah / I love filming planes

1133
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,431
Jin-ah / No reason

1134
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:58,403
Jin-ah / Maybe it’s because I love Jeju trips so much

1135
01:06:58,413 --> 01:07:00,205
Jin-ah / I just wanted to kidnap Han-kyul

1136
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:02,273
Jin-ah / And go on a Jeju trip with just the two of us

1137
01:07:02,283 --> 01:07:03,742
Jin-ah / That’s what I thought

1138
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:06,745
Jin-ah / And right now, I’m just so happy with her

1139
01:07:06,755 --> 01:07:08,146
Jin-ah / When we go back to the house

1140
01:07:08,156 --> 01:07:09,514
Jin-ah / There’s someone who thinks

1141
01:07:09,524 --> 01:07:11,960
Jin-ah / I stole Han-kyul away

1142
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:17,399
Jin-ah / So going back doesn’t feel so great

1143
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:19,357
Jin-ah / Should we go?

1144
01:07:19,367 --> 01:07:23,338
Jin-ah / I’m hungry

1145
01:07:25,473 --> 01:07:26,998
Han-kyul / I think only now

1146
01:07:27,008 --> 01:07:30,378
Han-kyul / I’m finally starting to get used to Jeju
