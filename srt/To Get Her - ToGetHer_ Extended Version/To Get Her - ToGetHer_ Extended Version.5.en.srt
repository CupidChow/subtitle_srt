1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,120
Are we the first ones here?

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,040
Jin-ah / Feels like it, right?

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,720
Hee-young / Kinda?
Jin-ah / Right?

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,480
Jin-ah / We made them super quick and rushed over

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,840
Jin-ah / Da-gyo~

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,640
Hee-young / Not here not here

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,920
Seo-yeon / Are we the fastest ones here?
Ri-won / Should we check Building 1? Aren’t you curious?

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,680
Ri-won / Want to open Building 1 first, then go to 2?

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,720
Ri-won / Feels like someone’s there?

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,400
Seo-yeon / Someone’s here?

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,480
Ri-won / Who’s in there?

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,360
Jin-ah / Just Hee-young and me

13
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,040
Seo-yeon / What were you doing?

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,080
Seo-yeon / What were you doing?
Jin-ah / We just got here

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,880
Ri-won / Then come to Building 2

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,880
Jin-ah / We made beer

17
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,800
Jin-ah / We made beer mugs

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,000
Ri-won / Mugs~ come to Building 2!

19
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,760
Jin-ah / We’re coming~

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,800
Seo-yeon / I wonder how things went between those two

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,600
Ri-won / Right? I get curious when someone’s already here

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,280
Ri-won / Oh they’re not here!

23
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,640
Ri-won / Oh they’re not here
Seo-yeon / They’re not here...

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,560
Ri-won / We’ll put the painting here

25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,400
Ri-won / To show off a bit

26
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,080
Seo-yeon / Let’s place it over there

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,480
Ri-won / I want to put it here though

28
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,920
Seo-yeon / It’s so pretty~

29
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,880
Ri-won / I think it’ll look good next to yours

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Ri-won / Feels like they connect

31
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,960
Seo-yeon / Wow~
Ri-won / Not bad, right?

32
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,000
Jin-ah / There’s some kind of initials on it

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,400
Jin-ah / I love that it says “with” on there

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,160
Jin-ah / Looks like they each wrote their names

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,480
Mi-rang / You got here first

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,320
Hee-young / Looks like they painted something

37
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,880
Mi-rang / Wow did you draw it yourselves?

38
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,200
Jin-ah / Didn’t they write each other’s names?

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,680
Hee-young / Yeah one of them used both of their initials

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,480
Hee-young / And the other didn’t even write their own name

41
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,800
Hee-young / Just “with”...

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,320
I want everyone to gather so we can hear all the dating stories

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,520
Same here

44
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,920
Ri-won / Try guessing which painting belongs to who

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,240
Da-gyo / What? I didn’t notice that one earlier

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,800
Da-gyo / I didn’t realize someone painted this just now

47
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,320
Da-gyo / I didn’t realize someone painted this just now
Ri-won / Try guessing whose is whose

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,480
Jin-ah / No no I figured it out

49
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,080
Ri-won / How’d you know?

50
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,400
Jin-ah / The initials

51
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,200
It’s just so romantic to write someone else’s name instead of your own

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,000
You two are quite romantic

53
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,480
Ri-won / I intentionally wrote Seo-yeon’s name first

54
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,000
Da-gyo / That was smooth

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,760
Han-kyul / Hello

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,400
Han-kyul / Everyone’s here

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,440
Mi-rang / You’re here?

58
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Min-woo / It started hailing

59
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,560
Ri-won / You made it?

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,000
Ri-won / So what kind of date did you two go on?

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,600
Min-woo / We filmed a mukbang

62
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,920
Min-woo / And drove along the coastal road

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,920
Min-woo / It was so beautiful then

64
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,720
Ri-won / A drive? You drove?

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,680
Min-woo / I was the driver

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,680
Hee-young / What what?

67
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,360
Ri-won / I want to drive too

68
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,320
Min-woo / She was just cute, like a younger sibling

69
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,080
Ri-won / Younger sibling?! You don’t even know her age!

70
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,040
Min-woo / I mean just based on looks...

71
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,480
Han-kyul / I was honestly a bit shocked

72
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,800
Han-kyul / I thought for sure

73
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,720
Han-kyul / she’d be way older than me

74
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,480
Han-kyul / So her picking me was

75
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,600
Han-kyul / a pleasant surprise?

76
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,000
Han-kyul / A pleasant surprise?
Da-gyo / Do you like younger people?

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,680
Min-woo / I don’t mind either way

78
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,800
Ri-won / What is this? I’m a little flustered

79
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,720
Ri-won / That kind of vibe

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,920
Min-woo / I don’t know which room to use

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,520
Ri-won / Huh? Min-woo, I think you’re using that one

82
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,800
Ri-won / Looks like that one’s yours

83
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,040
Min-woo / With who... who am I...

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
Min-woo / Who’s in here...

85
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,600
Min-woo / Whose room is this?

86
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,240
Han-kyul / Mi-rang and Seo-yeon’s

87
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,800
Min-woo / Oh~

88
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,560
Min-woo / So we’re roommates

89
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
Min-woo / Could you maybe cover my nose while I sleep?

90
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
Min-woo / Sorry but maybe...

91
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,960
Ri-won / Huh? Mi-rang’s pretending she didn’t hear that

92
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,000
Ri-won / She’s asking you to cover her nose while sleeping

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,280
Ri-won / Do you snore, Mi-rang?

94
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,600
Mi-rang / No I don’t

95
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,960
Min-woo / But we’re in the same room

96
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,760
Min-woo / Could you show me around the room?

97
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,720
Jin-ah / If she said “don’t snore,” isn’t that a red flag?

98
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,240
Jin-ah / It means she knows her sleeping habits...

99
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,280
Hee-young / Even if they’re not dating, that could still happen...

100
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,960
Suddenly the mood shifted

101
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,320
Min-woo / What? Why the same room?

102
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,400
Mi-rang / Ah seriously...

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,360
Min-woo / It’s just so funny

104
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,400
Min-woo / I feel like I’m going to pass out

105
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,640
Mi-rang / Honestly, now that we know each other

106
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,080
Mi-rang / Our personalities are totally opposite

107
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,440
Mi-rang / Not my type at all

108
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,080
Mi-rang / We don’t overlap in ideal types either

109
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,880
Mi-rang / Honestly, in front of a friend

110
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,240
Mi-rang / Flirting with someone feels

111
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,120
Mi-rang / A bit embarrassing, you know?

112
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,760
Min-woo / I was kind of unsettled

113
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,880
Min-woo / But at the same time

114
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,520
Min-woo / I felt a bit nervous but also comforted

115
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,400
Min-woo / I hoped she’d meet someone good

116
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,800
Min-woo / That thought came up too

117
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Seo-yeon / Min-woo

118
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,040
Seo-yeon / If you're okay with the bed, want to share it with me?

119
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,960
Min-woo / Yeah this one seems wider?

120
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,960
Seo-yeon / Oh really?

121
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,160
Min-woo / I think that person snores

122
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,400
Seo-yeon / Oh yeah then let's use it together

123
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,000
Seo-yeon / The bed felt kind of awkward so

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,440
Seo-yeon / I thought we should share the bed

125
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,160
Seo-yeon / To separate things a bit

126
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,720
Seo-yeon / So I asked, "Want to share the bed with me?"

127
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,840
Seo-yeon / And switched it up

128
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,320
Min-woo / "Want to share the bed with me?"

129
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,720
Min-woo / When she said "Sleep with me"

130
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,200
Min-woo / I thought she was flirting

131
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,280
Min-woo / So I started imagining all kinds of things

132
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,120
Mi-rang / How was it? After talking to Ri-won?

133
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,680
Seo-yeon / This date was really great because

134
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,560
Seo-yeon / Compared to when we were all together

135
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,920
Seo-yeon / During one-on-one

136
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,080
Seo-yeon / It’s totally different

137
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,160
Mi-rang / Ri-won?

138
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,680
Seo-yeon / Yeah really totally different

139
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,960
Seo-yeon / Ri-won is a bit

140
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,720
Seo-yeon / So outgoing when in a group

141
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,280
Seo-yeon / It felt a little overwhelming

142
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,080
Seo-yeon / But one-on-one, not at all like that

143
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,360
Seo-yeon / Very calm

144
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,520
Seo-yeon / So I really liked it

145
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,840
Seo-yeon / (How about Da-gyo?)

146
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,720
Mi-rang / I thought I’d have to lead the convo

147
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,560
Mi-rang / So I was worried but she talked well

148
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,400
Seo-yeon / Yeah I felt like Da-gyo would really match well

149
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,920
Mi-rang / Oh really?

150
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,040
Mi-rang / You know how some people talk a lot in groups

151
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,280
Mi-rang / But go silent one-on-one?

152
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,440
Mi-rang / I thought she’d be like that

153
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,720
Mi-rang / But she kept leading the talk and

154
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,880
Mi-rang / Was really honest

155
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,640
Mi-rang / We ended up having a very honest conversation

156
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,840
Seo-yeon / You definitely have to do a one-on-one date

157
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,160
Mi-rang / Yeah totally

158
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,480
Mi-rang / But we still don’t know

159
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,400
Mi-rang / Since it was the first time

160
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,840
Mi-rang / Talking one-on-one with someone

161
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,680
Seo-yeon / After doing that to me! You better end up well!

162
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,920
Mi-rang / Possibility~

163
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,800
Da-gyo / But it's interesting

164
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,120
Da-gyo / How everyone says it's so different?

165
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,000
Da-gyo / When we were inside yesterday

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,880
Da-gyo / The idea that people would be that different outside

167
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,080
Da-gyo / Never even crossed my mind

168
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,640
Da-gyo / I didn’t think about that

169
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,440
Jin-ah / It's totally different

170
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,280
Da-gyo / After going out today, I felt ‘It really is different’

171
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,760
Jin-ah / Completely different, the vibe itself

172
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,600
Jin-ah / I’m going to change clothes

173
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,160
Hee-young / How was the date?

174
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,200
Da-gyo / The date?

175
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,400
Da-gyo / Today’s date...

176
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,240
Hee-young / Was it okay then?

177
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,800
Da-gyo / Yeah it was super fun

178
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,840
Da-gyo / I was really satisfied

179
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,960
Da-gyo / It was so fun

180
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,840
Da-gyo / Haha that sounded lukewarm didn’t it?

181
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,720
Hee-young / No I just got curious

182
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,840
Hee-young / After hearing the convo today

183
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,600
Da-gyo / That’s the way it should be~

184
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,560
Ri-won / So it was kind of good?

185
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,440
Ri-won / It was good?

186
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,920
Han-kyul / The ocean was so pretty it felt freeing

187
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,760
Ri-won / Did you guys have a good talk?

188
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,280
Han-kyul / Oh it was hilarious, seriously

189
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,400
Han-kyul / I was like “Is this even a conversation?”

190
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,960
Ri-won / Oh like totally different wavelengths?

191
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,760
Han-kyul / Like a stream of consciousness talk

192
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,040
Han-kyul / Total nonsense party

193
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,760
Han-kyul / It felt like we were drunk

194
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,880
Ri-won / Are you alone?

195
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,120
Ri-won / Who are you with?

196
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,840
Ri-won / Oh with Min-woo?

197
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,440
Ri-won / Oh with Min-woo? /
Seo-yeon / Yeah Min-woo

198
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,720
Min-woo / My makeup keeps smudging

199
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,280
Seo-yeon / Doesn’t this outfit look like a clothing store?

200
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,160
Ri-won / You're right, it’s well put together

201
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,800
Ri-won / How was the date? Was it good?

202
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,720
Min-woo / The date? Yeah, it was good

203
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,280
Ri-won / Oh really?

204
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,560
Ri-won / Was it a drive?

205
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,600
Min-woo / Yeah

206
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,560
Min-woo / It’s been so long since I saw the ocean

207
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,840
Min-woo / And talking one-on-one like that

208
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,280
Min-woo / She really kept the conversation going

209
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,760
Min-woo / She’s kind of cute too I think

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,920
Min-woo / But since it’s the first day, I’m not sure yet

211
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,920
Ri-won / Still, for the first day, you adjusted really quickly

212
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,480
Ri-won / Still, for the first day, you adjusted really quickly /
Seo-yeon / Exactly

213
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,600
Min-woo / Really?

214
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,200
Min-woo / Really? /
Seo-yeon / Yes

215
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,920
Ri-won / I mean he didn’t give too many details

216
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,160
Ri-won / Just said it was a drive

217
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,080
Ri-won / I really love driving too

218
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,320
Ri-won / So it’s kind of...

219
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,200
Ri-won / Yeah I don’t think it was great

220
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,000
Can’t we just use store-bought pasta sauce together?

221
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,720
Han-kyul / Are there eight people?

222
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,000
Ri-won / Yeah there are eight now with the new ones

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,520
Han-kyul / Then I think we’ll need to open all four packs?

224
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,160
Han-kyul / One tomato, one cream

225
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,840
Han-kyul / And mix two for rosé

226
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,680
Ri-won / That much pasta?

227
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,960
Ri-won / Should we just make one of each?

228
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,520
Ri-won / We’re grilling meat too

229
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,840
Han-kyul / We’re grilling meat?

230
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,280
Han-kyul / That’s a good idea

231
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,920
Ri-won / Since you can scoop a bit of each

232
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,160
Ri-won / And mix them for rosé yourself

233
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,960
Han-kyul / That’s a good idea

234
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,000
Ri-won / Doing it all would be too much

235
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,200
Mi-rang / Can I watch the cooking?

236
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,480
Han-kyul / Just sit here and chat

237
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,200
Min-woo / Need any help?

238
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,120
Ri-won / Just sit! Sit and chit-chat~ /
Han-kyul / Too many people won’t help

239
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,040
Seo-yeon / I’m gonna sit here~

240
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,480
Seo-yeon / I’m gonna sit here~ /
Mi-rang / Wow with 8 people now, the seats...

241
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,520
Da-gyo / Are way too many

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,800
Mi-rang / Don’t you have questions for Maggie?

243
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,280
Seo-yeon / I have a lot, but anyway...

244
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,080
Jin-ah / I’m curious about everything since I don’t know anything

245
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,400
Jin-ah / I kept saying I wanted to get to know people

246
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Mi-rang / I really hope everyone opens up today

247
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,480
Seo-yeon / Ugh I’m so curious

248
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,480
Hee-young / Curious

249
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,960
Mi-rang / Please eat

250
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,720
Mi-rang / Jin-ah, explain it well please

251
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,480
Min-woo / I really needed this

252
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,960
Mi-rang / You have to eat this now

253
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,200
Min-woo / I’m on a diet so I really needed this seriously

254
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,280
Min-woo / Jin-ah, do you eat this before meals?

255
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,320
Min-woo / Jin-ah, do you eat this before meals? /
Jin-ah / After eating

256
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,880
Jin-ah / After eating, you chew it

257
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,000
So the undigested food

258
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
Jin-ah / Gets broken down by enzymes

259
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,440
Jin-ah / And then discharged from the body

260
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,960
Min-woo / Hurry...

261
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,000
Jin-ah / But it doesn’t have that fishy enzyme taste

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,040
Jin-ah / It's a fresh nutty flavor anyone can enjoy

263
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Min-woo / Ah~ it's like what’s in saliva right?

264
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,040
Min-woo / Amylase?

265
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,840
Mi-rang / If it’s for dementia I need to eat a lot of it

266
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,400
Min-woo / No I said saliva, not dementia

267
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,000
Min-woo / No I said saliva, not dementia /
Mi-rang / Oh sorry, amylase? Saliva?

268
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,000
Jin-ah / Dementia hahaha

269
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,000
Ri-won / Chef, how long do we boil this?

270
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,360
Han-kyul / From when the water starts boiling, 8 minutes

271
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,760
Han-kyul / If you prep the water beforehand and salt it

272
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,720
Ri-won / So it soaks in nicely?

273
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Han-kyul / Yeah it gets seasoned and swells a bit, perfect in 8 minutes

274
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,360
Ri-won / Of course

275
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,320
Ri-won / Of course /
Han-kyul / No no...

276
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,760
Ri-won / So scientific

277
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,360
Mi-rang / I can’t eat unless it’s with a fork

278
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Ri-won / I use chopsticks

279
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
Ri-won / I’m gonna dig in

280
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,560
Min-woo / This looks like art

281
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,760
Ri-won / Seriously, you’re basically a sculptor now

282
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,360
Ri-won / A mushroom sculptor

283
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,120
Min-woo / Like creative modern art, right?

284
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
Han-kyul / Oh no I feel like I’m dying

285
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,280
Min-woo / You’re fine

286
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,160
Min-woo / There’s fun in picking what to eat

287
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,880
Min-woo / Big size, small size

288
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,600
Min-woo / You’re doing great right now

289
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,760
Han-kyul / What if I get hate for this?

290
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,280
No you're doing great, really great

291
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,320
Min-woo / You’re slicing like it’s Death Note

292
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,480
Min-woo / Got it got it

293
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,800
Han-kyul / What if people find out I suck at cooking

294
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,920
Han-kyul / And leave hate comments

295
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,720
Ri-won / If you're gonna slice it, do it well please

296
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,520
Han-kyul / I’ll just give up on the visuals now

297
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,400
Ri-won / As long as it tastes good, that’s enough

298
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Min-woo / Han-kyul, where’s the pepper?

299
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,320
Han-kyul / Pepper... where’s... oh here it is

300
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Min-woo / There, season it how you like

301
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,000
Min-woo / If you're bored, want to have a drink?

302
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,040
Han-kyul / I feel so incompetent right now

303
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,080
Han-kyul / I’ve got too many things to be responsible for

304
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,320
Ri-won / Why is he doing that? Seriously?

305
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,800
Ri-won / Why is he acting like that? Is he into Han-kyul?

306
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,760
Ri-won / Is he trying to piss me off?

307
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,200
Ri-won / I don’t get it. Why is he acting like that?

308
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,440
Min-woo / When I’m interested in someone

309
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,800
Min-woo / I tend to joke around a lot

310
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,200
Min-woo / And with Han-kyul, when I joke

311
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Min-woo / She reacts well, so

312
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,320
Min-woo / I just wanted to mess around nearby like that

313
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,640
Ri-won / There’s no tongs

314
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,560
Ri-won / Let’s go

315
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,960
Wow~ nice

316
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,920
It’s only relaxing when everyone’s here to eat

317
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,200
It’s grilled so well~

318
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,360
I worked hard on it

319
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,400
It’s such a feast

320
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,960
Seriously

321
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,800
Min-woo / Nice work everyone, cheers~

322
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,440
Jin-ah / Is it good?

323
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,880
Ri-won / Tastes like school lunch spaghetti

324
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,920
Han-kyul / You know the pasta they sell at IKEA?

325
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,360
Han-kyul / It tastes just like that

326
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,480
Ri-won / No, honestly this is better than IKEA

327
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,840
Ri-won / Is the seasoning okay?

328
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:30,600
Hee-young / Yeah!

329
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,480
Ri-won / I’m kind of a "seasoning idiot"

330
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,680
Ri-won / Seasoning idiot

331
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,000
Ri-won / Seasoning idiot /
Hee-young / Seasoning idiot?

332
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,760
Ri-won / It’s from that show Black & White Chef

333
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,440
Yeah that’s right

334
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,960
Seo-yeon / Wasn’t it "seasoning ghost"?

335
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,120
Hee-young / "Seasoning ghost"!

336
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,560
Ri-won / Oh?! Oh...

337
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,480
Hee-young / Oh you meant "ghost" not "idiot" hahaha

338
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,680
It’s really good really good

339
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,000
Whoa that scared me

340
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,040
So happy so happy

341
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,840
Jin-ah / I feel even better now that you’re here

342
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,000
Jin-ah / I feel even better now that you’re here /
Da-gyo / Right

343
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,600
Min-woo / I feel kind of lucky honestly

344
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,040
Da-gyo / I was feeling a little frustrated

345
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,760
Da-gyo / Since we had some limits on talking

346
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,720
Da-gyo / Being able to talk while eating

347
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,360
Da-gyo / That was the best part for me

348
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,680
Jin-ah / Of all the people, I was most curious about Hee-young

349
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,080
Let's go

350
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,480
Mi-rang / Me first?

351
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,720
Da-gyo / Like age and what else?

352
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,760
Ri-won / Just say “I’m Mi-rang” and so on and so forth

353
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,360
Ri-won / Hurry, I’m curious

354
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,800
Mi-rang / You already know my name

355
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,040
Come on come on

356
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,720
Mi-rang / First, my age is...

357
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,320
Seo-yeon / I totally thought she was early or mid 20s

358
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,760
Da-gyo / I’m curious

359
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,280
Mi-rang / I was born in 1991

360
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,880
Da-gyo / You look so young

361
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,840
Da-gyo / You look so young /
Ri-won / Seriously you look young

362
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,760
Da-gyo / I was so surprised

363
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,840
Da-gyo / I thought max maybe a year or two older?

364
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,760
Da-gyo / How do you look so young

365
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,120
Seriously, so young

366
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,480
Mi-rang / But in my heart, I’m still in my 20s

367
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,480
Da-gyo / That’s even funnier

368
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,840
Da-gyo / Saying you’re in your 20s at heart is even funnier

369
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,760
Ri-won / MBTI

370
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,720
Mi-rang / Ah MBTI?

371
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,000
Mi-rang / I’m ESTJ

372
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,880
Ri-won / That’s so interesting~

373
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,240
Jin-ah / Your reaction is even more fun

374
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,760
Mi-rang / And my job is...

375
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,600
Mi-rang / I work in real estate

376
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,480
Da-gyo / Really?

377
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,640
Da-gyo / That was so surprising, it didn’t match at all

378
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,600
Da-gyo / I never imagined that job

379
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,680
Da-gyo / Not even a bit...

380
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,960
Seo-yeon / Since she deals with land, I thought maybe sports or F&B?

381
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,600
Seo-yeon / Like fitness or food service or something

382
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,360
Seo-yeon / It was unexpected

383
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,040
Mi-rang / I also do building management

384
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,400
Mi-rang / So along with real estate

385
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,640
Mi-rang / I manage several properties

386
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,560
Mi-rang / I wanted to test my capabilities

387
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,040
Mi-rang / So I wanted to try sales work

388
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,320
Mi-rang / That’s why I chose real estate

389
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,440
Ri-won / Me me me! I’m Kim Ri-won

390
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,000
Mi-rang / I was really curious about your age

391
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,800
Ri-won / My age is a secret

392
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,800
Ri-won / Later...

393
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,840
Ri-won / If I could hide just one thing

394
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,760
Ri-won / I’d want to hide my age because

395
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,520
Ri-won / Once people know, they get preconceived notions

396
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,240
Ri-won / And biases

397
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,600
Ri-won / I want to love purely more than anyone else

398
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,480
Ri-won / That’s why I want to keep my age secret

399
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,320
Han-kyul / I get the feeling people might think she’s younger than expected

400
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,280
Han-kyul / So she probably decided to keep it private

401
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,840
Han-kyul / If she’s one or two years older than me? Maybe two or three?

402
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,640
Han-kyul / I think that’d be nice

403
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,880
Mi-rang / And your MBTI?

404
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,080
Ri-won / ENTJ

405
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,320
Ri-won / ENTJ

406
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,840
Da-gyo / Oh, I see

407
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,960
Ri-won / My job is...

408
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,240
Ri-won / I’m an influencer

409
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,640
Ri-won / And also

410
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,120
Ri-won / I manage BJs (broadcasting jockeys)

411
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,560
Seo-yeon / For Ri-won, it’s like... yeah that fits her

412
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,840
Ri-won / Right now I’m active as an influencer

413
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,240
Ri-won / And I also run a company that manages BJs and creators

414
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,680
Ri-won / I operate that company too

415
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,960
Ri-won / When I was younger, I was a trainee for a long time

416
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Mi-rang / Idol?

417
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,200
Da-gyo / Earlier we said her name sounds like a stage name

418
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,840
Da-gyo / And that it really suits an idol vibe

419
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,800
Jin-ah / Her name is so pretty too

420
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,040
Jin-ah / Her name is so pretty /
Ri-won / It’s my real name

421
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,720
Da-gyo / Her name sounds perfect for an idol

422
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,800
Min-woo / I currently live in Gyeonggi Province

423
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,640
Min-woo / And I’m 31 years old

424
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,040
Min-woo / Born in 1995

425
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,320
Min-woo / MBTI is INTP

426
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,600
Min-woo / It’s been two years since I’ve been single

427
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,400
Da-gyo / That’s pretty specific

428
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,960
Min-woo / My job is a secret

429
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,280
Jin-ah / Now I’m even more curious

430
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,080
Jin-ah / The fact that it’s a secret makes it more intriguing

431
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,680
Seo-yeon / I feel like he runs a shopping mall

432
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,640
Ri-won / I thought maybe something in beauty

433
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,600
Min-woo / If I could hide one thing about me

434
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,120
Min-woo / It would definitely be my job

435
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,120
Min-woo / I want to meet someone who sees me

436
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,520
Min-woo / Without any preconceived notions

437
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,720
Min-woo / Because I believe I can find someone like that too

438
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,240
Min-woo / I want to show my unfiltered self

439
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,040
Da-gyo / I live in Seoul

440
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,080
Da-gyo / And my age is...

441
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,920
Da-gyo / My age is...

442
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,360
Da-gyo / I was born in 2000

443
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
Jin-ah / No wonder you’re so lovable

444
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,840
Mi-rang / I was actually kind of close in my guess

445
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,200
Mi-rang / But hearing her actual age

446
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,400
Mi-rang / Made me think more realistically

447
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,200
Mi-rang / I started wondering if our views on dating might be different

448
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,560
Seo-yeon / Hearing it made me go, “Is she too young?”

449
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,400
Seo-yeon / “Will she think I’m too old?”

450
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,000
Seo-yeon / It made me feel a little... hmm?

451
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,040
Hee-young / Da-gyo was younger than I expected

452
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,840
Hee-young / I did think she was young

453
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,560
Hee-young / But she seemed a lot more mature

454
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,200
Han-kyul / I kind of got that vibe from her

455
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,320
Han-kyul / That she might be around that age range

456
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
Han-kyul / So I wasn’t that surprised

457
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,000
Da-gyo / My MBTI is... ESTJ

458
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,560
Mi-rang / Oh?!

459
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,200
Jin-ah / Wait, you two have the same one?

460
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,160
Ri-won / I thought she’d be an F

461
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,200
Da-gyo / I’m a radiologic technologist

462
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,960
Da-gyo / I work at a hospital

463
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,320
Ri-won / That’s such a great job

464
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,800
Mi-rang / You wear a white coat at work, right?

465
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,840
Mi-rang / Just imagining that look suits you so well

466
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,800
Mi-rang / It makes me like you even more

467
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,560
Mi-rang / I really like that

468
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,360
Da-gyo / I’m Park Da-gyo, 26 years old, and I work as a radiologic technologist

469
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,240
Da-gyo / I mostly handle X-rays for patients

470
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,760
Da-gyo / I work at a hospital that primarily treats children

471
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,680
Da-gyo / Please hold still just like that

472
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,800
Da-gyo / I try to keep the atmosphere calm and

473
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,680
Da-gyo / I feel fulfilled when I communicate with patients

474
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,680
Da-gyo / I believe I need to be a trustworthy

475
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,720
Da-gyo / And responsible healthcare professional

476
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,360
Han-kyul / As for me

477
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,360
Han-kyul / I’m an indie singer-songwriter

478
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,280
Han-kyul / And also a freelance composer

479
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,200
Ri-won / I knew it was music

480
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,760
Ri-won / I said yesterday she probably does music~

481
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,040
Da-gyo / I had a feeling it’d be something emotional

482
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,360
Da-gyo / But I thought more like writing or something

483
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,800
Da-gyo / Didn’t expect music

484
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,240
Han-kyul / I’m Jung Han-kyul, a singer-songwriter

485
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,760
Han-kyul / Overseas, there are many artists who are openly out

486
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,360
Han-kyul / And I wondered,

487
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,520
Han-kyul / "Why aren’t there any lesbian singers in Korea?"

488
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,600
Han-kyul / That thought really stuck with me

489
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,640
Han-kyul / That’s why I introduce myself as a singer-songwriter

490
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,920
Han-kyul / Who’s open about who I am

491
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,440
Han-kyul / I’m also keeping my age private

492
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,600
Ri-won / I’m so curious I thought maybe...

493
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,360
Ri-won / Like 24 or 25

494
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,280
Ri-won / But maybe she’s even younger

495
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,880
Ri-won / I’m starting to think she might be in her early 20s

496
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,840
Min-woo / She definitely looks like the youngest

497
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,160
Han-kyul / I’m just hiding what I can

498
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,720
Min-woo / Hiding what’s visible...

499
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,080
Min-woo / That’s pretty pure

500
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,680
Min-woo / That’s kind of how it felt to me

501
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,040
Mi-rang / I'm seriously so curious

502
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,160
Han-kyul / My MBTI is INTJ

503
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,320
Ri-won / I knew it, right?

504
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,280
Ri-won / I knew it, right? /
Han-kyul / You got it exactly right

505
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,920
Ri-won / ENTJ and INTJ are a perfect match

506
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,280
Ri-won / My ex-girlfriend was INTJ

507
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,240
Ri-won / She was like a fierce little kitten too

508
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,400
Han-kyul / And I was also a trainee for an idol group

509
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,360
Ri-won / Seriously?

510
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,040
Ri-won / Can I ask which company?

511
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,320
Ri-won / We found a shared past, huh?

512
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,040
Han-kyul / Honestly, from that moment

513
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,480
Han-kyul / I started thinking, “Oh? I wanna chat with Ri-won soon”

514
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,640
Han-kyul / That thought just came to me

515
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,920
Jin-ah / I’m Kim Jin-ah

516
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,720
Jin-ah / I was born in 1994

517
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,000
Ri-won / You look so young

518
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,440
Jin-ah / I have two jobs

519
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,760
Jin-ah / One is being a psychology essay writer

520
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,280
Jin-ah / One is being a psychology essay writer /
Ri-won / Oh, you're a writer~

521
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,680
Jin-ah / The other is working at a generative AI startup

522
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Jin-ah / I'm the youngest executive there

523
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,320
Ri-won / She gave off such a smart vibe

524
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,560
Da-gyo / Totally

525
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,720
Da-gyo / The way she spoke was just so refined

526
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,600
Da-gyo / The whole time I was listening, I was like, “I knew it”

527
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,240
Da-gyo / “Of course, that makes sense” and reacting like that

528
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,480
Da-gyo / So that’s why I responded that way

529
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
Jin-ah / Hi, I'm 31-year-old Kim Jin-ah

530
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,960
Jin-ah / Working as both the youngest operations director at a Korean AI startup

531
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,120
Jin-ah / And a psychology essay writer

532
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,680
Jin-ah / The core tech stuff at my company

533
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,680
Jin-ah / Is mostly handled by IT guys

534
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,880
Jin-ah / But communication with clients

535
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,080
Jin-ah / And everything related to running the company

536
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,520
Jin-ah / That’s all under my leadership

537
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,920
Jin-ah / I always loved writing on social media

538
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,600
Jin-ah / Just posting whatever came to mind

539
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,120
Jin-ah / Then a publisher reached out to me first

540
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,520
Jin-ah / So I naturally debuted as an essayist

541
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,120
Jin-ah / And have been living as a writer ever since

542
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,000
Jin-ah / You were curious about the announcer thing—

543
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,840
Jin-ah / I started my career as a broadcast announcer

544
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,800
Ri-won / That cotton candy voice makes sense now

545
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,720
Ri-won / Like she has a cotton candy filter on her voice...

546
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Jin-ah / Since I was young, I just assumed I’d become an announcer

547
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,600
Jin-ah / So I naturally went that route

548
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,400
Jin-ah / And worked in that field through my late 20s

549
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,520
Jin-ah / But then I felt like I'd done everything I could there

550
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,760
Jin-ah / So I wanted to try something totally new

551
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,760
Jin-ah / And boldly retired

552
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,200
Jin-ah / My MBTI is INFJ

553
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,000
Jin-ah / Since I started out as an announcer

554
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,080
Jin-ah / I can’t stand awkward silence

555
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,400
Da-gyo / Ah, so that’s why...

556
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,480
Jin-ah / That’s why I don’t really go on blind dates

557
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,760
Ohh I see

558
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,240
That’s awesome

559
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,400
Da-gyo / That’s amazing

560
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,720
Seo-yeon / I’m Kim Seo-yeon

561
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,840
Mi-rang / I was curious about you

562
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,680
Seo-yeon / I was born in 1993

563
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,360
Mi-rang / Didn’t I say I might be the oldest?

564
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,800
Ri-won / Everyone's shocked by the ages

565
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,920
Ri-won / You all look so young

566
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,640
Seo-yeon / My MBTI is INFJ

567
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,840
Same as hers

568
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,560
Seo-yeon / My job is...

569
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,080
Seo-yeon / My job is...

570
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,560
Seo-yeon / I worked as a video PD in entertainment for about 4–5 years

571
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,600
Da-gyo / That’s such an unexpected job seriously

572
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,800
Seo-yeon / And now I’ve quit

573
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,280
Seo-yeon / and I'm running my own business

574
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,400
Da-gyo / Oh really?

575
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,000
Da-gyo / Your job was really unexpected

576
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,360
Da-gyo / When you said you used to be a PD...

577
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,880
Da-gyo / I just thought it sounded cool

578
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,240
Seo-yeon / I used to be a video PD in entertainment

579
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,760
Seo-yeon / and now I’m preparing to start a business

580
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,240
Seo-yeon / I’m working in the adult product industry

581
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,480
Seo-yeon / I’ve developed a women-only adult product

582
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,400
Seo-yeon / and I'm getting ready to sell it

583
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
Seo-yeon / When people think of adult content

584
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,360
Seo-yeon / women are often objectified

585
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
Seo-yeon / and portrayed that way a lot

586
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,000
Seo-yeon / But I don’t want women to be seen as sexual objects

587
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,640
Seo-yeon / I believe that women are the subjects of desire

588
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,760
Seo-yeon / and I wanted to express and sublimate that through adult products

589
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,560
Seo-yeon / That’s why I chose this field

590
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,120
Hee-young

591
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,560
Hee-young / Whoa I’m the last one

592
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,400
Hee-young / I’m Park Hee-young

593
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,160
Jin-ah / I really want to call you unnie

594
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,200
Jin-ah / Please let her be older...

595
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,240
Hee-young / I was born in ‘93

596
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,760
You look so young?!

597
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,640
Da-gyo / Wow~ I really didn’t expect that at all

598
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,000
Mi-rang / Then you two are the same age?

599
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,680
Min-woo / I seriously thought she was younger

600
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,040
Born in ‘93??

601
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,080
Seo-yeon / I thought she was way younger than me

602
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,760
Da-gyo / I really thought she was around my age

603
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,800
Seo-yeon / It's honestly shocking

604
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,760
Seo-yeon / You were surprised too, right She looks so young

605
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,480
Seo-yeon / I thought she was in her early 20s but turns out she's my age

606
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,080
Seo-yeon / I felt a bit awkward sitting next to her

607
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,480
Ri-won / Hee-young, why do you look so young

608
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,200
Ri-won / Born in '93

609
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,800
Ri-won / I was so shocked

610
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,520
Ri-won / I honestly thought she was in her mid-20s

611
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,920
Da-gyo / And because the age was so unexpected

612
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,080
Da-gyo / I really thought she was close to my age

613
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,200
Da-gyo / She said she was born in '93

614
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,320
Da-gyo / Since there's quite an age gap, I want to go on a date with her more

615
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,960
Da-gyo / I like older people

616
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,920
Hee-young / Oh and my MBTI too

617
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,560
Hee-young / I don’t really like talking about it

618
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,120
Hee-young / I'm right in the middle

619
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,360
Ri-won / Ah~ I see

620
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,960
Hee-young / I feel uncomfortable defining myself with just one type

621
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,520
Hee-young / INFP or INTP

622
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,160
Hee-young / I bounce between the two

623
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,880
Hee-young / It’s all somewhere in the middle

624
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,080
Hee-young / And I’ll tell you my job later

625
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,400
Hee-young / Once we get closer

626
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,840
Mi-rang / Your job...

627
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,280
Ri-won / Her job is a chef! A cook

628
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,600
Hee-young / Today, I’m the one~

629
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Jin-ah / I was actually curious what Hee-young does

630
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,680
Jin-ah / But I didn’t get to hear it...

631
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,600
Jin-ah / I feel like she runs a bar

632
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,200
Jin-ah / I can totally picture her shaking up drinks

633
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,600
Da-gyo / Why won’t Hee-young say what her job is?

634
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,280
Da-gyo / She’s got tattoos on her hands

635
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,080
Da-gyo / And a belly button piercing

636
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,040
Da-gyo / What could it be?

637
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,400
Seo-yeon / Tattoo artist

638
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,800
Seo-yeon / She just gives off that cool, hip vibe with piercings

639
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,400
Seo-yeon / Or maybe an idol?

640
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,320
Seo-yeon / I don’t know, and that makes me curious

641
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,520
Hee-young / That’s right

642
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,000
Mi-rang / I think maybe a chef

643
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,160
Ri-won / Right, she has knife-like precision with food

644
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,560
Ri-won / That level of control seems like a chef thing

645
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,320
Mi-rang / Or maybe something in beauty

646
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,160
Mi-rang / Or maybe something in beauty
Jin-ah / That too, or something seasonal

647
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,600
Jin-ah / Or working at night and on holidays

648
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,840
Min-woo / Everyone looks so young

649
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,600
Ri-won / Seriously, everyone looks way younger

650
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,680
Da-gyo / Right?

651
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,080
Jin-ah / I have a question

652
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,920
Jin-ah / After hearing everyone’s intros

653
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,480
Jin-ah / Did anyone surprise you?

654
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,480
Jin-ah / Like, “Oh that’s not what I expected”

655
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,160
Jin-ah / I’m curious if there’s someone like that

656
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,000
Mi-rang / Who seemed different?

657
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,760
Da-gyo / I was shocked by the age

658
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,560
Jin-ah / You and

659
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,760
Jin-ah / You
Mi-rang / Oh me?

660
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,680
Jin-ah / Da-gyo just seemed...

661
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,280
Jin-ah / So sweet and lovable

662
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,000
Da-gyo / Really?

663
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,800
Jin-ah / That’s the vibe I got

664
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,680
Jin-ah / I kept calling her Da-gyo like that

665
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,040
Jin-ah / But if she says, “I was born in '92”

666
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,720
Jin-ah / But if she says, “I was born in '92”
Da-gyo / You were born in '92?

667
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,880
Jin-ah / That’d be a big deal

668
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,360
Jin-ah / I seriously thought you were a baby

669
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,680
Jin-ah / I seriously thought you were a baby
Da-gyo / Really?

670
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,800
Jin-ah / Like born in 2000?

671
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,720
Jin-ah / I guessed between 1998 to 2002

672
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,520
Da-gyo / 2002? No one’s ever said that to me before

673
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,560
Ri-won / Now that I’m learning more about everyone, I love it

674
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,000
Jin-ah / Me too, I’m liking it even more

675
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,840
Da-gyo / I was seriously so surprised...

676
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,520
Min-woo / After the introductions

677
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,640
Min-woo / I’m honestly most curious about Seo-yeon

678
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,440
Min-woo / I feel like she won’t say much

679
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,440
Seo-yeon / Right now, my number one is

680
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,880
Seo-yeon / Da-gyo

681
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,160
Seo-yeon / Second place

682
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,480
Seo-yeon / Is Ri-won

683
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,440
Ri-won / Mi-rang?

684
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,800
Ri-won / I’m curious about Mi-rang

685
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,880
Ri-won / Her personality...

686
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,360
Ri-won / Might be the kind I really like?

687
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,520
Ri-won / That’s why I’m curious

688
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,000
Mi-rang / My interest level / Da-gyo 70

689
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Mi-rang / Jin-ah 30

690
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,320
Da-gyo / Mi-rang and Hee-young

691
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,920
Da-gyo / My interest in both of them went up

692
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,560
Da-gyo / I still don’t know Hee-young’s job

693
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,040
Da-gyo / But Mi-rang’s job really surprised me

694
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,680
Da-gyo / How is that possible?

695
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,840
Han-kyul / For me, it was definitely Ri-won
because

696
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,840
Han-kyul / I was just so happy to find a fellow professional

697
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,320
Mi-rang / The truth is, we already knew each other

698
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,440
Da-gyo / Who here didn’t know that?

699
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,400
Ri-won / I knew the moment I arrived

700
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,960
Mi-rang / About what kind of relationship we had

701
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,720
Mi-rang / A lot of people were really curious

702
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,440
Mi-rang / We just knew each other as acquaintances

703
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,200
Mi-rang / There was never anything romantic

704
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,280
Min-woo / From the very beginning

705
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,360
Min-woo / We were just friends from the start

706
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,720
Min-woo / Nothing ever happened

707
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,520
Jin-ah / But I actually have something I’m really curious about

708
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,240
Jin-ah / I used to think I was pansexual

709
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,800
Jin-ah / Because I don’t care about gender or job

710
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,240
Min-woo / Gender, job, family status?

711
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,720
Jin-ah / None of those matter to me at all

712
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,840
Jin-ah / But now that I want to get married

713
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,240
Jin-ah / I only want to date women

714
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,480
Jin-ah / When getting to know a guy, it naturally leads to marriage

715
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,840
Jin-ah / It just flows like that

716
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,120
Jin-ah / But with a girlfriend, I feel like I have to ask

717
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,720
Jin-ah / Try to convince her and stuff

718
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,760
Jin-ah / Even hide things on social media

719
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,440
Jin-ah / I’m just curious about those things

720
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,200
Jin-ah / And what people think about marriage

721
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,680
Jin-ah / I’m curious what others think
Ri-won / I actually think differently

722
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,720
Ri-won / There are guys who say they want to get married

723
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,480
Ri-won / And then just ghost you

724
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,560
Jin-ah / That’s true

725
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,240
Ri-won / And women too...

726
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,720
Ri-won / Women can totally get married these days

727
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,040
Ri-won / I actually looked into it

728
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,480
Ri-won / There’s a system where you can adopt as legal family

729
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,720
Ri-won / In Korea

730
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,200
Ri-won / That’s one way to do it

731
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,240
Ri-won / I think what kind of person you are matters more than gender

732
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,320
Ri-won / That’s more important

733
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,840
Ri-won / Just because someone’s a man

734
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,320
Ri-won / Doesn’t mean they’ll all get married

735
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,480
Jin-ah / I want to have a wedding ceremony

736
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Jin-ah / I think preparing for that symbol of love

737
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,000
Jin-ah / Brings out more responsibility

738
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,400
Jin-ah / Between two people

739
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,720
Mi-rang / I really like money...

740
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,840
Da-gyo / Money? Haha who doesn’t like money

741
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,640
Mi-rang / One reason I became ambitious

742
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,080
Mi-rang / One of my goals is also marriage

743
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,040
Mi-rang / I want a wedding ceremony too

744
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,560
Jin-ah / Yeah I want one too

745
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,200
Da-gyo / Don’t we all?

746
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,480
Jin-ah / A super cool one

747
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,920
Jin-ah / That’s why I’m working hard to make money

748
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,120
Han-kyul / That’s awesome

749
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,960
Min-woo / I think we all have the same goal

750
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,120
Da-gyo / I think so too

751
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,760
Ri-won / I mean you’d need that kind of drive

752
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,920
Ri-won / To even come on this show, right?

753
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,640
Jin-ah / Oh, is it a special trait?

754
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,920
Jin-ah / I thought there wouldn’t be many

755
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,720
Jin-ah / So I was curious

756
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,400
Jin-ah / I came here because I really want to meet someone to marry

757
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,880
Jin-ah / So I dropped that topic gently

758
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,440
Jin-ah / And if someone’s the right one, that should really mean something

759
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,480
Jin-ah / Like a plus 15 or something?

760
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,280
Jin-ah / So I did try to put that out there

761
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,360
Jin-ah / Hoping it would resonate with someone

762
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,440
Han-kyul / I feel like such a fool

763
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,200
Han-kyul / I feel like such a fool
Ri-won / You don’t seem like a fool

764
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,240
Han-kyul / What if people think I’m a fool?

765
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,520
Ri-won / Why would you be a fool?

766
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,680
Han-kyul / I was acting like that over there

767
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,160
Ri-won / It’s okay, you were tipsy

768
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,800
Han-kyul / What company were you with? Can you say?

769
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,480
Ri-won / I can say it. I was with SM

770
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,680
Han-kyul / No wonder your face proportions...

771
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,600
Han-kyul / The ratio is something else

772
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,320
Ri-won / I was cast from a dance academy in middle school

773
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,440
Ri-won / That’s how I started

774
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,280
Ri-won / I did it for about 3 years

775
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,360
Ri-won / How long did you do it?

776
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,960
Han-kyul / I joined early in high school

777
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,320
Han-kyul / And left around July of sophomore year

778
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,600
Ri-won / Oh so you joined a bit later

779
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,640
Ri-won / Were you street cast?

780
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,760
Han-kyul / I auditioned

781
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,520
Ri-won / Were you better at singing or dancing?

782
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,400
Han-kyul / I was more like the rapper type

783
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,920
Han-kyul / I kept bringing up face size, remember?

784
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,480
Han-kyul / Because someone in the same position

785
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,120
Han-kyul / With a similar image to mine

786
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,720
Han-kyul / Had a way smaller face than me

787
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,600
Han-kyul / And I think I got pushed out because of that

788
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,440
Han-kyul / That stuck with me

789
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,680
Han-kyul / I think I’ve held onto that point ever since

790
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,440
Han-kyul / That’s why I kept talking about face size

791
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,720
Ri-won / That’s why you kept bringing it up

792
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,640
Ri-won / That’s why you kept bringing it up
Han-kyul / I never had insecurities about my looks

793
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,320
Han-kyul / But I think it started after getting cut

794
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,000
Han-kyul / So I’ve been trying to overcome it

795
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,760
Han-kyul / Honestly, I never thought I’d be talking about this here

796
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,920
Han-kyul / It feels like I’ve gone back to those days

797
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,360
Han-kyul / Like I’ve time traveled

798
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,560
Han-kyul / And it made me really happy to find a fellow trainee

799
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:47,400
Han-kyul / That joy was pretty big for me

800
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,840
Ri-won / And I keep thinking, you’re so pretty

801
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,720
Ri-won / Why do you say you're not pretty

802
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,160
Ri-won / and that someone else is pretty? You're way prettier

803
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,760
Han-kyul / You're the prettiest in my eyes

804
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,320
Han-kyul / I've said way too much

805
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,040
Han-kyul / I'm curious if your impression of me...

806
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,000
Han-kyul / has changed even a little

807
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,280
Ri-won / I'm the same

808
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,360
Ri-won / Even if you're just a college student and unemployed

809
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,120
Ri-won / it wouldn't change anything for me

810
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,800
Han-kyul / You gave me a note, right?

811
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,080
Ri-won / I made it obvious

812
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,960
Han-kyul / There were plenty of others you could’ve chosen

813
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Han-kyul / Why did you use that precious one on me?

814
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,000
Ri-won / What are you talking about?
Han-kyul / I just feel so sorry now

815
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,440
Han-kyul / I mean...

816
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,800
Han-kyul / I just gave it to the person I wanted to give it to

817
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,680
Han-kyul / Thank you

818
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,720
Ri-won / When you said, "Thank you so much," I thought

819
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,880
Ri-won / that's how it all starts

820
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,240
Ri-won / And I started spinning up some hopeful thoughts

821
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,400
Ri-won / 'Oh, they’re starting to feel grateful now'

822
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,360
Ri-won / That’s kind of what I was thinking

823
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,600
Jin-ah / Can I come in?

824
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
Jin-ah / Can I come in?
Han-kyul / Of course

825
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,840
Han-kyul / Come on in

826
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,280
Jin-ah / I came back since I left my slippers

827
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,760
Han-kyul / Sorry it's a bit messy in here

828
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,440
Ri-won / Yeah there's nothing we can do about it

829
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,920
Jin-ah / I was honestly scared of Han-kyul yesterday

830
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,120
Jin-ah / As soon as I walked in

831
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,000
Jin-ah / I thought, 'Wow, she's really pretty'

832
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,960
Jin-ah / 'She probably fits a lot of different preferences'

833
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,080
Jin-ah / But your expression was kind of blank

834
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,680
Jin-ah / So I didn’t feel any romantic attraction

835
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,440
Jin-ah / But then during your self-introduction

836
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,000
Jin-ah / you seemed so soft and gentle

837
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,440
Jin-ah / I liked that human side of you

838
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,200
Jin-ah / It made me want to talk to you more

839
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,080
Ri-won / Hey, we didn’t get to finish our talk earlier

840
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,640
Jin-ah / About what? My boyfriend?

841
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,240
Ri-won / You were tearing up

842
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,120
Ri-won / Are you okay now?

843
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,640
Ri-won / You went again just now

844
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,000
Jin-ah / I'm okay now

845
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,640
Ri-won / That's a relief

846
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,040
Jin-ah / But... I’ve been overthinking

847
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,120
Ri-won / Why?

848
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,320
Ri-won / I thought things had actually become clearer

849
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,480
Jin-ah / I struggle with things that aren’t clear

850
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,560
Ri-won / It's not clear?

851
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,800
Jin-ah / It's like, 'This is okay, and I get you, but...'

852
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,640
Jin-ah / 'We still have to go this way'

853
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,160
Jin-ah / It’s kind of like being indecisive

854
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,640
Ri-won / Are you interested in getting to know someone else?

855
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,200
Han-kyul / You are?

856
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,600
Han-kyul / Then go ahead and try

857
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,840
Ri-won / But if you try everyone

858
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,960
Ri-won / I don't think there's anyone who wouldn't like you

859
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,840
Jin-ah / I was actually curious about Mi-rang

860
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,120
Jin-ah / But it's not like I had a crush

861
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,760
Jin-ah / It's just based on my past...

862
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,680
Ri-won / Right, what I was curious about was

863
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,560
Ri-won / Mi-rang kind of seems similar to

864
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,400
Ri-won / the people I used to date

865
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,960
Ri-won / So if I got the chance to go on a date

866
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,120
Ri-won / I think I’d really like the chemistry with Mi-rang

867
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,160
Han-kyul / Someone who can embrace you warmly

868
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,640
Han-kyul / If you're with that kind of person

869
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,520
Han-kyul / I think you'd have amazing chemistry

870
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,200
Han-kyul / I think you'd have amazing chemistry
Jin-ah / But Mi-rang seems to like Da-gyo

871
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,520
Ri-won / But that’s the thing

872
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,000
Ri-won / It's only our second day, nothing’s set yet

873
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,920
Ri-won / If someone shows interest in you

874
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,000
Ri-won / and expresses it

875
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,840
Ri-won / I'm open to trying things out with them

876
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,320
Ri-won / It's not like I'm charging ahead with anyone right now

877
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,080
Jin-ah / Really?

878
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,240
Ri-won / Yeah, really

879
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,920
Han-kyul / Is it that their looks are totally your type?

880
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,040
Jin-ah / I didn’t think so at first

881
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,520
Jin-ah / But after they removed their makeup, they totally are

882
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,280
Jin-ah / At first, definitely not

883
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,920
Jin-ah / At first, definitely not
Han-kyul / I haven’t seen her without makeup

884
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,960
Jin-ah / Mi-rang’s first impression was really flashy

885
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,920
Jin-ah / I thought she was like a baby

886
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,680
Jin-ah / She was like, “I like being doted on”

887
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,200
Jin-ah / But people who *really* like being doted on

888
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,240
Jin-ah / usually pretend they don’t

889
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,800
Ri-won / Right, they act tough

890
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
Ri-won / Right, they act tough
Jin-ah / Who does that? Me!

891
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,160
Jin-ah / The one I want to get to know is Mi-rang

892
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,480
Jin-ah / But it doesn’t seem like Mi-rang

893
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,800
Jin-ah / is here to meet someone she really likes

894
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,280
Jin-ah / And there’s Da-gyo too

895
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,120
Jin-ah / So instead

896
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,640
Jin-ah / of causing all this confusion like a slippery eel

897
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,880
Jin-ah / I thought maybe I'd like to get to know Han-kyul better

898
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,720
Jin-ah / It’s not as strong as what I felt with Mi-rang

899
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,080
Jin-ah / But the fact that my feelings grew from zero to this

900
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,800
Jin-ah / feels like something meaningful to me

901
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,040
Han-kyul / Oh you came?

902
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,720
Jin-ah / This is a gift

903
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,360
Jin-ah / You can keep it

904
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,400
Han-kyul / No I’ll buy it and read it myself

905
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,640
Ri-won / That’s so touching

906
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,920
Han-kyul / I want to buy and read it

907
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,120
Min-woo / Is this your book, Jin-ah?

908
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,560
Min-woo / This one, but I...

909
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,760
Jin-ah / I wrote it and received it and read it for the first time

910
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,880
Jin-ah / I wrote it and received it and read it for the first time
Han-kyul / But could you sign it?

911
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,000
Jin-ah / The Day 3 date

912
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,400
Jin-ah / To me it means ‘getting to know someone anew’

913
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,000
Jin-ah / When I think of ‘getting to know someone anew’

914
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,680
Jin-ah / That vibe matches you, Han-kyul

915
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,880
Jin-ah / But if I ask you out for a date tomorrow

916
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,640
Jin-ah / Then Mi-rang won’t get the chance

917
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,440
Jin-ah / To get to know you in that new way

918
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,040
Jin-ah / I’m about 90% sure of that

919
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,440
Jin-ah / So which one do I let go of?

920
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,600
Seo-yeon / How many people are you interested in, Hee-young?

921
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,920
Hee-young / How many?

922
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,000
Hee-young / I usually don’t take interest in people easily

923
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,000
Seo-yeon / Then how many people are you *not* interested in?

924
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,960
Hee-young / But strangely...

925
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,720
Seo-yeon / There’s no one you actively dislike or find uncomfortable

926
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,200
Hee-young / Yeah I don’t really try to blend into social groups

927
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,680
Hee-young / And I’ve never confessed to someone first

928
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,200
Seo-yeon / You need someone to like you first

929
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,240
Seo-yeon / That’s the style you go for

930
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,320
Hee-young / I went on a date and got scolded

931
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,400
Hee-young / For being clueless

932
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,280
Seo-yeon / That was deserved

933
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,440
Hee-young / Why? Do you know something?

934
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,400
Seo-yeon / I know everything

935
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,120
Hee-young / Seriously?

936
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,440
Hee-young / What is it? What do I have?

937
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,640
Seo-yeon / You do
Hee-young / I don’t though?

938
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,720
Hee-young / I really don’t

939
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,040
Hee-young / No I didn’t have anything

940
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,680
Hee-young / No I didn’t have anything
Seo-yeon / You did

941
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,480
Seo-yeon / Ah~ you *did*

942
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,440
Hee-young / No I didn’t
Seo-yeon / You totally did

943
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,160
Hee-young / I’m telling you I didn’t

944
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,000
Seo-yeon / You did~

945
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,040
Hee-young / I didn’t

946
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,440
Hee-young / Gosh you’re so off

947
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,840
Seo-yeon / You really have no sense

948
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,640
Hee-young / Who is it?

949
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,800
Seo-yeon / Give and take

950
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,560
Hee-young / Ugh here we go again

951
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,040
Hee-young / But they’re really busy...

952
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,960
Hee-young / I mean there are so many

953
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,440
Seo-yeon / I got a second note and didn’t receive anything

954
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,800
Hee-young / Second... oh me too

955
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,160
Seo-yeon / I didn’t get anything either

956
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,680
Hee-young / So that’s the give and take

957
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,800
Seo-yeon / Thanks!

958
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,160
Hee-young / Okay~

959
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,640
Hee-young / Did you find that out from a one-on-one?

960
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,240
Seo-yeon / Yeah

961
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,680
Seo-yeon / I just casually asked next to them “How many notes did you get?”

962
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,600
Seo-yeon / Just like that...

963
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,680
Hee-young / So smooth

964
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,520
Seo-yeon / I just asked them nearby

965
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,920
Hee-young / Then I must have had someone

966
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,800
Hee-young / I guess I did?

967
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,640
Seo-yeon / You did

968
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,520
Hee-young / I don’t know now

969
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,600
Seo-yeon / Yeah

970
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,400
Hee-young / Then that means I don’t

971
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,120
Hee-young / While talking I realized we just clicked

972
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,440
Hee-young / It was just chill and comfortable

973
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,160
Hee-young / I think we both felt we could be friends

974
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,560
Hee-young / It felt like meeting from a total friendship vibe

975
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,400
Mi-rang / We should eat some fruit

976
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,640
Da-gyo / This much? I can pick for sure

977
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,720
Mi-rang / Your face turning red makes it even better for me

978
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,040
Da-gyo / I just put on makeup though

979
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,640
Mi-rang / Really?
Da-gyo / It’s still red...

980
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,320
Mi-rang / Now it just looks like you applied blush

981
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,320
Da-gyo / I tried really hard to tone it down

982
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,280
Mi-rang / But seriously...

983
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,120
Mi-rang / I was surprised

984
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,840
Mi-rang / When I told you my age

985
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,800
Mi-rang / I kept thinking

986
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,360
Mi-rang / ‘What if they’re disappointed?’

987
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,680
Mi-rang / Nowadays it’s awkward to even bring up age

988
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,400
Da-gyo / You don’t look that way at all not even close

989
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,920
Da-gyo / Then how old are you?

990
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,680
Da-gyo / Thirty... five in Korean age?

991
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:05,520
Mi-rang / Four

992
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,440
Da-gyo / Thirty-four

993
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,480
Da-gyo / When you say it like that it sounds older

994
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,480
Mi-rang / Are you dissing me?

995
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,800
Da-gyo / I’m kidding

996
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,320
Da-gyo / You seriously look so young

997
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,520
Mi-rang / How long have you been doing that job?

998
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,920
Da-gyo / About 3 years

999
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,680
Da-gyo / Is this my 3rd year?

1000
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,040
Mi-rang / So do you go in wearing all white every day?

1001
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,120
Mi-rang / Is that how it is?

1002
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:31,200
Da-gyo / I just wear hospital clothes or staff uniforms

1003
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,440
Mi-rang / I get X-rays taken, X-rays

1004
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,480
Da-gyo / Mostly

1005
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,480
Mi-rang / I bet you’d look so pretty working in uniform

1006
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,760
Seo-yeon / Mi-rang unnie definitely knows

1007
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,200
Seo-yeon / that I like Da-gyo

1008
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,960
Seo-yeon / But even so, in that kitchen

1009
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,600
Seo-yeon / she came and sat at the table right next to me

1010
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,080
Seo-yeon / and had that kind of conversation with Da-gyo

1011
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,440
Seo-yeon / Knowing how I feel, did she really need to come next to me

1012
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,440
Seo-yeon / and talk about things like that?

1013
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,480
Seo-yeon / Why would she go that far when she knows how I feel?

1014
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,400
Seo-yeon / It’s not like we’re on bad terms

1015
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,000
Seo-yeon / It just really makes me wonder...

1016
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,720
Seo-yeon / Does she hate me?

1017
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,080
Seo-yeon / That thought crossed my mind

1018
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,840
Seo-yeon / Pretty solid, right?

1019
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,080
Min-woo / Honestly you don’t seem like the type to use stuff like this

1020
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,800
Min-woo / I thought your personality would be super sharp

1021
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,480
Seo-yeon / Not at all
Min-woo / But you’re surprisingly cute and dainty

1022
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,480
Seo-yeon / I actually use things like this a lot

1023
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,280
Min-woo / Really?

1024
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,640
Seo-yeon / How was your date today?

1025
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,920
Min-woo / I just chose based on first impressions

1026
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,400
Min-woo / But it wasn’t bad

1027
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,280
Min-woo / But for me

1028
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,920
Min-woo / I usually prefer same age or older

1029
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,120
Seo-yeon / Oh really?

1030
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,920
Min-woo / They seemed kind of young so that was a little disappointing

1031
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,200
Min-woo / But it’s still the first time meeting

1032
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,880
Seo-yeon / How many people are you interested in?

1033
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,840
Min-woo / Two people!

1034
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,440
Seo-yeon / You’re very clear about it

1035
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,680
Min-woo / Yeah I’m not good at juggling

1036
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,560
Seo-yeon / Still it must be nice to have someone you feel comfortable with

1037
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,320
Min-woo / But as you can see

1038
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,680
Min-woo / That side is kind of loud

1039
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,840
Min-woo / I think I’m kind of weak in group settings

1040
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,600
Seo-yeon / Me too

1041
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,280
Seo-yeon / But your image is kind of

1042
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,880
Seo-yeon / very composed so it seems hard to approach you

1043
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,600
Seo-yeon / That’s the kind of vibe you give off

1044
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,320
Seo-yeon / What’s your personality like?

1045
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,000
Min-woo / I don’t think I’m the type

1046
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,760
Min-woo / to just easily go along with anything

1047
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,280
Min-woo / But when I do date, I treat them really well

1048
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,680
Seo-yeon / As a partner?

1049
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,000
Min-woo / Of course

1050
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,760
Min-woo / That comes with a sense of responsibility, right?

1051
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,320
Min-woo / It's kind of like raising a cat or a dog

1052
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,320
Min-woo / If we had just met

1053
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,120
Min-woo / I don’t think I would’ve stayed single for long

1054
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,520
Min-woo / But the gap was a bit long

1055
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,680
Seo-yeon / How many years?

1056
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,720
Min-woo / For me, it was 2 years

1057
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:05,840
Seo-yeon / For me, 6 years

1058
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,800
Min-woo / What?

1059
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,240
Min-woo / But for me, I was also really busy with work

1060
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,560
Seo-yeon / That happens when you're busy

1061
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,120
Min-woo / 6 years?

1062
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,960
Seo-yeon / Yeah, for 6 years

1063
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,440
Min-woo / How did you go 6 years

1064
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,400
Min-woo / Isn’t that almost like avoiding it on purpose?

1065
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,200
Seo-yeon / I just tend to get really into something when I like it

1066
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,640
Min-woo / You didn’t feel the need for it?

1067
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,200
Seo-yeon / Yeah

1068
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,760
Min-woo / That’s interesting

1069
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,240
Seo-yeon / Can I ask what kind of style you like?

1070
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,960
Min-woo / I don’t really like the super princessy type

1071
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,120
Min-woo / Appearance doesn’t matter to me

1072
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,880
Seo-yeon / But someone who's just like a friend is okay, right?

1073
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,920
Min-woo / I love that

1074
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,280
Seo-yeon / Ah, I guess I’m definitely not it

1075
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,520
Seo-yeon / Actually, I’m

1076
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,480
Seo-yeon / Not really the princess type either

1077
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,360
Seo-yeon / Anyway, I guess that means I’m not your type

1078
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,680
Min-woo / Wait, but seriously, you've been single for 6 years?

1079
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,120
Seo-yeon / When I get really into something

1080
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,840
Seo-yeon / I can think about that one thing all day

1081
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,400
Seo-yeon / I go all in

1082
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,880
Seo-yeon / Back then I was really into writing

1083
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,200
Seo-yeon / I’d just think about that all day long

1084
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,920
Seo-yeon / And I’d just do that one thing

1085
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,880
Seo-yeon / If I’m dating, I focus only on dating

1086
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,240
Seo-yeon / I’m that kind of person

1087
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,960
Min-woo / What if you dated and worked at the same time?

1088
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:22,400
Seo-yeon / Now I can balance it out a bit more

1089
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,280
Seo-yeon / But I couldn’t do that back then

1090
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,240
Min-woo / Wow seriously

1091
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,160
Min-woo / I really don’t get people’s hearts

1092
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,760
Min-woo / I don’t even get my own heart

1093
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,040
Seo-yeon / But you’ve only been here a few hours

1094
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:41,320
Seo-yeon / It's more amazing to understand someone’s heart already...

1095
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,920
Seo-yeon / It's kind of fascinating

1096
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,480
Min-woo / Even the vibe that you give off, Seo-yeon

1097
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,360
Min-woo / It feels strong to me

1098
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,680
Min-woo / It’s definitely not a light aura or anything like that

1099
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,920
Hee-young / I’ve been thinking a lot about this too, even if briefly

1100
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,360
Hee-young / Whether someone has really had feelings for me

1101
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,680
Hee-young / Turns out I kept meeting people who were very direct about it

1102
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,280
Hee-young / I think I’m really slow at noticing things

1103
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,520
Hee-young / Unless someone says it in a very obvious or intense way

1104
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,200
Hee-young / Unless they say it directly

1105
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,400
Hee-young / I just don’t pick up on it

1106
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,120
Seo-yeon / Was there someone you wanted to go on a date with?

1107
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,080
Seo-yeon / Someone you *wanted* to...

1108
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,520
Seo-yeon / I assumed today’s question was “write to someone you're interested in”

1109
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:27,160
Seo-yeon / So I thought “Of course I’ll just write to Ri-won” and went with that

1110
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,960
Seo-yeon / But turns out, that wasn’t it

1111
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,600
Han-kyul / I interpreted the question as a hypothetical “if”

1112
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,600
Han-kyul / So I excluded the person I actually went on a date with today

1113
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,800
Han-kyul / And wrote without much hesitation

1114
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,240
Han-kyul / Because that was how I really felt

1115
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,920
Han-kyul / That was my honest answer

1116
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,720
Min-woo / I also thought I should exclude the person I already dated

1117
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,240
Min-woo / That was the approach I took

1118
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,960
Ri-won / I honestly didn’t think much after the first note

1119
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,560
Ri-won / But starting from the second note

1120
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,320
Ri-won / I started thinking, “Huh? Maybe I kind of do feel that way?”

1121
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,880
Ri-won / And by today’s note

1122
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,880
Ri-won / I think it changed to “Yeah I think I should go for it”

1123
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,280
Ri-won / I’m curious about something

1124
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,320
Ri-won / If someone you thought had zero interest in you

1125
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,400
Ri-won / suddenly asked to go on a walk, just the two of you

1126
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,680
Ri-won / Would you go?

1127
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,200
Hee-young / Of course I would

1128
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:55,880
Ri-won / Really?

1129
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:56,600
Han-kyul / I would too!

1130
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,600
Jin-ah / You’d be curious, right?

1131
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,720
Jin-ah / Like “Why’d they ask me?”

1132
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,280
Da-gyo / Yeah because you don’t know what it’s about

1133
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,480
Hee-young / If they say “Wanna go for a walk?” and you go “No”...

1134
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,600
Hee-young / That’s weird

1135
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,960
Jin-ah / They’re going to say “I like this and that about you”

1136
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,800
Jin-ah / That’s probably why they called you

1137
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,920
Jin-ah / And just being seen that way

1138
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,120
Jin-ah / Could make you feel something too

1139
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,680
Min-woo / If someone said “Let’s go for a walk,” I’d be like “Why?”

1140
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,200
Min-woo / Especially if it’s someone I never thought about that way

1141
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,440
Min-woo / “Why?”

1142
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,880
Hee-young / But that “why” could also come from curiosity

1143
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,080
Hee-young / You could just go and hear them out

1144
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,560
Hee-young / Or just ask them directly

1145
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,800
Da-gyo / But when you ask “why?”

1146
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,160
Da-gyo / And they just say “Just come out”

1147
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,080
Min-woo / Yeah!

1148
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,840
But you know how it is

1149
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,400
Jin-ah / Since we’re getting closer

1150
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,000
Jin-ah / And hanging out together like this

1151
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,520
Jin-ah / More and more I'm getting interested...

1152
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:43,280
Ah I don’t want to check

1153
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,600
Let’s go

1154
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,520
Ri-won / Let's go

1155
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,920
Ri-won / I think I’d be happy with just Han-kyul’s note

1156
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,360
Ri-won / I thought I would get zero notes

1157
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:17,080
Ri-won / And honestly I think I could’ve gotten one from Seo-yeon

1158
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,000
Ri-won / To be honest

1159
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,200
Ri-won / But I didn’t want to confuse someone just to get a note

1160
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,080
Ri-won / So after the date

1161
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,360
Ri-won / I think I tried not to confuse Seo-yeon

1162
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,480
Ri-won / So she could send it to someone else

1163
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,400
Ri-won / I think I tried to be considerate

1164
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,360
Ri-won / So she could send it to someone else

1165
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,880
Ri-won / I’ll go down

1166
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,400
Han-kyul / You’ll go down?

1167
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,880
Han-kyul / Ugh I don’t want to open it

1168
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,040
To. Han-kyul

1169
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,960
There was supposed to be a fish

1170
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,920
But a real person showed up instead

1171
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,720
Ri-won / So you went on a date with Han-kyul...

1172
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,480
Ri-won / Next time, please make chocolate pudding for sure

1173
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,760
Ri-won / You worked hard making dinner today

1174
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,920
Ri-won / I think the fact that Han-kyul got zero votes on day one

1175
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,280
Ri-won / Getting zero votes

1176
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,720
Ri-won / And saying “Ah I figured this would happen”

1177
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,400
Ri-won / “It’s all going just as I expected”

1178
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,400
Ri-won / “As expected, my role is the extra”

1179
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,800
Ri-won / Saying all that as my roommate right next to me

1180
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,480
Ri-won / I think that made me care more

1181
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,400
Seo-yeon / I feel like I didn’t get one

1182
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,320
Seo-yeon / I didn’t get one last time either

1183
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,680
Min-woo / To. Seo-yeon

1184
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,720
Min-woo / Were you really being considerate?

1185
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,480
Seo-yeon / Want to sit with me?

1186
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:14,960
Min-woo / Sure

1187
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,960
Min-woo / You said you were being considerate, Seo-yeon

1188
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,680
Min-woo / But I saw that look in your eyes

1189
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,080
Min-woo / Even while I was looking elsewhere

1190
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,560
Min-woo / I could feel eyes looking at me

1191
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,120
Min-woo / So I think you

1192
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,960
Min-woo / probably thought I wasn’t interested in you at all

1193
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,160
Min-woo / But I don’t like making things obvious

1194
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:35,040
Min-woo / I’m more of a strategic type

1195
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,240
Min-woo / That’s why I didn’t show it but ended up writing the note earlier

1196
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,360
Seo-yeon / Today was seriously crazy

1197
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,760
Seo-yeon / Today really...

1198
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,280
Seo-yeon / Seriously what do I even do today

1199
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,720
Seo-yeon / Do you know what was written in my note?

1200
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,720
Seo-yeon / “Were you really being considerate?”

1201
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,840
Seo-yeon / That’s what it said

1202
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,520
Seo-yeon / How am I supposed to sleep now?

1203
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,440
Seo-yeon / Can you let me change rooms?

1204
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,000
Seo-yeon / How do I sleep now?

1205
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,520
Seo-yeon / Seriously what do I do I don’t think I can sleep

1206
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,640
Seo-yeon / I really didn’t think it would be me

1207
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,000
Seo-yeon / Wow... what do I do

1208
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,680
Seo-yeon / I usually don’t like people who say they like me

1209
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:59,280
Seo-yeon / But maybe because I’m here

1210
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,960
Seo-yeon / Hearing that he likes me is making me shaky and curious

1211
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,920
Seo-yeon / I don’t know I’m going crazy

1212
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,480
Mi-rang / Huh?

1213
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,160
Min-woo / I didn’t know it would be revealed right away

1214
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,160
Min-woo / And I wrote the note to Seo-yeon

1215
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:17,560
Min-woo / What do I do

1216
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,920
Min-woo / Seeing her smile like that just from one note

1217
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,360
Min-woo / It really shows love conquers all

1218
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,640
Min-woo / No matter how hard you work

1219
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,520
Min-woo / I think you really do need someone to love

1220
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,640
Mi-rang / You already looked?

1221
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,120
Mi-rang / I can’t bring myself to look

1222
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,640
Ri-won / Why? Are you nervous?

1223
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,920
Ri-won / That’s a real reaction

1224
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,080
Mi-rang / Da-gyo looked really confused

1225
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,080
Mi-rang / So I thought, “Did she not write one for me?”

1226
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,040
Ri-won / Why that face?
Jin-ah / How was it?

1227
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,360
Ri-won / Why the face?
Jin-ah / Huh? What?

1228
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,320
Ri-won / You look like you’re about to cry again

1229
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,640
Da-gyo / It’s just... just... no

1230
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,840
Da-gyo / I wrote it well

1231
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,360
Da-gyo / I just think I did okay

1232
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:11,960
Mi-rang / The look on her face was like “That was kind of hard” so

1233
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,160
Mi-rang / That made me think maybe Da-gyo didn’t give one to me
