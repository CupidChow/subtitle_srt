1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,320
Jin-ah / We were wrong

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,440
Jin-ah / We were really wrong

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,320
Hee-young / Huh?

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
Wow I'm so curious

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,640
Seriously curious

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,200
Jin-ah / Why? Are you super popular?

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,520
Da-gyo / What's going on?

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,240
Hee-young / What are we supposed to do?

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,040
What is this

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,320
Jin-ah / This is so fun, it’s actually fun...

11
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,440
Jin-ah / What are we supposed to do? What is this?

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,520
Jin-ah / What are we supposed to do? What is this?
Da-gyo / Exactly

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,480
Jin-ah / No seriously, I feel like a viewer right now because

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,360
Jin-ah / I watch Hee-young react, then I look at Da-gyo

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,680
Jin-ah / It’s like watching a VCR and being a panel guest

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,680
Jin-ah / And then Da-gyo is looking at me

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,240
Jin-ah / and doing all this stuff

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,920
Da-gyo / Oh no

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,800
Hee-young / Wait, that’s how it looks from there?

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,000
Jin-ah / When Hee-young says something

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,560
Jin-ah / Da-gyo is doing this to me again

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,040
Jin-ah / This is hilarious

23
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,640
Hee-young / So, do you wanna go on a date?

24
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,960
Hee-young / So

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,880
Hee-young / Do you wanna go on a date?

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Hee-young / So, do you wanna go on a date?

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,560
Jin-ah / Me?

28
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,880
Jin-ah / Oh, is that what this is? Ah hahaha

29
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,840
Da-gyo / I’ll excuse myself for a moment

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
Da-gyo / You ladies can have your conversation

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,600
Da-gyo / Just for a bit

32
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,160
Jin-ah / I was flustered, happy, excited, and thankful

33
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,120
Hee-young / What do I do? This situation is just...

34
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,200
Hee-young / If it wasn’t something I had to do because I was told to

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,600
Hee-young / I would've taken it much slower

36
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,280
Hee-young / It kind of feels like we’re becoming a couple way too early

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,960
Hee-young / But even so, I couldn’t ask someone out

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,440
Hee-young / If I wasn’t at least interested in them, right?

39
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,640
Hee-young / What kind of viewer is that

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,200
Hee-young / What kind of viewer is that
Jin-ah / Oh right I’m not a viewer, haha

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Hee-young / Are we leaving now?

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,600
Hee-young / Are we leaving now?
Jin-ah / Let's go

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,720
Da-gyo / So this is what it feels like to lose...

44
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,480
Seo-yeon / It’s still too early to feel down

45
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,520
Seo-yeon / It’s only the first day...

46
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,680
Seo-yeon / Is the first day always this frustrating?

47
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,240
Mi-rang / Ugh it’s so frustrating, seriously

48
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
Seo-yeon / I feel all mixed up inside...

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,560
Han-kyul / Huh

50
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,760
Ri-won / Huh? Now I’m jealous

51
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,960
Ri-won / Huh? I'm jealous
Han-kyul / Are we staying in?

52
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
Mi-rang / Who is it? So who was it?

53
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,120
Seo-yeon / It's not us, right? Haha

54
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,200
Hee-young / Should we head out?

55
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,680
Da-gyo / Oh no

56
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,720
Da-gyo / Let us know when you're back

57
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,800
Da-gyo / Let us know when you're back
Jin-ah / Okay

58
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,000
Why?

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,160
Jin-ah / Do you like cats more? Or dogs more?

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,760
Hee-young / I love all animals

61
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,560
Jin-ah / Good answer

62
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,800
Hee-young / Good answer?!

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,880
Jin-ah / No, not that kind of “good answer”

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,120
Jin-ah / That’s a good one

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,760
Hello~?

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,200
Hee-young / I’m literally standing outside

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,560
Jin-ah / Our first meal in Jeju

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,880
Hee-young / Wow I’m so hungry

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,200
Mackerel and this must be hairtail

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,600
Jin-ah / I wanna take a photo

71
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,320
Jin-ah / I wanna take a photo
Hee-young / Me too

72
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,400
Jin-ah / Turn on location tag too

73
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,680
Jin-ah / It’s not coming out pretty

74
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,920
Hee-young / Just capturing the moment~

75
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,000
Jin-ah / No but

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Jin-ah / I look like someone who just caught the fish

77
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,120
Hee-young / I think it looks fine?

78
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,040
Hee-young / Should I take one with this?

79
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,840
Hee-young / Want me to take one for you?

80
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,320
Jin-ah / Here? Can you do it later?

81
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,440
Jin-ah / When I go on dates

82
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Jin-ah / I really like creating shared memories

83
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,040
Jin-ah / So I realized I’d love to go on more photo-taking dates

84
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,320
Hee-young / Let’s dig in for real now

85
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,640
Hee-young / I don’t even know where to start

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hee-young / The bracken is so good

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
Hee-young / The bracken is so good
Jin-ah / Really?

88
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,240
Jin-ah / The mackerel is delicious

89
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,600
Jin-ah / Do you usually cook for yourself?

90
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,280
Hee-young / I eat out a lot because of work

91
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Hee-young / But I do cook often
Jin-ah / Really?

92
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,720
Jin-ah / I like cooking too

93
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,680
Hee-young / What kind of food do you make?

94
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,600
Jin-ah / Honestly, wine side dishes

95
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
Jin-ah / I make a lot of those at home

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,160
Jin-ah / Or traditional Korean dishes, actually

97
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,960
Jin-ah / Like samgyetang or eel soup, you know, for stamina

98
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,840
Jin-ah / Once the sun sets, if the lights are bright

99
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,280
Jin-ah / I usually don’t eat meals

100
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,960
Jin-ah / So I end up going to wine bars and such

101
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,040
Jin-ah / But it still feels awkward, this brightness

102
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,240
Hee-young / I like darker places too

103
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,520
Jin-ah / At home I never turn on the fluorescent lights

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,520
Jin-ah / I like using mood lighting

105
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,120
Hee-young / Same here, except when I clean or do my makeup

106
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,720
Jin-ah / I even do my makeup in the dark

107
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,240
Hee-young / That’s a bit much

108
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,120
Hee-young / No wonder you walk around with powder all over your face...

109
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,480
Jin-ah / Do you usually travel a lot?

110
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,440
Hee-young / I love traveling

111
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,120
Jin-ah / I love traveling too

112
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,520
Jin-ah / I went to Tokyo, Okinawa, Canada, and Hong Kong

113
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,040
Jin-ah / Just last year

114
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,760
Hee-young / I also went to Canada and Okinawa

115
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,400
Hee-young / Okinawa was around March

116
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,000
Jin-ah / I went in June

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,520
Jin-ah / Canada was in September

118
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,240
Hee-young / Canada, August...

119
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,360
Jin-ah / It was my first time in Canada, I went to Toronto

120
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,800
Hee-young / That’s where I went!

121
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
Jin-ah / Oh really?

122
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,440
Hee-young / It was my birthday then

123
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,280
Hee-young / I went to Niagara Falls

124
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,800
Jin-ah / Me too!

125
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,040
Jin-ah / It was really nice
Hee-young / It really was

126
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,080
Jin-ah / You sleep in, right? Go to bed late and wake up late?

127
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,880
Jin-ah / You sleep after sunrise, right?

128
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,400
Hee-young / It depends

129
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,960
Jin-ah / What do you think of someone who lives really upright?

130
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,160
Jin-ah / Total bore?

131
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,640
Hee-young / Someone with a very proper lifestyle?

132
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,000
Jin-ah / I actually go around saying I’m a no-fun person

133
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,200
Jin-ah / Early to bed, early to rise

134
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,840
Hee-young / Boring people are boring even at 2 a.m.

135
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,280
Jin-ah / I don't go out much, I stay in

136
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,920
Jin-ah / I’m not only into home dates

137
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,280
Jin-ah / But I do like just being home together

138
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,920
Jin-ah / Not that I’ve done it a lot or anything

139
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,000
Hee-young / So what do you usually do on home dates?

140
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,080
Jin-ah / I just really like being with them

141
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,160
Jin-ah / So it’s like I want to stay together all the way to home

142
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,560
Jin-ah / When I’m in a relationship, I don’t have many friends

143
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,960
Jin-ah / My partner is like my friend and soulmate in every way

144
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,680
Jin-ah / So maybe that’s why I like home dates too

145
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,000
Jin-ah / But when I think about it, with a boyfriend

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,200
Jin-ah / Matching all those pieces seems impossible

147
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,320
Hee-young / I also think that beyond gender

148
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,680
Hee-young / It’s the person that matters first

149
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,960
Hee-young / I have friends, whether they’re male or female

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,080
Hee-young / But like you said, with guys it’s hard to match like that

151
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,920
Hee-young / Moving on to the next step

152
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,720
Hee-young / I think I’m drawn to people I want to become like

153
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,160
Hee-young / To the ideal self I hope to become

154
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:22,840
Hee-young / Someone whose thoughts and values are really healthy and kind

155
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,160
Jin-ah / Well, my thoughts are healthy at least

156
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,920
Jin-ah / My thoughts are healthy

157
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,760
Hee-young / I’m drawn to that, and I think only then can that person be part of my life

158
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,720
Hee-young / And walk with me in the future

159
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,280
Hee-young / She’s someone who

160
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,760
Hee-young / talks about herself very smoothly

161
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,000
Hee-young / Even in conversations

162
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,320
Hee-young / You can tell she thinks deeply

163
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,920
Hee-young / Talking with Jin-ah is really attractive to me

164
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,840
Jin-ah / The flow of the conversation doesn’t feel burdensome

165
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,960
Jin-ah / It’s like ping pong, back and forth

166
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,400
Jin-ah / I liked that style of conversation

167
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,440
Jin-ah / You don’t know who I sent the note to, right?

168
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,600
Hee-young / I have no idea

169
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,680
Jin-ah / Are you curious?

170
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,880
Hee-young / I am

171
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,600
Jin-ah / I honestly had no clue who wrote to me

172
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,400
Hee-young / Really, truly

173
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,920
Jin-ah / I actually wrote a long one

174
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,200
Jin-ah / I wanted to explain “why you,” so I wrote a lot

175
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,160
Jin-ah / But the reply was so short, I felt kind of let down

176
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,400
Jin-ah / I wrote so much...

177
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,720
Hee-young / So who did you send it to...?

178
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,040
Jin-ah / Wasn’t there a flower drawing?

179
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,000
Hee-young / I voted for Jin-ah in the first impression vote, because

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hee-young / I was drawn to her!

181
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,840
Hee-young / Oh, so you did write it to me

182
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,520
Jin-ah / I think I wrote it because I felt a new kind of flutter I’d never felt before

183
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,320
Jin-ah / That’s probably why I did it

184
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,960
Jin-ah / Small, precious,

185
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,360
Jin-ah / cute—

186
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,280
Jin-ah / But also someone I want to lean on—that kind of flutter

187
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,160
Jin-ah / Didn’t I write a lot?

188
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,120
Jin-ah / I was so disappointed

189
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,000
Hee-young / When I saw the note

190
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,040
Hee-young / I thought, “Oh, so I can write like this too”

191
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Jin-ah / Then who did you think it was from?

192
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,280
Jin-ah / Who did you think it was from?
Hee-young / I had no clue at all

193
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,560
Hee-young / I didn’t think it was from Jin-ah at all

194
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,760
Hee-young / Maybe I just have no intuition

195
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,480
Hee-young / Maybe I’m just a fool

196
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,160
Hee-young / I was so happy, realizing, “Oh, that was me!”

197
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,120
Hee-young / That was the most memorable note for me

198
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,080
Jin-ah / I actually had something

199
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,120
Jin-ah / I really wanted to ask over the meal

200
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Jin-ah / But it’s so bright here, I can’t ask it

201
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,640
Jin-ah / It’s too bright, I can’t ask

202
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Jin-ah / It’s too bright, I can’t ask
Hee-young / What is it?

203
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,880
Jin-ah / No, it’s just...

204
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,200
Jin-ah / No...

205
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,160
Jin-ah / Oh come on... you know what I was gonna ask, right?

206
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,280
Jin-ah / Oh come on... you know what I was gonna ask, right?
Hee-young / I have no idea

207
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,240
Hee-young / What... what did you say? haha

208
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,080
Hee-young / What did you say?

209
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,040
Jin-ah / I was just curious why you asked me out on a date

210
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,320
Jin-ah / You heard me, right?

211
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,960
Hee-young / Why I asked you out on a date?

212
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,560
Hee-young / Because I was the most curious...

213
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,760
Hee-young / I asked because I wanted to know more

214
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,800
Hee-young / Your way of speaking

215
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,240
Hee-young / The tone of your voice, and how you talk

216
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,760
Hee-young / All of that really stood out to me

217
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,440
Jin-ah / And also

218
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,680
Jin-ah / I was curious why you used the pink note

219
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,120
Hee-young / Because you told me you like pink

220
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,200
Hee-young / I was being way too self-conscious

221
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,400
Da-gyo / Does my face look okay right now?

222
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,160
Han-kyul / You look beautiful

223
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
Han-kyul / You look beautiful
Da-gyo / Really?

224
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,720
Da-gyo / I feel like my makeup smudged too much today

225
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,080
Da-gyo / It’s been a long time since I did it

226
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,920
Han-kyul / You know earlier we were sitting far apart

227
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,960
Han-kyul / I couldn’t really see your face properly

228
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,880
Han-kyul / I couldn’t really see your face properly
Da-gyo / Oh, at the beginning?

229
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,360
Han-kyul / I don’t think I saw your smile clearly

230
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,240
Han-kyul / It’s like you’re the perfect peach-type beauty

231
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,440
Da-gyo / I’ve never been told that before

232
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,400
Da-gyo / That’s when I became sure it was Han-kyul who wrote the note

233
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,680
Da-gyo / I was certain

234
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,880
Da-gyo / Even if it was just a compliment

235
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,600
Da-gyo / You know you can feel it through the eyes

236
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,280
Da-gyo / I just felt, “Ah~ it was Han-kyul!”

237
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,880
Da-gyo / Do you have a cotton swab?

238
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,040
Han-kyul / I do, should I get it for you?

239
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,520
Han-kyul / I do, should I get it for you?
Da-gyo / Yes

240
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,320
Han-kyul / How many do you need?

241
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,360
Da-gyo / Just one

242
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,160
Da-gyo / Oh yay~

243
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,480
Han-kyul / I actually voted for Hee-young at first

244
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,600
Han-kyul / But some people look even more radiant up close

245
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Han-kyul / Compared to when you see them from afar

246
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,760
Han-kyul / I think that person was you, Da-gyo

247
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,080
Han-kyul / The glow you had

248
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,880
Han-kyul / The way you smiled

249
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,920
Han-kyul / When I saw it up close, it really struck me

250
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,040
Han-kyul / It touched me even more than I expected

251
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,560
Han-kyul / That image really left an impression on me

252
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,160
Han-kyul / I feel like I’ll keep thinking about it

253
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,400
Han-kyul / I just had this strange sense of certainty

254
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,880
Da-gyo / Do you blush when you drink?

255
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,360
Da-gyo / Do you blush when you drink?
Mi-rang / No, I don’t

256
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,080
Mi-rang / I heard earlier you do

257
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,480
Mi-rang / I heard earlier you do
Mi-rang / That’s nice, I’m jealous

258
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,240
Mi-rang / I once said this

259
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,680
Mi-rang / When someone asked about my ideal type

260
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,760
Mi-rang / I said “a girl who blushes when she drinks”

261
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,680
Da-gyo / Wait… is this flirting?

262
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,000
Mi-rang / Oh! No no!

263
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,720
Da-gyo / No?

264
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,160
Da-gyo / Are you saying “Don’t misunderstand me!”?

265
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,040
Mi-rang / I mean, a lot of people like it when someone blushes

266
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
Mi-rang / My first note was for Da-gyo

267
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,840
Mi-rang / I thought her smile was really pretty

268
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,000
Mi-rang / She says what she wants to say, but also

269
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,280
Mi-rang / Seems to hold back a bit

270
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,840
Mi-rang / That made her seem mysterious

271
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,520
Mi-rang / And made me want to know her more

272
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,360
Mi-rang / Also, I really like people who wear light blue

273
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,440
Mi-rang / And she just happened to be wearing it

274
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,680
Mi-rang / So I kept being drawn to her

275
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,880
Da-gyo / Thank you

276
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,360
Da-gyo / That was a nice letter

277
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,880
Han-kyul / Are you okay?

278
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,880
Mi-rang / Isn’t she supposed to come too?

279
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,760
Mi-rang / Isn’t she supposed to come too?
Da-gyo / Ri-won?

280
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,360
Da-gyo / She’s sleeping

281
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,600
Da-gyo / She’s sleeping
Seo-yeon / Huh? Ri-won’s sleeping?

282
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,160
Da-gyo / She wasn’t feeling well earlier, caught a cold

283
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,120
Da-gyo / She wasn’t feeling well earlier, caught a cold
Mi-rang / She’s sleeping

284
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,280
Seo-yeon / You work out, right?

285
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,080
Seo-yeon / You work out, right?
Mi-rang / That’s a secret

286
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,040
Han-kyul / Should we work out tomorrow morning?

287
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,880
Han-kyul / Hit the gym

288
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,400
Seo-yeon / You go to the gym?

289
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,440
Seo-yeon / You go to the gym?
Han-kyul / No, I don’t go regularly

290
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,680
Han-kyul / But since there’s one here, I thought I’d use it to de-puff in the morning

291
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,920
Seo-yeon / Honestly, I hate working out more than anything

292
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,600
Da-gyo / I can work out once I get there, but the getting there part…

293
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,360
Mi-rang / The process… exactly!

294
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,920
Mi-rang / That’s why I just built a home gym

295
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,760
Han-kyul / Those who are left, please cook dinner together

296
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,240
Mi-rang / So we’re in charge of making dinner?

297
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,320
Han-kyul / Should we check the fridge?

298
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,880
Han-kyul / Should we check the fridge?
Mi-rang / Or should we all cook together?

299
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,760
Let’s all do it

300
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,440
Han-kyul / Let’s open the fridge and see

301
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,120
Da-gyo / Let’s take it all out and see what we’ve got

302
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,360
Da-gyo / See what we’ve got?

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,400
Mi-rang / Does anyone know how to make spaghetti?

304
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,360
Han-kyul / You sauté the sauce first in a pan

305
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,840
Han-kyul / Then boil the noodles and mix them together

306
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,720
Da-gyo / Budae-jjigae?

307
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,160
Seo-yeon / I really want sashimi!

308
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,800
Seo-yeon / I really want sashimi!
Da-gyo / I think this is tteokbokki

309
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,080
Da-gyo / Tteokbokki, yellowtail, and flatfish

310
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,960
Da-gyo / Tteokbokki, yellowtail, and flatfish
Seo-yeon / Yellowtail!

311
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,680
Da-gyo / So what should we do? There’s four of us

312
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,080
Mi-rang / Tteokbokki sounds really good too

313
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,120
Seo-yeon / Then let’s do both sashimi sets

314
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,840
Da-gyo / And maybe one stew should be enough?

315
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,080
Mi-rang / When the others come back

316
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,120
Mi-rang / We might be able to share with them, so

317
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,280
Mi-rang / The tteokbokki…

318
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:13,720
Seo-yeon / They’re going to have a great dinner anyway

319
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,640
Seo-yeon / They’re going to have a great dinner anyway
Da-gyo / They’re on a date, after all

320
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,080
Seo-yeon / Let’s divide up the roles

321
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,680
Han-kyul / What are we making again…?

322
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,960
Mi-rang / The budae-jjigae

323
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,920
Da-gyo / We only need to make one thing

324
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,000
Mi-rang / There’s not much to do

325
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,480
Mi-rang / Just sit back, I’ll take care of it

326
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,840
Han-kyul / You sure about that?

327
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,640
Seo-yeon / Then…

328
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,800
Da-gyo / Then…

329
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,720
Han-kyul / I’ll

330
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,160
Han-kyul / Stir it well so it doesn’t clump

331
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,840
Da-gyo / Since we’re not drinking a lot, we’ll do the cleanup

332
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,280
Seo-yeon / Yeah, we’ll take care of cleanup

333
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,080
Da-gyo / How’s that?

334
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,480
Da-gyo / How’s that?
Mi-rang / Sounds great

335
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,640
Han-kyul / I’ll help with cleanup too

336
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,560
Mi-rang / There’s no particular reason, it’s just that

337
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,840
Mi-rang / I’ve always liked cooking

338
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,240
Mi-rang / I just instinctively thought, “I should do it”

339
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,600
Han-kyul / Should I rinse the dishes?

340
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,640
Mi-rang / I’ll go first…

341
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,640
Mi-rang / My hands are already messy anyway

342
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,000
Mi-rang / Could you just open that? The budae-jjigae?

343
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,000
Han-kyul / Mi-rang really took initiative

344
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,920
Han-kyul / Took the lead on everything

345
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,840
Han-kyul / But to be honest, I wanted to be like that too

346
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,560
Han-kyul / But she seemed so practiced and confident

347
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,920
Han-kyul / Seeing someone so skilled

348
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,240
Han-kyul / I started to feel like I might lose out to her charm

349
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,640
Han-kyul / I felt a bit threatened

350
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,400
Han-kyul / And at the same time…

351
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,840
Han-kyul / I’m honestly jealous. I want to be like her

352
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,080
Han-kyul / I wish I was born like that

353
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,160
Han-kyul / That’s how I felt

354
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,640
Mi-rang / Can you eat spicy food?

355
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,760
Mi-rang / Can you eat spicy food?
Han-kyul / Yes

356
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,600
Mi-rang / Da-gyo, can you eat spicy food too?

357
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,840
Mi-rang / You said earlier you can’t handle it…

358
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,800
Da-gyo / I can’t eat spicy food at all

359
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,360
Mi-rang / Not at all?

360
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,840
Mi-rang / Then just the two of us will add chili peppers…

361
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,640
Da-gyo / Oh, so you two like spicy food

362
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,760
Da-gyo / You can’t eat spicy food?

363
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,480
Da-gyo / You can’t eat spicy food?
Seo-yeon / I’m super sensitive to spice

364
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,400
Da-gyo / Wow, we’re really alike—can’t drink either

365
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,240
Seo-yeon / Exactly

366
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,480
Han-kyul / How tall are you?

367
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,160
Han-kyul / How tall are you?
Mi-rang / I’m 174cm

368
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,520
Han-kyul / Ah… I knew it…

369
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,720
Da-gyo / Why is everyone here so tall?

370
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,080
Da-gyo / When we were standing earlier, I felt so small

371
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,440
Da-gyo / I had to look way up at everyone

372
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,280
Seo-yeon / Do you like tall girls?

373
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,240
Seo-yeon / Or do you prefer short girls?

374
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,720
Da-gyo / You prefer tall girls, right?

375
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,800
Da-gyo / Because I’ll follow them around

376
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,120
Da-gyo / I like someone taller than me

377
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,480
Seo-yeon / After talking with Da-gyo a lot and spending the evening together

378
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,240
Seo-yeon / I realized we have a lot in common

379
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,480
Seo-yeon / And she smiles a lot too

380
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,160
Seo-yeon / That really made me like her more

381
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,920
Seo-yeon / I think my interest in her went up because of that

382
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
What should we do? Should we move this?

383
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,800
Seo-yeon / Ri-won, are you okay?

384
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,320
Ri-won / I’d love to help

385
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,440
Da-gyo / You’re not feeling well, so just sit

386
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,840
Da-gyo / You’re not feeling well, so just sit
Ri-won / I’m not that sick though

387
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,440
Da-gyo / Really?

388
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,640
Da-gyo / Still, just sit down

389
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,880
Ri-won / Someone please give me a task, seriously

390
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,640
Da-gyo / I’ll be sitting soon too

391
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,880
Seo-yeon / I haven’t done anything either

392
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,240
Seo-yeon / Want to do the cleanup with me?

393
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,720
Ri-won / I’d love that

394
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,560
Da-gyo / I haven’t done much either

395
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,600
Han-kyul / I need to help too though

396
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,800
Ri-won / Right now, Seo-yeon and I are doing the cleanup

397
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,560
Ri-won / No stealing our task!

398
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,480
Ri-won / When I was writing the first impression note

399
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,960
Ri-won / I was torn between Han-kyul and Seo-yeon

400
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,920
Ri-won / But Seo-yeon’s smile was just so beautiful

401
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,880
Ri-won / I picked Seo-yeon

402
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,760
Ri-won / This is going to be super hot, isn’t it?

403
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,560
Da-gyo / It’s really hot

404
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,320
Da-gyo / Isn’t it hot?

405
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,520
Da-gyo / You’re tough

406
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,680
Ri-won / Hot hot hot

407
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,840
Ri-won / Hot hot hot
Mi-rang / Not hot at all

408
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,760
Looks delicious

409
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,120
Da-gyo / Thank you

410
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,680
Da-gyo / I think it’s going to be good

411
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,920
Mi-rang / Try it

412
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,160
Da-gyo / Try it?

413
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,720
Seo-yeon / It’s good

414
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,080
Seo-yeon / It’s good
Mi-rang / Oh! You okay?

415
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,560
Seo-yeon / Kinda tastes like fishcake soup

416
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,160
Ri-won / Like a hangover soup vibe

417
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,320
Han-kyul / It feels refreshing

418
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,360
Da-gyo / Tastes good

419
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,200
Is it good?

420
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,920
Da-gyo / Seriously, it’s like fishcake
Seo-yeon / Right?

421
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,040
Mi-rang / The flounder is so good

422
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,000
Da-gyo / Flounder? Or yellowtail?

423
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,520
Mi-rang / Flounder!

424
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,160
Da-gyo / Ah, flounder

425
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,840
Mi-rang / I like flounder more than yellowtail

426
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,760
Me too, me too

427
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,280
Da-gyo / I don’t usually like flounder, but this is good

428
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,600
Mi-rang / You don’t like flounder?

429
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,400
Ri-won / How can you not like flounder?

430
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,600
Da-gyo / I don’t really like white fish, I prefer oily sashimi

431
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,520
Mi-rang / Isn’t this yellowtail too big?

432
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,800
Mi-rang / Want me to cut it?

433
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,120
Mi-rang / Want me to cut it?
Da-gyo / No, it’s okay

434
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Mi-rang / As expected from a yellowtail lover…

435
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,400
Han-kyul / It’s all about the thick slices

436
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,200
Mi-rang / Have you ever dated someone with totally different taste in food?

437
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,120
Mi-rang / Like food preferences?

438
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,240
Da-gyo / Spicy food?

439
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,360
Da-gyo / Can you eat spicy for someone?

440
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,480
Da-gyo / Like if they ask you to eat spicy food

441
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,080
Ri-won / That’s torture, isn’t it?

442
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,240
Ri-won / If someone who can eat it chooses not to, it’s considerate

443
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,600
Ri-won / But if someone who can’t eat it tries, that’s torture

444
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,360
Ri-won / But if someone who can’t eat it tries, that’s torture
Seo-yeon / Exactly, it is torture

445
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,120
Mi-rang / It might change my ranking

446
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,920
Mi-rang / If our food preferences are totally off

447
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:01,360
Mi-rang / For example, if someone can’t eat spicy food at all

448
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,080
Mi-rang / And with sashimi too

449
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,040
Mi-rang / I don’t like oily fish

450
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,200
Mi-rang / But they like all the oily types

451
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,320
Mi-rang / From beginning to end, we were totally different

452
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,040
Da-gyo / My chopsticks aren’t a matching pair

453
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,320
Mi-rang / What!

454
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,000
Mi-rang / Mine are mismatched too

455
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Da-gyo / Same here

456
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,880
Da-gyo / Same here
Mi-rang / I feel like something bad’s going to happen

457
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,840
Da-gyo / I don’t really believe that

458
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,200
Da-gyo / I’m just the type who pays attention to that kind of thing

459
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,800
Da-gyo / I’m just the type who pays attention to that kind of thing
Seo-yeon / I knew it

460
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,280
Da-gyo / Maybe that’s why I didn’t get to go on the date today

461
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,800
Da-gyo / Look at that, check it out

462
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,080
Ri-won / I want to know what they ate

463
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,240
Ri-won / Did they eat something good?

464
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,400
Seo-yeon / I bet it was something tasty

465
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,280
Seo-yeon / And somewhere nice too

466
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,480
Da-gyo / Look, she wrote it down before she even left

467
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,160
Jin-ah / But it was supposed to be random, right?

468
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,600
Jin-ah / Still, let’s write it down just in case

469
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,840
Hee-young / I tried to write it in a cute way

470
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,160
Seo-yeon / What is even going on here

471
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,720
Da-gyo / Everyone needed to see what happened earlier

472
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,240
Ri-won / But you never know

473
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,400
Ri-won / Tomorrow or the day after, they might totally split

474
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,160
Like seriously

475
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Ri-won / Or maybe not?

476
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,920
Ri-won / It’s possible

477
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,080
Ri-won / It’s possible
Da-gyo / This group might be more fun anyway

478
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,040
Ri-won / Nah, right now it kinda feels like I’m being too hopeful

479
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,400
Han-kyul / I think having more people is just way more fun

480
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,280
Han-kyul / I think having more people is just way more fun
Feeling a little salty

481
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,960
Da-gyo / More people overall…

482
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,080
Da-gyo / It’s surprisingly fun

483
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,240
Han-kyul / Let’s just steal all the screen time from them

484
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
Mi-rang / I’m seriously curious about everyone’s age

485
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,240
Same here

486
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,760
That’s the biggest mystery

487
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,560
Da-gyo / I don’t think they all look that young

488
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,240
Da-gyo / Just the vibe

489
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,520
Mi-rang / What if I turn out to be the youngest?

490
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,680
Da-gyo / Then you’re just young, I guess

491
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,520
Ri-won / Do you all not like younger people?

492
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,280
Seo-yeon / Maybe not if they act young

493
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,560
Da-gyo / It’s not about age

494
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,000
Ri-won / But I feel like this group

495
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,120
Ri-won / prefers mature people

496
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,840
Ri-won / Calm, caring, grown-up types

497
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,880
Ri-won / Everyone’s been saying there aren’t enough unnies

498
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,160
Mi-rang / I’m the opposite

499
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,360
Mi-rang / I mean, calm is nice too

500
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,480
Mi-rang / Calm people are nice too
Da-gyo / Do you like someone more outgoing?

501
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,280
Mi-rang / Yeah, I kind of like it when someone…

502
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,680
Mi-rang / does things for me when I’m just sitting still…

503
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,720
Da-gyo / Seriously, how old is everyone? I’m so curious

504
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,160
Da-gyo / Seriously, how old is everyone? I’m so curious
Ri-won / Should we guess?

505
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,360
Ri-won / Let’s start with Han-kyul

506
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,040
Ri-won / I think Han-kyul is 24

507
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,880
Da-gyo / 24?

508
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,720
Mi-rang / I’ll guess 23

509
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,640
Da-gyo / Yeah maybe around 24?

510
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,400
Seo-yeon / 25

511
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,640
Han-kyul / I really don’t like this rule where we reveal ages later

512
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,840
Han-kyul / Age… sigh

513
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,760
Han-kyul / I wish we could just start by telling everyone our age

514
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,280
Seo-yeon / Da-gyo

515
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,880
Da-gyo / Me?

516
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,240
Mi-rang / 26

517
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,640
Ri-won / Same!

518
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,840
Seo-yeon / I think 26 too

519
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,000
Me too, 26 exactly
We’re all on the same page

520
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,840
Han-kyul / I hope she’s 23

521
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,120
Da-gyo / Twenty-three?

522
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,160
Ri-won / Maybe Han-kyul really is 24

523
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,840
Han-kyul / Why does that even matter?

524
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,480
Mi-rang / Do you prefer older or younger partners?

525
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,080
Han-kyul / Me?

526
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,040
Han-kyul / Ah, wait, I don’t want to get lured into this

527
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,600
Han-kyul / This kind of guided conversation, no thanks

528
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,880
Ri-won / So innocent, still

529
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,080
Ri-won / Still... still so innocent

530
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,520
Ri-won / Pure, so pure

531
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,680
Han-kyul / I don’t see age as a trait of a person

532
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,560
Han-kyul / I strongly believe it’s more about their condition

533
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,880
Han-kyul / So depending on when you meet someone

534
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,560
Han-kyul / At that moment, I could be

535
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,680
Han-kyul / Older, younger, or the same age as them

536
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,600
Han-kyul / But other than how you treat each other as people

537
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,520
Han-kyul / I don’t think anything else matters

538
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,360
Han-kyul / If someone can’t manage their own life at all

539
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,480
Han-kyul / That could be a problem

540
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,040
Han-kyul / If they’re just looking for someone to depend on

541
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,120
Han-kyul / That’s not good, right

542
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,080
Ri-won / I actually like people like that

543
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,040
Ri-won / I’d love for someone to entrust their life to me

544
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,640
Really?

545
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,680
Han-kyul / What? Do you have a desire to support someone?

546
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,400
Ri-won / That’s right

547
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,440
Da-gyo / I personally don’t think that’s right

548
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,760
Da-gyo / I also felt like that wouldn’t be a good match

549
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,800
Da-gyo / Even with what Han-kyul said

550
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,840
Da-gyo / I appreciate that she showed interest, but

551
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,920
Da-gyo / But for it to develop into a relationship with me

552
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,400
Da-gyo / I started to wonder if we even connect when talking

553
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,320
Da-gyo / Would it work out?

554
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,560
Da-gyo / I think it made me reflect on that a bit

555
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,720
Ri-won / I’m 28 but I totally look way younger

556
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,160
Ri-won / That’s what I think

557
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,720
Da-gyo / I’m 26

558
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,280
Mi-rang / Well, based on what we talked about in our room earlier…

559
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,200
Mi-rang / 32?

560
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,280
What were you talking about

561
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,680
That bumped the age up that high?

562
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,800
Mi-rang / Just...

563
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,520
Mi-rang / I thought this person might be

564
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,000
Mi-rang / the second oldest here

565
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,760
Han-kyul / I don’t know why, but I keep thinking

566
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,800
Han-kyul / like a preschool or kindergarten teacher

567
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,520
Han-kyul / or someone who studied early childhood education

568
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,200
Han-kyul / That kind of vibe just keeps coming to mind with the smile

569
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,920
Ri-won / Looks like she needs to smile a lot for her job

570
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,520
Seo-yeon / So how old are you?

571
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,240
Han-kyul / Huh?!

572
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,320
Da-gyo / You’re not good at answering that

573
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:55,960
Han-kyul / 27?

574
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,880
Han-kyul / She’s really bad at guessing ages

575
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,520
Mi-rang / What does that make me then...

576
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,680
Mi-rang / Sorry

577
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,000
Han-kyul / She really can’t guess ages

578
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,040
Han-kyul / And people often think I look young

579
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,920
Han-kyul / I don’t really care though

580
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,040
Han-kyul / Because in here, at the end of the day

581
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,480
Han-kyul / we’re just getting to know each other person to person

582
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,720
Ri-won / I feel like age has been a burden for Han-kyul

583
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,240
Ri-won / Like she liked someone before but it didn’t work because of age

584
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Han-kyul / There was a time when it really stressed me out so much

585
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,040
Han-kyul / Like if someone sees me as too young

586
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,480
Han-kyul / I start thinking maybe all of this doesn’t mean anything

587
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,200
Mi-rang / I’m 25

588
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,080
Seo-yeon / 27

589
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,400
Da-gyo / I’m 27 too

590
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,160
Mi-rang / Pay up! I told you I was 24 earlier

591
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,080
Ri-won / How much do you want?

592
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,080
Han-kyul / You said you liked younger people

593
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,120
Mi-rang / Sharp one, huh?

594
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,040
Han-kyul / I’m not sure

595
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,480
Han-kyul / You look mid-20s

596
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,640
Han-kyul / But your vibe feels more like late-20s

597
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,720
Han-kyul / I don’t think you’re in your 30s

598
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,760
Han-kyul / I don’t think you’re in your 30s
Ri-won / She’s basically a professor at this point

599
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,280
Ri-won / Talking about “attitude” and stuff

600
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,200
Ri-won / And she even put on glasses just now

601
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,840
Ri-won / I seriously thought, “My age could be an advantage”

602
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,800
Ri-won / That thought really hit me

603
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,320
Ri-won / Everyone thought I was around Han-kyul’s age today

604
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,960
Ri-won / I think things will get more interesting later on

605
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,320
Da-gyo / Wait, we need to guess Mi-rang’s age

606
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,440
Age

607
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,680
I think I can guess it

608
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,240
Da-gyo / I actually think she’s younger than expected

609
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,040
Ri-won / I think early 30s with a baby face

610
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,240
Da-gyo / Early 30s with a baby face?

611
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,320
Da-gyo / I honestly didn’t think that

612
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,040
Han-kyul / But her face really looks young

613
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,240
Ri-won / Her face looks young but her aura...

614
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,560
Ri-won / She gives off a mature vibe when she speaks

615
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,080
Da-gyo / Or maybe not? Maybe she’s not that young?

616
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,440
Ri-won / I think she’s the sweetest one here

617
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,920
Ri-won / She takes care of people like this

618
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,000
Ri-won / She just notices and helps out

619
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,640
Ri-won / Someone in their 20s can’t act like that

620
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,120
Han-kyul / I absorb everything she does and just think, “I want to be like that”

621
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,320
Han-kyul / I keep thinking that

622
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,800
Mi-rang / I’m so touched, is it okay if I cry?

623
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,720
Han-kyul / I was honestly a little jealous

624
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,080
Han-kyul / Like she’s tall and everything

625
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,720
Han-kyul / That kind of presence she has

626
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,320
Han-kyul / I can’t keep up with that

627
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,800
Ri-won / Why? Han-kyul, you’re just as lovely

628
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,880
Ri-won / You’re adorable

629
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,480
Han-kyul / What’s so lovely about me?

630
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,600
Da-gyo / You seem like someone who reads a lot of books

631
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,520
Ri-won / Like a smart little kid

632
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,480
Ri-won / You know those gifted kids in the neighborhood?

633
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,520
Ri-won / A child who’s mature and tells grown-ups, “This is how it works!”

634
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,600
“This is this!”

635
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,880
Ri-won / She’s like espresso—an acquired taste

636
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,360
Han-kyul / Doesn’t feel like a romantic partner

637
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,400
Ri-won / Why not? Some people like that type

638
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,880
Han-kyul / I don’t know, I’m not listening

639
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,040
Han-kyul / I’m just

640
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,240
Han-kyul / gonna go for it

641
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,680
Mi-rang / Try guessing

642
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,000
Da-gyo / Oh, me?

643
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:06,800
Da-gyo / This is really hard

644
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,280
Da-gyo / This is really hard
Seo-yeon / 29?

645
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,480
Da-gyo / I thought she’d be younger at first

646
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,960
Da-gyo / But after hearing everything

647
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,560
Da-gyo / I don’t think she’s that young

648
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,880
Da-gyo / I’m changing my guess

649
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,840
Da-gyo / 28?

650
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,080
Mi-rang / So you thought I was younger than that?

651
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,960
Mi-rang / So you thought I was even younger than that?
Da-gyo / Yes!

652
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,200
Ri-won / She’s happy about it

653
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,040
Ri-won / Look at her, she’s happy I got it right

654
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,680
Da-gyo / Pay up~

655
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,800
Da-gyo / Pay up~
Ri-won / She’s seriously happy

656
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,200
Ri-won / It totally showed

657
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,080
Ri-won / You’re all so pure

658
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,600
Ri-won / In my opinion

659
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,120
Ri-won / The one with the purest core was Han-kyul

660
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,360
Ri-won / And the one with the kindest heart was Mi-rang

661
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,640
Da-gyo / That’s funny

662
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,480
Da-gyo / This is fun!

663
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,080
It’s gonna be so fun when we find out everyone’s real age

664
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,360
Da-gyo / I’m curious what everyone does too

665
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,240
Ri-won / I am curious about their jobs too

666
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,480
Ri-won / I am curious about their jobs too
Seo-yeon / I’m so curious about your job

667
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,880
Mi-rang / Should we guess each other’s jobs based on image?

668
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,760
Ri-won / That sounds fun

669
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,360
Mi-rang / Let’s guess based on how we look

670
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,040
Ri-won / Let’s guess hers

671
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,160
Mi-rang / Try to guess what I do

672
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,240
Ri-won / I feel like you’re in the food business

673
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,680
Han-kyul / Like a neighborhood family restaurant

674
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,960
Han-kyul / A place with a really cozy vibe

675
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,360
Han-kyul / Like a heartwarming local restaurant

676
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,800
Han-kyul / That everyone talks about for being so kind

677
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,760
Han-kyul / Someone who’s been doing that for 15 years

678
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,480
Han-kyul / A veteran chef kind of vibe

679
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,000
Han-kyul / That’s the feeling I get

680
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,760
Ri-won / Wow, that’s such a detailed character setup

681
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,640
Mi-rang / This is fun, I’m getting into it

682
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,080
Seo-yeon / Fitness?

683
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,240
Seo-yeon / Fitness?
Ri-won / Oh, a PT trainer!

684
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,080
Seo-yeon / Maybe a PT

685
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,240
Seo-yeon / Or possibly an athlete

686
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,640
Da-gyo / I also thought she was in the food business

687
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,440
Ri-won / Is any of us right?

688
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,920
Mi-rang / Nope!

689
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,280
No?

690
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,840
Da-gyo / There’s a twist

691
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,560
Ri-won / This is fun

692
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,000
Da-gyo / What could it be?

693
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,240
Mi-rang / This is fun
Da-gyo / I’m curious now

694
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,080
Ri-won / Oh! Try to guess mine!

695
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
Da-gyo / You seem like you do hair or beauty

696
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,160
Da-gyo / You seem like you do hair or beauty
Seo-yeon / A cheerleader!

697
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,120
Ri-won / I’ve heard that before too

698
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,480
Ri-won / I’ve heard that before too
Da-gyo / It suits you so well

699
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,360
Han-kyul / I thought hairstylist or nail artist

700
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,760
You really seem like you do beauty work

701
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,560
Mi-rang / I'm the manager at a plastic surgery clinic

702
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,240
Ri-won / I'm confident!

703
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,680
Ri-won / I'm really confident

704
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,440
Mi-rang / Oh! A nurse!

705
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,720
Da-gyo / Nurse suits you
Mi-rang / A dental nurse

706
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,400
Da-gyo / A dental hygienist

707
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,120
Ri-won / Ooh~ that job sounds super sexy

708
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,440
Han-kyul / So that's not it

709
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,560
Ri-won / Beauty?

710
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,360
Mi-rang / Pilates

711
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,160
Seo-yeon / I think Pilates too

712
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,760
Han-kyul / I thought she might be a cheerleader

713
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,720
Han-kyul / Or maybe something in beauty...

714
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,600
Ri-won / How many cheerleaders are here?

715
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,960
Da-gyo / She’s a bit too tall to be a cheerleader

716
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,680
Han-kyul / I just thought she had that kind of energy

717
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,280
Da-gyo / None of those are right!

718
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,120
Ri-won / Now I'm really curious what her job is

719
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,480
Da-gyo / I feel like Seo-yeon might play an instrument

720
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,880
Da-gyo / I feel like Seo-yeon might play an instrument
Ri-won / I think she's a teacher

721
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,360
Han-kyul / I also think she works with kids

722
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,960
Han-kyul / She has the kind of smile you'd expect in that job

723
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,200
Mi-rang / I think she's in beauty

724
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,440
Seo-yeon / Beauty?

725
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,720
Mi-rang / Or maybe even a model

726
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Seo-yeon / None of the above!

727
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,120
Ri-won / Wow, now I’m super curious

728
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,200
Ri-won / Everyone saying no makes it worse

729
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,640
Seo-yeon / I actually hear stuff like this a lot, so it’s nothing new

730
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,080
Seo-yeon / But the one I’m really curious about is

731
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,600
Seo-yeon / Han-kyul, I’m really curious about you

732
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,920
Seo-yeon / You seem totally like a T

733
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,800
Seo-yeon / But you speak so emotionally too

734
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,680
Da-gyo / Han-kyul, are you a writer?

735
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,040
Da-gyo / You seem like you'd do writing

736
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,520
Seo-yeon / A writer!

737
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,000
Ri-won / Or maybe something in music

738
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,360
Ri-won / Like music-related

739
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,320
Ri-won / Very possible

740
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,840
Mi-rang / You seem really logical, like a PhD student?

741
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,320
Mi-rang / Maybe a grad student?

742
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,360
Han-kyul / Do I really have to answer?

743
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,200
Ri-won / Oh, you do have a job, don’t you?

744
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,280
Ri-won / Oh, you do have a job, don’t you?
Da-gyo / Do you?

745
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,400
Ri-won / Then that’s enough

746
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,040
Seo-yeon / Your face gave it away

747
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,240
Seo-yeon / Your face gave it away
Da-gyo / Let’s just assume she has one

748
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,400
Ri-won / Got one!

749
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,000
Han-kyul / You’ll find out soon anyway

750
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,040
Da-gyo / But if you really don’t have a job and just didn’t say anything...

751
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,480
Mi-rang / So it was a twist

752
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,480
Han-kyul / I’m just ending up in the role I expected

753
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,080
Han-kyul / So

754
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,920
Han-kyul / I’m just finding it amusing and chill

755
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Ri-won / These things are always unexpected

756
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,640
Ri-won / Those two might break up, you know

757
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,360
Da-gyo / Right, no one knows

758
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,640
Ri-won / To be honest

759
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,760
Ri-won / I didn’t vote for either of them

760
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,560
Ri-won / Among everyone here

761
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,280
Ri-won / Someone must have picked one of them

762
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,360
Ri-won / That’s why they got matched, right?

763
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,040
Ri-won / Then out of the four of you excluding me

764
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,880
Ri-won / Someone here must’ve

765
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
Ri-won / Liked one of them

766
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,320
Ri-won / So go and break them up

767
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,880
Han-kyul / Why? For what?

768
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,000
Ri-won / Because it’d be fun

769
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,720
Han-kyul / You dopamine addicts

770
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
Ri-won / Doesn’t it annoy you?

771
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,520
Ri-won / That the person you picked went on a date?

772
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,880
Ri-won / So to be honest

773
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,880
Ri-won / I just looked and went “meh~”

774
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,920
Ri-won / And I think I napped peacefully during the break

775
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,280
Ri-won / Because the people I like

776
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,400
Ri-won / Are right here

777
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,880
Ri-won / I have another question

778
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,120
Ri-won / We all wrote those notes, right?

779
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,360
Ri-won / What was your criteria?

780
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,760
Seo-yeon / Just external appeal for me

781
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,640
Ri-won / Yeah, same here

782
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,880
Mi-rang / For me, the vibe they gave off

783
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,240
Mi-rang / Felt like my type

784
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,880
Mi-rang / That’s something you just feel in the beginning

785
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,040
Mi-rang / You don’t know how they’ll change later

786
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,440
Mi-rang / So I guess I just wanted to find out more

787
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,360
Da-gyo / But seriously, it was so sudden

788
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,560
Ri-won / If we wrote it at night, I would've picked someone else

789
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,440
Seo-yeon / Oh! Me too

790
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,240
Ri-won / Same here

791
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,440
Ri-won / I definitely would've chosen someone else

792
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,800
Mi-rang / If it were written at night?

793
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,760
Da-gyo / Raise your hand if you would've picked someone else at night

794
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,360
Ri-won / Me

795
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,120
Ri-won / I’m sure I would’ve picked someone else

796
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,760
Han-kyul / If we voted at night

797
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,440
Han-kyul / I probably would’ve picked Da-gyo from the start

798
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,800
Mi-rang / Should we clean up if we’re done eating?

799
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,840
Mi-rang / Should we clean up if we’re done eating?
Ri-won / Ah, yes please!

800
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,640
Yeah yeah

801
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,400
Ri-won / You three go now

802
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,760
Ri-won / Go to Unit 1, Unit 1

803
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,600
Da-gyo / I barely did anything though

804
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,800
Seo-yeon / Please go

805
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,560
Han-kyul / I’ll do the dishes

806
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,400
Ri-won / Why are you rolling up your sleeves?

807
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,320
Ri-won / Seo-yeon and I agreed to do it

808
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,160
Ri-won / Just go already

809
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,000
Seo-yeon / Gosh, seriously

810
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,560
Ri-won / Seo-yeon and I are doing it

811
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,560
Seo-yeon / I thought it was warm and harmonious

812
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,120
Seo-yeon / Just eating together like that

813
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,840
Seo-yeon / Mi-rang made delicious army stew

814
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,720
Seo-yeon / And I got a chance to talk with Da-gyo too

815
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,160
Seo-yeon / We sat next to each other and enjoyed our meal

816
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,880
Seo-yeon / I had a really good time

817
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,560
Seo-yeon / So that in itself was a nice experience

818
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,360
Han-kyul / I think I really liked being left with five others

819
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,280
Han-kyul / Especially on the first day when nothing’s certain

820
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,680
Han-kyul / I thought ‘it’s better to interact with more people’

821
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,960
Han-kyul / So I kept that possibility open

822
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,440
Han-kyul / Because of that, I was able to discover their charms

823
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,120
Han-kyul / So I really enjoyed it

824
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,760
Da-gyo / It’s cold!

825
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,960
Isn’t it?

826
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,320
Han-kyul / Don’t you have a jacket?

827
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,400
Da-gyo / A jacket? It’s in the other room

828
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,080
Han-kyul / Wait here a sec

829
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,120
Da-gyo / Han-kyul

830
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,200
Mi-rang / One of you wear this

831
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,800
Da-gyo / Thank you

832
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,840
Mi-rang / Han-kyul, wear this one

833
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,560
Han-kyul / Oh wait a sec

834
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,520
Mi-rang / Yes!

835
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,600
Mi-rang / Oh, you wear that, then I’ll wear this

836
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,320
Han-kyul / Oh, you already gave it to me
Da-gyo / Oh no

837
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,720
I want to brush my teeth

838
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,160
Go brush them then

839
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,120
Mi-rang / Spending a whole week together, it’s kind of exciting

840
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,320
Da-gyo / Me too, it still doesn’t feel real

841
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,640
Da-gyo / It hit me when we were writing those notes earlier

842
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,800
Da-gyo / It was so sudden

843
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,960
Mi-rang / It drove me crazy, seriously

844
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,120
What if I totally messed it up?

845
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,160
That would be so weird

846
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,880
Mi-rang / Should I just stay alone?

847
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,440
Mi-rang / Then I’ll just wait until someone else comes

848
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,720
Mi-rang / When they arrive, I’ll step out for a bit

849
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,040
Da-gyo / It feels kind of warm here?

850
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,280
Da-gyo / I took a photo of this earlier and made it my wallpaper

851
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,800
Da-gyo / To memorize everyone’s names

852
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,120
Da-gyo / It’s for remembering names and… the feelings~

853
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,680
Da-gyo / Like this~

854
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,400
Mi-rang / Did you memorize them all?

855
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,600
Da-gyo / Of course

856
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,120
Da-gyo / But just a bit…

857
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,480
Da-gyo / I’m scared I might mess one up

858
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,760
Han-kyul / Hello, I didn’t get to brush my teeth

859
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,120
Mi-rang / It kinda feels like a first meeting again

860
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,320
Han-kyul / Yeah, kinda

861
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,240
Mi-rang / Hello

862
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,080
Han-kyul / Hello

863
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,280
Mi-rang / But seriously, I feel like you do something with writing

864
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,600
Han-kyul / No comment on that

865
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,640
Mi-rang / I think it’d be interesting

866
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,080
Han-kyul / Like what…?

867
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:47,240
Mi-rang / I’m just really curious what kind of work you do

868
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,760
Han-kyul / Let’s have a chat sometime

869
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,480
Han-kyul / I feel like I want to get to know you as a person

870
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,560
Han-kyul / Why am I so shy?

871
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,320
Han-kyul / I feel like I’m confessing or something

872
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,960
Da-gyo / Did you decide what you’ll wear tomorrow?

873
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,320
Han-kyul / I’m just gonna wear whatever I grab first

874
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,480
Da-gyo / The two of you brought way too much stuff into my room

875
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,840
Han-kyul / What are we supposed to do in there…

876
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,480
Da-gyo / How are we even going to make you both sleep there?

877
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,920
Da-gyo / It feels kinda weird to have you both in one bed

878
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,640
Da-gyo / Both in one bed
Mi-rang / Oh, right

879
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,160
Han-kyul / Just make them sleep in one bed

880
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,280
Da-gyo / Would that be okay…?

881
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,320
Mi-rang / Da-gyo~

882
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,000
Mi-rang / This triple room really sucks

883
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,520
Da-gyo / I didn’t expect it to turn out like this

884
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,680
Mi-rang / Won’t it be kinda awkward for them to sleep together?

885
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,480
Da-gyo / Do you think it’s better if I let them choose?

886
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,120
Mi-rang / You lie down on the bed first like this

887
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,240
Mi-rang / And say, “Who wants to lie next to me?” or something like that

888
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,120
Han-kyul / If no one answers, then just sleep the two of you

889
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,400
Han-kyul / That kind of subtle invite

890
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,840
Da-gyo / Seriously

891
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,240
Ri-won / Should we go too? To Building 1?

892
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,280
Ri-won / Should we go too? To Building 1?
Ri-won / Yeah

893
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,680
Good work

894
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,720
Thank you for your hard work

895
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,920
Seo-yeon / They’re here

896
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,840
Seo-yeon / They’re here
Da-gyo / They came?

897
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,680
Ri-won / Did those two arrive?

898
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,520
Da-gyo / We should attack

899
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,600
Mi-rang / I should act surprised~!

900
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,840
I just want to wash everything away

901
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:29,880
Mi-rang / Oh? Hello

902
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,720
Mi-rang / Oh? Hello
Hee-young / Hello

903
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,080
Hee-young / What are you doing?

904
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,240
Da-gyo / We were just talking about you two

905
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,360
Da-gyo / Come on in

906
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,360
Mi-rang / Must’ve been cold out there

907
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,280
Jin-ah / We’re back

908
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,280
Ri-won / I’m curious what you ate

909
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,760
Jin-ah / We had grilled fish set menu?

910
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,360
Da-gyo / Sounds delicious

911
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,600
Hee-young / Stir-fried pork, mackerel, hairtail

912
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,680
Hee-young / Side dishes x3

913
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,120
Hee-young / Seaweed soup

914
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,280
Seaweed soup

915
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,360
Oh really?

916
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,680
Jin-ah / While eating... Da-gyo, oh no!

917
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,000
Ri-won / We took good care of her

918
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,520
Ri-won / Right? You were happy, weren’t you, Da-gyo?

919
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,320
Da-gyo / I’m sure you had a great time

920
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,360
Da-gyo / Now that you’re back, I need to ask what you did

921
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,080
Mi-rang / Seo-yeon, why are you getting so quiet?

922
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,760
Han-kyul / Want to switch seats?

923
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,880
Han-kyul / You're kind of at the edge

924
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,440
Seo-yeon / Oh! No, I’m...

925
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,320
Han-kyul / You’re too far on the side
Mi-rang / Are you feeling unwell?

926
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,560
Seo-yeon / No, no, I’m fine!

927
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,120
Seo-yeon / Ah! So this is what that feels like!

928
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,040
Seo-yeon / So this is what that feels like

929
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,120
Seo-yeon / I think I just kept thinking about it

930
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,880
Da-gyo / That earlier first...

931
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,800
Da-gyo / The shock from earlier is still lingering

932
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,040
Jin-ah / But I’m slowly getting used to it and it’s even comfortable now

933
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,280
Jin-ah / Don’t you think so?

934
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,040
Jin-ah / It doesn’t even feel weird anymore

935
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,080
Da-gyo / I laughed so much my cheeks hurt

936
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,640
Ri-won / Oh? Something’s coming

937
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,320
Ri-won / That sound makes me so happy

938
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,280
Seo-yeon / Like, going around in turns
Jin-ah / Should I go first?

939
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,160
Jin-ah / Ah, no pink one

940
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,120
Da-gyo / Even now?

941
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,120
Ri-won / It’s Pinkfong

942
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,480
Jin-ah / I’ll go with this one

943
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,600
Jin-ah / What’s your definition of cheating?

944
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,320
Jin-ah / And I have one more, a smaller one

945
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,560
Jin-ah / If your partner cheated, could you forgive them?

946
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,160
Jin-ah / Does this make sense?

947
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,760
Da-gyo / What’s your definition of cheating?

948
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,880
Hee-young / Definition of cheating?

949
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,200
Ri-won / If your partner gets stressed over your interactions with others

950
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,200
Ri-won / I think that’s cheating

951
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,480
Jin-ah / I usually take a long time to fall in love

952
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,040
Jin-ah / I need a reason why it has to be this person

953
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,280
Jin-ah / And I want them to feel like it has to be me

954
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,800
Jin-ah / But when I feel like it doesn’t have to be me

955
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,240
Jin-ah / That’s when I feel it’s over

956
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,560
Ri-won / That’s cheating?

957
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,240
Jin-ah / When emotional distraction starts with someone else

958
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,880
Okay okay

959
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:13,840
Ri-won / Hee-young, you went on the date

960
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,680
Ri-won / What do you think cheating is?

961
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,720
Hee-young / If the other person feels hurt or upset

962
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,800
Hee-young / Then it’s cheating

963
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,800
Da-gyo / For me it’s clear-cut

964
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,080
Da-gyo / Like contacting someone secretly, giving off certain vibes

965
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:31,960
Ri-won / Something obvious

966
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,400
Ri-won / Obvious
Da-gyo / Very clear-cut

967
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,920
Ri-won / Things anyone would call cheating
Da-gyo / Meeting up in secret

968
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,960
Ri-won / Something everyone would agree is cheating

969
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,160
Ri-won / Something everyone would agree is cheating
Da-gyo / Physical stuff, or anything like that

970
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,160
Da-gyo / When there’s a clear line crossed

971
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,160
Da-gyo / That’s what I think

972
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,800
Mi-rang / Oh, me?

973
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,160
Ri-won / Why are you looking at me like that?

974
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,320
Mi-rang / If it’s someone I don’t trust

975
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,400
Mi-rang / And I said I don’t like it

976
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,840
Mi-rang / But they still choose to meet that person

977
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,360
Mi-rang / They go to meet that person anyway

978
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,160
Ri-won / “But they’re an old friend~!”

979
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,680
Ri-won / “Why can’t you understand that?”

980
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,240
Jin-ah / Ugh... that really gets me mad

981
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,320
Jin-ah / I’m getting worked up just thinking about it

982
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,880
Da-gyo / Sounds like personal experience haha

983
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,440
Ri-won / Let’s talk about that later haha

984
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,240
Han-kyul / For me, basically

985
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,960
Han-kyul / If you’re in a relationship and you meet someone else

986
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,720
Han-kyul / And you meet them in secret without being honest

987
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,160
Han-kyul / And your feelings move to them, that’s “moving on”

988
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,520
Han-kyul / That’s what I consider a switch

989
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,040
Han-kyul / Cheating is when you give both people hope

990
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,360
Han-kyul / You want something from this person

991
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,920
Han-kyul / But you still don’t want to let go of the other

992
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,080
Han-kyul / That in-between, that lingering—that’s cheating

993
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,240
Han-kyul / That’s what I think cheating is

994
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,080
Da-gyo / What about you, Seo-yeon?

995
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,040
Seo-yeon / I’m pretty close to Da-gyo’s view

996
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,440
Seo-yeon / I think it's natural for people to waver a little sometimes

997
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,640
Seo-yeon / But the real question is

998
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,240
Seo-yeon / Whether you act on those feelings or not—that’s the line

999
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,640
Ri-won / Has anyone here ever forgiven someone who cheated on them?

1000
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,840
Seo-yeon / I would never...

1001
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,280
Ri-won / Mi-rang, you have, right?

1002
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,000
Mi-rang / No, never!

1003
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,360
Ri-won / Really? No one?

1004
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,040
Ri-won / Really? No one?
Jin-ah / You have?

1005
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,000
Ri-won / Yes, I have

1006
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,240
Ri-won / Yes, I have
Mi-rang / But does it count as forgiveness?

1007
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,120
Mi-rang / Like, if I say, “Break it off with her and come back to me!”

1008
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,920
Mi-rang / Is that still forgiving?

1009
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,160
That’s forgiveness

1010
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,240
Totally forgiveness

1011
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,000
Jin-ah / That’s forgiveness plus being a fool

1012
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,280
Han-kyul / I’ve been in that position before

1013
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,040
Jin-ah / I can’t do that!

1014
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:20,400
Jin-ah / My feelings would disappear

1015
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,560
Han-kyul / But the person never came back

1016
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,960
Han-kyul / Even if I wanted to forgive, I couldn’t

1017
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,560
Han-kyul / Even if I wanted to forgive, I couldn’t
Mi-rang / Me too

1018
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,680
Hee-young / And you still feel the same now?

1019
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,000
Mi-rang / Never, absolutely not!

1020
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,320
Ri-won / So no forgiving cheating?

1021
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,960
Han-kyul / If I still loved them

1022
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,160
Han-kyul / I might say “Come back,” not for them but for me

1023
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,920
Han-kyul / Come back to me

1024
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:38,760
Han-kyul / That’s another way to look at it

1025
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,680
Ri-won / Everyone has such different standards

1026
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,800
Ri-won / Really shows how different our values are

1027
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,080
Ri-won / Han-kyul seems a bit less conservative

1028
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,560
Ri-won / And I guess I’m more on the conservative side

1029
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:50,800
Ri-won / More strict, maybe

1030
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,280
Hee-young / This is kind of...

1031
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,840
Hee-young / A drink topic, no?

1032
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,320
Ri-won / Should we keep talking over drinks?

1033
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,680
Mi-rang / I’ll go grab some

1034
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,760
Da-gyo / Wow, everyone really loves alcohol

1035
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,360
Han-kyul / Definitely feels like a drinks conversation...

1036
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,440
Jin-ah / Are these the shoes?

1037
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,960
Jin-ah / I had my eye on these shoes

1038
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,440
Mi-rang / Really?

1039
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,760
Jin-ah / I saw them in the room and thought,

1040
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,520
Jin-ah / I should try them on secretly

1041
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,520
Jin-ah / Like, are these those cute pastel pink shoes?

1042
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,760
Mi-rang / Is that why you’re called Jin-jin Pink, since you like pink?

1043
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,720
Jin-ah / Hahaha exactly

1044
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,400
Mi-rang / That YouTube thing...

1045
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,720
Mi-rang / I was going to bring this up later

1046
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,000
Mi-rang / But I actually watch it while I shower every morning

1047
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,800
Mi-rang / But when I listen while showering

1048
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,400
Mi-rang / It’s too noisy to hear properly

1049
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,840
Jin-ah / Oh, the talking?

1050
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,320
Mi-rang / So I ended up just watching your face and that’s it

1051
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,200
Jin-ah / Am I different from how I seem on YouTube?

1052
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,080
Mi-rang / Totally

1053
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,240
Mi-rang / You look way better in person

1054
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,680
Jin-ah / Really? That’s such a compliment

1055
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,600
Jin-ah / What did you drink?

1056
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,360
Jin-ah / Oh, you had this one, okay

1057
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,320
Mi-rang / There’s also some flounder

1058
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,280
Jin-ah / Oh really? You had that too?

1059
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,040
Mi-rang / I do pay attention to appearance

1060
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,040
Mi-rang / But I really admire people who are ambitious and work hard

1061
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,120
Mi-rang / I really like that kind of person

1062
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:05,160
Mi-rang / When I saw you on YouTube, you spoke so well

1063
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,960
Mi-rang / You were focused on your goals and had ambition

1064
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,920
Mi-rang / That confident image

1065
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,560
Mi-rang / Was really attractive to me

1066
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,000
Jin-ah / When Mi-rang said she already knew me

1067
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,680
Jin-ah / I had two thoughts

1068
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:21,960
Jin-ah / First, since she already knows me a bit

1069
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,920
Jin-ah / Maybe we can go deeper, faster

1070
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,600
Jin-ah / That felt nice

1071
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,160
Jin-ah / But at the same time, I wondered if she might not be curious about me anymore

1072
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,560
Jin-ah / Like, “She already knows everything about me, right?”

1073
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,320
Jin-ah / So I had mixed feelings

1074
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,760
Jin-ah / This is so good

1075
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:38,640
Jin-ah / Everyone raise your glass

1076
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,520
Ri-won / I like this vibe

1077
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,080
Hee-young / We’re really getting into it now

1078
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,880
Hee-young / Cheers to our first round!

1079
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:53,000
So nice to meet you all

1080
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,160
Mi-rang / Is there something specific that makes you fall for someone?

1081
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,680
Jin-ah / Oh, I want to know this too

1082
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,440
Ri-won / Isn’t this the most important question?

1083
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,320
Jin-ah / I love watching people answer this

1084
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,600
Mi-rang / The moment that makes you fall for someone?

1085
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,320
Da-gyo / Just say what kind of person you like

1086
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,000
Da-gyo / That’s easier

1087
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,280
Mi-rang / Someone who’s responsible with their work

1088
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:23,920
Jin-ah / But how do you even know that?

1089
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,760
Jin-ah / But how do you even know that?
Ri-won / Aren’t there like ten million of those?

1090
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,640
Mi-rang / I really don’t like people who live lazily

1091
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,760
Jin-ah / Oh, a "grind-set" person

1092
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,160
Jin-ah / I'm really drawn to people who have ambition too

1093
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,240
Mi-rang / And the moment someone falls for me is because of

1094
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,960
Mi-rang / My unexpected charm

1095
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,880
Seo-yeon / I think I know what you mean

1096
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,400
Jin-ah / Wow, she says she gets it

1097
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,360
Jin-ah / Wow, she says she gets it
Ri-won / I don’t get it though

1098
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,040
Seo-yeon / You seem really mature and composed but then

1099
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,040
Jin-ah / Totally clumsy!

1100
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,480
Mi-rang / That doesn’t sound like a compliment

1101
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,240
Ri-won / You mean it’s cute, right?

1102
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,400
Ri-won / You mean it’s cute, right?
Seo-yeon / Yeah, it’s cute

1103
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,040
Jin-ah / But I think that’s right. That unexpected charm?

1104
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,520
Jin-ah / Wow, you really noticed that well

1105
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:05,880
Seo-yeon / I think you’d notice it more as you spend time together

1106
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,360
Hee-young / I already noticed it

1107
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,120
Seo-yeon / We're roommates, after all

1108
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,560
Mi-rang / We’ve had lots of conversations

1109
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:15,440
Jin-ah / I saw Seo-yeon looking at Mi-rang from across the table

1110
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,480
Jin-ah / With this cute “I’ve got my eyes on you” look

1111
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,920
Jin-ah / I was like, “Wait, did Seo-yeon already claim Mi-rang?”

1112
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,440
Jin-ah / So, Seo-yeon, you said something about that

1113
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,560
Seo-yeon / For me, it’s more like...

1114
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,760
Seo-yeon / When I feel like someone is really sincere

1115
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,080
Seo-yeon / And devoted, that’s when I fall for them

1116
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,400
Seo-yeon / That’s the kind of person I’m drawn to

1117
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,440
Seo-yeon / And I feel like I can show that side of myself too

1118
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,440
Seo-yeon / What about you, Jin-ah?

1119
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,160
Jin-ah / For me…

1120
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,280
Jin-ah / When someone tries to better themselves

1121
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:52,880
Jin-ah / Because of me, that completely wins me over

1122
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,040
Jin-ah / I fall hard for that

1123
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,280
Jin-ah / Whether it’s trying to become a better person

1124
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,960
Jin-ah / By waking up early in the morning

1125
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,920
Jin-ah / Or working out harder

1126
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,320
Jin-ah / Or speaking more kindly, whatever it is

1127
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,280
Jin-ah / It’s all part of trying to grow

1128
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,840
Jin-ah / If you just look at my social media

1129
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,840
Jin-ah / You’d probably think I just love to party

1130
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,680
Jin-ah / But I’m actually the complete opposite

1131
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,320
Jin-ah / I like people who can see that about me

1132
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,400
Jin-ah / If someone can recognize that side of me…

1133
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,320
Jin-ah / That’s it

1134
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:24,440
Jin-ah / How about you, Da-gyo?

1135
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,680
Da-gyo / I’m really sensitive to scents

1136
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,440
Da-gyo / So if someone smells nice, I get interested

1137
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,320
Da-gyo / But not like some special unique scent

1138
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,400
Ri-won / I didn’t spray anything, I was kidding

1139
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,760
Mi-rang / Wait, I think I’ve heard this somewhere before

1140
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,160
Da-gyo / I don’t mean a distinct perfume or anything

1141
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,200
Da-gyo / Just something that matches their vibe really well

1142
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:41,840
Da-gyo / That kind of scent

1143
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,080
Da-gyo / I tend to remember people by their scent

1144
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,560
Jin-ah / Tomorrow this whole place will be a perfume cloud

1145
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:48,520
Ri-won / We're doomed!

1146
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,200
Ri-won / I’m spraying myself head to toe tomorrow

1147
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,120
Da-gyo / And also

1148
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:57,360
Da-gyo / Someone who remembers the little things I say

1149
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,600
Da-gyo / Like “Did I really say that?”

1150
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,080
Da-gyo / Even when I forget, but they remember

1151
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,120
Da-gyo / I find that really attractive

1152
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,440
Da-gyo / And someone who lives with drive...

1153
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,560
Da-gyo / Someone who works hard and tries their best

1154
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,720
Da-gyo / I’m kind of like that myself

1155
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,680
Da-gyo / I’m pretty ambitious

1156
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,160
Da-gyo / I’m pretty ambitious
Jin-ah / Ambition is great

1157
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,440
Da-gyo / What I often hear from people I get close to is

1158
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,360
Da-gyo / That I’m fun once you get to know me

1159
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,920
Da-gyo / I hear that quite a bit

1160
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,800
Ri-won / You’re already fun

1161
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:23,840
Da-gyo / Really?

1162
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,200
Da-gyo / That’s a relief, then

1163
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,360
Da-gyo / Also

1164
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,240
Da-gyo / I hear that I’m kind of cute when you get to know me

1165
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,640
Da-gyo / I hear that I’m kind of cute when you get to know me
Ri-won / You’re already cute

1166
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,360
Da-gyo / And

1167
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,520
Da-gyo / I get told I’m mature for my age

1168
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,360
Ri-won / So you’re young, huh?

1169
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,560
Hee-young / How old are your peers exactly?

1170
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,400
Da-gyo / I don’t know

1171
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,320
Hee-young / I definitely find sincerity really attractive

1172
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,520
Hee-young / When someone’s genuine, it gets me

1173
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,840
Hee-young / As for what’s attractive about me…

1174
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,600
Hee-young / Hmm…

1175
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,000
Hee-young / I’m embarrassed

1176
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,960
Ri-won / Why? Claim it!

1177
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,880
Da-gyo / Be confident

1178
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,720
Jin-ah / No holding back

1179
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,480
Ri-won / No holding back here

1180
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,480
Jin-ah / I’m here to win

1181
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,760
Hee-young / I think when I’m really into someone, I show it more

1182
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,640
Da-gyo / When you’re sure

1183
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,760
Da-gyo / When you’re sure
Hee-young / I’m pretty straightforward

1184
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,600
Hee-young / It just takes a lot for me to get to that point

1185
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,840
Ri-won / Han-kyul, have you answered yet?

1186
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,240
Han-kyul / First impressions? Looks. But after that, emotional connection

1187
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,600
Ri-won / Whoa, that was surprisingly concise

1188
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,120
Han-kyul / You know what people who aren’t into me often say?

1189
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,240
Han-kyul / Stuff like,

1190
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,040
Han-kyul / “I don’t get what you’re saying”

1191
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,880
Han-kyul / “I don’t know what you’re thinking”

1192
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,120
Han-kyul / “You’re too abstract”

1193
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,320
Han-kyul / “I can’t enter your world, I can’t fit in”

1194
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,640
Han-kyul / I’ve gotten rejected with that reasoning a lot, but now

1195
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,800
Han-kyul / I sometimes find people who actually relate to it

1196
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,800
Han-kyul / People who get it

1197
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,960
Han-kyul / Someone who says “I want to understand you” and reaches out

1198
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,840
Han-kyul / If someone is drawn to me

1199
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:53,600
Han-kyul / It’s probably because they empathize with me

1200
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,440
Han-kyul / What draws me to someone is their looks

1201
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,360
Hee-young / So you're into looks?

1202
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,480
Han-kyul / I mean, to be honest...

1203
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,000
Han-kyul / I won't deny it

1204
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,520
Ri-won / For me, what draws me in...

1205
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,000
Ri-won / I like cute people

1206
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,200
Ri-won / And I don’t mind if someone’s a little rude

1207
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,800
Ri-won / Like, to put it bluntly, a bit of an attitude is okay

1208
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,040
Ri-won / But deep down they have a good heart

1209
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,160
Ri-won / That kind of person attracts me

1210
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,560
Ri-won / Even if their approach is wrong

1211
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,640
Da-gyo / That’s complicated

1212
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,720
Jin-ah / I’m a bit confused too

1213
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,360
Hee-young / I think the way they express it matters

1214
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:27,960
Jin-ah / I agree

1215
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,480
Jin-ah / Managing how those traits show up

1216
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,480
Jin-ah / I think that’s part of being mature

1217
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,760
Ri-won / But that’s exactly what could make me fall for someone

1218
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,560
Ri-won / Because I can teach them a better way

1219
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,720
Ri-won / I really like filling in the gaps for someone

1220
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,200
Ri-won / Helping them where they fall short

1221
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,720
Ri-won / That’s really rewarding to me

1222
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,360
Ri-won / I love filling those missing pieces

1223
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:54,520
Da-gyo / Earlier during dinner, when you said the person totally...

1224
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,160
Han-kyul / Relied on you!

1225
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,200
Da-gyo / Yeah, that’s right

1226
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:57,760
Ri-won / I love that

1227
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,360
Jin-ah / So you're the nurturing type

1228
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,640
Jin-ah / You enjoy taking care of someone
Da-gyo / And you’re okay with that dynamic

1229
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,800
Ri-won / If someone entrusts their life to me

1230
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,280
Ri-won / I’ll take full responsibility

1231
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,560
Ri-won / I can design their whole life if needed

1232
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,920
Jin-ah / That’s not for me though

1233
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,520
Ri-won / I actually like that

1234
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,560
Seo-yeon / I didn’t expect it, but Ri-won seems

1235
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:21,800
Seo-yeon / So devoted and sincere when she loves someone

1236
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,800
Seo-yeon / She’s genuinely heartfelt

1237
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,120
Seo-yeon / I found myself thinking, “I want a girlfriend like that too”

1238
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,040
Seo-yeon / That really crossed my mind

1239
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,440
Ri-won / Anyone else who hasn’t gone yet?

1240
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,800
Ri-won / Anyone else who hasn’t gone yet?
Han-kyul / I haven’t

1241
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:38,720
Han-kyul / When you're going through a hard time, what or who do you turn to?

1242
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,240
Da-gyo / That’s easy!

1243
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:42,960
Da-gyo / For me...

1244
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,320
Da-gyo / My mom!

1245
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,600
Da-gyo / I’m super close with my mom, like best friends

1246
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,000
Da-gyo / There’s nothing I don’t tell her

1247
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,960
Da-gyo / We’re really close

1248
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,600
Da-gyo / My mom and my aunt too

1249
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,800
Han-kyul / I really value the relationship with parents

1250
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,560
Han-kyul / So for me, that “beloved daughter” or “bright girl” image

1251
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,440
Han-kyul / I'm super weak to that. It really melts my heart

1252
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,680
Han-kyul / My feelings shoot up when I see that

1253
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,560
Han-kyul / It’s like my interest spikes in that moment

1254
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:18,400
Han-kyul / I think that’s when I really start to feel drawn to someone

1255
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,960
Jin-ah / I don’t rely on anyone

1256
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,640
Da-gyo / How come?

1257
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,360
Jin-ah / But I like it that way

1258
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,920
Jin-ah / I bounce back really fast

1259
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,640
Jin-ah / I don’t get down easily

1260
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,520
Jin-ah / I don’t get down easily
Ri-won / You must be really positive

1261
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,720
Jin-ah / So in relationships

1262
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,520
Jin-ah / I feel myself becoming more needy

1263
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:32,960
Strangely

1264
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:33,720
Jin-ah / It’s like

1265
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,720
Jin-ah / I’m totally fine on my own, don’t need anyone

1266
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,840
Then once I start dating

1267
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,040
Jin-ah / I’m like, “Why am I suddenly talking all cute like this?”

1268
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:45,520
Jin-ah / And leaning on them for things that aren’t even hard

1269
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,080
Jin-ah / That kind of thing

1270
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:47,800
Da-gyo / Yeah, I get that

1271
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,960
Seo-yeon / I don’t even lean on my partner

1272
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,640
Da-gyo / Really?

1273
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,400
Seo-yeon / I’m just not the type to rely on people

1274
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,600
Hee-young / She’s not even leaning her back right now

1275
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,720
Han-kyul / You’re seriously sitting so straight

1276
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,480
Jin-ah / But people like that don’t really get overwhelmed, right?

1277
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,800
Jin-ah / Like they don’t struggle much?

1278
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,640
Seo-yeon / No, it's just...

1279
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,320
Seo-yeon / It’s more that I’m scared I won’t be able to stay grounded

1280
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,080
Seo-yeon / When I don’t have that support

1281
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:14,560
Da-gyo / That’s heavy

1282
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,680
Da-gyo / Like really heavy

1283
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,320
Seo-yeon / So it can be a bit hard sometimes

1284
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,160
Seo-yeon / I do wish I could lean on someone every now and then

1285
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,640
Seo-yeon / But I can’t do that

1286
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,440
Da-gyo / Then lean on us now

1287
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,160
Seo-yeon / So~ Sweet

1288
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,200
Da-gyo / Don’t cry

1289
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,760
That was really touching

1290
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,200
Ri-won / But it seems like most people here don’t lean on others?

1291
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:38,720
Ri-won / Do you?

1292
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,760
Da-gyo / I do... I lean on my partner

1293
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,960
Jin-ah / You already look like you want to lean on someone

1294
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,800
Ri-won / I do lean

1295
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,400
Da-gyo / I’d feel a bit hurt

1296
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,720
Da-gyo / If they didn’t tell me when they’re struggling

1297
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,760
Jin-ah / You mean the other person?

1298
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:53,160
Jin-ah / I’ve had that happen too

1299
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,120
Mi-rang / For me, it was complicated, at first

1300
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:57,200
Mi-rang / I relied too much on them

1301
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,840
Mi-rang / And when they left, I crumbled

1302
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,480
Mi-rang / So I thought, “I shouldn’t do that anymore”

1303
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,960
Mi-rang / “I shouldn't do that anymore”
Hee-young / Been there, done that

1304
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:02,920
Mi-rang / So I stopped

1305
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,480
Mi-rang / Tried not to lean on anyone

1306
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:08,120
Mi-rang / But then the other person felt hurt by that too

1307
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,480
Mi-rang / So like Da-gyo said

1308
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,680
Mi-rang / I think we just shouldn’t lean too heavily

1309
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,880
Mi-rang / But we need to communicate it

1310
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,080
Mi-rang / It’s about balance, really

1311
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,600
Jin-ah / That’s why I love watching someone like that

1312
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,600
Jin-ah / Change when they become mine

1313
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,000
Jin-ah / That’s my kind of happiness

1314
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,040
Mi-rang / You think it’d be fun?

1315
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,160
Jin-ah / Watching them grow stronger

1316
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,720
Jin-ah / Like, they lean on me a lot

1317
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,120
Jin-ah / And then one day, they start standing tall

1318
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,200
Whoa whoa look at the crazy sparkle in your eyes again

1319
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,360
Ri-won / She had that crazed sparkle on her date too

1320
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,040
Ri-won / Was there madness on the date?

1321
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:44,160
Hee-young / Especially when she talks about something she’s passionate about

1322
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,120
Ri-won / Everyone’s giving such thoughtful answers

1323
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,120
Ri-won / I’m just like

1324
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,520
Ri-won / How could I lean on my baby?

1325
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,240
Seo-yeon / Wow, that’s legendary

1326
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,680
Da-gyo / That was too sweet

1327
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,240
Da-gyo / I don’t even need dessert now

1328
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,960
Hee-young / My baby...

1329
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,560
Ri-won / People expect to lean on someone, but for me

1330
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,400
Ri-won / Just their existence heals me and gives me strength

1331
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,280
Da-gyo / Oh my god

1332
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,600
Ri-won / I don’t even need to lean

1333
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,160
Ri-won / Just seeing their face makes me so happy

1334
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,280
Ri-won / They’re the driving force of my life

1335
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,960
Han-kyul / That’s so romantic

1336
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:18,920
Da-gyo / It’s the same line from earlier

1337
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,840
Ri-won / No regrets meeting me

1338
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,400
Exactly exactly

1339
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,040
Ri-won / That’s kind of my philosophy on dating

1340
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,280
Ri-won / They probably had other options

1341
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,440
Ri-won / Other chances besides me

1342
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,520
Ri-won / But they chose me

1343
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,560
Hee-young / That’s why you could forgive a fling?

1344
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,040
Han-kyul / I’m the type who likes to give the other person the choice

1345
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,040
Han-kyul / I don’t like when the responsibility falls on me

1346
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,920
Han-kyul / I’d rather they decide

1347
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,680
Han-kyul / So when you do something for me

1348
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,360
Han-kyul / I see it as, “This is your permission, your choice”

1349
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,840
Han-kyul / That mindset fits my personality

1350
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,440
Da-gyo / I should learn that kind of attitude

1351
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,600
Hee-young / I think love should include

1352
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,920
Hee-young / A certain level of devotion

1353
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,160
Jin-ah / Because you love them

1354
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,800
Da-gyo / But doesn’t that naturally come with love?

1355
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,040
Da-gyo / It just happens

1356
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,720
Hee-young / As generations change, it feels like

1357
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,240
Hee-young / Devoted love is treated like

1358
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,480
Hee-young / You're lacking your own values

1359
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:14,120
Hee-young / And people think too much and try to win in love

1360
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,960
Hee-young / That mindset is everywhere now

1361
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,600
Hee-young / So I think you two are really amazing

1362
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,760
Hee-young / Having those thoughts while loving someone is admirable

1363
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,400
Jin-ah / Shall we draw another one?

1364
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,960
Ri-won / Should we just reveal them and choose?

1365
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,520
Ri-won / We don’t have many left anyway

1366
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:29,960
Mi-rang / You're a great MC

1367
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,800
Han-kyul / Right? You’re basically hosting this

1368
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:35,080
Ri-won / Then instead of asking all of them

1369
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,560
Ri-won / Should we ask just one person?

1370
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:37,760
Ri-won / Pick one and go

1371
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,560
Seo-yeon / Yeah, sounds good

1372
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,920
Ri-won / I’m even curious what question I’d pick

1373
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,160
Ri-won / You can tell a lot about someone by that too

1374
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:47,040
Jin-ah / Really? Then I have to take it seriously

1375
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,640
Jin-ah / Actually, I really wanted to do this one

1376
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,160
I’m curious about this one too

1377
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,560
Ri-won / Should we start this way?

1378
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,480
Jin-ah / Honestly, I want to ask all of these

1379
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,800
Jin-ah / But since we just ate...

1380
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,120
Jin-ah / How do you resolve conflicts with your partner?

1381
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,840
Jin-ah / Is there a way you’d like to try?

1382
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,360
Jin-ah / Out of everyone, I was most curious about Hee-young

1383
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:18,640
Hee-young / Honestly, I usually resolve it through conversation

1384
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,560
Hee-young / “Because of this and this, I felt like this”

1385
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,360
Jin-ah / I’m curious—do you take time or talk right away?

1386
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,440
Hee-young / Ah~ do I talk right away?

1387
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,720
Jin-ah / That really makes a difference

1388
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,480
Ri-won / That’s a really important point

1389
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,880
Ri-won / Whether you resolve it immediately or wait

1390
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,560
Hee-young / But the thing is

1391
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,280
Hee-young / For me, it depends on the situation

1392
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,400
Hee-young / It’s all relative, based on the context

1393
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,720
Da-gyo / It depends on the reason for the fight too

1394
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,680
Hee-young / And how deep the relationship is at that point

1395
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:46,320
Hee-young / And also whether it’s something I can understand or not

1396
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,600
Hee-young / I take all those into account

1397
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:52,760
Hee-young / But I still end up talking about it pretty quickly

1398
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,320
Hee-young / A way I want to try resolving conflict?

1399
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,880
Hee-young / Maybe being more honest?

1400
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,960
Hee-young / Honest, but without getting angry

1401
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,760
Hee-young / Being honest without showing anger, that kind of thing

1402
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,560
Jin-ah / It wasn’t very clear

1403
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,560
Jin-ah / Even after hearing, I still can’t tell

1404
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:10,840
Jin-ah / What kind of person you are when resolving conflict

1405
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,320
Hee-young / I’ll go with this one

1406
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,320
Da-gyo / Is that the top card?

1407
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:26,080
Hee-young / Since the two of us went missing and came back, it could’ve been fun

1408
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,080
Hee-young / But doing anything that seals the deal too much like a couple...

1409
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,280
Hee-young / I didn’t want to do that

1410
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,280
Hee-young / I guess I was feeling too conflicted emotionally

1411
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,960
Da-gyo / Between loving and being loved

1412
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,760
Da-gyo / Which one do you think is easier?

1413
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:46,080
Da-gyo / I think being loved is harder

1414
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,760
Da-gyo / Even in relationships, the feeling of loving someone

1415
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:50,920
Da-gyo / Feels so natural, right?

1416
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,600
Da-gyo / To love someone yourself

1417
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,640
Da-gyo / And for both to share that love… that’s

1418
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,760
Da-gyo / I think that’s actually incredibly rare and hard

1419
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,480
Da-gyo / The process itself is

1420
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,960
Da-gyo / You all get what I’m trying to say, right?

1421
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,440
Da-gyo / I think being loved is harder

1422
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,520
Da-gyo / That might sound strange, right?

1423
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,560
Mi-rang / No no, you did great

1424
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:19,320
Han-kyul / When do you feel most loved?

1425
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,280
Han-kyul / I think it’s when someone’s curious about my tastes

1426
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,760
Han-kyul / Like when they say “I want to watch all the movies you like”

1427
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:32,880
Han-kyul / Or “I’ve been listening to your favorite music lately”

1428
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,000
Han-kyul / Those words really hit me

1429
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,200
Han-kyul / I think that’s my favorite expression of love

1430
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,560
Hee-young / That’s cool

1431
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,040
Ri-won / You’re such a deep thinker

1432
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,200
Ri-won / I see the saddest energy coming from someone here

1433
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,160
Mi-rang / Why are you looking at me!

1434
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,720
Ri-won / I think you’ve been hurt the most

1435
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,880
Ri-won / Mi-rang, when you’re feeling down

1436
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,360
Ri-won / What’s something that makes you smile?

1437
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,560
Mi-rang / When my partner takes care of me

1438
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,000
Hee-young / How so?

1439
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,280
Mi-rang / Like always being thoughtful

1440
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,000
Ri-won / Care!

1441
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:13,600
Ri-won / Full-on care

1442
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,200
Mi-rang / Saying things like “Let’s go eat, come out now!”

1443
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,840
Jin-ah / What about when you’re not dating?

1444
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:22,040
Mi-rang / I mean, I don’t really get super down that often

1445
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,600
Da-gyo / Really?

1446
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,080
Mi-rang / I used to rely on others a lot before

1447
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:27,520
Mi-rang / These days, even if I get really mad, it fades quickly

1448
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,240
Mi-rang / These days, even if I get really mad, it fades quickly
Jin-ah / Same here

1449
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,840
Jin-ah / I just sleep on it and feel fine

1450
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,000
Mi-rang / It never lasts long for me

1451
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,280
Mi-rang / Bad moods don’t even last an hour

1452
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,080
Jin-ah / "I’m too busy to feel upset"

1453
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,040
Jin-ah / I think like that and just fall asleep

1454
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,320
Mi-rang / But don’t you think this happens?

1455
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,960
Mi-rang / You brush things off over and over

1456
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,760
Mi-rang / But when burnout hits, it hits hard

1457
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,080
Ri-won / Like going deep into a cave

1458
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,320
Mi-rang / I just spend a whole day by myself

1459
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,000
Jin-ah / Exactly, same here

1460
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,400
Hee-young / I always have days where I don’t leave the house

1461
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,520
Jin-ah / Just lying in bed like the last leaf

1462
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,080
Jin-ah / drip drip

1463
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:03,680
Mi-rang / Then the next day I’m totally fine

1464
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,680
Mi-rang / Back to daily life

1465
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:07,000
Jin-ah / I think that’s actually healthy

1466
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:10,200
Ri-won / Mi-rang is more soft-hearted than I thought

1467
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,880
Ri-won / Very feminine and has a lot of wounds

1468
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,160
Ri-won / I think Mi-rang has a very pure soul too

1469
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,560
Mi-rang / When you're in a relationship

1470
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,320
Mi-rang / Which do you value more — excitement or comfort?

1471
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,120
Mi-rang / What’s more important to you?

1472
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,960
Seo-yeon / For me, comfort no matter what

1473
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:34,760
Seo-yeon / If there’s no comfort

1474
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,240
Seo-yeon / I won’t even start a relationship

1475
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,320
Da-gyo / Really?

1476
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,720
Da-gyo / That’s totally opposite for me

1477
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,080
Excitement, always excitement

1478
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,640
Jin-ah / But that excitement can take different forms

1479
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,760
Mi-rang / I do love the excitement, but

1480
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,320
Mi-rang / I hate the discomfort

1481
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,040
Jin-ah / Same here
Seo-yeon / Yeah! Me too

1482
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,480
Mi-rang / When I do something and think

1483
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:54,920
Mi-rang / “What if they start disliking me for this?”

1484
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,320
Mi-rang / That’s discomfort too

1485
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,520
Mi-rang / I mean that kind of comfort

1486
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:01,560
Seo-yeon / Jin-ah

1487
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,440
Jin-ah / Did you give this to me because no one else took it?

1488
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:09,240
Jin-ah / What’s something you really want to do with your partner this year?

1489
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:10,160
Jin-ah / I have one

1490
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,240
Jin-ah / I actually go to Jeju Island

1491
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,080
Jin-ah / About once every month or two

1492
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:16,360
Jin-ah / But I don’t go for sightseeing

1493
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,040
Jin-ah / I go for work

1494
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,400
Jin-ah / Honestly

1495
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,440
Jin-ah / If I meet someone I love here

1496
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,760
Jin-ah / I’d want to come back again with them

1497
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,920
Jin-ah / When the weather warms up a bit

1498
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,600
Ri-won / That’s so romantic

1499
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,360
Jin-ah / So I want to go to all the places I really wanted to visit

1500
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,760
Jin-ah / And say, "I wanted to come here back then"

1501
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,440
Jin-ah / And travel around like that

1502
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,920
Mi-rang / That sounds lovely!

1503
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,240
That was fun

1504
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,080
Ri-won / Huh? Something just arrived

1505
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,280
Seo-yeon / Again?

1506
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,960
Ri-won / Huh? Again?

1507
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,520
All together?

1508
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,800
Let’s do it again

1509
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,000
All together

1510
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,000
It looks like a decision has been made, anyway

1511
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,240
Let’s be honest about how we feel right now
