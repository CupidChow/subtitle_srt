00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:25,378
Hello.

6
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:26,847
- Hello. - Hey.

7
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:29,018
Just in case my husband tried anything funny.

8
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,276
Ms. Lee will be with him when he goes to school.

9
00:00:31,277 --> 00:00:33,916
Gosh. Don't worry about him. My housekeeper is good with kids.

10
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:35,857
You'll have a friend when you come to my house.

11
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:37,787
He can play with my daughter.

12
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:42,798
Be a good boy, and listen to her while I go on a business trip.

13
00:00:44,397 --> 00:00:45,427
Say bye to your mom.

14
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:46,998
Bye, Mom.

15
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:48,366
- Do you want some snacks? - Yes.

16
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,938
I made delicious snacks for you. Let's go.

17
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:54,307
Let's go. I wonder what kind of snack you will like.

(Final Episode)

19
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:22,567
You said we were still on the same team.

20
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:24,238
And I'm going to believe you.

21
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:28,007
Whatever the reason is, I want to see him go down too.

22
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:31,608
By the way,

23
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:34,608
Chairwoman Cha seemed as if she had been wronged pretty badly.

24
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:36,847
Aren't you scared?

25
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,987
I am. I've been smiling so hard not to look scared.

26
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:41,587
So I have a muscle cramp here.

27
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:44,717
What about Noh Yul Seong?

28
00:01:46,087 --> 00:01:47,728
Nothing yet, for now.

29
00:01:48,157 --> 00:01:50,026
As for Professor Seo's case,

30
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,057
he got rid of Professor Seo's phone. So it won't be easy.

31
00:01:53,467 --> 00:01:56,397
As for my mom's case, it's still a perfect crime.

32
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:58,837
- Then... - I must corner him...

33
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:03,337
until he makes a bigger mistake, trying to cover up a small mistake.

34
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:09,617
Here.

35
00:02:10,918 --> 00:02:12,048
It's the 50-Million-Dollar Club.

36
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:14,787
Is it the five-member society your father talked about?

37
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:17,858
Yes. They gave out money as bribes.

38
00:02:18,018 --> 00:02:20,328
I hope you can use this to corner him.

Let's get rid of the people backing Noh Yul Seong.

46
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:39,876
Since he bribed people,

47
00:02:39,877 --> 00:02:42,048
he must have a ledger. A ledger for the bribes.

48
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:46,318
The ledger will be Noh Yul Seong's last weapon.

49
00:02:46,448 --> 00:02:48,186
What? It won't be his weakness?

50
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:49,988
Before it becomes his weakness, he will use it as a weapon.

51
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:52,116
He will probably blackmail the people on the ledger...

52
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:54,087
to get him out of trouble.

53
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:56,527
So you want to obtain the ledger, right?

54
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:00,328
Yes. We have to make sure he doesn't get away with this.

55
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,997
Not until I send him to prison for murdering my mother.

56
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:07,936
Gosh. The ledger... Where do you think it is?

57
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,876
The law firm? His house? In a bank safe?

58

63
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:22,216
Do you have anything on him? Like his weaknesses?

64
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:23,817
It looks like he would have a lot of those.

He writes articles for money.

68
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:32,467
He's the weak link.

69
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:36,467
Ms. Kim. If someone bribed you, where would you keep it?

70
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:39,138
Well,

71
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,568
I've never received a bribe. So I wouldn't know.

72
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:45,038
- Not the bank, for sure. - Right.

73
00:03:46,078 --> 00:03:48,007
If it goes over 10,000 dollars,

74
00:03:48,008 --> 00:03:49,716
it gets reported to the Financial Supervisory Service by default.

75
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:51,847
- Right. - That's why you need...

76
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:53,588
a secret storage for black money.

77
00:03:54,747 --> 00:03:56,918
A storage for a secret fund of the five-member society?

78
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:00,358
The ledger must be in there too.

79
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,257
First of all, let's follow the trail of Park Jong Il's bribes.

80
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,126
The trail will lead us to where the ledger is.

81
00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:09,297

82
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:12,506
You see, I used to be a prosecutor.

83
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:15,307

Please cook up a nice article for my restaurant.

99
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:37,218
Gosh. People call my flattery work a masterpiece.

100
00:05:40,028 --> 00:05:43,597
Then I'll send my employees tonight.

101
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:44,658
Okay.

102
00:05:45,658 --> 00:05:47,427
Thank you, Mr. Park!

103
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:51,468
Gosh. That piece of trash. Oh, you're here.

104
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:55,637
That was some expensive interview, wasn't it?

105
00:05:56,038 --> 00:05:57,637
I made you waste your talent on something like this.

106
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:01,048
I'm sorry and grateful at the same time.

107
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:04,218
I always wanted to repay you. You gave me a chance to do that.

108
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:08,117
- I hope your son is doing well. - Yes, thanks to you.

109
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:10,488
I hope you win this one like you did for me.

110
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,516
Yes, that will be the case.

111
00:06:12,517 --> 00:06:13,557
You see,

112
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:16,528
these two ladies are no joke.

113
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:19,728
We'll make sure to win.

114
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:22,997
You know what?

115
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:26,538
Remember what you told me the other day? It's...

116
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,277
What is it?

117
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:31,137
I have to take a picture when I see something beautiful.

118
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:32,978
What?

119
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:37,677
From now on, no mention of your exes.

120
00:06:38,117 --> 00:06:39,148
I'm talking about your ex-girlfriends.

121
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:42,017
The day we bring down Noh Yul Seong...

122
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:44,288
will be the first day of our relationship.

123
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,686
Seriously? Did you just say that? That was so sudden.

124
00:06:47,687 --> 00:06:48,728
Look ahead.

125
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:28,727
- Here's the sweet and sour chicken. - Thank you.

126
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:30,167
- Thank you. - Sure. Enjoy.

127
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:32,167
The fishcake soup will be out soon. Sure.

128
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:33,237
Hey, you're here.

129
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:36,136
Gosh. This is why I told you I was against this solution.

130
00:07:36,137 --> 00:07:37,337
I'm so busy.

131
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:39,077
- A bottle of beer, please. - Sure.

132
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,247
I'm not buying what she said.

133
00:07:42,747 --> 00:07:44,847
Gosh. That is one impressive vending machine.

134
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:46,347
He got the downpayment, did the interview,

135
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:48,787
and wrote the article within 30 minutes. Ta-Da.

136
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:52,187
People who use their talents solely for their own gain...

137
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:53,757
all ought to suffer in a pit of fire.

138
00:07:57,557 --> 00:07:58,557
Hey.

139
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:00,197
The money bag is on the move.

140
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:01,567
Where's the destination?

141
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:06,108
He just drove toward Danyeong.

142
00:08:06,307 --> 00:08:07,367
Danyeong?

143
00:08:07,608 --> 00:08:08,667
Danyeong?

144
00:08:09,108 --> 00:08:11,537
Danyeong in Gyeonggi Province? Where Chayul Law Firm has land?

145
00:08:11,877 --> 00:08:12,877
Yes. That's the place.

146
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:16,117
Look closely at which part of Danyeong he's going to. Okay.

147
00:08:25,117 --> 00:08:27,127
Are you sure this land belongs to Chayul?

148
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,328
Yes. All the land in this vicinity belongs to Chayul.

149
00:08:29,897 --> 00:08:33,468

Hey.

156
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:06,897
Did you write the article for this restaurant?

157
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,666
You didn't cut a deal with them or anything, right?

158
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,698
Gosh, what deal?

159
00:09:11,068 --> 00:09:12,068
But why do you ask?

160
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:14,406
The restaurant owner works with Dong Gi Jun.

161
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:16,037
The one who's investigating Professor Seo's case.

162
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:18,277
Don't keep them close.

163
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:29,858
The land does belong to Chairwoman Cha.

164
00:09:30,417 --> 00:09:32,088
But someone else has been managing the farmland.

165
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:34,828
It's Park Jong Il.

166
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:37,626
Farmland, my foot.

167
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,328
He was probably managing the secrets of the five-member society.

168
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:42,567
By the way, where's the secret storage here?

169
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:43,968
I only see fields of garlic here.

170
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:48,167
Right. Fields of garlic.

171
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:49,707
Right.

172
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:52,608
No law says that only garlic can grow from the garlic fields.

173
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:57,078
If you plant beans, you get beans. If you plant garlic, you get garlic.

174
00:09:57,948 --> 00:09:59,647
So if they were to plant bundles of bills,

175
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:02,116
they would get cash, right?

176
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:03,517
I see.

177
00:10:04,058 --> 00:10:07,928
Gosh. How are we going to dig up the entire field?

178
00:10:12,328 --> 00:10:13,397
Let's start digging first.

179
00:10:13,497 --> 00:10:14,897
Gosh, Lawyer Dong.

180
00:10:15,928 --> 00:10:19,098
- But this is... - Gosh. Come on, guys.

181
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:20,468
We don't have time to dig up the entire field.

182
00:10:21,407 --> 00:10:23,277
We must dig it up in one go.

183
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:25,137
All right.

184
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:28,907
Hey, guys!

185
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:33,448
The excavator is launched!

186
00:10:33,818 --> 00:10:35,088
- Can you see that? - Gosh.

187
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:07,287
Gosh. Look over there!

188
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:17,558
Darn it. There's no ledger.

189
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:20,568
Then does it mean this money is for Park Jong Il's personal use?

190
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:23,867
I don't think we'll find anything even if we keep digging.

191
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:25,438
Unless they buried the ledger more deeply.

192
00:11:25,867 --> 00:11:27,537
I doubt that they buried it deeply...

193
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:30,578
because they probably had to check the ledger frequently.

194
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:32,978
If it's not in the garlic field...

195
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:53,428
Gosh.

196
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:56,568
Flash it there.

197
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,677
You startled me. What's that?

198
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:11,947
There's some kind of manual these corrupt people follow.

199
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:13,617
They always hide their secret in places like this.

200
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:14,818
Step back for a second.

201
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:24,958
Exactly where?

202
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:28,997
Trust me on this.

203
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:35,967
Gosh. At this point, we should find a hole in the wall,

204
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:38,037
or a secret safe should show up.

205
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:42,747
It's not in there.

206
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:44,678
Only a fool would hide it there.

207
00:12:50,818 --> 00:12:53,757
I guess a fool hid the ledger right here.

208
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:58,657
What? No way. It can't be.

209
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:00,468
What?

210
00:13:03,438 --> 00:13:04,467
(Na Sung Il, a law professor)

211
00:13:04,468 --> 00:13:07,808
Gosh. All the transaction records and their names are on this.

212
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:09,708
With this,

213
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,838
he'll be charged with bribery.

214
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:16,578
We finally found people who are backing Noh Yul Seong.

215
00:13:21,318 --> 00:13:23,657
What? Did you guys find it?

216
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:26,257
Good job.

217
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,027
What? What are you talking about?

218
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:36,468
Let me get this straight.

219
00:13:37,938 --> 00:13:39,807
Kim Sa Ra has our ledger?

220
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:41,968
Gosh, what should we do?

221
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,377
How did she find out where it was?

222
00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:54,887
- Hey. - Yes.

223
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,657
There was a deal with that restaurant article, right?

224
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:01,227
- Right? You got caught, didn't you? - Gosh.

225
00:14:01,228 --> 00:14:04,157
No. Let me explain. The article...

226
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:06,967
It's not like I did this on purpose.

227
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:08,166
- You know? - Gosh, you jerk.

228
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:10,166
- How could you be so brazen? - Hey.

229
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:11,437
- Stop it. - How dare you?

230
00:14:11,438 --> 00:14:12,597
I told you to go easy...

231
00:14:12,598 --> 00:14:14,406
- on taking those backroom deals. - Hey, stop it.

232
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:16,107
- I never liked this jerk. - You're going to kill him.

233
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:17,108
- This jerk. - My gosh.

234
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:18,207
- You've been going around town... - This is just great.

235
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,246
- for money like some desperate dog. - He can't take a punch.

236
00:14:20,247 --> 00:14:21,407
- Stop it. - You're taking money from everyone.

237
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:23,447
- Seriously. - Gosh, this useless jerk.

238
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:24,517
- Gosh. - Goodness.

239
00:14:26,348 --> 00:14:28,386
- Are you free tomorrow? - Yes. Why?

240
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:31,317
- If you're free tomorrow, - Hey, did you know...

241
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:33,457
- let's invite other kids... - That's why...

242
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,987
- Seo Yun. - Hello, mister.

243
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:37,558
- Sure. - I don't want to.

244
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:41,997
Let's do that tomorrow.

245
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:46,637
- Hey, that elevator is open. - Gosh.

246
00:14:47,468 --> 00:14:49,608
(Kind and reliable police alongside the people)

247
00:14:51,578 --> 00:14:53,547
- What is it? - Bring me the ledger.

248
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:56,078
Everything should go back to where it belongs.

249
00:14:56,678 --> 00:14:59,377
The ledger, to the police. And you, to prison.

250
00:15:00,887 --> 00:15:03,157
Is that so? Then you should go back too.

251
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:05,417
To those days you couldn't see Seo Yun.

252
00:15:06,257 --> 00:15:07,327
Seo Yun?

253
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:09,958
The moment you hand over the ledger, you'll never see your son.

254
00:15:10,428 --> 00:15:11,497
What...

255
00:15:13,058 --> 00:15:14,996
What is it? Is something wrong?

256
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:15,997
(Seo Yun's Nanny, Ms. Lee)

257
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:19,867
- Yes, Ms. Lee. - Seo Yun is gone.

258
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,568
When he didn't come out from his academy, I went in to check.

259
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:26,208
(Contacts)

260
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,208
(My Love)

261
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,718
What's wrong?

262
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:35,417
He took Seo Yun.

263
00:15:36,558 --> 00:15:37,588
What do I do?

264
00:15:40,428 --> 00:15:43,996
Right. We can track children's cell phones.

265
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:44,997
Let's go.

266
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,627
Can you look for Seo Yun?

267
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:48,367
I'll put an end to this with Noh Yul Seong.

268
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,968
No, wait.

269
00:15:59,507 --> 00:16:01,247
(Phone Location in Real-time)

270
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:32,808
You piece of trash. How could you kidnap your own son?

271
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:35,046
How could you cross the line like this?

272
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:36,178
Speak for yourself.

273
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,078
How could you do this to your husband?

274
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:44,257
- Where's Seo Yun? - Where's my reward?

275
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:52,628
Bring Seo Yun right now.

276
00:16:53,968 --> 00:16:54,968
What if it's fake?

277
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:03,977
(Han Dong Jin: Assemblyman, Cha Yoon Sub: Chief Secretary)

278
00:17:03,978 --> 00:17:05,337
(Kim Yu Shin: Chairperson, Oh Jung Jae: Director)

279
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:08,678
Give that to me first.

280
00:17:09,577 --> 00:17:11,118
How could I trust you?

281
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:18,257
They're heading to the airport. They might leave the country.

282
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:20,628
Call him now!

283
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:25,698
Yes, sir.

284
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:42,347
You sure stashed a lot of escape plans.

285
00:17:43,777 --> 00:17:45,978
Do you know who the most powerful person in the world is?

286
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:48,517
It's the person who has something...

287
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:51,087
on the most powerful person.

288
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:53,928
So know your place.

289
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:56,327
You can't beat me.

290
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,097
I do wonder if you'll be able to make use...

291
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:01,997
of all the escape plans you created.

292
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:18,178
Gosh. Seriously.

293
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:31,158
Mom! Dad!

294
00:18:31,198 --> 00:18:32,997
- Seo Yun! - Come to Daddy.

295
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:36,427
I was playing a fun game with your mom.

296
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:37,567
You should join us.

297
00:18:41,908 --> 00:18:43,237
Come on. Put the ledger down.

298

00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,277
Right, Seo Yun?

302
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:57,287
Send him over now.

303
00:18:58,557 --> 00:18:59,618

Go, and play with your mom.

What's this?

309
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:52,138
Darn you, Kim Sa Ra.

310
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:11,057
We can't hand over the real ledger.

311
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:14,997
Please keep a close eye on Seo Yun.

312
00:20:20,368 --> 00:20:23,037
Seo Yun, I told you not to follow anyone.

313
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,208
He said you were waiting for me.

314
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,178
That's what Dad's secretary said.

315
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:32,618
Seo Yun, you take after your mom.

316
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,547
Who's that man?

317
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:37,557
He's my friend.

318
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:42,688
Seo Yun. Hello.

319
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:44,458
Hello.

320
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:49,468
I hope we can get along well.

321
00:20:50,238 --> 00:20:51,797
All right. Pound it.

322
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:56,267
Boom.

323
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:07,917
There has been a significant scandal...

324
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:09,487
surrounding the exposure of Chayul Law Firm's bribery ledger.

325
00:21:09,488 --> 00:21:10,887
Each bribe amounted to five million dollars,

326
00:21:10,888 --> 00:21:12,286
resulting in a total of 50 million dollars.

327
00:21:12,287 --> 00:21:13,356
To build Chayul Town...

328
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,957
It's been confirmed that CEO Noh Yul Seong had been...

329
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,557
bribing influential individuals to build Chayul Town.

330
00:21:18,698 --> 00:21:21,596
I will now begin the investigation status briefing...

331
00:21:21,597 --> 00:21:24,096
on the bribery incident over the redevelopment area...

332
00:21:24,097 --> 00:21:26,697
in Seoha-dong which is also known as the Suspicious Chayul Town Case.

333
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:28,307
("Investigation Status Announcement on Bribery Case of Chayul Town")

334
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:32,607
What is this about?

335
00:21:33,978 --> 00:21:36,148
You'll regret it if you don't hear us out.

336
00:21:37,678 --> 00:21:39,178
Gong Deukgu talked.

337
00:21:39,517 --> 00:21:42,188
He said Noh Yul Seong and you were in the car...

338
00:21:42,948 --> 00:21:45,718
with Ms. Kim's late mother on the day of her murder.

339
00:21:47,757 --> 00:21:50,497
That's why the prosecutor called in Noh Yul Seong.

340
00:21:51,898 --> 00:21:52,928
One more thing.

341
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:59,067
"Who was the one to push Park Jeong Suk at the factory?"

342
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:01,037
"It was Secretary Baek."

343
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:05,107
It's part of Noh Yul Seong's statement.

344
00:22:08,478 --> 00:22:09,977
(Who was the one to push Park Jeong Suk at the factory?)

345
00:22:09,978 --> 00:22:11,478
(It was Secretary Baek.)

346
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:16,418
Do not lie to me with something fake like this.

347
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:19,188
The prosecutor in charge written there is my friend.

348
00:22:19,618 --> 00:22:22,257
You can ask him if it's true or not.

349
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:24,658
Do you still think Noh Yul Seong is the one to rely on?

350
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,198
Let's get to our senses.

351
00:22:43,277 --> 00:22:45,447
If he thought this was fake,

352
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,148
he would've shown it to Noh Yul Seong.

353
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:49,047
He was a bit shaken by it.

354
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:54,657
Gosh, our Lawyer Dong can stop training in the mountains now.

355
00:22:54,658 --> 00:22:57,428
You know how to cross the line and make lies.

356
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:00,368
I've become so corrupt, haven't I?

357
00:23:00,698 --> 00:23:02,027
I'm in trouble.

358
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:03,938
This isn't right.

359
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:06,537
You're doing great.

360
00:23:13,222 --> 00:23:14,732
You can go in that way. Let's hurry.

361
00:23:16,392 --> 00:23:17,462
Let's move.

362
00:23:23,303 --> 00:23:25,573
It's the prosecution. It's a search and seizure.

363
00:23:27,543 --> 00:23:28,843
I think they'll come in here first.

364
00:23:32,882 --> 00:23:34,752
After they're done, they will call for you.

365
00:23:34,753 --> 00:23:36,681
So we need to be on the same line.

366
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:37,682
Right.

367
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:41,023
If they bring up about Seo Yun's grandmother, I wasn't in the car.

368
00:23:41,823 --> 00:23:42,823
Sorry?

369
00:23:43,293 --> 00:23:45,322
Gong Deukgu was driving and got off.

370
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:47,563
And then, you drove to the factory.

371
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,092
Just say you dropped her off at the factory.

372
00:23:50,093 --> 00:23:51,701
This isn't about that.

373
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:52,832
It's about the lobby funds.

374
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,573
It won't end there!

375
00:23:57,902 --> 00:23:59,803
If they find out that I was lying...

376
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:02,242
You have to get arrested. What else can we do?

377
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:05,142
Me?

378
00:24:06,283 --> 00:24:07,382
Then shall I go to prison?

379
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:10,382
What about Chayul?

380
00:24:13,482 --> 00:24:16,292
Hey, don't worry about it. Why are you so scared?

381
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:18,922
I'll take care of you until the end even if that happens.

382
00:24:19,063 --> 00:24:20,662
You trust me, don't you?

383
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:30,172
The lobbying suspicion based on Chayul Town.

384
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,273
This is a search and seizure warrant for that.

385
00:24:39,083 --> 00:24:40,113
Begin.

386
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:45,222
Be careful with that, mister.

387
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:48,952
He won't even listen.

388
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:51,763
(Divorce Specialist SOLUTION)

389
00:24:53,863 --> 00:24:57,132
The law school selection. Chayul Law Firm got eliminated!

390
00:24:58,162 --> 00:24:59,232
Ms. Kim!

391
00:25:00,273 --> 00:25:03,502
Was it, "What goes around comes around?"

392
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,842
"Justice will prevail." "Self do, self have."

393
00:25:04,843 --> 00:25:06,302
- "A taste of your own medicine." - Whatever.

394
00:25:06,303 --> 00:25:08,872
Let's just go with, "Stepping on one's own foot."

395
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:10,412
- Aren't I right, Ms. Kim? - Yes.

396
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:14,013
We can now feel at ease and put an end to Mom's case.

397
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,823
Hey. What happened with Secretary Baek?

398
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,992
It was a success.

399
00:25:59,093 --> 00:26:00,162
He volunteered to help.

400
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:01,662
Great work.

401
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:07,532
But it's a bit of a worry...

402
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,632
that Noh Yul Seong is pushed to the corner.

403
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:11,971
It's time for him to struggle to survive.

404
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:14,642
No. I'm worried that he might target you.

405
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:18,882
(Noh Yul Seong)

406
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:21,353
I'll be careful.

407
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:41,972
I knew you would come out right away.

408
00:26:42,273 --> 00:26:43,402
What is your condition?

409
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:47,772
What do you want in exchange...

410
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:48,843
for telling me how my mom died?

411
00:26:50,343 --> 00:26:51,412
Let me ask you something.

412
00:26:52,382 --> 00:26:54,583
Did you come into my house with an intention?

413
00:26:57,553 --> 00:26:59,182
You must not be that busy,

414
00:26:59,882 --> 00:27:00,992
seeing you ask that kind of question.

415
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,293
So this is what betrayal feels like.

416
00:27:11,303 --> 00:27:14,632
It must have been hard for you to leave me alone.

417
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:22,343
What are you doing with me?

418
00:29:41,353 --> 00:29:43,712
Gosh. That must hurt.

419
00:29:44,922 --> 00:29:46,523
It feels uncomfortable, doesn't it?

420
00:29:58,603 --> 00:29:59,632
Are you okay?

421
00:30:01,303 --> 00:30:04,502
Beg me. Beg me to save you.

422
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,141
Do you even have the guts to save me?

423
00:30:06,142 --> 00:30:07,472
Your lips are still alive.

424
00:30:17,113 --> 00:30:18,882
You killed my mom, right?

425
00:30:20,182 --> 00:30:21,753
Do you have evidence that I pushed her?

426
00:30:28,432 --> 00:30:29,593
So you did push her.

427
00:30:31,232 --> 00:30:32,232
How...

428
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:35,432
How could you do that?

429
00:30:35,503 --> 00:30:38,003
My mom was so nice to you!

430
00:30:38,142 --> 00:30:39,873
Hey, she was nice?

431
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:42,412
She was nice to me?

432
00:30:42,513 --> 00:30:45,613
Would someone nice come up to me and threaten me?

433
00:30:45,942 --> 00:30:49,013
Would someone nice threaten to do something if I don't...

434
00:30:49,553 --> 00:30:51,482
get her daughter out of jail?

435
00:30:52,023 --> 00:30:53,652
Did my mom go to you?

436
00:30:56,523 --> 00:30:57,593
Here.

437
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:04,802
"Chayul's bribe ledger is fake and I made it."

438
00:31:04,803 --> 00:31:07,972
"I didn't think things would get this big. I apologize."

439
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:10,573
Let's leave a voice recording.

440
00:31:13,843 --> 00:31:15,472
How did you push my mom?

441
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,312
Again. "The bribe ledge is fake."

442
00:31:19,313 --> 00:31:20,613
Start the confession.

443
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:24,622
Why did you push my mom?

444
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:27,152
What do you mean I pushed her? Gosh.

445
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:31,763
She got in the car. And she went up the factory.

446
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:34,892
What happened after that?

447
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:37,232
I didn't do anything wrong.

448
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,363
I didn't do anything wrong.

449
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:41,103
You murderer.

450
00:31:44,773 --> 00:31:46,972
Murderer? Are you insane?

451
00:31:50,472 --> 00:31:51,583
I said it wasn't me.

452
00:31:52,382 --> 00:31:56,651
If someone says something, you should learn how to listen.

453
00:31:56,652 --> 00:31:59,652
Why doesn't anyone around know how to listen?

454
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:11,833
My goodness.

455
00:32:16,132 --> 00:32:18,442
Sa Ra, what's this?

456
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:22,742
You've become a bugging expert,

457
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,482
Kim Sa Ra.

458
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:35,523
(Noh Yul Seong)

459
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,023
I'll be careful.

460
00:32:44,063 --> 00:32:47,503
He has his right and left arm cut off along with his back.

461
00:32:47,972 --> 00:32:49,603
I'm the only one he can trust.

462
00:32:52,073 --> 00:32:54,043
If he makes me the one who made up the ledger,

463
00:32:54,513 --> 00:32:56,343
he can find a way out.

464
00:32:58,682 --> 00:33:00,442
But Noh Yul Seong...

465
00:33:01,553 --> 00:33:03,053
is the only solution left for me as well.

466
00:33:03,753 --> 00:33:06,422
There are no witnesses or any evidence of my mom's murder.

467
00:33:08,192 --> 00:33:09,823
I need his confession.

468
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:13,263
You're going to get it from him on your own?

469
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,392
He will try to make a deal with me.

470
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:17,833
That's my chance.

471
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:22,533
Okay. Let's give it a try.

472
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:26,642
I'll be careful.

473
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,142
You're going to be with me.

474
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,322
It's not working. She must've got caught.

475
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:43,192
What do we do? We haven't gotten anything yet.

476
00:33:46,362 --> 00:33:47,362
Let's enter.

477
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:28,503
What's wrong?

478
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:31,273
Stay still.

479
00:34:43,753 --> 00:34:45,652
It seems like he prepared a container.

480
00:34:45,653 --> 00:34:47,322
Yongseong Port Container Yard.

481
00:34:50,023 --> 00:34:51,563
I'll try to buy time as much as possible.

482
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:05,673
Gosh, this is so annoying.

483
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:12,412
Hey.

484
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:15,912
Do you think you'll find a way out if you bust the tire?

485
00:35:16,383 --> 00:35:17,412
Get out.

486
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:26,662
Get out now.

487
00:35:40,842 --> 00:35:42,173
The voice recorder is here!

488
00:35:51,322 --> 00:35:52,952
What do we do?

489
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:54,883
Do you want some of this?

490
00:36:55,753 --> 00:36:56,753
You look cold.

491
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:01,623
I heard this is bound for Senegal.

492
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,423
You can't quite imagine, can you?

493
00:37:04,193 --> 00:37:05,861
If this closes up and gets loaded on the ship,

494
00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:09,063
it will take around two months to get there.

495
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:10,792
Don't worry too much.

496
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:14,201
I will ask them to bury you in a field...

497
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:15,702
with lots of sunshine.

498
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:25,842
It's cold.

499
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:34,722
I really loved you.

500
00:37:35,722 --> 00:37:36,822
That was why I married you.

501
00:37:37,123 --> 00:37:38,162
Love?

502
00:37:39,262 --> 00:37:40,362
My foot.

503
00:37:41,262 --> 00:37:43,733
Marriage is like a closet for you.

504
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,233
You choose someone to wear or take off.

505
00:37:46,762 --> 00:37:48,432
Your wives are the clothes hanging there.

506
00:37:48,972 --> 00:37:51,471
Out of them, Kim Sa Ra was my favourite.

507
00:37:51,472 --> 00:37:53,142
You were the one to refuse to be that.

508
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:55,412
Hold on.

509
00:37:57,043 --> 00:37:58,043
Hold on.

510
00:37:59,883 --> 00:38:01,112
The important thing...

511
00:38:02,383 --> 00:38:04,083
is that you have five minutes left.

512
00:38:04,822 --> 00:38:05,952
What does that mean?

513
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:08,653
It's 10:25pm.

514
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:10,591
That container will close up...

515
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:12,862
and loading starts at 10:30pm.

516
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,242
You two should go that way.

517
00:38:31,412 --> 00:38:32,841
- I'll go this way. - Okay.

518
00:38:32,842 --> 00:38:34,182
- I'll go that way. - Okay.

519
00:38:38,623 --> 00:38:40,623
(5 minutes)

520
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:44,662
All right.

521
00:38:48,063 --> 00:38:49,463
What is this? I didn't stop the recording.

522
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:56,633
Let's try with the voice recording once again.

523
00:38:57,133 --> 00:38:58,502
A confession...

524
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,342
that you made the ledger up.

525
00:39:14,123 --> 00:39:15,123
It's cold, isn't it?

526
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:28,673
Right. You don't want to die, do you?

527
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,333
Sa Ra, we're not strangers to each other.

528
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,443
Let's do each other a favour.

529
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:41,753
Nothing will change even if you are found innocent of bribery.

530
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:45,782
Secretary Baek has gone to the prosecution.

531
00:39:48,623 --> 00:39:50,153
What have you done with him?

532
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,672
Where are you?

533
00:40:02,673 --> 00:40:04,873
I'm sorry, sir.

534
00:40:06,043 --> 00:40:08,943
I will get punished only for the things I have done.

535
00:40:10,043 --> 00:40:11,912
Hello? Hey!

536
00:40:13,142 --> 00:40:15,282
This stupid jerk.

537
00:40:19,452 --> 00:40:21,692
Sa Ra, do you not care about your life?

538
00:40:21,693 --> 00:40:23,752
You're kicking away your opportunity to live.

539
00:40:23,753 --> 00:40:25,563
Now, your crime against my mother...

540
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:27,321
will be revealed to the world.

541
00:40:27,322 --> 00:40:29,332
That's just him making those claims anyway.

542
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:30,792
This is what's important.

543
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:32,432
(5 minutes)

544
00:40:35,173 --> 00:40:36,633
This container will close up soon.

545
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:57,023
This won't work. I should just get going.

546
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:02,432
You'll agree to do this, I suppose. Here.

547
00:41:04,432 --> 00:41:05,931
Say your last words to Seo Yun.

548
00:41:05,932 --> 00:41:07,333
I'll let him listen to it once he gets older.

549
00:41:09,673 --> 00:41:11,603
(General)

550
00:41:13,443 --> 00:41:14,472
Seo Yun.

551
00:41:15,313 --> 00:41:17,273
The one who pushed your grandmother was your dad.

552
00:41:17,443 --> 00:41:19,342
How many times do I have to tell you it wasn't me?

553
00:41:32,362 --> 00:41:33,662
How much time do I have left?

554
00:41:35,633 --> 00:41:36,662
Now you're curious about that?

555
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:38,262
Feeling scared now?

556
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:40,861
(5 minutes)

557
00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:42,402
There's less than two minutes left.

558
00:41:42,403 --> 00:41:44,532
You said it'd be over once that door closes.

559
00:41:44,742 --> 00:41:46,241
So tell me.

560
00:41:46,242 --> 00:41:47,972
Tell me how my mom died...

561
00:41:48,713 --> 00:41:49,873
before I die.

562
00:41:51,072 --> 00:41:52,112
Did you...

563
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,952
try to kill my mom from the start?

564
00:41:57,653 --> 00:41:58,653
Did you push her?

565
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:01,293
(5 minutes)

566
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:07,023
I did push her.

567
00:42:07,623 --> 00:42:08,862
It was me.

568
00:42:09,932 --> 00:42:12,733
I did push her, but it wasn't on purpose. It was a mistake.

569
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:14,563
Are you happy now?

570
00:42:16,103 --> 00:42:19,472
It was a mistake so I had no intention to kill her.

571
00:42:21,173 --> 00:42:23,213
So it was you who killed my mom.

572
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:28,052
You were the one who pushed her.

573
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:32,652
You made her fall but didn't care to look.

574
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:33,822
You just let her die.

575
00:42:36,193 --> 00:42:38,693
You're a murderer for just letting her die like that.

576
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:42,032
This is why I can't let you live.

577
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:48,032
I wish...

578
00:42:49,202 --> 00:42:51,903
that Seo Yun doesn't become a piece of trash like you.

579
00:42:54,713 --> 00:42:55,742
Please tell him that.

580
00:42:57,612 --> 00:42:58,642
Fine.

581
00:43:10,052 --> 00:43:11,052
Sa Ra.

582
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:16,063
It's really time to say goodbye.

583
00:43:20,503 --> 00:43:21,532
Right.

584
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,912
That is my last gift for you.

585
00:43:34,182 --> 00:43:36,912
You can untie it yourself and leave comfortably.

586
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,269
Wait!

587
00:45:09,909 --> 00:45:10,909
Stop!

588
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,809
Stop!

589
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:22,150
Kim Sa Ra!

590
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,880
We should be together...

591
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:57,209
until the end.

592
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,289
Kim Sa Ra.

593
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,829
Sa Ra, wake up.

594
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,539
Are you okay? Can you see me?

595
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,950
Here. Be careful.

596
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,709
I was scared to death.

597
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,110
What?

598
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,309
I thought you weren't coming this time.

599
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:16,590
Why does your heartbeat sound so desperate?

600
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:19,400
You make me worried and feel sorry.

601
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:27,240
I'm glad...

602
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,539
that you're worried.

603
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:16,019
Where are you going?

604
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,150
You need to see me.

605
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:06,900
A moment, please.

606
00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:10,070
It's over.

607
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:11,909
Admit it.

608
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,780
What's over and admit what?

609
00:50:15,409 --> 00:50:16,709
What did I do wrong?

610
00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:37,329
What did I...

611
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,340
What are you doing?

612
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:47,510
Why didn't you turn off the recordings?

613
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:53,619
I did push her,

614
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,689
but it wasn't on purpose. It was a mistake.

615
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,590
This is the essence of confession.

616
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:01,929
Kim Sa Ra. You seriously...

617
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:02,990
What's over, you asked?

618
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:08,499
You, like a water flea, being unable to escape.

619
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:11,938
You receiving punishment for the sins you committed.

620
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:13,200
Especially, you asking for forgiveness...

621
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,110
to my mother until you die.

622
00:51:18,479 --> 00:51:20,880
Stay healthy while you're locked up in prison for a long time.

623
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,909
Eventually, even someone like you...

624
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,519
would be able to live like a human.

625
00:51:29,689 --> 00:51:31,389
I wish you could.

626
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:37,659
Come here, you jerk. Hey.

627
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:40,199
Let me go. I have something to say.

628
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,970
Do you think this is the end?

629
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,170
I'll kill all of you!

630
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:45,639
Let me go!

631
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,099
I'll walk myself! Let go!

632
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,079
Thanks for your effort.

633
00:52:01,849 --> 00:52:04,889
Ms. Kim, your kick was amazing.

634
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:08,989
I didn't kick him properly as I wasn't feeling well.

635
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:11,800
What are you talking about? It was awesome. You're the best!

636
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:33,248
(The Late Park Jeong Suk)

637
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:34,819
Do you remember your grandma?

638
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,820
Yes, she said I was kind, and that's why she liked me.

639
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,059
She said I resembled you.

640
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:47,459
Mom, people say that Seo Yun is an exact duplicate of me.

641
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:53,340
Please take care of my son from there.

642
00:52:54,269 --> 00:52:55,969
(Birth: October 11, 1959, Death: October 31, 2022)

643
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:58,610
Please take care your daughter...

644
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,309
and grandson together.

645
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:03,949
Hello. You're my mother's friend.

646
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:05,320
Yes, that's right.

647
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,990
Seo Yun, how are you doing?

648
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:10,689
Fist bump.

649
00:53:12,459 --> 00:53:14,658
(The Late Park Jeong Suk)

650
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:16,859
(Birth: October 11, 1959, Death: October 31, 2022)

651
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,130
I'm the prosecutor whom you came...

652
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,300
to see you with a memo.

653
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:23,869
This is what I look like.

654
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,740
I'm sorry for...

655
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,939
recognizing you too late and for coming to see you...

656
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,578
too late.

657
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:35,709
(The Late Park Jeong Suk)

658
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:40,680
I'll repay the debt to your daughter and grandson twice over.

659
00:53:42,249 --> 00:53:43,849
How will you repay?

660
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,889
Seo Yun.

661
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,300
Let's go.

662
00:54:04,939 --> 00:54:05,979
Maybe like this?

663
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:24,189
(A few months later)

664
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,470
The second floor has been vacant for too long.

665
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:36,869
Should I go back there?

666
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:38,470
How about your current law firm?

667
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:40,109
You joined them recently.

668
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,880
My contract will end in a year.

669
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,749
How can I wait until then?

670
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:50,349
I know very well how you feel.

671
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:53,360
I know just how hard it is...

672
00:54:53,959 --> 00:54:55,729
to wait endlessly.

673
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,869
How about this one?

674
00:55:02,729 --> 00:55:03,729
No.

675
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,800
No?

676
00:55:06,499 --> 00:55:09,209
Wait. Then, how about that?

677
00:55:10,709 --> 00:55:11,979
Not really.

678
00:55:13,709 --> 00:55:14,709
How about that?

679
00:55:15,909 --> 00:55:17,348
It's pretty.

680
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:18,409
- Right? - Yes.

681
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,050
Can we see that, please?

682
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:24,519
How does it look?

683
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,518
It's pretty. Do you like it?

684
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:27,659
Very much.

685
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:28,760
Okay.

686
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:31,229
We'll get these.

687
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:37,768
Seo Yun, today is an important day.

688
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:39,899
Can you congratulate them as promised?

689
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:41,768
Of course, I can do it!

690
00:55:41,769 --> 00:55:42,970
Thank you, son.

691
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:45,279
Have a good day at school. See you later.

692
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,010
See you later.

693
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:49,880
Seo Yun!

694
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,219
I love you, son.

695
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,849
I love you too, Mom.

696
00:55:55,889 --> 00:55:57,150
See you later.

697
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,990
- Hello. - Seo Yun, come here quick!

698
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:07,099
Ms. Kim, your makeup reservation is at 12pm.

699

(Kim Young A)

703
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:30,450
For goodness' sake.

704
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,260
This is difficult.

705
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:38,130
Rich woman, you're amazing!

706
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:42,130
Is this too much?

707
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,269
The fatter, the better.

708
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:45,699
Especially, for cash envelopes.

709
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,269
- You're right. - Yes.

710
00:56:47,499 --> 00:56:49,740
Is it my fault for divorcing and earning a lot of money?

711
00:56:49,909 --> 00:56:51,039
She's just lucky.

712
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:53,038
- It's great for her. - Bravo.

713
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:55,209
- She'll faint in happiness. - Faint, for sure.

714
00:56:55,709 --> 00:56:56,849
I should go to that side.

715
00:56:58,309 --> 00:56:59,518

00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:01,420
(Monetary gift)

717
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,430
He's so cute. He takes after his mother.

718
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,939
The groom, Kwon Dae Gi...

719
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,079
and the bride, Kang Bom...

720
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,409
will need a big round of applause.

721
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:50,630
I invited them.

722
00:57:50,829 --> 00:57:52,369
What? Why?

723
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:53,740
Because you're mine now.

724
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,539
I'll make sure to make a point in front of your exes.

725
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:08,680
Next, we will have Kim Sa Ra, who is both the senior...

726
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:11,590
and the CEO of the bride and groom...

727
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,889
to begin the officiation.

728
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:23,999
I have...

729
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:28,599
married twice and divorced twice.

730
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:31,970
I am a divorce specialist.

731
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:36,908
So I feel embarrassed...

732
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:39,380
to officiate.

733
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:43,118
But wouldn't I know more...

734
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,559
than people who have never married?

735
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,260
Most definitely.

736
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,559
Marriage is a commitment...

737
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,070
to eat more than 30,000 meals with the partner.

738
00:58:58,999 --> 00:59:03,269
Do you both want to share 30,000 meals together?

739
00:59:05,139 --> 00:59:07,109
I would want to eat three million meals with her!

740
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,110
Me too!

741
00:59:09,709 --> 00:59:10,709
Good.

742
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,978
It's the end of marriage when you...

743
00:59:13,979 --> 00:59:15,050
blame each other.

744
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,819
Are you confident not to cry?

745
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,019
- Yes. - Yes!

746
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,789
- "Yes." - Lastly,

747
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:22,289
are you two...

748
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:25,459
ready to break up?

749
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,900
- Sorry? - Sorry?

750
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:33,170
Dating doesn't become a burden only when it's not for life.

751
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,269
Think the same for marriage.

752
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:38,809
You can end it whenever, and it can end whenever.

753
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:40,880
It's okay if you break up.

754
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,979
It's not the end of the world.

755
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:47,519
That's how you keep some tension in your marriage...

756
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:51,789
and become more forgiving toward each other.

757
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:53,459
- Yes! - Yes.

758
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,099
Next, we will have the exchange...

759
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,530
of rings between the bride and groom.

760
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:36,700
Great work today.

761
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:41,070
I was nervous to death.

762
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,439
I could see that.

763
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:47,209
You were cute.

764
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:52,920
Well...

765
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,979
By the way,

766
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:58,789
until when do I need to wait?

767
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:20,110
If you endure anything three times, you'll be burned out in this era.

768
01:01:20,909 --> 01:01:23,010
What will you do if I burn out?

769
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:29,019
Kim Sa Ra can continue walking...

770
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:30,590
toward her path.

771
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:35,689
I'll follow you in the same direction.

772
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,769
No.

773
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:53,809
What?

774
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,809
I don't want to get married anymore.

775
01:02:02,349 --> 01:02:03,349
Then what?

776
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,389
Let's break up.

777
01:02:06,619 --> 01:02:07,619
What?

778
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,829
Let's break up after living five years together.

779
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,499
If it's a marriage with an expiry date, I'm okay with it.

780
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,130
Is marriage...

781
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,700
- canned food? - That's what I'm saying.

782
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:25,470
The expiry date is on canned foods, but why not for marriage?

783
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:29,209
I have a question.

784
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:32,349
What if I want to continue to be with you?

785
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:36,019
If...

786
01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:40,760
that miracle happens,

787
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:46,860
we can marry again.

788
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:50,130
It'll have another five years of expiry date.

789
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:53,900
Wait, let me think.

790
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,380
Okay, fine.

791
01:03:02,349 --> 01:03:05,209
I have a goal. From today,

792
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:09,650
I'll get ten rings.

793
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:11,990
For you.

794
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,889
Let's become partners after a long time.

795
01:03:44,349 --> 01:03:45,389
A business partner.

796
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:50,289
Not that, but a life partner.

797
01:03:51,189 --> 01:03:52,229
I tricked you.

798
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:58,570
Never mind.

799
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:03,439
I tricked you.

800
01:04:37,869 --> 01:04:39,780
(Queen of Divorce)

801
01:05:03,829 --> 01:05:06,268
The taste of getting stabbed in the back unexpectedly.

802
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,638
Do something!

803
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:10,569
You were like a thorn in my throat for a lifetime.

804
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:12,509
It's completely over for you.

805
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:13,839
Do you destroy families?

806
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,408
You're manipulating an innocent woman. Why are you messing around?

807
01:05:16,409 --> 01:05:17,479
Bring the alimony.

808
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:19,049
Admit your sins too.

809
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:21,650
If it's your request, I can do anything.

810
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:23,220
Please divorce me.

811
01:05:23,221 --> 01:05:25,489
Are you doing this on purpose to avoid paying?

812
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:28,018
If our company goes public, it'll be for Cheonji Dongsan.

813
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:29,259
I'm more confident than anyone else...

814
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,788
that I am the mother of those children.

815
01:05:30,789 --> 01:05:32,859
The dead lady didn't commit suicide.

816
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:35,868
I'm happy if you're happy.

817
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:37,399
I love you too, Mom.

818
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,268
We'll cover your entry log to the casino.

819
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,438
I'm in charge of this case.

820
01:05:41,439 --> 01:05:44,109
I'm reinvestigating Professor Seo's falling incident.

821
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:45,938
I heard you were having a lot of blind dates.

822
01:05:45,939 --> 01:05:47,339
Put me on the list too.

823
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,348
I get furious whenever I see boiling water.

824
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:51,949
I'm not that common-looking.

825
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:54,219
I'm upset. Upset like a dog.

826
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,389
I have pride and money. I'm rich enough to pay for this.

827
01:05:56,849 --> 01:05:58,719
Don't forget that there are parents...

828
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,658
who even eat their own offspring.

829
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:03,589
I just bite anyone...

830
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:04,629
who shows their teeth.

831
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:05,998
What could happen if you move unnecessarily?

832
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:07,728
You'll have to stay on your toes.

833
01:06:07,729 --> 01:06:10,529
We have a list of surprises that will make you come to us...

834
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:11,530
in shock.

835
01:06:11,531 --> 01:06:13,038
Is there a failure in marriage?

836
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:14,739
No, our solution isn't over yet.

837
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:16,170
Shall we see who'll win this time?

838
01:06:16,269 --> 01:06:17,609
Let's start.

839
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:18,768
The solution for this time is...

840
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:20,110
(Thank you for watching Queen of Divorce.)
