(Queen of Divorce)

5
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,879
No way. Is this what I think it is?

6
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,050
Yes. That's it. He was the one behind it.

7
00:00:55,349 --> 00:00:57,049
So he had the highest marks from the training institute?

8
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,988
He did. Not only does he have an impressive resume,

9
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:00,220
but he is also impressively bold.

10
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:10,929
Hey.

11
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,339
Hey. Prosecutor Dong.

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,070
Look who it is. It's a loach.

13
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,609
You managed to weasel your way out of the recent case.

14
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:19,739
Gosh.

15
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,379
By the way, I don't think...

16
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,950
this can be your designated parking spot.

17
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,479
Look at you, acting bossy. No wonder why the other prosecutors...

18
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,680
kicked you out. Seriously.

19
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:33,760
I heard you were moving far away.

20
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,460
Put it toward your gas.

21
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:58,380
Gosh.

22
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,980
Oh, my.

23
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,089
You know what? He sure knows when to go all out...

24
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,358
even if he has to pay a fine.

25
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:10,930
He did this when he knew he would end up paying a 5,000-dollar fine.

26
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:13,599
- Gosh. This is crazy.
- Right?

27
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
If I were a woman, I would have asked for his number.

28
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,070
Gosh. They're made for each other.

29
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,339
- With me?
- No way!

30
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,850
(Episode 3)

31
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,329
Gosh, don't worry about me.

32
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,070
The rest of the team welcomed me with open arms.

33
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:55,739
So I'll be able to handle your cold treatment toward me.

34
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,940
You could have gotten a better job.

35
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,648
Well, are you under the impression that I chose to work here...

36
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:07,980
for you?

37
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,679
Please don't get the wrong idea.

38
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:14,519
Given our history, we shouldn't be colleagues.

39
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:20,030
Are you still hung up on me?

40
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:27,440
If not, why do you care?

41
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:30,470
I'll give it three months.

42
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,839
If I still make you feel uncomfortable by then,

43
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,209
I'll leave.

44
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:39,649
Three months.

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,119
Okay. That's a deal.

46
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,249
You did bring way too much stuff...

47
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,019
given you'll be here only for three months.

48
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,230
Right.

49
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,500
You still haven't shaken my hand yet.

50
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,780
Sure. Welcome.

51
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:12,450
It's our first time working together.

52
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,250
I look forward to working with you.

53
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,709
- Ms. Kim.
- What is it?

54
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,779
I was looking into Mr. Dong.

55
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,620
I think your friend posted this a long time ago.

56
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,860
Did other people see this?

57
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,690
Do you want me to get rid of this?

58
00:04:59,829 --> 00:05:02,859
Gosh. What am I going to do with this?

59
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,930
Isn't it simple?

60
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,769
I have never seen this picture before.

61
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,700
Thank you.

62
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,240
- Could you get rid of it quickly?
- Sure.

63
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:12,839
Why am I here? Gosh. I can't remember a thing.

64
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:45,839
I look forward to working with you.

65
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,310
What was that?

66
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,260
Hey.

67
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,589
All right, Mr. Dong. Here's the Welcome Quiz.

68
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,130
Guess his nickname. It ends with D.

69
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,669
- Legend.
- Hey.

70
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,228
- No.
- David.

71
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:15,200
- David.
- Wrong.

72
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,699
Head. Card. Fund.

73
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,639
Keyboard. Code. Cloud. They are all wrong.

74
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,379
- Any guess, Ms. Kim?
- Shepherd.

75
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,649
- What?
- How did you know?

76
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,478
You know, look at his face.

77
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:29,479
He sort of resembles a dog. Don't you see the resemblance?

78
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:32,089
- Pardon?
- A dog?

79
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,518
I see. He's like a dog.

80
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,158
He doesn't let go once he gets his teeth into something.

81
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:38,029
We welcome you and your tenacity, Mr. Dong. Clap, everyone.

82
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:40,930
Okay.

83
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:44,828
Gosh. Did you already finish going through that?

84
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:46,999
Well, yes.

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,070
Gosh.

86
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,239
By the way, is it allowed...

87
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,169
for a wife to file a divorce lawsuit just because her husband was...

88
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,940
in a sexual assault scandal?

89
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,010
Well, is there a law that says she can't?

90
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:00,180
If the husband were to win the trial,

91
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,279
getting a divorce will be difficult.

92
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,389
Our client, Ms. Lee Joo Won, is serious about getting a divorce.

93
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,389
That's all we need to move forward.

94
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,329
How can you help her get a divorce just because she's serious about it?

95
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,229
We can.

96
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,440
Who gets to judge if she's serious about it...

97
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:24,570
- or not?
- We do.

98
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:26,469
What?

99
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,278
- All right. Let's begin.
- Yes, ma'am.

100
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,379
Hold on.

101
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,649
You should at least tell me how you're going to...

102
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,279
judge that.

103
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,489
Well, let me brief you on how we do things...

104
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,519
The first step is...

105
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,690
studying the client.

106
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:43,060
I feel naked.

107
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,288
Right in the middle of an intersection.

108
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:49,228
I can't make my daughter suffer through this any longer.

109
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:52,929
Next, we learn about the spouse we have to bring down.

110
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,940
(JBC entry log)

111
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:56,439
Once we finish studying both spouses,

112
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,038
we find clues,

113
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,170
proving the other spouse as the guilty party.

114
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,409
We do it very efficiently.

115
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,050
Hello.

116
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:14,620
You're showing up now after ghosting me a year ago?

117
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,429
- And what?
- Come on, sweetie. Help me out.

118
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,360
I heard that you led the investigative coverage.

119
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:21,360
Gosh.

120
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,039
You're getting married?

121
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,070
How could you do that to me?

122
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,479
- What?
- Hey.

123
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:36,638
- Have you gone mad?
- Please I'm begging you.

124
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,950
Help me out just this once.

125
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:41,450
I knew it.

126

(Kim Ji Eu, 25 years old, refused to be interviewed)

128
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,289
Dae Gi. From whom did you get this kind of inside information?

129
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,929
- From his ex or the one before her.
- The one before her?

130
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,200
This time, it was from my ex from two relationships ago.

131
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,169
From two relationships ago?

132
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,639
My motto is give and take.

133
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,969
Well, I loved all of my exes.

134
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,109
But this guy is something else. Gosh.

135
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:08,140
Example One. He sent pictures every night.

136
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,679
Example Two.

137
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,810
He text-bombed this girl to ride a bicycle every weekend.

138
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:13,478
Example Three.

139
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,478
He asked to meet a girl alone at the cafe in front of the office.

140
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:16,718
Examples 4 and 5...

141
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:17,748
(He verbally abused her.)

142
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:19,149
This is the feedback of the anonymous survey...

143
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,559
JBC conducted with female freelancers.

144
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,389
It's a never-ending list of his improper behaviors.

145
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,159
Wait. Did Ms. Lee know about this?

146
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,200
No.

147
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:30,429
Then to use that as grounds to demand a divorce...

148
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,070
Of course, it's not enough.

149
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,670
Let's put eyes on him.

150
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,299
To win this case, we must find evidence...

151
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,738
that he's not just regular trash,

152
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:39,170
but trash that cannot even be recycled.

153
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,839
- Got it?
- Yes, ma'am.

154

Hey, you're here.

161
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,629
Gosh. You turned down a lot of nice offers. Why...

162
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,998
I don't understand your decision unless a girl you fell in love...

164
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,269
You're the only one I fell in love at first sight.

165
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,708
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

Have you heard anything about his divorce?

170
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:22,219
Why do you ask?

171
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,479
Does his divorce have to do with this case?

172
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,119

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,129
The wife hired Lawyer Kim.

182
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,930
- Who?
- The former lawyer, Kim Sa Ra.

183
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,199
What are you talking about? She can't represent clients.

184
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,869
She has a separate legal advisor.

185
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,468
His name is Dong Gi Jun.

186
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:18,869
Dong Gi Jun? The former prosecutor?

187
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:20,839
They're working together?

188
00:11:22,109 --> 00:11:23,579
Yes. That's right.

189
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,719
Okay. Bring your A game and handle the case.

190
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:30,020
Don't worry, sir.

191
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,290
I know how Ms. Kim works.

192
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,629
No, I'm talking about Mr. Dong.

193
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,959
- Mr. Dong?
- Yes.

194
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,129
Yes, sir.

195
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,869

Here's the next news.

229
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,569
The former anchor, Jang Jae Gook,

230
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,769
was assaulted in his private office in the afternoon yesterday.

231
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,640
He was found unconscious and transported to the hospital.

232
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,078
Some witnesses said they saw his wife at the scene.

233
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,378
But there's no record of his wife making a report to the police.

234

- Sir. Head to Yeongsu-dong...
- The police are investigating now.

240
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,859
There won't be any divorce if Ms. Lee doesn't have an alibi.

241

You're telling me the truth, correct?

242
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:55,910
Yes.

243
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,509

Did you go there?

252
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:26,969
No.

253
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,979
Then why did people see you there?

254
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,150
Did you go to the hospital to see your husband?

255

He's still unconscious. I'll visit him after this meeting.

257

Are you suspecting me?

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,670
I'm saying other people will.

261
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,968
Especially when they find out you're preparing to divorce him.

262
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:58,009
I want to get away from him,

263
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,870

I won't be able to make it too.

362
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:27,459
Let's meet up again in the morning.

363
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:47,708
(Kim Sa Ra)

364
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:48,819
(Missed call)

365
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,059
Let's have some music on.

366
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,330
Yes, Ms. Kim?

367
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:01,029
You said you were attending a reunion tonight, right?

368
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,630
Where and what time is it held?

369
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,630
It starts at 7pm.

370
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,130
- Why do you ask?
- Thanks.

371
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,940
Hello?

372
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,249
Why won't you answer my calls?

373
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,489
That way, you'll come looking for me.

374
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,420
What are you doing right now?

375
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,160
I heard you met Seo Yun.

376
00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:39,670
My mother found out.

377
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:41,969
Right now,

378
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:46,670
she's making a fuss to send Seo Yun abroad.

379
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:49,779
So?

380
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,479
You know Anchor Jang is our client, right?

381
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,650
Step away from this case.

382
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:58,650
Then, I'll find a way to talk things out with my mother.

383
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,620
How do you keep showing your worst every time I see you?

384
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,558
You're making deals with Seo Yun now?

385
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:09,199
By that way, why are you always with Dong Gi Jun?

386
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,630
Why do you care?

387
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:13,930
You're Seo Yun's mom.

388
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,008
How are you seeing the guy you met before getting married?

389
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:19,369
Don't you feel ashamed to see your son?

390
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,940
- Hey! You just...
- CEO Noh Yul Seong?

391
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,249
It's been a while.

392
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,049
Are you okay, Ms. Kim?

393
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:32,650
You should've just walked away.

394
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,360
Why butt in to a married couple's business?

395
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:38,529
Oh, right.

396
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:43,559
But aren't you two divorced?

397
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,830
To my knowledge, you two are much further apart than us two.

398
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:53,769
"Us two?"

399
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,479
You left your car, right?

400
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,979
I'll grab you a cab.

401
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:01,920
No matter where you hide Seo Yun, I'll find him.

402
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,690
I will make sure to watch Seo Yun grow.

403
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,440
Just drop me off by the main entrance.

404
00:27:23,069 --> 00:27:24,239
I can just take a cab.

405
00:27:34,479 --> 00:27:35,549
Thank you.

406
00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:25,799
- Get in.
- Are you not going back?

407
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,400
I'm here to eat.

408
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:29,640
I don't need to go if you're buying.

409
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:39,279
Are there more people coming?

410
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,179
You two are my saviors.

411
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,818
You saved me.

412
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:46,950
And you were the one that destroyed my ex.

413
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,459
It's so lovely to see you two together.

414
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,059
Wasn't I right? Isn't he such a great guy?

415
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:59,370
- He is.
- I told you.

416
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,998
Isn't Sa Ra amazing too?

417
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:03,869
- I was right, wasn't I?
- I was surprised.

418
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:06,370
Solution is under the hands of you two.

419
00:29:06,469 --> 00:29:08,308
- It's a pleasure to work with you.
- Right.

420
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:10,509
Sa Ra and Gi Jun. The Sa-Gi Couple.

421
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,049
Thank you for the food.

422
00:29:20,549 --> 00:29:22,559
I meant it.

423
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:24,089
I was surprised.

424
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,759
No, I am continuing to get surprised.

425
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,930
I'm seeing your new sides too.

426
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,799
Why did you start this job?

427
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,870
I wanted to save people who are suffering from their married lives.

428
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,748
There are a lot of people who are suffering...

429
00:29:46,749 --> 00:29:48,749
because they don't know how to free themselves.

430
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:54,690
Don't you have any dreams for yourself?

431
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,160
Me?

432
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,299
That'll be sending away that person we saw earlier.

433
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,200
Far away into space.

434
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,340
Deep into the fiery pit.

435
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,518
Didn't you ask to have dinner to find out...

436
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:24,849
how I'm doing with Noh Yul Seong?

437
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,590
Yes. What? Oh, well...

438
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,959
Have you been learning how to read minds?

439
00:30:34,229 --> 00:30:37,600
That way, I can bring my child back.

440
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,069
We'll find a way.

441
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,739
A way to make that dream come true.

442
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:50,979
Why would you help me?

443
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,709
Exactly. Why would I?

444
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,749
Well, it'll be out of teamwork?

445
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,450
Comradeship?

446
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:05,329
- Let's drink up.
- My glass is almost empty.

447
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,390
Got it.

448
00:31:14,229 --> 00:31:16,239
Here. Cheers.

449
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,410
Goodness.

450
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,180
What's wrong? Did you forget something?

451
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:26,409
Where's my phone?

452
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,910
Pass it here.

453
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:34,319
What's this?

454
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,959
(Sa-Gi Couple's 787 days together, Feeling happy, you lovebirds?)

455
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:42,860
What is it?

456
00:31:44,459 --> 00:31:45,529
What's wrong?

457
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,268
- What's wrong?
- Gosh.

458
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:51,269
Come on.

459
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:57,979
So this is the Sa-Gi Couple.

460
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:04,449
Bom found this post.

461
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:05,549
I told her to keep it a secret.

462
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,950
I see.

463
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,159
If I were to throw this away in the office,

464
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,389
the cleaning lady might see it.

465
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,058
I brought it with me to throw it away at home.

466
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,130
I didn't say anything.

467
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,870
Put it back in.

468
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,049
Did you even think of me?

469
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,380
I told you earlier that I was busy with life.

470
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:39,519
No matter how busy you are with life,

471
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,459
there's always time to miss someone.

472
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,690
That's how thinking works.

473
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,259
It would be a lie to say I didn't think about you at all.

474
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,870
- But, that's...
- Done.

475
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,469
To say that you thought about me... You thought...

476
00:32:56,969 --> 00:32:59,269
That's all I need to know. You thought about me?

477
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,539
My gosh.

478
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,640
You thought about me?

479
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,459
(Chayul Law Firm Lawyer...)

480
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:43,920

Why won't you answer my calls?

487
00:34:17,479 --> 00:34:19,988
Hey. I told you to keep things quiet.

488
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,549
Why would you come all the way here?

489
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:22,919
We're in big trouble.

490
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,919
This is under embargo until tomorrow.

491
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,628
Assemblyman Han Joo Hyuk. Your father-in-law!

492
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:28,699
He's in trouble.

493
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,799
He's been linked with illegal solicitation.

494
00:34:31,759 --> 00:34:34,369
This can't be happening at this time.

495
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,799
What will we do?

496
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,710
(Limited approval)

497
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,020
My gosh.

498
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:58,559
You're smiling ear to ear. Stop looking so happy.

00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:18,379
Bring me Lee Joo Won's photos.

502
00:35:18,779 --> 00:35:20,480
There are photos of her before and after marriage, right?

503
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:47,609
Call Ms. Lee to the office.

504
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,790
It was like seeing my own wedding photo.

505
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,489
The bride who feels the weight of the tiara...

506
00:36:03,689 --> 00:36:05,859
like a plate of armor.

507
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,029
I looked just like that.

508
00:36:10,259 --> 00:36:12,330
"Is this marriage a good idea?"

509
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,339
"Will I be able to manage?"

510
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,299
"No. There's nothing I can do now."

511
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,180
This is the face you make...

512
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,480
after around the 99th thought.

513
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:34,219
There's a story behind this marriage, right?

514
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,830
You said you felt his loss.

515
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,399
I just feel like he'll lose.

516
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:53,169
I'm his wife, after all.

517
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,509
I believe what you said could be related to it.

518
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:06,290
The same thing...

519
00:37:07,689 --> 00:37:09,520
happened to me.

520
00:37:10,259 --> 00:37:11,689
Just like Seo Min Hee.

521
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:14,029
It was Jang Jae Gook?

522
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,370
We got married because I got pregnant.

523
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,669
We lived in the same area.

524
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:28,469
I was just invited for a drink.

525
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:31,779
At that moment,

526
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,379
I just thought about the child inside me.

527
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,689
My husband kept clinging on to me as well.

528
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,929
That was when you should have sorted things out!

529
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,589
As soon as you thought things weren't right!

530
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:50,060
But how?

531
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,969
What else could I have done during that moment?

532
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:58,810
I persuaded myself with lies every single day.

533
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,239
"We're a family."

534
00:38:03,509 --> 00:38:06,549
But I'm going insane after this case.

535
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,219
It kept reminding me of those times.

536
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,989
My heart was beating like crazy all day long.

537
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,529
I came here because I couldn't stand it.

538
00:38:24,029 --> 00:38:25,299
Then,

539
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:30,000
the reason you went to meet Seo Min Hee was because...

540
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,310
I would be able to tell...

541
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,580
if she went through the same thing I did.

542
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:44,649
But you revealed Min Hee's texts like that?

543
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:49,520
"A sex offender's daughter."

544
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,628
I didn't want my Soo Ji to be called that.

545
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:55,560
I was out of my mind.

546
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,669
I rather wanted to believe it was an affair.

547
00:39:01,399 --> 00:39:04,200
But now,

548
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:06,609
I deeply regret what I did.

549
00:39:07,069 --> 00:39:11,508
First of all, I will bring up what you went through before marriage.

550
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:13,649
That would be big enough to bring up a divorce.

551
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,620
No. I will keep this a secret to my grave.

552
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,988
You must keep this a secret.

553
00:39:19,989 --> 00:39:21,319
Ms. Lee!

554
00:39:21,549 --> 00:39:22,689
My Soo Ji...

555
00:39:23,689 --> 00:39:27,830
She must never find out how she was born. Never!

556
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,878
It was the 10th at 1pm.

557
00:39:42,879 --> 00:39:46,179
Anchor Jang Jae Gook of JBC got attacked by an assailant...

558
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,979
and became unconscious.

559
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,349
Anchor Jang, who has regained consciousness,

560
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,679
told the police...

561
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,488
that as soon as he opened the door to his office for Ms. Seo,

562
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:56,259
the one who has pressed charges against him for sexual assault...

563
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,758
Anchor Jang, who has regained consciousness,

564
00:40:02,759 --> 00:40:04,430
told the police that as soon as he...

565
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,529
("Anchor Jang Attacked by the Victim of Sexual Assault")

566
00:40:09,739 --> 00:40:11,169
There we go.

567
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:19,950
("Anchor Jang Attacked by the Victim of Sexual Assault")

568
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:23,580
You saw a drone in the news footage?

569
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,819
Drones are restricted from apartment complexes.

570
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:28,120
Those areas.

571
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:31,089
But spotting a drone there...

572
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,959
means that there are people secret filming...

573
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,029
There it is.

574
00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:37,660
It means they're back out.

575
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,398
I was right. The ones who got caught recently...

576
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,238
started moving again in this area.

577
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,239
This way.

578
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:48,509
Prosecutor Dong, would they recognize...

579
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:51,109
No, Lawyer Dong. Would they recognize who you are?

580
00:40:51,609 --> 00:40:53,979
If they try to get away after seeing me,

581
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,080
it's them for sure.

582
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,180
Okay.

583
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,790
This way. Why are you trying to take the lead?

584
00:41:11,029 --> 00:41:12,060
I feel nervous.

585
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,799
Don't be.

586
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,669
Who is it?

587
00:41:21,739 --> 00:41:24,310
I'm here for a gas inspection.

588
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:29,950
How have you been?

589
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:32,489
Hello. Darn it!

590
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,350
Hey!

591
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:37,160
That darn punk.

592
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,669
You punk.

593
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:52,469
Gosh.

594
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,580
Gosh. Why is it so slow?

595
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,549
What are you doing?

596
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:11,759
Darn it.

597
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,700
- Why are you running away?
- Darn it.

598
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:24,270
That punk.

599
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,390
Darn it! I'm sorry.

600
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:44,859
Gosh.

601
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:49,930
I apologize!

602
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,600
Hey, stop right there!

603
00:42:55,669 --> 00:42:56,700
Stop!

604
00:43:00,169 --> 00:43:01,609
Hey, are you okay?

605
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,080
- Are you okay? We're very sorry.
- Hey!

606
00:43:06,379 --> 00:43:08,210
Stop following me!

607
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,950
We're not here for you.

608
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,819
Darn it!

609
00:43:11,919 --> 00:43:14,450
Hey! I'm exhausted.

610
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,899
My goodness.

611
00:43:28,629 --> 00:43:30,140
Just stay still for a while.

612
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,909
Hey, let's talk!

613
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,910
(Blocked)

614
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:36,910
Oh, gosh.

615
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:40,680
We won't get him. Darn it!

616
00:43:44,419 --> 00:43:45,850
(Illegal dumping prohibited)

617
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,620
- Get over here.
- Darn it!

618
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:53,029
Do you wish to die? How dare you?

619
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:02,839
What are you doing?

620
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,480
You're going to get him for good.

621
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,120
It's okay.

622
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,319
Do you wish to run away for the rest of your life?

623
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,120
Give us the drone footage from three days ago.

624
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:27,028
- Why do you want that?
- Don't ask!

625
00:44:27,029 --> 00:44:29,330
Gosh. Stay calm.

626
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,060
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

627
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:38,469
Will we see the rooftop now?

628
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:44,410
All right. Right there.

629
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,278
There! Right there!

630
00:44:48,279 --> 00:44:51,418
Jang Jae Gook testified that the incident occurred at 1pm.

631
00:44:51,419 --> 00:44:53,889
But Lee Joo Won's rooftop footage...

632
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:57,660
starts from 12:50pm to 1:05pm.

633
00:44:57,989 --> 00:44:58,989
Yes!

634
00:44:59,689 --> 00:45:02,129
What a relief. We've proved your alibi.

635
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,829
But things don't end here.

636
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:06,830
Let's take another look.

637
00:45:08,399 --> 00:45:09,770
Look closely here.

638
00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:19,109
What? Seo Min Hee still hasn't gone inside!

639
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,479
But Anchor Jang said he was attacked by Seo Min Hee.

640
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,680
That was a lie.

641
00:45:26,989 --> 00:45:28,919
Was there any sort of attack?

642
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,589
Exactly.

643
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,460
So everything's a lie.

644
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,730
Okay. There's our answer.

645
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:41,230
Jang Jae Gook lied.

646
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,968
Let's make that big fat liar pay.

647
00:45:43,969 --> 00:45:45,040
- Understood!
- Understood!

648
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:47,109
Big fat what?

649
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,180
You've been through so much.

650
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,080
Thank you so much.

651
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:56,520
The footage will be sent to the investigation team.

652
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,519
Lawyer Dong, you're already making a mark.

653
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,918
You can't be this charming.

654
00:46:00,919 --> 00:46:01,950
Aren't I right, Ms. Kim?

655
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,589
Lawyer Dong,

656
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:06,930
you've also gone through a lot.

657
00:46:08,129 --> 00:46:11,200
So we'll be back to solving divorce matters, right?

658
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,569
You should receive the baton.

659
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:25,439
There! A handshake too.

660
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,020
If I give up,

661
00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:36,120
it's only...

662
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,589
Hey, Kim Sa Ra!

663
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,129
Hey, what's going on?

664
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,628
Prosecutor Dong, no. I heard Lawyer Dong is here.

665
00:46:43,629 --> 00:46:44,660
Is this true?

666
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:46,230
I can't believe it.

667
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,029
Are you working in the same office?

668
00:46:49,069 --> 00:46:50,839
- No.
- Then?

669
00:46:59,649 --> 00:47:01,779
Are you guys starting something again?

670
00:47:02,450 --> 00:47:03,749
Tell me!

671
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,918
Did you run all the way here just to ask about that?

672
00:47:05,919 --> 00:47:07,020
Of course.

673
00:47:07,189 --> 00:47:08,749
He's good-looking and has a nice body.

674
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,488
Money? I'm not really sure about that.

675
00:47:10,489 --> 00:47:13,660
Anyway, he's super qualified and single too.

676
00:47:15,259 --> 00:47:18,398
My friend Kim Sa Ra met her ex who's single...

677
00:47:18,399 --> 00:47:20,168
after five years.

678
00:47:20,169 --> 00:47:22,069
So he never got married.

679
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:25,910
What's with that indifferent reaction?

680
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,669
Are you seeing someone?

681
00:47:28,739 --> 00:47:31,439
Anyway, I'm definitely casting my vote for Lawyer Dong.

682
00:47:32,379 --> 00:47:35,149
Did he not ask about why you didn't show up?

683
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,680
Well, he doesn't know.

684
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,289
Gosh, you were totally wasted that night.

685
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:44,719
- With Noh Yul Seong...
- Hey!

686
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:45,819
Oh, gosh.

687
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,449
Are you not coming to get your bridal makeup done?

688
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:10,679
Yul Seong is at the wedding hall.

689
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,480
- You should hurry.
- You're on your way, right?

690
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:14,450
I'm at the airport.

691
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,339
(Meeting Point, West)

692
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,899
I'm in front of Gate 6.

693
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:00,669
I'm waiting here.

694
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,529
(I'm in front of Gate 6. I'm waiting here.)

695
00:49:16,919 --> 00:49:19,489
(Meeting Point, West)

696
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:54,290
Ms. Kim!

697
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,319
It's Chayul Law Firm.

698
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,059
They set things up with a lie.

699
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,659
Chayul met up with Seo Min Hee's lawyer in secret.

700
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,660
With Jang Jae Gook too.

701
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:06,528
- Can we go in?
- Come in.

702
00:50:06,529 --> 00:50:07,968
- Come in.
- I should go home.

703
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:09,399
- This is home.
- This way.

704
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,499
Was that before the assault?

705
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,069
Yes. It sounds super fishy.

706
00:50:20,879 --> 00:50:21,879
Ms. Lee.

707
00:50:22,879 --> 00:50:25,419
Would you like to go for the plan I mentioned earlier?

708
00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:28,120
This plan...

709
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,589
involves joining forces with the foe.

710
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,469
That day, the lawyer asked to see me...

711
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,669
at Anchor Jang's office.

712
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:48,969
It was to settle an agreement.

713
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,980
But it sounded suspicious.

714
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,620
I was making a call to refuse to go in.

715
00:50:56,779 --> 00:50:57,850
It's a relief...

716
00:50:58,450 --> 00:50:59,819
that his alibi was proven wrong.

717
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,149
But...

718
00:51:02,419 --> 00:51:04,620
my lawyer met up with Jang Jae Gook's side?

719
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:06,359
Yes.

720
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,230
Why are you helping me?

721
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,359
There's someone...

722
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,469
who wants to take your side.

723
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:35,750
I was out of my mind.

724
00:51:36,859 --> 00:51:39,020
I apologize.

725
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:41,960
Forget it.

726
00:51:42,629 --> 00:51:43,999
Will acting this way change anything?

727
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,029
I thought this to myself...

728
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:49,270
while seeing my daughter get harassed.

729
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:52,870
"My daughter is getting punished instead of me."

730
00:51:52,969 --> 00:51:55,109
Forget it. Get up.

731
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,520
Why would I side with you?

732
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,419
He...

733
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:13,890
attacked me too.

734
00:52:14,189 --> 00:52:16,660
Just like how he attacked you.

735
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:18,859
That's how we ended up getting married.

736
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,140
And we've come this far.

737
00:52:24,799 --> 00:52:25,899
You've done well...

738
00:52:26,669 --> 00:52:28,210
to make it this far with him.

739
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:30,580
I know you can't forgive me.

740
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,040
- But...
- I can't.

741
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,379
I can't forgive both you and your husband.

742
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,049
Don't forgive her.

743
00:52:39,379 --> 00:52:41,049
This isn't about reconciliation.

744
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,359
This is about winning against Jang Jae Gook.

745
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,029
But it'll be tough for you two...

746
00:52:47,629 --> 00:52:48,830
to fight alone.

747
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,799
This is why I'm suggesting that you two...

748
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,430
join forces.

749
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,039
The assailant fears it the most...

750
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,770
when the victims join forces.

751
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:02,810
There's no way out when the victims speak as one.

752
00:53:07,149 --> 00:53:08,779
Please contact us after much consideration.

753
00:53:09,549 --> 00:53:12,219
And make sure to get a new lawyer even if it isn't us.

754
00:53:20,759 --> 00:53:21,759
Let's go.

755
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:29,430
We'll be off.

756
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:46,418
Hanjoo Party's Han Joo Hyuk has been arrested.

757
00:53:46,419 --> 00:53:47,419
He's the first chairman...

758
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,749
of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee...

759
00:53:48,750 --> 00:53:49,789
to ever get arrested.

760
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:51,359
Assemblyman Han is currently denying...

761
00:53:53,759 --> 00:53:56,459
How can your wife not be of use for at least a year?

762
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,460
My father-in-law...

763
00:53:58,359 --> 00:54:01,569
took a fall before nominations by the party representative.

764
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:03,398
He should've passed the law school law...

765
00:54:03,399 --> 00:54:05,100
before ending up like that.

766
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,509
I might as well just become an assemblyman myself.

767
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:11,938
The party representative and your father-in-law...

768
00:54:11,939 --> 00:54:12,979
are great enemies.

769
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,980
Would he give you a nomination?

770
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:18,080
You told me this before.

771
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,120
You don't look for ways. You make them.

772
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:41,969
The Me Too case looks to be under our hands.

773
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:44,810
You must not surf the web that often.

774
00:54:46,379 --> 00:54:48,810
But we're talking about a divorce.

775
00:54:49,779 --> 00:54:50,850
Exactly.

776
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,620
If we win the Me Too case,

777
00:54:52,779 --> 00:54:55,950
it's obvious how things will pan out with the divorce.

778
00:54:57,890 --> 00:54:58,960
Lawyer Ma.

779
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,988
Are there any reasons for liability...

780
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:03,960
for Anchor Jang to break down a marriage?

781
00:55:05,529 --> 00:55:07,330
Any cases of violence, gambling,

782
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,100
or things like mental weakness.

783
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:17,839
Not at all, sir.

784
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,009
Then why is Lawyer Dong being so stubborn about it?

785
00:55:26,649 --> 00:55:28,689
Jang Jae Gook's shamelessness...

786
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:33,129
which really reminds me of someone.

787
00:55:38,129 --> 00:55:40,600
You should've been a better coach.

788
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,569
That night, I didn't want it to happen.

789
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,710
That night?

790
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:51,710
What are you talking about?

791
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,750
That day 18 years ago.

792
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,060
The moment I couldn't control my body...

793
00:56:08,129 --> 00:56:10,460
as if I was suffering from sleep paralysis.

794
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,569
Really, what nonsense are you spouting now?

795
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,069
Right.

796
00:56:20,069 --> 00:56:21,870
Telling you this now will only make you claim...

797
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:24,939
that I'm making up a story to get a divorce.

798
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:29,980
But what if there's another person who suffered the same thing I did?

799
00:56:39,419 --> 00:56:41,230
People don't believe me.

800
00:56:43,129 --> 00:56:45,759
"She hit on him. She's an adulteress."

801
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,669
I'm everyone's topic of gossip.

802
00:56:51,669 --> 00:56:55,168
But things would be different if more victims went through...

803
00:56:55,169 --> 00:56:56,509
the same experience.

804
00:56:56,609 --> 00:56:58,008
What are you two doing?

805
00:56:58,009 --> 00:57:01,210
We're getting our story straight to testify against you in the trial.

806
00:57:02,310 --> 00:57:04,750
Did he do that to you 18 years ago without your consent?

807
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:05,980
Yes.

808
00:57:06,919 --> 00:57:09,350
It was the same with you, right, Ms. Seo?

809
00:57:10,759 --> 00:57:11,759
Yes.

810
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,290
Are you kidding me?

811
00:57:15,759 --> 00:57:19,029
Honey. Shouldn't you think about Soo Ji?

812
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:22,028
We're a married couple. How can you disclose it publicly?

813
00:57:22,029 --> 00:57:24,799
Why shouldn't I when you were in the wrong?

814
00:57:28,339 --> 00:57:31,580
You two have gone mad, haven't you?

815
00:57:32,439 --> 00:57:35,378
Listen. Since when did we have to get consent...

816
00:57:35,379 --> 00:57:36,949
for doing that?

817
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:38,749
I doubt even judges and prosecutors do that.

818
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,648
And so you didn't either?

819
00:57:40,649 --> 00:57:42,290
No, I didn't!

820
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,160
Consent, my foot.

821
00:57:47,489 --> 00:57:49,059
Can't you tell at a glance?

822
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,859
A guy who asks for consent is a total fool.

823
00:58:02,669 --> 00:58:05,709
What do you think will happen...

824
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:09,049
if Ms. Lee gives testimony in Ms. Seo's trial?

825
00:58:11,549 --> 00:58:13,790
(Uncontested Divorce Agreement)

826
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:16,890
It's in the condition she doesn't testify in court.

827
00:58:29,899 --> 00:58:33,569
There won't be any divorce by mutual agreement...

828
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,969
the moment that goes public.

829
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,080
All right.

830
00:58:55,529 --> 00:58:58,230
Noh Yul Seong has completely lost his temper.

831
00:58:59,129 --> 00:59:00,199
You kicked his butt.

832
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,529
But that's not enough.

833
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,839
He must be sent to the pen.

834
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:05,739
"Pen?"

835
00:59:06,739 --> 00:59:07,939
There's this thing.

836
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:12,879
By the way, don't drop the honorifics in the office.

837
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,879
Got it, Sa Ra.

838
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:22,290
We're in the elevator right now, not the office.

839
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,100
- Hey. You're ready, right?
- Yes.

840
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,600
We'll be there in 30 minutes.

841
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,870
Sa Ra. Wait for me.

842
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:40,810
Sa Ra?

843
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,149
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

844
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:53,850
What is there to examine to make me come and go?

845
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,710
(To Reporter Heo Eun Young: We should grab a meal together.)

846
01:00:36,489 --> 01:00:38,259
Weren't we going to the director's office?

847
01:00:39,029 --> 01:00:41,000
What? Who are you?

848
01:00:43,669 --> 01:00:46,069
Who are you two? What are you doing?

849
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,648
Good grief. What's this?

850
01:00:57,649 --> 01:00:59,520
Are you the warriors of Earth or something?

851
01:01:00,049 --> 01:01:02,219
Didn't you agree to the divorce terms?

852
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,259
So what now?

853
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:08,060
We're on the same side.

854
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,100
What?

855
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:14,099
Even if Ms. Seo wins the Me Too trial,

856
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,140
her suffering won't end if she loses in the public opinion trial.

857
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:20,169
As such, we have decided to work together...

858
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:22,338
to show people that the real witch here is you,

859
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:25,008
Jang Jae Gook, and not Seo Min Hee.

860
01:01:25,009 --> 01:01:26,179
What real witch?

861
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:29,450
Don't look so surprised. The real deal starts now.

862
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:37,120
- Gosh...
- What?

863
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:39,919
- Please excuse me for a moment.
- What?

864
01:01:40,689 --> 01:01:41,989
What are you...

865
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,980
Now then, let's go.

866
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:02,910
Where are we going?

867
01:02:20,669 --> 01:02:23,270
- It's a miracle!
- Nice.

868
01:02:24,939 --> 01:02:26,809
I should've known when you were admitted...

869
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:29,508
to this hospital connected with Chayul.

870
01:02:29,509 --> 01:02:31,339
I was too late, wasn't I?

871
01:02:31,939 --> 01:02:34,810
Self-fabricated scenarios usually end with two weeks of treatment.

872
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:39,379
I guess you weren't confident to change the public opinion with it.

873
01:02:39,779 --> 01:02:41,489
You even went into a coma.

874
01:02:43,759 --> 01:02:45,718
Aren't you being too harsh on me?

875
01:02:45,719 --> 01:02:50,298
No. You were always a bothersome being in my life.

876
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:52,500
I should've gotten rid of you sooner.

877
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,830
Do you realize that it's over for you now?

878
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:57,770
And totally, at that.

879
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,480
You...

880
01:03:08,549 --> 01:03:11,019
Are you family wreckers? Are you?

881
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,048
What do you know?

882
01:03:12,049 --> 01:03:14,149
How dare you act up after sweet-talking a naive woman?

883
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,919
You're right. We don't know much. No, except for one.

884
01:03:17,259 --> 01:03:19,960
We know she's not happy because of her husband.

885
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,559
Who said that? I love my wife dearly.

886
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,560
She must be happy.

887
01:03:23,561 --> 01:03:24,759
What's love?

888
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,500
What?

889
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:28,529
It's trust.

890
01:03:28,629 --> 01:03:31,838
You love the person as much as you trust them.

891
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,468
Ms. Lee started with zero trust in you...

892
01:03:34,469 --> 01:03:37,039
after it was destroyed entirely.

893
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,140
But what? "Love?"

894
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:40,980
How can she love you?

895
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,020
"Happy?" Is your happiness all that matters?

896
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:46,318
Who are you to talk back at me?

897
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:48,749
What? Are you the only one who can talk back?

898
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:49,750
Hey...

899
01:03:50,189 --> 01:03:52,089
You asked me what I knew to act up, right?

900
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:54,160
What about you?

901
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:56,730
How much do you know about your wife?

902
01:04:00,669 --> 01:04:02,830
- What...
- By the way, I'll stand witness...

903
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,869
in Ms. Seo's trial.

904
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:06,238
If Ms. Lee does it,

905
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:08,239
the mutual agreement divorce will go down the drain.

906
01:04:10,109 --> 01:04:11,140
Look forward to it.

907
01:04:37,469 --> 01:04:38,969
We're leaving for the gates now.

908
01:04:40,339 --> 01:04:43,270
I told Soo Ji about our conversation...

909
01:04:43,509 --> 01:04:45,540
about not wasting too much time...

910
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:48,148
on what hurt us.

911
01:04:48,149 --> 01:04:50,250
Good. Let's only think about...

912
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:54,149
how to get back on our feet and not what hurt us.

913
01:04:55,989 --> 01:04:57,319
Congratulations on your divorce.

914
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,730
How may I help you?

915
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:13,939
Please help me.

916
01:05:16,739 --> 01:05:17,739
I'm...

917
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:25,149
the wife of Chayul Law Firm's CEO, Noh Yul Seong.

918
01:05:26,049 --> 01:05:27,149
I'm Han Ji In.

919
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:53,850
(Queen of Divorce)

920
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:24,379
I think my husband is holding my weakness.

921
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,480
Guess what this is.

922
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,649
You should be picky about your clients.

923
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,649
You won't defend my wife, will you?

924
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:32,019
Too bad. I'm getting fired up now that...

925
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:33,450
you're telling me not to do it.

926
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,350
You want me to go through Noh Yul Seong's office?

927
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:39,318
I'm a judicial officer, not a troubleshooter.

928
01:06:39,319 --> 01:06:40,960
- Okay?
- Honey!

929
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:44,660
Making a scene at your ex-husband's workplace is uncivilized.

930
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:47,329
Isn't the jerk...

931
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:49,830
who kidnapped his wife much more uncivilized?

932
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:51,739
It's hot!

933
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,269
Did you always cross the line so easily?

934
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:54,910
I've never crossed it, not even now.

935
01:06:55,739 --> 01:06:59,140
Though I'm the one who decides where the line is.
