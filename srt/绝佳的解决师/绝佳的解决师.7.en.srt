4
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:29,745
Don't you really know...

5
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:32,245
why I joined SOLUTION?

6
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:43,884
Don't get distracted, Sa Ra.

7
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:51,865
Fine.

8
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:56,005
Then you shouldn't get distracted too.

9
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:18,625
Let's just go.

10
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:25,295
(Divorce Specialist SOLUTION)

11
00:01:36,474 --> 00:01:37,505
You...

12
00:01:38,345 --> 00:01:39,574
used me first.

13
00:01:41,675 --> 00:01:43,885
What did you want to show to Noh Yul Seong?

14
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:47,054
I must make him more anxious...

15
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:52,024
if I want to find out why he's so bothered by us.

16
00:01:58,225 --> 00:01:59,564
I never used you.

17
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:17,344
You could have had your pick of the job.

18
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:20,414
But I was curious why you chose this place of all the offers.

19
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:21,455
That's true.

20
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:24,684
Despite that, I chose to join SOLUTION.

21
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:27,325
- The reason behind my decision... - I didn't know...

22
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:31,825
that reason was Noh Yul Seong.

23
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:36,564
You found out about the five-member society while working here.

24
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:38,135
So working here paid off, did it not?

25
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:40,675
Kim Sa Ra.

26
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:43,344
Is that...

27
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:46,915
all I amount to in your eyes?

28
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:51,445
I need you to take a break from the team.

29
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,314
I finally understand why you wanted me to give you...

30
00:02:58,455 --> 00:02:59,554
three months.

31
00:03:56,785 --> 00:03:57,785
Kim Sa Ra!

32
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:02,013
Hey, get a grip.

33
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:04,383
Let me tell you something. That jerk is a total nutcase.

34
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:06,453
Remember the case where a professor jumped off? He's using you,

35
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,694
so he can find evidence to avoid taking responsibility for it.

36
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:13,494
What's so awful about being used?

37
00:04:14,835 --> 00:04:16,605
I wouldn't mind being used by him.

38
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:27,415
How's Chayul Town going?

39
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:31,215
I get that you're curious about how much we know.

40
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:32,585
But don't make it so obvious.

41
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:34,184
It makes you look small.

42
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,865
I never used you.

46
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:20,335
Professor Seo.

47
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:22,905
Come in.

48
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:26,104
It's about the law-school-related law.

49
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:27,434
The Legislation and Judiciary Committee passed it.

50
00:05:29,304 --> 00:05:30,943
Could they have bribed the committee?

51
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:32,144
Only the plenary session remains now.

52
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:34,844
- How likely is it to get passed? - Assemblymen's opinions are split.

53
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:36,943
That must be why Noh Yul Seong is trying badly to grease...

54
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:38,215
the leaders of Hanjoo Party.

55
00:05:38,314 --> 00:05:40,785
So he'll use the votes of the majority party?

56
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:44,925
Kim Young A, the party representative of Hanjoo Party?

57
00:05:45,884 --> 00:05:47,824
Didn't you say you guys have the same spa membership?

58
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:50,525
We do. Why do you ask?

59
00:05:52,764 --> 00:05:56,204
I must stop Noh Yul Seong from turning into a dinosaur.

60
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:00,574
I still can't see my son when he's only an elephant now.

61
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:02,845
Should I find out when she comes for spa?

62
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,244
Only the members are allowed inside, right?

63
00:06:05,444 --> 00:06:09,345
First of all, I need to cross paths with her at least once.

64
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:14,014
You know, let's fix your makeup, so you look a bit older.

65
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:16,754
Pretend you're me, and go in. Here you go.

66
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:18,525
Thank you.

67
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:20,925
It's a VIP card.

68
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:30,264
Hello.

69
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:32,804
I'm a fan.

70
00:06:33,074 --> 00:06:34,134
Thank you.

71
00:06:38,074 --> 00:06:40,174
Please run for President in the next election.

72
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:41,175
Gosh.

73
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:44,314
- Sure. - By the way,

74
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:47,383
aren't you from the divorce...

75
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:50,425
Gosh, what an honour. You know who I am.

76
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:51,724
My name is Kim Sa Ra.

77
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:54,493
You destroyed Candidate Noh Yul Seong to pieces.

78
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:55,524
Of course, I remember you.

79
00:06:55,525 --> 00:06:57,594
I always wanted to meet you someday.

80
00:06:57,595 --> 00:06:58,965
I got my wish, I guess.

81
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:00,595
I'll let you rest now.

82
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:04,735
I have a question. Do you also assist people...

83
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:08,275
in preventing a divorce?

84
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:15,614
Sang Hee. Is your campaign for class president going well?

85
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:16,684
Yes.

86
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:18,384
How come you're not even touching the tofu?

87
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:20,383
She activated her eyes on the back of her head again.

88
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:22,253
I know you're trying to lose weight.

89
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:23,724
But if you don't consume enough protein,

90
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:24,985
your bones will break. Here.

91
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:28,155
If I keep consuming protein like this, I'll be a muscular pig.

92
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:38,335
Sang Hoon. Have a good day at school.

93
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:40,274
- Have a good day. - Thanks.

94
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:41,374
Hey.

95
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:44,573
- I need a moment. - I'm running late.

96
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:45,644
Just a moment.

97
00:07:49,415 --> 00:07:50,484
(Uncontested Divorce Agreement)

98
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:53,484
Must you do this now when you know I have a busy morning?

99
00:07:53,485 --> 00:07:55,585
How many times must I tell you?

100
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:57,683
I was told that our family and politics don't mix.

101
00:07:57,684 --> 00:07:58,984
It will bring a flood of misfortunes.

102
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:00,225
Honey. How could you...

103
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:03,095
Are you doing this because you actually believe that?

104
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:04,865
What's the harm in taking the advice?

105
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:07,164
Seriously. How come you can't see it?

106
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:08,334
Get a grip.

107
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:09,393
If that's the reason,

108
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:10,634
that's all the more reason I cannot agree to this divorce.

109
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:13,274
Honey.

110
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:14,904
That's the situation I am in.

111
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:18,374
I was looking into setting up a meeting with you.

112
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:20,074
I guess telepathy could be real.

113
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:21,913
(The generation-changing Hanjoo Party of the nation)

114
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:22,945
Thank you.

115
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:27,585
Let's hear it.

116
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,024
Tell me why you came to see me at the spa.

117
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:35,095
Where do you stand on increasing the number of law schools?

118
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:39,124
You really hate Mr. Noh Yul Seong, don't you?

119
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:43,305
I can pay you the bonus after everything, right?

120
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:45,605
Yes. Of course.

121
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:48,404
Let me say this again.

122
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,575
My husband is asking me for a divorce.

123
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:53,474
(Hanjoo Party)

124
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:54,814
You wouldn't want to go through a divorce,

125
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:56,714
since getting reelected...

126
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:59,485
as the party representative would become harder then, right?

127
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:03,455
No. It's because of my children.

128
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:04,825
Sang Hee and Sang Hoon.

129
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:07,524
They are from my husband's previous marriage.

130
00:09:08,424 --> 00:09:09,424
I see.

131
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:11,964
They may not be my biological children, but I can proudly say...

132
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,595
that I am their mother.

133
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:17,435
In a divorce, it'd be difficult for me to get custody, wouldn't it?

134
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:19,305
Legally, yes.

135
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:20,674
That's why...

136
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,374
I cannot divorce him.

137
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:34,815
You all read the message, right?

138
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:38,224
Isn't this the first case where we have to stop a divorce?

139
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:39,954
I'm all for this kind of case.

140
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:41,893
We just kill at what we do.

141
00:09:41,894 --> 00:09:44,494
It doesn't mean our job is to kill every divorce.

142
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:47,364
Let's gather all the materials and talk at the conference table.

143
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:48,435
- Okay. - Okay.

144
00:09:51,965 --> 00:09:54,104
Hello. You're here. Let's start the briefing then.

145
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:55,805
He's going to sit this one out.

146
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:57,844
What? Why?

147
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:58,974
Is something wrong?

148
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:01,445
- Well... - He has a lot of his own cases too.

149
00:10:01,575 --> 00:10:02,715
Let's work on this one without him.

150
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:06,754
But I still need to be in the loop regarding the overall outline.

151
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:08,085
I'll attend the briefing.

152
00:10:11,384 --> 00:10:12,784
Kim Young A, the party representative of Hanjoo Party.

153
00:10:13,994 --> 00:10:15,054
As an IT specialist,

154
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:16,865
she was the CEO of a search engine in her 30s.

155
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:18,993
Seven years ago, she married...

156
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:21,594
the CEO of Yerim Distribution, Yoo Min Chul, at a late age.

157
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:22,734
Their conflict has gotten serious lately...

158
00:10:22,735 --> 00:10:23,935
regarding her political career.

159
00:10:24,134 --> 00:10:25,533
As her husband's company is about to get listed,

160
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:27,003
he's pushing for a divorce now.

161
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:29,133
If he were to get a divorce after the company gets listed,

162
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:31,273
there would be more assets to divide during the divorce.

163
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:32,873
So he must want to get it done before that.

164
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:35,344
When they got married, if she adopted his children,

165
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:37,743
that would be grounds to demand child custody. Did she do that?

166
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:38,744
She must have missed that.

167
00:10:39,445 --> 00:10:42,014
Then they would be strangers if the divorce gets processed.

168
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:43,685
Let's meet with the husband first.

169
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:46,794
- Security is our priority on this. - Yes, ma'am.

170
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:01,504
Are the bottoms of your feet okay?

171
00:11:06,445 --> 00:11:08,845
You had crossed a desert.

172
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:10,945
But there's no water in your fortune.

173
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:14,555
So what do you think? The bottoms of your feet must be on fire.

174
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:17,585
Life must have been tough on you.

175
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:22,054
If you gather the energy of the universe together,

176
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:25,264
the desert may turn into a meadow.

177
00:11:25,764 --> 00:11:26,764
Hallelujah.

178
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:31,104
The pupils and whites of your eyes are clear. So you are bright.

179
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:33,903
Your nose is straight like a riverbank where water flows.

180
00:11:33,904 --> 00:11:38,044
But your philtrum is deep. So you will drink up all the water.

181
00:11:38,705 --> 00:11:41,075
You and the energy of the universe...

182
00:11:41,374 --> 00:11:46,555
are bound to be in conflict by nature.

183
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,383
Hallelujah.

184
00:11:49,384 --> 00:11:50,424
Amen.

185
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:54,424
Sir. Did you ask for a divorce...

186
00:11:55,225 --> 00:11:57,365
based on the pastor's fortune reading?

187
00:11:57,695 --> 00:11:59,835
It's not fortune reading. It's the energy of the universe.

188
00:11:59,935 --> 00:12:01,633
I understand why this may seem a bit odd...

189
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:02,764
from the eyes of worldly beings.

190
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:04,304
But do not be rude to him.

191
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:05,964
Excuse me. We just met,

192
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:07,773
but judging her based on her facial features is also bad manners.

193
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:10,143
Why don't you show them your psychokinesis?

194
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:13,644
They will need a reason to back out of the case too.

195
00:12:18,315 --> 00:12:19,315
Young lady.

196
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:22,413
These coins are engraved with the 12 zodiac animals.

197
00:12:22,414 --> 00:12:23,423
Choose one.

198
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:27,524
Then the pastor will make the coin of your choice fly in the air.

199
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:30,565
You must experience his superpower to believe it.

200
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:33,435
Why must I experience it?

201
00:12:35,095 --> 00:12:36,163
It says so on your face.

202
00:12:36,164 --> 00:12:38,504
"How could you ask for a divorce based on what he said?"

203
00:12:39,805 --> 00:12:40,873
Let's stop here.

204
00:12:40,874 --> 00:12:43,004
There are people who doubt the truth of the universe.

205
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:48,575
Please forgive their sin. Hallelujah.

206
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:49,674
Amen.

207
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:57,555
Anyway, Ms. Kim will not agree to a divorce...

208
00:12:57,884 --> 00:12:59,754
unless you give her child custody.

209
00:13:02,894 --> 00:13:04,124
I will divorce her.

210
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,994
Tell her to sign the paper quietly before this turns into a big deal.

211
00:13:08,494 --> 00:13:09,534
Hallelujah.

212
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:15,404
Is this called the Magnet Religion?

213
00:13:15,805 --> 00:13:17,244
How could he fall for a cult like that?

214
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:21,615
It will be harder for Ms. Kim to leave the children with him.

215
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:23,744
It feels like we have two targets with this case.

216
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:26,115
The husband and the pastor he is influenced by.

217
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:28,555
Let's dig into that pastor...

218
00:13:29,754 --> 00:13:31,284
and find out about what kind of man he is.

219
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:56,044
It will be a holiday soon.

220
00:13:57,144 --> 00:13:58,644
Hang in there, ma'am.

221
00:14:12,294 --> 00:14:14,264
You didn't get the cell phone back from Chayul Law Firm, right?

222
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:15,465
No. Not yet.

223
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:20,975
You knew Chayul Law Firm had it.

224
00:14:23,504 --> 00:14:24,845
Professor Seo...

225
00:14:26,004 --> 00:14:30,044
was in the five-member society Noh Yul Seong established.

226
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:32,143
What's that?

227
00:14:32,144 --> 00:14:33,754
On the surface, they were working to found a law school.

228
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:35,783
But they were a private group,

229
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:37,355
looking to score future profits from real estate development.

230
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:39,784
It is my opinion that...

231
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:42,695
the five-member society had something to do with why he jumped.

232
00:14:45,325 --> 00:14:47,365
Haven't you done enough, putting him in this condition?

233
00:14:47,965 --> 00:14:50,034
Are you going to accuse him of being a criminal now?

234
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:51,865
Please leave.

235
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:57,874
Okay.

236
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:09,815
Fine.

237
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:13,423
You can curse me out and call me a prosecutor...

238
00:15:13,424 --> 00:15:14,994
who only cared about making my case.

239
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:21,465
Sometimes, it makes me wonder if that's who I had been.

240
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:23,335
That does cross my mind.

241
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:26,335
But let me check Professor Seo's cell phone.

242
00:15:28,435 --> 00:15:30,674
I will find the real reason behind his decision to jump.

243
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:45,154
Well, you had me scared for some time now.

244
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,123
I requested to meet with you for a while.

245
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:51,394
But our meeting kept getting delayed.

246
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:53,534
Once the law regarding law schools get amended,

247
00:15:53,965 --> 00:15:56,034
there would be three new law schools.

248
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:57,835
I heard that your law firm played...

249
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:00,574
a huge role when it was presented to the LJC.

250
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:01,903
(Hanjoo Party)

251
00:16:01,904 --> 00:16:04,873
You want to get down to business. I see.

252
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:05,874
This is great.

253
00:16:07,774 --> 00:16:09,874
If you help the law get passed in the plenary session,

254
00:16:10,585 --> 00:16:12,185
I will pay my own money...

255
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:14,315
to build the town for law schools.

256
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,783
If these law schools can serve...

257
00:16:17,784 --> 00:16:20,324
as a tool in revitalizing the regional economy,

258
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:21,893
you will be taking all the credit.

259
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:24,565
You can count on that, of course.

260
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:28,195
Then it only makes sense that Chayul Law Firm takes...

261
00:16:28,764 --> 00:16:30,404
one of the new law schools.

262
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:34,435
That's too bad. You see,

263
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:38,205
I don't join hands with people who have been...

264
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:41,144
awful to their spouses.

265
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:58,164
By the way, there's something between Ms. Kim and Lawyer Dong.

266
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,335
What? That was so random.

267
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:05,065
Seriously. You're so clueless. This is why you can't date men.

268
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:09,404
Lawyer Dong never had the intention of sitting this one out.

269
00:17:10,005 --> 00:17:12,644
But Ms. Kim pushed him out on purpose.

270
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:14,515
I bet she's playing hard-to-get.

271
00:17:15,944 --> 00:17:18,585
You must think there's a fling if two people establish eye contact.

272
00:17:19,085 --> 00:17:20,284
You think we're all like you.

273
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:22,315
My hunches are scientifically proven.

274
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:26,184
See? Our eyes meet all the time, but I never get confused.

275
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,154
- Is that so? - Yes.

276
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,535
What?

277
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:40,934
What is it?

278
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:46,505
Gosh. I wonder if Lawyer Dong needs any help from another guy.

279
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:48,045
He's coming out.

They're all his believers?

282
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:28,650
He must've extorted a lot of money...

283
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:30,220
to be able to build such a big church like this.

284
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,520
What is this? A rip off on Cheonji Dongsan?

285

He's known as the pastor...

293
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:53,710
who foresees the future and heals sick people.

294
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:56,240

You know, he has psychic power.

The psychic power we almost saw in person that day.

299
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,120
Besides, he's famous for making accurate predictions...

regarding investments.

301
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,060
Back then, Yoo's company was struggling due to lack of funds.

302
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:14,400
But when he bought the stocks of the company the pastor pointed out,

303
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:15,729
he made a fortune.

304
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,370
He said his insomnia improved thanks to the psychic therapy.

305
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:19,730
That's how he got hooked.

- You're back, Lawyer Dong. - Hey.

Are there people with psychic powers like him in Korea too?

he would be in trouble without a divorce.

- Yes. - Don't.

Then how did the pastor treat his insomnia?

335
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,151
Maybe, it might be the placebo effect.

336

Right. It got better as much as his faith grew.

I'd say it was more than just knowing each other.

358
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:40,661
She was his girl?

359
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:44,171
Since when?

360
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,770
I'm not sure.

361
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,600
Anyway, I saw her in a hotel...

362
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:51,270
at Noh Yul Seong's remarriage party.

363
00:23:51,611 --> 00:23:54,411
That night, she died after falling off a taxi that was driving.

364
00:23:54,811 --> 00:23:56,010
There was an informant?

365
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:58,249
The police ended the case as a suicide.

366
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,311
But there was an informant that claimed it wasn't a suicide.

367
00:24:00,651 --> 00:24:02,219
But why didn't they conduct reinvestigation?

368
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,091
She couldn't be reached after her call.

369
00:24:04,621 --> 00:24:06,249
It sounded like a lady in her 60s.

370
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,421
But there were no clues that led to her.

371
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,490
Seo Woong Jin's death leap and Na Yu Mi's suicide.

372
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:15,560
Both cases don't seem quite right.

373
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:17,530
But in these two cases,

374
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:20,500
Noh Yul Seong is involved.

375
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,371
That was why I kept looking into these cases.

376
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:26,841
But Noh Yul Seong wasn't the reason I came to SOLUTION.

377
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:31,280
It was Kim Sa Ra.

378
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,749
We met after nine years.

379
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,790
"Well, that's nice. I should use my ex to my advantage."

380
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,821
Can you think that way?

381
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,990
Yes.

382
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,590
What?

383
00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:47,901
I will do that from now on.

384
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,860
Do what?

385
00:24:49,861 --> 00:24:53,030
I finally see a way to send Noh Yul Seong to prison.

386
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,740
I want to use you, Lawyer Dong.

387
00:24:57,911 --> 00:24:59,171
Let's use each other.

388
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,300
Ms. Kim and Lawyer Dong got in a fight.

389
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:27,770
She sounded quite resolute about having Lawyer Dong out of a case.

390
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,470
Really?

391
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,510
It seems like you'll cry if they make up with each other.

392
00:25:33,171 --> 00:25:35,739
What's going on? Do you still have feelings for your ex-wife?

393
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,811
Don't get ahead of yourself.

394
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,381
Don't be taking things there.

395
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:42,450
Fine.

396
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,591
Then is it too much to talk about Kim Young A?

397
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:49,391
I will if you stop frowning so much.

398
00:25:49,661 --> 00:25:51,190
Hurry up and tell me.

399
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,660
She came to SOLUTION to ask for help to stop her divorce.

400
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:56,661
Divorce?

401
00:25:59,401 --> 00:26:00,840
Is she liable for anything?

402
00:26:00,841 --> 00:26:01,841
Not at all.

403
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,611
The problem lies within the husband.

404
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:06,470
Amazingly, it has to do with a cult.

405
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:16,020
- Get off. - What?

406
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:18,519
Weren't you the one to call to ask me things?

407
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,920
You're right about that.

408
00:26:19,921 --> 00:26:21,460
Get off for now. Wait for me.

409
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,280
What's with the heavy steps?

410
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:49,250
Sorry? I'm fine.

411
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,121
Was it because I mentioned the second floor to stay out of it?

412
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,960
I hope it wasn't because of that.

413
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,960
Oh, not at all.

414
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:59,831
It had nothing to do with you, Hui Jin.

415
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,530
I was worried if you would get the wrong idea.

416
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,371
Why are you worrying about me?

417
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,841
We're in the same team.

418
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:29,290
You're going to push Kim Young A out?

419
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,861
It's a mess there.

420
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,200
No pesticide will work.

421
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,401
If that's the case, it's best to cut it out.

422
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,300
What next?

423
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,141
After her, the next representative is Ha Hyun Ho.

424
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:46,871
I need your help.

425
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,980
You said you'll take care of things on your own.

426
00:27:53,111 --> 00:27:55,950
But you're showing the white flag in just a week.

427
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,821
I'm feeling embarrassed.

428
00:28:04,331 --> 00:28:05,930
Your pesticides will surely work on Ha Hyun Ho.

429
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:07,290
One last time!

430
00:28:08,661 --> 00:28:10,029
If you are to blame me one more time,

431
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,671
not even a single sheet of paper from Chayul will be given to you.

432
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,510
If you are to help out with that,

433
00:28:18,411 --> 00:28:19,770
I will deal with Kim Young A.

434
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,990
Hello, Pastor Cheon.

435
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,060
By the way, you're house is amazing.

436
00:28:43,061 --> 00:28:47,171
Oh, is CEO Yoo Min Chul's divorce going smoothly?

437
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,770
Who are you?

438
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:50,601
Me?

439
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:54,341
I am someone who is looking in the same direction as you.

440
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,709
Do you know Kim Young A well?

441
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,949
Yes. She comes often.

442
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,850
She came for both the party representative...

443
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:04,750
and presidential elections.

444
00:29:05,121 --> 00:29:07,190
- Did you watch it? - We're watching it right now.

445
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,561
Oh, right.

446
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,799
Do you know Kim Young A well?

447
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,269
Yes. She comes often.

448
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:20,199
She came for both the party representative...

449
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,070
and presidential elections.

450
00:29:22,071 --> 00:29:23,469
Are you her mentor?

451
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,469
That's it. A mentor.

452
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,381
The higher a person goes, the lonelier they get.

453
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,949
Unexpectedly, she has no one around her.

454
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,749
That is why I am here for her to give some advice.

455
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:35,019
The part-timer of this place posted it up online.

456
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,180
While going through the CCTV footage,

457
00:29:37,181 --> 00:29:39,190
talks about a big name made the part-timer post it up.

458
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:47,331
Did your mom want steak this year?

459
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:50,631
Yes. I got the sign last night.

460
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:54,000
- Enjoy your meal, Mom. - Let's dig in.

461
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:58,210
Only cooked vegetables.

462
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:02,239
A controlled diet is most important for your illness, Sang Hoon.

463
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,311
I know.

464
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:05,479
What's the point of going through a controlled diet?

465
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,510
Dad...

466
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:09,950
I know your dad doesn't remember the anniversary of your mom's death.

467
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,689
Don't feel too sad about it.

468
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,219
He's super annoying.

469
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,591
Sang Hee, let's not get rude now.

470
00:30:15,621 --> 00:30:16,661
Your brother might learn from you.

471
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:20,130
Look at what he's doing after hearing from a pastor...

472
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:21,500
that it'll bring bad luck to him.

473
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:23,061
Let's eat.

474
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
Hey.

475
00:30:30,341 --> 00:30:31,371
What?

476
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,411
That's it. A mentor.

477
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,310
This pastor is totally crazy.

478
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:39,310
Mom, will you really get a divorce?

479
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:41,181
Gosh, are you kidding me?

480
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:43,381
Do you think I can live without you two?

481
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,990
Seriously?

482
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,000
I will survive through this.

483
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,571
Don't get so worried. Okay?

484
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:04,470
CEO Yoo!

485
00:31:04,671 --> 00:31:06,439
What are you thinking?

486
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,710
I just don't get why...

487
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:11,380
you said all those lies.

488
00:31:11,381 --> 00:31:12,949
Haven't you heard of malicious editing?

489
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,120
It's just making me look like I've said those things.

490
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:17,181
My gosh.

491
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:19,749
So that was it, right?

492
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,891
Gosh.

493
00:31:25,161 --> 00:31:28,431
What do I get from doing that?

494
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:32,770
Your status will go up as a party representative mentor.

495
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,299
Even if Kim Young A denies it,

496
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,200
people will go with that idea.

497
00:31:41,841 --> 00:31:44,811
Listen. Kim Young A...

498
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:48,779
is taking away the cosmic energy within you.

499
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,550
How many times have I told you this?

500
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:53,090
And yet, you're still struggling...

501
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:54,960
to get a divorce.

502
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,060
- CEO Yoo. - Yes?

503
00:32:02,061 --> 00:32:04,800
Are you acting this way to avoid making offerings?

504
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:07,071
Pastor Cheon!

505
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:10,870
After our company gets listed, it'll be Cheonji Dongsan's.

506
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:12,709
We must receive your great energy...

507
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,581
and spread out through the world.

508
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:17,811
Hallelujah.

509
00:32:18,151 --> 00:32:19,151
Hello.

510
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:20,880
Have you seen the video?

511
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:23,321
None of it is true. Talk with the secretary's office.

512
00:32:30,029 --> 00:32:32,429
(Member of the Supreme Council, Ha Hyun Ho)

513
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,400
(Hanjoo Party)

514
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,769
I apologize for being late.

515
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:41,587
Goodness. You're going through a lot.

516
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:44,187
Journalists love a bit of gossip, don't they?

517
00:32:44,188 --> 00:32:46,157
But let's make things clear.

518
00:32:46,158 --> 00:32:48,427
Are you sure you're not related to all that?

519
00:32:48,428 --> 00:32:51,697
- Assemblyman Ha. - Well, if it isn't true,

520
00:32:51,698 --> 00:32:53,466
you must deny this for the party's sake.

521
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:54,598
Don't worry.

522
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:57,908
I am not a member of that cult.

523
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:01,437
Great. Then everything's fine.

524
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,577
Make some time on the weekend with your husband.

525
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:04,678
Go to a big church or cathedral...

526
00:33:05,007 --> 00:33:07,747
and post up a picture of you praying.

527
00:33:08,078 --> 00:33:10,047
That will sort things right away.

528
00:33:12,517 --> 00:33:14,858
I feel so dumbfounded.

529
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:15,956
(The generation-changing Hanjoo Party of the nation)

530
00:33:15,957 --> 00:33:17,088
My husband says...

531
00:33:18,158 --> 00:33:19,588
it's malicious editing.

532
00:33:19,757 --> 00:33:21,296
Everyone on the Internet...

533
00:33:21,297 --> 00:33:23,828
is doxing the pastor of Cheonji Dongsan.

534
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:28,338
We can get by saying it's nonsense from the pastor.

535
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,668
But if everyone finds out that your husband is a member,

536
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:32,338
things will get much worse.

537
00:33:33,838 --> 00:33:35,006
We don't have time.

538
00:33:35,007 --> 00:33:36,537
The rumours and the divorce.

539
00:33:36,908 --> 00:33:40,007
These things will only get solved when your husband leaves that place.

540
00:33:50,118 --> 00:33:51,728
Just a moment.

541
00:33:53,257 --> 00:33:54,257
Me?

542
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:56,627
Again?

543
00:33:57,698 --> 00:34:01,697
Out of us, you're the only one the pastor doesn't know.

544
00:34:01,698 --> 00:34:03,566
To get the husband out,

545
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:06,408
we have to make him know the pastor is a cult leader.

546
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:11,748
Why do you keep making me the inside man?

547
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:14,577
This still doesn't sound right.

548
00:34:14,578 --> 00:34:16,577
Won't there be another way?

549
00:34:16,578 --> 00:34:19,186
If we are to make him learn that the pastor is a swindler,

550
00:34:19,187 --> 00:34:20,916
this is the best way.

551
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:24,787
Well, I may be good at everything else,

552
00:34:24,788 --> 00:34:27,728
but acting is just not my thing.

553
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:30,727
You won't find a worse actor than me.

554
00:34:30,728 --> 00:34:32,327
It's serious.

555
00:34:32,328 --> 00:34:33,767
Let's find another way.

556
00:34:33,768 --> 00:34:36,867
Lawyer Dong. It's a trend to have it all as a lawyer.

557
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:39,667
Have it all? I'm not interested.

558
00:34:41,607 --> 00:34:44,077
If someone like me ends up going,

559
00:34:44,078 --> 00:34:46,208
everyone will find out.

560
00:34:46,578 --> 00:34:47,578
Hi!

561
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:50,447
Ms. Son. I don't really look like someone who is...

562
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:51,587
part of a cult, do I?

563
00:34:52,317 --> 00:34:54,816
There aren't specific faces to be a cult member.

564
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:56,986
What is it? Why do you need me for this?

565
00:34:56,987 --> 00:35:00,427
Ms. Son, you said you dreamed of becoming an actress, right?

566
00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:03,657
Yes. I have the perfect face and body. What a waste.

567
00:35:03,658 --> 00:35:05,427
- Right? - Yes. Why do you ask?

568
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:09,138
Why don't you take this chance to live out your dream?

569
00:35:09,437 --> 00:35:12,067
Two is better than one, isn't it? This looks great.

570
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:14,268
What?

571
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:15,937
Just say no.

572
00:35:16,138 --> 00:35:17,177
What is it about?

573
00:35:17,178 --> 00:35:20,506
Think carefully about this. Is this the best plan possible?

574
00:35:20,507 --> 00:35:21,518
- Yes! - Yes!

575
00:35:21,948 --> 00:35:23,147
What plan?

576
00:35:23,348 --> 00:35:24,617
Just say no.

577
00:35:24,618 --> 00:35:25,947
Say no? No!

578
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:27,217
But what's the plan?

579
00:35:27,618 --> 00:35:29,957
(Cheonji Dongsan)

580
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:32,757
Cheonji claimed this!

581
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:36,728
If you have faith,

582
00:35:37,397 --> 00:35:41,127
the mountains and seas can be moved!

583
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:43,896
Believe in Cheonji...

584
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:45,808
and miracles will occur!

585
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,678
Doubt Cheonji...

586
00:35:49,178 --> 00:35:53,377
and all will fall into the fiery pit!

587
00:35:53,478 --> 00:35:55,577
Hallelujah!

588
00:35:55,578 --> 00:35:57,716
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

589
00:35:57,717 --> 00:35:59,347
- Amen. - Hallelujah.

590
00:35:59,348 --> 00:36:01,587
- Amen. - Amen.

591
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:04,927
Claims that I am...

592
00:36:04,928 --> 00:36:07,157
a mentor of a famous politician...

593
00:36:07,158 --> 00:36:09,958
are not important at all.

594
00:36:11,228 --> 00:36:12,498
"Why so serious?"

595
00:36:15,397 --> 00:36:17,767
Even so, there are numerous...

596
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:19,807
poor and pitiful members who have come...

597
00:36:19,808 --> 00:36:23,478
from all over the country.

598
00:36:23,837 --> 00:36:29,018
Cheonji will welcome you with love.

599
00:36:29,417 --> 00:36:30,577
Newcomers.

600
00:36:30,578 --> 00:36:33,086
- Please stand up, newcomers. - Newcomers.

601
00:36:33,087 --> 00:36:35,388
- Yes. Stand up. - Please stand up for us.

602
00:36:36,518 --> 00:36:38,127
- Newcomers? - We're newcomers.

603
00:36:39,357 --> 00:36:40,958
- Up we go. - I can't see at all.

604
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:45,527
Who shall greet us as the representative?

605
00:36:45,928 --> 00:36:47,998
Oh, the one with glasses.

606
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:49,837
You're the only man here.

607
00:36:50,538 --> 00:36:51,538
Glasses?

608
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:54,937
Oh, right.

609
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:58,578
- Look natural. - Natural. Yes.

610
00:36:58,777 --> 00:37:02,118
Well, I have come with my sister...

611
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,717
who has lost her sight a few years ago...

612
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:07,917
through an unknown illness.

613
00:37:10,817 --> 00:37:14,657
We have come to receive the blessing of Pastor Cheonji.

614
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:15,796
Hallelujah!

615
00:37:15,797 --> 00:37:18,567
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

616
00:37:19,998 --> 00:37:22,138
Great.

617
00:37:22,237 --> 00:37:24,167
None of that is necessary!

618
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:25,638
All you need is faith.

619
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:28,936
- Faith alone. - This acting is more than terrible.

620
00:37:28,937 --> 00:37:33,376
With faith in Cheonji, the sister of the only man here...

621
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:36,617
a miracle will occur!

622
00:37:36,618 --> 00:37:38,887
Hallelujah!

623
00:37:38,888 --> 00:37:40,117
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

624
00:37:40,118 --> 00:37:42,058
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

625
00:37:42,717 --> 00:37:43,787
Amen!

626
00:37:43,788 --> 00:37:45,756
- Amen! - Amen!

627
00:37:45,757 --> 00:37:47,527
Please be seated.

628
00:37:48,658 --> 00:37:49,698
Yes.

629
00:37:50,627 --> 00:37:51,627
Right.

630
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,038
(Cheonji Dongsan)

631
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:00,607
Look forward.

632
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:10,748
Cheonji!

633
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:19,728
Your faith...

634
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:23,457
will receive cosmic energy!

635
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,896
It is through Pastor Cheonji.

636
00:38:25,897 --> 00:38:27,166
Who?

637
00:38:27,167 --> 00:38:29,767
- Pastor Cheonji! - Pastor Cheonji!

638
00:38:29,768 --> 00:38:30,768
Pastor Cheonji!

639
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,308
Through Pastor Cheonji,

640
00:38:33,507 --> 00:38:36,407
this poor cancer patient...

641
00:38:36,408 --> 00:38:39,908
will receive that energy!

642
00:38:40,478 --> 00:38:41,577
Do you believe this?

643
00:38:41,578 --> 00:38:42,947
- Yes! - Yes!

644
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:44,577
Do you believe this?

645
00:38:44,578 --> 00:38:46,018
- Yes! - Yes!

646
00:38:59,098 --> 00:39:00,567
We believe!

647
00:39:13,948 --> 00:39:16,877
(Cheonji Dongsan)

648
00:39:42,607 --> 00:39:43,607
Silence!

649
00:39:43,808 --> 00:39:45,807
You may now...

650
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:48,678
witness the evidence of this miracle.

651
00:39:55,518 --> 00:40:00,486
This Pastor Cheonji has received cosmic energy...

652
00:40:00,487 --> 00:40:03,627
to remove that lump of cancer.

653
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:08,367
Thus, a miracle has come to this believer.

654
00:40:08,368 --> 00:40:10,597
- Amen! - Amen!

655
00:40:10,598 --> 00:40:15,377
Now, let us give our final prayer.

656
00:40:16,408 --> 00:40:17,977
I have an announcement to make.

657
00:40:17,978 --> 00:40:20,748
If you are a newcomer, please come to the front.

658
00:40:22,118 --> 00:40:23,817
Newcomers!

659
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:25,546
- You may leave the mats... - Come forward.

660
00:40:25,547 --> 00:40:26,817
- this way. - Come this way.

661
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:27,948
The mats...

662
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:41,637
Oh, right. Where is the prayer room?

663
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:43,066
- It's that way. - Right.

664
00:40:43,067 --> 00:40:44,166
She can't see.

665
00:40:44,167 --> 00:40:45,207
- My sister can't see. - I can't see.

666
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,466
- It's this way. - I can't see.

667
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:48,107
- I must go this way. - This way.

668
00:40:58,147 --> 00:40:59,847
- Don't look surprised. - I can't see.

669
00:40:59,848 --> 00:41:00,848
You can't see.

670
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:05,558
Thank you.

671
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:16,067
- Ms. Son. - Yes?

672
00:41:16,437 --> 00:41:17,768
You're supposed to be blind.

673
00:41:17,868 --> 00:41:20,138
I'll just keep my eyes closed.

674
00:41:20,868 --> 00:41:22,677
Keep them open and keep watch.

675
00:41:22,678 --> 00:41:25,277
All right. It is a bit scary here.

676
00:41:36,757 --> 00:41:37,817
Gosh.

677
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:45,027
Oh, no.

678
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:51,638
(Laundry Room)

679
00:42:06,217 --> 00:42:07,288
(Laundry Room)

680
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,357
Gosh, my back is killing me from standing.

681
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:16,198
Staying healthy is the best thing.

682
00:42:16,498 --> 00:42:19,897
Someone just went past me. Someone just went by!

683
00:42:29,007 --> 00:42:31,748
Darn it. I told them to get rid of the empty boxes.

684
00:42:34,908 --> 00:42:36,078
Let's take a look.

685
00:42:38,618 --> 00:42:40,547
Let's see.

686
00:42:44,158 --> 00:42:45,187
Okay.

687
00:43:21,357 --> 00:43:24,027
Sir, there's another fuss in the lobby.

688
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:27,198
Gosh. Why can't they take care of it on their own?

689
00:43:27,698 --> 00:43:29,897
- Let's go. - All right.

690
00:43:29,998 --> 00:43:31,566
- Let's go. - Where is it?

691
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:32,638
- It's that way. - My back hurts.

692
00:43:32,937 --> 00:43:35,837
My back is killing me. Standing is all I can do.

693
00:43:37,937 --> 00:43:38,977
What do I do?

694
00:43:38,978 --> 00:43:39,978
My goodness.

695
00:43:47,587 --> 00:43:49,187
Something must be wrong with my back.

696
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,297
Okay.

697
00:43:56,558 --> 00:43:59,268
Gosh. What do I do?

698
00:43:59,897 --> 00:44:01,527
- Did you get it? - Come on.

699
00:44:01,967 --> 00:44:03,467
- Let's get out of here. - Okay.

700
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:05,607
We took too long.

701
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,166
Give me back my wife!

702
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:10,506
- You can be like this here. - Calm down?

703
00:44:10,507 --> 00:44:11,507
Drag him out.

704
00:44:11,508 --> 00:44:13,207
- Hey! - Come this way.

705
00:44:13,208 --> 00:44:15,317
You made us get a divorce out of nowhere!

706
00:44:15,618 --> 00:44:18,686
Hey! Where's the pastor?

707
00:44:18,687 --> 00:44:21,146
Hey! You cult members!

708
00:44:21,147 --> 00:44:23,986
- Hey! - This place is a mess.

709
00:44:23,987 --> 00:44:26,257
Stay focused. Use your cane.

710
00:44:27,888 --> 00:44:29,297
My goodness.

711
00:44:29,397 --> 00:44:31,157
They're dragging him out.

712
00:44:31,158 --> 00:44:32,868
You're totally not blind right now.

713
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,666
That's just awful.

714
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:38,038
Stay focused until the end.

715
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:39,638
Just a moment.

716
00:44:40,837 --> 00:44:44,006
Oh, yes. Hallelujah.

717
00:44:44,007 --> 00:44:46,847
- Right. - We're heading out.

718
00:44:46,848 --> 00:44:50,078
Is that so? Just a moment.

719
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,618
What are you doing?

720
00:44:54,047 --> 00:44:55,957
- Bang! - Gosh! What are you doing?

721
00:44:55,958 --> 00:44:56,986
- You can see, right? - Yes, I can!

722
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:59,727
Hey! What are you doing? What do you mean you can see?

723
00:44:59,728 --> 00:45:03,098
Why are being so rude like this?

724
00:45:04,027 --> 00:45:05,058
Let's get...

725
00:45:09,538 --> 00:45:10,538
My goodness.

726
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,666
What should I do? My goodness!

727
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:15,677
Hey! Go away!

728
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:18,477
- I saw a miracle. - Get out!

729
00:45:18,478 --> 00:45:20,977
- Pastor, it's a miracle! - Go away!

730
00:45:20,978 --> 00:45:23,578
Hey! Go away!

731
00:45:23,717 --> 00:45:26,347
Bring them to me. They are swindlers.

732
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,646
Get off of me!

733
00:45:27,647 --> 00:45:28,957
- Let me go! - Wait a minute.

734
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:30,657
- Wait a minute! - Oh, my!

735
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:31,888
- No! - I'm sorry!

736
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:34,627
Seriously.

737
00:45:35,627 --> 00:45:36,828
You bad people!

738
00:45:37,397 --> 00:45:39,666
- Go away! - Gosh.

739
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:41,698
- My goodness. - Oh, my.

740
00:45:42,067 --> 00:45:43,967
- Hey! - Oh, my!

741
00:45:44,368 --> 00:45:46,666
- Hey! - Stop.

742
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:48,606
- Hey! No! - Oh, my.

743
00:45:48,607 --> 00:45:50,207
You bad people!

744
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:51,807
Chase them, now.

745
00:45:51,808 --> 00:45:53,348
Seriously.

746
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,376
- Hey! - Hurry up!

747
00:45:56,377 --> 00:45:57,848
- Calm down. - My goodness.

748
00:45:57,948 --> 00:46:00,216
- Get in. - Drive!

749
00:46:00,217 --> 00:46:01,646
My goodness!

750
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:02,658
Seriously.

751
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:08,558
My goodness.

752
00:46:10,658 --> 00:46:12,397
But you...

753
00:46:13,498 --> 00:46:15,967
were running away without me.

754
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:19,038
- Are you okay? - Yes, I had so much fun.

755
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:21,876
Who said you were a bad actor, Lawyer Dong?

756
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:23,336
You should change your career as an actor if you get fired.

757
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:25,777
Look. I told you...

758
00:46:26,107 --> 00:46:27,578
this isn't a good idea.

759
00:46:27,908 --> 00:46:29,317
It may not be good,

760
00:46:30,178 --> 00:46:31,248
but it was the best.

761
00:46:33,317 --> 00:46:34,388
- Was it? - Yes.

762
00:46:37,317 --> 00:46:38,388
It hurts.

763
00:46:43,828 --> 00:46:45,928
(Yerim Distribution)

764
00:46:49,638 --> 00:46:51,237
It's a scam disguised as psychic abilities.

765
00:46:51,598 --> 00:46:53,237
Pastor Cheonji is a cult leader.

766
00:46:56,408 --> 00:46:57,478
Let's stop.

767
00:47:01,107 --> 00:47:02,348
Did my wife ask you to do this?

768
00:47:02,547 --> 00:47:04,118
To fabricate the video...

769
00:47:04,917 --> 00:47:06,186
and make me change my heart?

770
00:47:06,187 --> 00:47:07,687
Let's at least reveal the truth.

771
00:47:07,888 --> 00:47:10,158
Ask Pastor Cheonji to hold a press conference.

772
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:13,756
"I'm not Kim Young A's a mentor."

773
00:47:13,757 --> 00:47:14,856
(CEO Yoo Min Chul)

774
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:17,058
He's not someone whom I can ask to do this or that.

775
00:47:17,658 --> 00:47:21,627
Then, let's upload this video on the Internet...

776
00:47:21,728 --> 00:47:23,038
and ask the public.

777
00:47:24,737 --> 00:47:27,566
If they think if it's fabricated or not.

778
00:47:27,567 --> 00:47:30,376
Then, my wife would be affected too.

779
00:47:30,377 --> 00:47:33,208
Our goal is to prevent a divorce,

780
00:47:34,647 --> 00:47:36,216
not to maintain her approval ratings.

781
00:47:36,217 --> 00:47:39,186
I doubt a company rumoured to have its CEO enchanted by a cult...

782
00:47:39,187 --> 00:47:41,587
must be listed well in the stock market.

783
00:47:44,618 --> 00:47:46,058
I'll give you time to think until tomorrow.

784
00:47:50,698 --> 00:47:55,097
Are you asking me to help Ms. Kim Young A?

785
00:47:55,098 --> 00:47:56,267
Am I right?

786
00:47:56,268 --> 00:47:59,167
You should've seen the video.

787
00:47:59,408 --> 00:48:00,936
It's filmed it in a way that could easily be misunderstood.

788
00:48:00,937 --> 00:48:03,506
We can keep the cult members quiet.

789
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:05,006
Why are you making a fuss?

790
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,046
(Cheonji Dongsan)

791
00:48:06,047 --> 00:48:07,808
It's because we're getting listed in the stock market soon.

792
00:48:08,078 --> 00:48:10,077
If our company gets listed at a high price,

793
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:11,948
it'll be better for Cheonji Dongsan too.

794
00:48:13,147 --> 00:48:15,288
Please make an exception just this once.

795
00:48:32,437 --> 00:48:34,637
(Professor Seo's wife)

796
00:48:34,638 --> 00:48:36,207
(Hello. This is Dong Gi Jun. If you can't believe me,)

797
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:37,538
(check his bank account. A record for the five-member society...)

798
00:48:40,107 --> 00:48:41,807
You need to pay the hospital bills for this month...

799
00:48:41,808 --> 00:48:43,578
to extend the hospitalization.

800
00:48:44,877 --> 00:48:47,848
Our financial situation is not good due to the long hospitalization.

801
00:48:48,417 --> 00:48:51,658
Please wait until next week.

802
00:49:00,297 --> 00:49:03,498
Have you not received Professor Seo's phone yet?

803
00:49:10,308 --> 00:49:12,308
Because of the recent case I've taken on,

804
00:49:13,678 --> 00:49:17,047
I've been pondering about what trust really is.

805
00:49:19,317 --> 00:49:21,717
It feels like the most secure prison in the world.

806
00:49:23,217 --> 00:49:24,717
You can't escape...

807
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:26,857
until you realize it.

808
00:49:31,257 --> 00:49:32,897
What are you trying to say?

809
00:49:34,498 --> 00:49:35,638
Professor Seo...

810
00:49:36,038 --> 00:49:37,966
must've invested in the five-member society...

811
00:49:37,967 --> 00:49:39,268
that Noh Yul Seong created.

812
00:49:40,737 --> 00:49:42,308
That's how he became one of the members.

813
00:49:42,937 --> 00:49:46,448
If he invested,

814
00:49:47,948 --> 00:49:49,317
then what?

815
00:49:50,078 --> 00:49:52,917
You should think carefully why Noh Yul Seong...

816
00:49:54,087 --> 00:49:55,487
kept quiet.

817
00:49:56,958 --> 00:49:58,987
I'll wait until...

818
00:50:00,558 --> 00:50:02,027
you start doubting...

00:50:03,098 --> 00:50:04,228
Chayul Law Firm.

820
00:50:17,578 --> 00:50:18,638
You saw what happened today and yesterday, right?

821
00:50:18,737 --> 00:50:21,506
Playing games is over for them. The end!

822
00:50:21,507 --> 00:50:23,047
When did they even start?

823
00:50:23,647 --> 00:50:25,948
I should give you a lesson about love.

824
00:50:26,317 --> 00:50:27,546
Where's Kwon Dae Gi?

825
00:50:27,547 --> 00:50:28,716
It's a misunderstanding.

826
00:50:28,717 --> 00:50:31,216
- It's not his name too. - Is it you?

827
00:50:31,217 --> 00:50:32,356

How dare you seduce my wife?

830
00:50:39,328 --> 00:50:41,067
- You little... - Seriously, stop!

831
00:50:42,067 --> 00:50:43,896
- Who are you? - He is flirty,

832
00:50:43,897 --> 00:50:46,007
but he won't date a married woman.

833
00:50:46,368 --> 00:50:48,007
Tell him.

834
00:50:48,808 --> 00:50:50,308
He didn't know.

835
00:50:50,678 --> 00:50:51,678
Honey?

836
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:54,477
For real. I didn't know.

837
00:50:54,478 --> 00:50:57,146
Let me give you a good punch. You jerk!

- Come here! - Sir!

841
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:04,158
- For goodness' sake! - Honey, calm down!

842
00:51:11,928 --> 00:51:12,928
Put this on.

843
00:51:46,527 --> 00:51:49,198
It's camomile tea. It'll make you calmer.

844
00:51:53,337 --> 00:51:56,277
This can't be true. She was married.

845
00:51:57,138 --> 00:51:58,337
Thanks, anyway.

846
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:00,948
I'm touched...

847
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:02,947
that you trusted me.

848
00:52:02,948 --> 00:52:05,448
I won't tell anyone so don't worry.

849
00:52:07,288 --> 00:52:09,087

Every time you date someone,

856
00:53:00,507 --> 00:53:02,377
ask for a family relationship certificate.

857

865
00:53:46,917 --> 00:53:50,787
anything wrong about my interview?

866
00:53:50,788 --> 00:53:53,527
Who gave you the permission to have an interview like that?

867
00:53:54,487 --> 00:53:55,657
You didn't even discuss with me.

- "You?" - I have...

870

nothing to gain from you.

872
00:54:12,848 --> 00:54:14,208
Look at this scum.

873
00:54:20,987 --> 00:54:22,018
Come in.

876
00:54:36,297 --> 00:54:37,297

(SEOHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL)

878
00:54:45,948 --> 00:54:48,448
I checked my husband's bank account.

879

889
00:55:33,328 --> 00:55:34,357
I can recover the data.

00:56:04,917 --> 00:56:05,958
My goodness.

902
00:56:06,587 --> 00:56:09,728
You're right. The last person who called him was Noh Yul Seong.

903
00:56:09,857 --> 00:56:11,127
The number ending with 2711.

904
00:56:11,527 --> 00:56:12,527
Wait.

905
00:56:14,127 --> 00:56:15,967
November 10, 4am.

906
00:56:16,837 --> 00:56:17,868
It's right before his suicide.

907
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:52,098
CEO Noh, please give me back one million dollars that I invested.

908
00:56:52,198 --> 00:56:53,466
It's urgent.

909
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:54,808
(CEO Noh)

910
00:56:59,507 --> 00:57:02,107
(CEO Noh)

911
00:57:03,777 --> 00:57:06,686
I can't call. I need it immediately.

912
00:57:06,687 --> 00:57:07,948
I'll send you my bank account number.

913
00:57:17,158 --> 00:57:19,667
Professor Seo is under investigation by the prosecutors.

914
00:57:20,368 --> 00:57:21,828
What's Na Yu Mi's case?

915
00:57:22,228 --> 00:57:23,397
He's a witness.

916
00:57:31,078 --> 00:57:32,178
Where are you?

917
00:57:34,748 --> 00:57:35,777
At my school.

918
00:57:38,848 --> 00:57:39,848
Answer my call.

919
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:50,627
(CEO Noh)

920
00:57:53,397 --> 00:57:57,368
What was automatically recorded on his phone has been restored.

921
00:58:00,007 --> 00:58:02,436
(Call recording: CEO Noh)

922
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,437
Hello.

923
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,177
Are you trying to come clean in front of the prosecutors...

924
00:58:06,178 --> 00:58:07,547
after you withdraw your investments?

925
00:58:08,877 --> 00:58:10,876
You're a witness.

926
00:58:10,877 --> 00:58:13,018
Why are you scared?

927
00:58:14,187 --> 00:58:17,158
The prosecutors requested a search and seizure warrant.

928
00:58:17,187 --> 00:58:18,658
It'll be ready in an hour.

929
00:58:19,627 --> 00:58:21,127
I have recordings on my phone.

930
00:58:21,587 --> 00:58:24,627
Regarding change of purpose and bribery.

931
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:27,567
You're mad.

932
00:58:30,598 --> 00:58:31,598
(Professor Seo)

933
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,138
Pull me out of this.

934
00:58:33,937 --> 00:58:37,138
Just withdraw my money.

935
00:58:38,377 --> 00:58:40,007
I'm not like you.

936
00:58:40,208 --> 00:58:42,007
That's my entire savings.

937
00:58:42,848 --> 00:58:45,047
What is he talking about?

938
00:58:45,417 --> 00:58:49,658
Professor Seo wants to come clean. What shall we do?

939
00:58:49,757 --> 00:58:50,757
To who?

940
00:58:51,357 --> 00:58:53,058
- To the prosecutors. - What?

941
00:58:53,487 --> 00:58:55,788
What a nut job. Are you crazy?

942
00:58:58,728 --> 00:59:01,198
Who's against taking Professor Seo out of our group?

943
00:59:14,377 --> 00:59:16,216
Between us, betrayal means death.

944
00:59:16,217 --> 00:59:17,547
From now on, you will die alone.

945
00:59:18,277 --> 00:59:19,348
CEO Noh.

946
00:59:30,357 --> 00:59:32,967
(CEO Noh)

947
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:41,936
In 30 minutes, your wife, daughter,

948
00:59:41,937 --> 00:59:43,737
and mother will all see this video.

949
00:59:44,507 --> 00:59:46,348
So escape,

950
00:59:46,448 --> 00:59:48,377
or die. Choose one.

951
01:00:40,598 --> 01:00:42,498
(Call recording: CEO Noh)

952
01:00:44,897 --> 01:00:47,808
(SMS history)

953
01:00:50,737 --> 01:00:52,078
He was in full acceleration mode.

954
01:00:56,147 --> 01:00:57,777
I didn't think he'd go to that extent.

955
01:01:02,857 --> 01:01:03,857
Let's go together.

956
01:01:04,958 --> 01:01:06,587
We should step on the brake for him.

957
01:01:15,498 --> 01:01:16,566
Why are you here?

958
01:01:16,567 --> 01:01:19,137
Oh, I just missed you.

959
01:01:19,138 --> 01:01:20,138
What are you talking about?

960
01:01:27,408 --> 01:01:28,408
Here.

961
01:01:29,078 --> 01:01:31,547
These are Professor Seo's phone and forensic files.

962
01:01:32,678 --> 01:01:34,587
Oh, yes.

963
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,087
It's the evidence to prove...

964
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:39,357
that Noh Yul Seong made Seo Woong Jin commit suicide.

965
01:01:39,857 --> 01:01:41,288
CEO Noh did that to Professor Seo?

966
01:01:42,797 --> 01:01:44,928
There wasn't much in Na Yu Mi's case file.

967
01:01:45,558 --> 01:01:48,098
So I'm digging his involvement in Professor Seo's suicide first.

968
01:01:48,598 --> 01:01:51,098
That's a good move.

969
01:01:53,467 --> 01:01:55,337
Jin Woo. Prosecutor Park.

970
01:01:58,078 --> 01:02:00,578
Please put Noh Yul Seong in jail...

971
01:02:01,848 --> 01:02:03,147
and unload my anger.

972
01:02:03,917 --> 01:02:05,247
- All right. - Okay.

973
01:02:05,248 --> 01:02:06,248
- Goodbye. - Disciple of justice,

974
01:02:06,249 --> 01:02:07,288
- Prosecutor Park. - Yes.

975
01:02:36,978 --> 01:02:39,848
(Seo Woong Jin's forensic files)

976
01:02:47,257 --> 01:02:48,388
The phone too.

977
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:06,277
Don't worry about the casino entry records.

978
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:10,678
We'll cover it for you.

979
01:03:23,127 --> 01:03:24,228
It's done.

980
01:03:24,558 --> 01:03:25,598
Good job.

981
01:03:27,067 --> 01:03:28,828
Make sure to clean up the forensic company,

982
01:03:29,397 --> 01:03:31,268
their office,

983
01:03:31,768 --> 01:03:33,268
and their houses...

984
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:35,237
so that there aren't any copies.

985
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:39,237
Okay.

986
01:04:11,507 --> 01:04:12,978
(Kim Sa Ra)

987
01:04:22,748 --> 01:04:24,357
For goodness' sake.

988
01:04:27,527 --> 01:04:30,828
Bom, do you know Sa Ra's exact house address?

989
01:04:31,027 --> 01:04:32,297
Please send it to me.

990
01:04:32,558 --> 01:04:33,627
Is everything okay?

991
01:04:33,728 --> 01:04:35,566
I need to check something. Hurry.

992
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:36,567
Okay.

993
01:04:46,948 --> 01:04:49,177
The phone is turned off.

994
01:04:49,178 --> 01:04:51,277
Please leave a message after the tone.

995
01:04:51,377 --> 01:04:53,618
You will be charged.

996
01:05:07,328 --> 01:05:08,397
Kim Sa Ra.

997
01:05:14,808 --> 01:05:15,868
Kim Sa Ra.

998
01:06:16,698 --> 01:06:19,638
Lawyer Dong. Open your eyes. Lawyer Dong!

999
01:06:24,837 --> 01:06:25,837
Gi Jun!

1000
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:39,587
(Queen of Divorce)

1001
01:07:08,118 --> 01:07:10,716
Let's find the best solution for Ms. Kim.

1002
01:07:10,717 --> 01:07:13,788
Noh Yul Seong is supporting Assemblyman Ha Hyun Ho.

1003
01:07:14,058 --> 01:07:15,856
What can Kim Young A do now?

1004
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:17,797
It's like getting a death sentence in politics.

1005
01:07:18,357 --> 01:07:20,328
I'm making a difficult decision.

1006
01:07:20,428 --> 01:07:23,467
I accept my husband's request to divorce me.

1007
01:07:23,868 --> 01:07:27,467
The solution for this round is a custody battle.

1008
01:07:27,868 --> 01:07:28,967
Demolishing Cheonji.

1009
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:30,208
So we will...

1010
01:07:31,837 --> 01:07:32,978
be very detailed.

1011
01:07:35,147 --> 01:07:36,347
I've made a mistake worthy of death.

1012
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:39,546
Why did you when you can't even die?

1013
01:07:39,547 --> 01:07:43,018
It's not just me. Sa Ra, are you all right?

1014
01:07:45,888 --> 01:07:47,158
No, I'm not.
