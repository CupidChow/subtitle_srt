Stall a bit.

14
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,320
Come back here at dawn, and let her out.

15
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:36,260
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,499
- Turn the car around.
- Pardon?

17
00:01:49,669 --> 00:01:51,108

Gosh. Are you all right?

22
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,328
Can you talk? Say something.

23
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:12,490
Yes. My voice is still as fine as ever.

00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,299
Did you get hurt anywhere?

25
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,299
Well,

about you.

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,530

Gosh. It smells great.

This shows why it's important to have a clean breakup with women.

58
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,658
You should have bought her an expensive bag...

59
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:02,999
and then tossed her out.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,200
Or you should have taught her a lesson to keep her quiet.

61

I'm against that.

70
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,669

71
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,680

135

It's bitter because you're drinking alone.

You said you were going to put up with him.

156
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,219
People did that when the average lifespan was 60.

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,180
I had never been slapped in my life.

185
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,680
This will be the last time too.

186
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:44,390
What are the chances of meeting a mother-in-law like her again?

187
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:50,759
Mom. Please stay out of my business.

188
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,290
Do you expect me to turn into a fool just like you?

189
00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:55,930
Like a fool who got played and had to pay her alimony?

190
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,968
The first thing we must do is to separate the lawyer...

191
00:13:58,969 --> 00:14:00,839
from Kim Sa Ra.

192
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,040
Do you still have feelings for her?

193
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:08,640
That lawyer is Dong Gi Jun.

194
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,509
The prosecutor who handled Professor Seo's case.

195
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,249
The one who jumped off.

196
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,180
So what? Why can't the two of them work...

197
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,820
You're the reason.

198
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,359
Gosh. Come on.

199
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
You know,

200
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,069
I got a divorce and remarried just like you told me to.

201
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,509
But look at me now.

202
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,450
Look at the situation I'm in right now. It's a mess.

203
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:52,290
I'll do it my way starting now.

204
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,459
Are you saying it's my fault?

205
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,070
My husband tumbled off the wheelchair again.

206
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:08,769
He was trying to move on his own...

207
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,599
because he didn't want to burden me.

208
00:15:11,469 --> 00:15:14,040
Honey, you must call me next time. Okay?

209
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:15,709
Okay. I will.

210
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,879
How do I look today?

211
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:17,979
You look beautiful.

212
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:21,579
The case involves the couple, Kang Chul and Choi La Hee.

213
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:24,488
The husband got into Harvard University in the US.

214
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:26,348
He was paralysed from the waist down in a car accident.

215
00:15:26,349 --> 00:15:27,588
But he established his business with determination...

216
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:28,890
and became a successful entrepreneur.

217
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,030
His wife is a streamer.

218
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,159
She posts videos of their day-to-day lives.

219
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,800
She mostly uploads videos about how she takes care of her husband.

220
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:39,999
They met on a reality dating show.

221
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,540
They were interested in each other from the first meeting.

222
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,469
They got married in four months.

223
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,780
But why does she want a divorce? Is their marriage for show?

224
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,309
Right after they got married,

225
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,650
the wife had been a victim of his jealous delusion.

226
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:54,549
The husband feels wrongfully accused and doesn't want a divorce.

227
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,349
Gosh. I'm sorry I'm late.

228
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,690
(Kang Chul, Choi La Hee)

229
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:07,228
Is the client the husband or the wife?

230
00:16:07,229 --> 00:16:09,430
- The wife.
- Will we take on this case?

231
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,300
I plan to meet with her. Why?

232
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,700
Hello.

233
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:28,650
Hello, Lawyer Dong.

234
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:31,719
Hello.

235
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,089
Hello. I'm the team leader of SOLUTION. My name is Kim Sa Ra.

236
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:03,979
How does your husband usually suspect your infidelity?

237
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,920
He watches my every move with his eyes peeled.

238
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,499
You've never...

239
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,799
experienced that before, right?

240
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,670
You don't know how it feels unless you've been a victim of it.

241
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:40,190
Did you install this yourself?

242
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,630
What's that?

243
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:49,799
It's a location tracker.

244
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:54,140
Gosh. What's this doing on my car?

245
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,170
Ask your husband.

246
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:58,809
He gets so insecure even when he gives me my allowance...

247
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:01,239
in case I spend it to cheat on him.

248
00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:05,249
Can I ask how much you get as your allowance?

249
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,680
Without the living expenses, he gives me 5,000 dollars.

250
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:10,049
Isn't that awful?

251
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:15,160
He doesn't understand that I need money to keep up appearances.

252
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,890
Can't this be grounds for a divorce?

253
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,390
No.

254
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,799
Then what else?

255
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,268
Right. Sometimes, he inspects my socks in the laundry hamper.

256
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:29,969
Why does he inspect your socks?

257
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,939
If I were to put them back again after taking them off when I'm out,

258
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,940
he would be able to tell.

259
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:37,380
Because of the heels.

260
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:39,279
You could tell?

261
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
Is that true?

262
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:44,450
I see. It does leave a trace.

263
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:48,789
I guess 5,000 dollars isn't enough for someone.

264
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,190
That handbag alone is 40,000 dollars.

265
00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:52,289
No way.

266
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:54,900
It's amazing that you know the price just by looking at it.

267
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,100
So when did your husband start suspecting you?

268
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,910
It's because of you, Lawyer Dong.

269
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:08,080
Lawyer Dong...

270
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,039
Me?

271
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,049
Do you guys know each other?

272
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,319
I see. You didn't know.

273
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,289
We were in a serious relationship before.

274
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:24,189
Gosh. It wasn't a serious relationship.

275
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,190
Let me explain.

276
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:27,600
My husband saw an old photo of Gi Jun and me together.

277
00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:31,630
I had no idea that it was on my computer.

278
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,298
So will this problem be solved...

279
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,110
if I tell your husband that nothing is going on?

280
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,519
Can I talk to Lawyer Dong for a moment?

281
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:54,860
Of course.

282
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:20,380
How long has it been since our breakup?

283
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,019
About four years?

284
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,049
You know, it's not too late to withdraw your request from us.

285
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:29,259
Why would I do that?

286
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,130
Did you come here on purpose?

287
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:39,130
Of course.

288
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:43,200
Can you take this case?

289
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:47,009
I don't want to tell other people about my pathetic married life.

290
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,748
But still. This is...

291
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:53,850
Are you worried about your girlfriend?

292
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,449
- Who?
- If not,

293
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:58,450
why can't you take my case? Please?

294
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,360
No. You haven't changed one bit.

295
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:04,288
Nothing is predictable with you.

296
00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:05,789
Isn't that the charm you fell for?

297
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,890
(Latheteresa)

298
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,430
(Everything about splits)

299
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,670
Gosh. You startled me.

300
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:51,739
My talk with Gi Jun ran slightly longer than expected.

301
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,809
Can I get a cup of coffee before I go?

302
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,880
But you know why Gi Jun came here, right?

303
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,180
Did Lawyer Dong...

304
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,519
- say something?
- Oh, my. You don't know.

305
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,719
Don't worry about it. I'll take this to go.

306
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,309
We just briefly met.

307
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:04,910
We just brushed past each other.

308
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:06,610
Right.

309
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:08,819
Well, it's not like...

310
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,519
I would not have met anyone up until now.

311
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:13,350
Did I say anything?

312
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,190
So...

313
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,959
how was La Hee usually like?

314
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:24,569
I'd say she has a daring charm.

315
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:29,269
Or should I say she does things however she wants?

316
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,769
I don't really remember, to be honest.

317
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,679
How many girls have you met...

318
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,739
for you not to remember?

319
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,650
I don't remember anyone else except Kim Sa Ra.

320
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,850
Gosh.

321
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,959
Should we...

322
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:50,860
give up on Choi La Hee?

323
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,660
- It must be uncomfortable for you.
- No.

324
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,728
I'm totally fine with her.

325
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:57,700
I'm worried you might feel uncomfortable about it.

326
00:23:58,499 --> 00:24:01,299
It's hard to grasp what is to come with her as our client too.

327
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,968
But she wants help from someone she knows.

328
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:07,979
She asked for my help.

329
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:11,650
Oh, right.

330
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,950
If my partner wants to help, I must do it.

331
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,419
Don't worry too much about the two of us.

332
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,450
Never.

333
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,459
I get it.

334
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,959
Why would I do that?

335
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,799
Right. I get it.

336
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,749
It's cold.

337
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:50,079
It's cold indeed.

338
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,589
Today, my husband, CEO Kang...

339
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,318
got a burn on his hand.

340
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,859
Take a look at this. It looks painful, doesn't it?

341
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,458
For now, we've cooled it down with some cold water.

342
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:01,399
It has blistered up now.

343
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,359
- It stings, doesn't it?
- Yes. It stings a bit.

344
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,228
We're going to use this bandage.

345
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:07,200
It has a cooling effect.

346
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,269
She was the one that wanted a divorce, right?

347
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,539
There was a video with a cut on the forehead a few days ago.

348
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,008
Now, it's a burn?

349
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:17,808
The injuries happen too often.

350
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:20,249
The treatment videos come up twice a week.

351
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:22,479
He gets hurt every 3 to 4 days?

352
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,379
This doesn't make any sense.

353
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,419
Does this look normal?

354
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,919
(- I'd love a wife like her. - I'm always rooting for you.)

355
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,120
(- He got hurt again. - Oh, no. A burn?)

356
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,459
(Choi La Hee)

357
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:40,100
Answer it.

358
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,640
Okay.

359
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:43,670
(Answer call)

360
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:45,469
Hey.

361
00:25:45,739 --> 00:25:47,739
I knew you'd still use this number.

362
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,479
Shall we have dinner tonight?

363
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:54,778
I'll call you back.

(Choi La Hee)

365
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,119
Please refrain from personal calls with the client.

366
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,830
Oh, of course.

367
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,839
Oh, hello.

368
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,200
- Take a seat.
- Thanks.

369
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,640
Goodness.

370
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,579
We won't be getting a divorce.

371
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,539
Your wife contacted us.

372
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,049
She behaves this way whenever she feels upset at me.

373
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,749
Did you see our show yesterday?

374
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:32,150
Did we look like people who wanted a divorce?

375
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,488
I'm sorry,

376
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:41,930
but have you ever seen me? Or it could have been a photo.

377
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,729
No. Have we met before?

378
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:51,670
My husband saw an old photo of Gi Jun and me together.

379
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:53,170
What is it that you want to know?

380
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:56,640
Has she mentioned anything about delusional jealousy?

381
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:01,950
My wife will do anything for views.

382
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,549
She has a meal with the biggest donator every week.

383
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,920
I found that suspicious for a while.

384
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:11,258
Don't you know there are weird rumours about you?

385
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:12,430
You believe all that gossip?

386
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:20,670
If you just trust me, everything will be fine.

387
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,439
I found out it wasn't true,

388
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,739
and that was the end of it.

389
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,610
How did you get that burn?

390
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:30,080
I'm really sorry,

391
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:32,910
but is that burn real?

392
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,420
Gosh.

393
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:41,018
Four days ago, you hurt your forehead.

394
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:42,788
Last week, you hurt your ankle.

395
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:44,519
And before that, you hurt your finger.

396
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,860
You get yourself hurt quite often.

397
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,068
I move around a lot although it's hard for me to.

398
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:54,100
That is why I get hurt often.

399
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,380
The husband or wife. Who do you think is lying?

400
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:04,779
Do you think it's Choi La Hee?

401
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,049
Well, she lied about the photo.

402
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,620
Does she have other feelings for you?

403
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:15,359
I guess things are possible if they get a divorce.

404
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,390
My gosh.

405
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,559
You're walking in seven-league boots with your imagination.

406
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,130
Why are you two here?

407
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,569
You met my husband without telling me?

408
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:35,239
Gi Jun, are you doubting me?

409
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,680
I just wanted to make things clear.

410
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:39,809
That was why.

411
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:43,049
Let's go.

412
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,049
I have something to tell you!

413
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,999
You may take your time.

414
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,430
I'll get a cab.

415
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,559
What are you doing?

416
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:33,430
What's wrong with you?

417
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,910
Shall we spend some time together?

418
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,069
No, thanks.

419
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,380
Ms. Choi La Hee, you're my client.

420
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:45,880
If you keep this going...

421
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:48,679
I was just joking.

422
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,380
Why have you become so lame? I was just making a joke.

423
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,519
Get back to parking your car. I'm off.

424
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:56,690
Gosh.

425
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,249
I told you it wouldn't work on someone like him.

426
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,680
Gosh. I want 30 percent more added to the contract.

427
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:23,749
My head hurts from all this, and I don't even want a divorce!

428
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,420
Did I tell you to get a divorce?

429
00:30:25,549 --> 00:30:27,419
Just get them away from each other while meeting them.

430
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,488
Is it that hard for you?

431
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:30,389
Gosh, you scared me. Who are you?

432
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,789
Let's go with 20 percent more. That's all I'll offer.

433
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:34,589
But you have to sleep with Dong Gi Jun.

434
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,900
You must leave evidence.

435

00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,189
Why do I even care?

438
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,589
- Hey.
- Hey, listen up.

439
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,958
Lawyer Dong got calls from three other law firms.

440
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,399
He gave all of them up to work with you.

441
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,799
- What about that?
- That means...

442
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,168
there's something he wants from you.

443
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:20,008

00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:22,939
- Remains in my heart - Want what? I'm hanging up.

445
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,908
But you know why Gi Jun came here, right?

446
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:30,050
Oh, my. You don't know.

447
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,229
I'm not here as a client.

448
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,100
So don't be so harsh on me.

449
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:50,999
You're drunk. Let's talk tomorrow.

450

I really missed you.

What do I do?

Can't you just...

456
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,640

when things don't go her way.

461
00:32:45,459 --> 00:32:46,630
She would get angry.

462
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,769

Get off me.

469
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,759
Is this what you want?

470
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,790
I'm sorry, but it's a no for me.

471
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,820
So stop.

472
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,258
Gi Jun, it's me, Choi La Hee!

473
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:56,259
It's a no because you're Choi La Hee! Get it?

474

Get out.

Until I see you on your knees for me.

with a guy who doesn't want anything with a girl after him?

480
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:33,369
Why don't you give me some of your tips, Secretary Baek? Gosh.

- Says who?

Get ready to get sued.

Gosh. She has quite a story too.

Of course. Don't mind me.

542
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,299
It could be an invasion of privacy.

543
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,869
Just because it's a family issue,

544
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,840
many misfortunes get suppressed.

545
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:07,209
Do you think that's okay?

546
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,780
Let's start with the Munchausen syndrome.

547
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,720
Let's find out if this is a real issue with them.

548
00:39:23,689 --> 00:39:25,360
I just won't get a divorce.

549
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:28,229
"Just?" Is getting a divorce some kind of game?

550
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,199
Then get a divorce.

551
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,868
Let's talk. Where are you going?

552
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:35,869
What are you grabbing at?

553
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,340
Oh, gosh! Do you know how much this is?

554
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,340
My baby!

555
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,749
We're at the door.

556
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,380
Yes. It would be great if you could spare some time.

557
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:53,249
Sorry?

558
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:05,829
- Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm okay.

559
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,769
I apologize. It's my secretary's day off.

560
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,609
I did a brief research. The purses and bracelets...

561
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,110
were all worth around 10,000 dollars.

562
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,479
How much does she make with her Internet shows?

563
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,220
It's nowhere near to get her those things.

564
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,289
May I ask you two for help?

565
00:40:33,189 --> 00:40:35,700
Please confirm one thing with us first.

566
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:40,630
Has your wife ever hurt you on purpose...

567
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:44,039
or used violence on you?

568
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,039
That has never happened.

569
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,009
That makes no sense. He's just used to violence.

570
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,510
She left her husband on the floor.

571
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,380
It's a problem that he's keeping everything to himself.

572
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:04,619
And about that high-end purse.

573
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:07,160
I was told it wasn't sold to just anyone.

574
00:41:13,669 --> 00:41:18,300
It's a purse that's sold to those who have spent over 100,000 dollars.

575
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,240
That won't be enough with the money she gets.

576
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:24,708
Having a meal with the biggest donator.

577
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:25,709
It's still going on.

578
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,280
A sponsor?

579
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,978
These are the products used to take care of CEO Kang.

- Here are the medical products!

582
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,119
So this is...

583
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,828
You have to beat Supercar98 to win a meal.

584
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:42,930

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,360
I love you!

586
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,570
You're the strongest contender for the meal! My gosh!

587
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:52,869
It's to focus better.

588
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,070
Focus.

589
00:41:55,169 --> 00:41:56,180
Focus.

590
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,880
Here's one for you to focus, Ms. Kim.

591
00:41:59,749 --> 00:42:01,110
- Can you see this?
- Focus.

592
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:02,979
- Let's do this.
- All right.

Oh, no! I'm out of ammo.

00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,418
- It's over our budget.
- How much do you need?

604
00:43:12,419 --> 00:43:15,450
Oh, no. We need a time-out.

605
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:18,459
Come on. Don't you know my motto?

Always look intelligent.

618
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,329
Become a fool in front of a woman.

619
00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:31,329
You know I'm the worst at those two things.

620

622

Hi.

Don't try to cut the steak with force, but try to slice it well.

625

Don't smile. You look like a fool.

626
00:45:04,229 --> 00:45:06,530
No, Dae Gi. You look cute when you smile.

627
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:11,639
But...

628
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:14,869
have we seen each other before?

629
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:22,720
I don't have such a common face.

630
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:24,380
I feel disappointed.

Yes? Start what?

634
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,169
A fun game.

635
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,039
Let's call this a blank check.

636
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,649

Write whatever you want.

638
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:57,880
Then, I'll...

639
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,550

Yes. According to our research.

643
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,269
After the accident, my family and friends...

644
00:46:22,169 --> 00:46:25,280
have always been afraid that I might be discouraged.

645
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,149
How disappointing would it be for them to know that I have...

646
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,419
such a ridiculous married life?

647
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:33,419
Do not give up on your life...

648
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:35,849
just to consider others' perspectives and positions.

649
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,589
Would this have happened...

650
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,430
even if I was healthy?

651
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:45,030
She'd have been the same even if I were her husband.

652
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,269
It's not your fault.

654
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,180
Both of your suspicions were correct.

655
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,050
She hurt me to film the video.

656
00:47:01,309 --> 00:47:03,119
She's obsessed with the number of views.

657
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,919
If I refuse, she makes a fuss about filing for divorce.

658
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:12,490
I wish you to file for divorce.

659
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,058
Whether to forgive your wife's privacy...

660
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:17,800
is your choice,

661
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:19,130
but violence is not.

662
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:21,729
We can't let this slip.

663
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,070
I'll make sure you get compensated for all the unfairness.

664
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,110
I didn't want to divorce.

665
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,579
I wanted to show everyone that I'm living a happy life.

666
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:42,349
I truly understand...

667
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:44,660
how you feel.

668
00:47:46,829 --> 00:47:48,090
Don't be afraid.

669
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,729
It's fine to be divorced.

670
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,630
Even if you get divorced, the world won't collapse.

671
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,689
I admit it.

672
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:20,430
Not everything about family matters is private.

673
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,930
Why do you think CEO Kang...

674
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:27,800
endured until now?

675
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:31,139
I'm not sure.

676
00:48:31,539 --> 00:48:34,039
He has a sufficient career,

677
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:35,939
wealth, and fame.

678
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:41,849
If he just stays quiet,

679
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,849
he can become someone without problems.

680
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,530
I was like him when I was married.

681
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,439
I wanted to look fine externally.

682
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:11,539
So I felt more drawn to him.

683
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,550
Since it felt like looking at my past.

684
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:24,119
Gosh. I knew everything about you in the past.

685
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:28,530

Shall we eat ramyeon now?

687
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:42,269
Why is it so mushy and soggy?

688
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:46,349
La Hee's eyes will turn like that tomorrow, right?

689
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:47,709
Being so furious.

690
00:49:48,709 --> 00:49:50,150
She should be punished for what she has done.

691
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,249
In the most her-like way possible.

692
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:02,889

- It's amazing.

- Cheers.
- Cheers.

Thank you.

700
00:50:32,119 --> 00:50:33,189
Look at her husband.

701
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:34,660
Thank you all for coming.

702
00:50:35,189 --> 00:50:37,459
- Congratulations!
- Thank you for coming.

703
00:50:38,959 --> 00:50:41,900
Oh, my goodness. Isn't this dress from Andres Gang?

704
00:50:42,769 --> 00:50:44,400
Yes, that's the dress.

705
00:50:45,769 --> 00:50:48,708
My husband sent a person to Paris to get it for me.

706
00:50:48,709 --> 00:50:50,478
He's amazing.

707
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:51,740
It's so pretty.

708
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:53,910
My goodness.

709
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,829
Isn't she wearing a limited edition?

710
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,180
Where did you get your bag and bracelet from?

711
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:27,709
Answer me!

712
00:51:28,979 --> 00:51:30,050
Honey.

713
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,380
Honey.

714
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:36,489
Shall we renew our vows for our third anniversary?

715
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:37,788
Don't change the topic.

716
00:51:37,789 --> 00:51:39,859
Let me increase the view counts.

717
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,089
It's my wish...

718
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:42,759
to hit 100,000 views.

719
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,728
- That many people won't view it.
- We can do noise marketing.

720
00:51:45,729 --> 00:51:47,799
You have that blind date rumour.

721
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,868
You see, people say I'm not only eating.

722
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:52,399
They say my private life is complicated.

723
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,869
Because of that, the happiest day of my life...

724
00:51:56,269 --> 00:51:59,038
turns into such a miserable ordeal.

725
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:02,050
And then it ends dramatically and romantically.

726
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,849
We'll hit 100,000 views.

727
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,289
How does it sound? You're on it, right?

728
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,019
Renewing vows sounds good.

729
00:52:13,289 --> 00:52:16,498
You should offer to get it ready from A to Z.

730
00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:18,728
She even wants to cast actors who can play troublemakers.

731
00:52:18,729 --> 00:52:20,328
There's one subscriber who ended up getting a divorce...

732
00:52:20,329 --> 00:52:21,700
because he sponsored her.

733
00:52:22,669 --> 00:52:23,740
I see.

734
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:26,570
Let's invite the wife.

735
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:30,510
Are we making a documentary instead of a show?

736
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:31,709
The solution for this time...

737
00:52:33,809 --> 00:52:34,849
is GCOS.

738
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,849
Getting caught up in one's own schemes.

739
00:52:40,249 --> 00:52:41,289
Oh, my.

740
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:42,919
Where's Choi La Hee?

741
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,289
What's going on?

742
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,359
Come out, mistress!

743
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,459
Good. Make it more chaotic!

744
00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:50,229
My husband...

745
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:55,200
- Honey, is she one of the actors?
- Come out!

746
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:58,139
This feels so real.

747
00:52:58,599 --> 00:52:59,939
She's there!

748
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,740
What?

749
00:53:05,479 --> 00:53:06,550
- Oh, my!
- My goodness!

750
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,419
- Hey!
- My hair!

751
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:15,049
- Hey! It really hurts!
- It hurts!

752
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:16,389
- Hey!
- Hey!

753
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:18,559
- Make it pitiful.
- Pitiful?

754
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,959
- Oh, my goodness.
- You...

755
00:53:24,959 --> 00:53:26,160
- My goodness.
- Excuse me.

756
00:53:26,329 --> 00:53:27,430
She's running away.

757
00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:29,599
It hurts so much.

758
00:53:29,729 --> 00:53:32,639
It feels so real.

759
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,209
Come on.

760
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,280
How's the view count?

761
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,180
It's 80,000 views.

762
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,449
Good. Now it's your turn.

763
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:52,119
Tell them you always brought me to your blind dates...

764
00:53:52,419 --> 00:53:53,860
and that you love me, okay?

765
00:53:55,389 --> 00:53:56,459
What are waiting for?

766
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:58,300
For goodness' sake.

767
00:53:58,499 --> 00:53:59,999
- Is she okay?
- Really?

768
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,240
Testing.

769
00:54:04,769 --> 00:54:06,510
You're all so mean.

770
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,039
My husband worked so hard for today.

771
00:54:12,539 --> 00:54:14,149
Are you recording this?

772
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,150
Honey.

773
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:30,259
I planned this party because I had...

774
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:31,530
something to say to my wife.

775
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,829
Could you do me a favour, please?

776
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:38,269
I hope you do.

777
00:54:38,369 --> 00:54:39,369
Of course.

778
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:43,780
I can do any of your favours.

779
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:46,579
- Oh, my goodness.
- Gosh. It's so sweet.

780
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,018
- Divorce me.
- Yes.

781
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:51,220
- Divorce?
- Divorce?

782
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,650
- Suddenly a divorce?
- Why?

783
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:56,220
- What did you say?
- We'll reach 100,000 views!

784
00:55:01,329 --> 00:55:03,760
You must be happy to have high view counts.

785
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,369
- View counts?
- View counts?

786
00:55:09,269 --> 00:55:11,340
You! You little...

787
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:13,309
For goodness' sake!

788
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:16,010
Gosh!

789
00:55:16,979 --> 00:55:18,010
Kill me.

790
00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:20,910
Do you want to be a boiled chicken?

791
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:23,550
Put it down!

792
00:55:24,249 --> 00:55:25,820
You're the worst!

793
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:32,059
Who are you?

794
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:38,760
When I see boiling water, my blood boils.

795
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,700
You crazy wench!

796
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,939
You should be thankful that you didn't turn into a boiled chicken.

797
00:55:53,139 --> 00:55:54,150
You...

798
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,189
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

799
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,860
- Record it.
- Oh, gosh.

800
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:06,889
- This is crazy.
- My goodness.

801
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,268
You're getting arrested for domestic violence...

802
00:56:17,269 --> 00:56:18,269
and violation of the Disabled Welfare Act.

803
00:56:18,939 --> 00:56:20,509
Did you scheme all this?

804
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,110
You have the right to have an attorney.

805
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,510
You'll have a chance to explain yourself.

806
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,550
You have the right to have an attorney and a chance to explain.

807
00:56:28,579 --> 00:56:29,950
- Then you can...
- I decline.

808
00:56:30,419 --> 00:56:32,150
I'm not going to defend you.

809
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:36,619
Honey! This isn't right!

810
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:39,459
Honey, can you live without me with your legs like that?

811
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:45,829
Shall we stop here?

812
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:53,740
I planned this divorce party with so much effort.

813
00:57:00,309 --> 00:57:03,749
Shall we enjoy the party now?

814
00:57:08,189 --> 00:57:09,220
Oh, my goodness.

815
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:15,630
Here.

816
00:57:22,369 --> 00:57:23,369
Kang Bom!

817
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:26,039
You were so excited for this solution.

818
00:57:34,579 --> 00:57:36,249
What's with that burn?

819
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,050
I got this scar...

820
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,119
while I was trying to block my dad who tried to boil my mom.

821
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,220
What?

822
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,130
The reason why I follow Ms. Kim around...

823
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,189
is to get rid of bad partners.

824
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,260
Let's enjoy the party!

825
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:55,729
Yes, sure.

826
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,550
I want to get a florist certificate.

827
00:58:09,979 --> 00:58:13,079
I heard I needed experience, so I'm doing a part-time job.

828
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:15,820
It's nice to see you happy.

829
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:18,360
Maybe it's because it's my first time to earn money myself.

830
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:21,360
Thanks to you, Sa Ra.

831
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:27,700
Can I call you Sa Ra?

832
00:58:29,869 --> 00:58:30,970
You can.

833
00:58:34,369 --> 00:58:35,439
Sure.

834
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:39,209
To celebrate us being friends,

835
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,309
I have something to give you.

836
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:44,479
What is it?

837
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:49,619
They are documents about my husband.

838
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,889
No, my ex-husband's that my father kept.

839
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:56,289
Maybe these could be helpful...

840
00:58:56,689 --> 00:58:58,059
to win back Seo Yun.

841
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:03,300
This is very unexpected. Thank you so much.

842
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,379
The Judiciary Committee members' stance...

843
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,748
clearly changed after we bribed them.

844
00:59:14,749 --> 00:59:17,950
The Law School Act bill will pass next week.

845
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,320
Are you sure?

846
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:25,119
We should've done this from the start.

847
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:27,688
You went through so much trouble.

848
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:30,459
This is the last thing I can buy with money.

849
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,499
It's impossible for the National Assembly.

850
00:59:33,099 --> 00:59:35,499
If you were a member of the National Assembly,

851
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:39,139
we would've been able to do something with the plenary.

852
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,269
I know, right?

853
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,309
Anyway, thanks for your efforts.

854
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:46,208
Let's make a plan again.

855
00:59:46,209 --> 00:59:47,510
- Yes, sir!
- Okay.

856
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:52,380
I think you need to see this.

857
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,118
Let's see.

00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,660
("Kang Chul and Choi La Hee are Divorcing, Ending Their Love")

859
01:00:02,959 --> 01:00:04,860
Kim Sa Ra and Dong Gi Jun...

860
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,469
will be closer with this exciting news.

861
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:10,470
Right? That's what this means.

862
01:00:11,139 --> 01:00:12,340
Yes, you're right.

863
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:14,539
Get out.

864
01:00:15,439 --> 01:00:16,439
Yes, sir.

865
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,599
Gi Jun is using you.

866
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:40,058
Why do you think he's next to you?

867
01:00:40,059 --> 01:00:41,570
Stop driving a wedge between us.

868
01:00:43,499 --> 01:00:46,970
Seo Woong Jin... Never mind. Let's meet.

869
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:49,009
I'll tell you why he can't be trusted.

870
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:51,708
No. Apologize first for assuming wrongly...

871
01:00:51,709 --> 01:00:52,939
about Choi La Hee.

872
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:57,849
Why is he so anxious?

873
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:01,990
Seo Woong Jin?

874
01:01:04,889 --> 01:01:05,919

Chayul Town Promotion Team?

881
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,240
So what is Chayul Town Promotion Team about?

882
01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:29,550
They have five members. They're called five-member society.

883
01:01:29,749 --> 01:01:31,478
They'd get the permission to build a law school...

884
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,220
through an all-around lobbying,

885
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:35,050
then develop the area at a cheap price...

886
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:37,590
under the guise of an educational project.

887
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:40,559
I heard they were making a billion dollars from ten million dollars.

888
01:01:41,459 --> 01:01:42,729
Why is it called a five-member society?

889
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:44,859
I saw only four members in the document.

890
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,559
You'll get goosebumps here.

891
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:49,229
There was one more member.

892
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:52,700
Was it Seo Woong Jin?

893
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:53,840
Bingo!

01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:38,880
but he was the last one who called. Why do you ask?

903
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:43,990
Have you heard of the five-member society while investigating?

904
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:47,289
A five-member society? What is that?

905
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:52,599
That's how Seo Woong Jin and Noh Yul Seong knew each other.

906
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:56,470
Did you know that they knew each other?

907
01:02:57,099 --> 01:02:58,269
Well,

908
01:02:59,269 --> 01:03:00,739
I just had a hint since it was a case...

909
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:02,410
that I was investigating.

910
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:09,610
Why?

911
01:03:12,249 --> 01:03:13,249
(Reduced sentence for serial killer)

912
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:15,788
(Chayul Law Firm and Chayul Town Promotion Team)

913
01:03:15,789 --> 01:03:16,789
(Seo Woong Jin is the last person Na Yu Mi talked with.)

914
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,119
It seems you've been keeping an eye on this case.

915
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:25,930
(Reason for a divorce between Kim Sa Ra and Noh Yul Seong)

916
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:29,800
Why is my name here?

917
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,240
Didn't you say you had no other reason...

918
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:37,979
coming to SOLUTION?

919
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,748
Well, that's...

920
01:03:41,749 --> 01:03:43,450
It wasn't someone else's meddling.

921
01:03:44,749 --> 01:03:46,180
It was your lie.

922
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:50,789
Wait!

923
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,189
Why did you come here?

924
01:03:55,389 --> 01:03:58,829
Because it'd be easier for you to be near Noh Yul Seong?

925
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:00,498
It's not like that.

926
01:04:00,499 --> 01:04:02,929
That's why you said three months would be enough.

927
01:04:02,930 --> 01:04:04,700
That's not it, Kim Sa Ra!

928
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:08,470
Ask me. I can answer what I know.

929
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:11,340
Then, we'll be able to end it here.

930
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:23,220
I didn't tell you because I was being careful.

931
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,360
Sa Ra!

932
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:43,340
Don't you really know...

933
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:45,840
why I joined SOLUTION?

934
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:57,220
Don't get distracted, Sa Ra.

935
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:01,930
Fine.

936
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:10,030
Then you shouldn't get distracted too.

937
01:05:35,829 --> 01:05:37,860
(Queen of Divorce)

938
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,530
Do you also prevent a divorce?

939
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,759
A divorce? Did Kim Young Hak do anything faulty?

940
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,929
It's from the husband's side.

941
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:13,328
It's none other than a cult.

942
01:06:13,329 --> 01:06:15,899
CEO Yoo's divorce was done through fortune telling...

943
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,939
It wasn't fortune-telling. It was the energy of the universe.

944
01:06:18,139 --> 01:06:20,239
Why? What must be going on that you called me here?

945
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,668
Do you believe in it?

946
01:06:21,669 --> 01:06:23,168
- I do!
- I do!

947
01:06:23,169 --> 01:06:24,938
- Just like this.
- My goodness! What are you doing?

948
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:25,939
- You can see me, right?
- Yes, so what?

949
01:06:26,209 --> 01:06:27,909
See what?

950
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:30,619
Is CEO Yoo's divorce case going well?

951
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,579
I'm someone who thinks in the same direction as you.

952
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:36,118
I got it back from Chayul.

953
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:38,018
The last caller is Noh Yul Seong.

954
01:06:38,019 --> 01:06:39,689
It's a piece of evidence that proves...

955
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,129
Noh Yul Seong made Professor Seo commit suicide.

956
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,329
I want to use Lawyer Dong.

957
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,229
I can finally see how...

958
01:06:46,229 --> 01:06:47,369
I can send Noh Yul Seong to prison.
