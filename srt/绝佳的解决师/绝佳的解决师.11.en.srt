00:00:55,779 --> 00:01:01,290
(On the day of Park Jeong Suk, Sa Ra's mother's death)

6
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,498
Where am I?

7
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:09,629
Mother, this factory area seems to have no luck.

8
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,700
Right? They're bankrupt again.

9
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:16,769
But...

10
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,980
why are you like this?

11
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:22,480
Why are you doing this?

12
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:25,480
Mother.

13
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,219
Why did you go to see a prosecutor?

14
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:31,790
Did you think I was joking?

15
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,919
Did you not understand what I said?

16
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,699
I heard you ordering others to get rid of Na Yu Mi.

17
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,199
If you clear my daughter's name,

18
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,730
I'll also keep my mouth shut.

19
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,900
This is absurd.

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,840
If you make such nonsense remarks one more time,

21
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:53,939
you'll end up just like your daughter.

22
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,249
Do you understand?

23
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:59,549
Yul Seong, please. I beg you.

24
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:01,119
- Please.
- Let it go.

25
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,480
Yul Seong, please!

26
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:06,688
It's not because of that.

27
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,519
I don't know anything.

28
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:14,499
Okay.

29
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:17,499
Where did you hear what I said that day?

30
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,940
I just told them...

31
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,678
to scare Na Yu Mi a bit.

32
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,010
Do you think I'm crazy?

33
00:02:28,679 --> 00:02:30,708
What do you think will happen...

34
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,750
if you go and tell this story to the prosecutor?

35
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,618
Then, they will investigate enthusiastically.

36
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:35,619
I'll be framed as the culprit.

37
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,849
What will happen to my marriage, then?

38
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,820
Think about it! It'll ruin my marriage.

39
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,089
Think before you act! For goodness' sake!

40
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:46,799
You're really frustrating.

41
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,729
Come here. For goodness' sake.

42
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,768
Who was it? Answer now.

43
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,129
I don't know. I really don't know.

44
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,168
Tell me now. Who's the blabbermouth?

45
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:57,239
I don't know.

46
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:59,510
I really don't know.

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,939
"I really don't know. I don't know."

48
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,209
I'm tired of this!

49
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:23,399
Mr. Noh.

50
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,030
The Law School Select Committee...

51
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,729
has direct and indirect connections...

52
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,269
with the government and ruling party.

53
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,398
Through various connections...

54
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:05,108
with the party representative, Kim Young A and others,

55
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,078
we'll identify the inclinations of the Select Committee.

56
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,638
We are devising a strategy to convince them...

57
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,880
to support our law firm as much as possible.

58
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:14,019
I will explain...

59
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,049
the persuasion strategy in three stages.

(Emergency Medical Center)

63
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,010
They said Gong Deukgu is recovering.

64
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,539
His life is not in danger.

65
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,148
We need to see him before Noh Yul Seong does.

66
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:48,079
Let's just say you weren't at the scene for now.

67
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,579
It'll be dangerous if Noh Yul Seong figures out.

68
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,589
Tell the police the same too.

69
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,510

72
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,550
What are you doing?

73
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,019
The car that almost got crushed...

74
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,360
was rented by Kang Bom.

75
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,399
Deception by a spouse is grounds for annulment. You know, right?

76
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:41,000
You'll never see Seo Yun again.

77
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,810
Don't regret it later, and tell me the truth now.

78
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,440
You asked them to do this, right?

79
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,219
- Yes.
- Yes?

80
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,389
I asked Bom to see...

81
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:03,089
if Mr. Gong is related to my mother's case in any way.

82
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,359
But suddenly, she said Mr. Gong...

83
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,130
got into an accident while running away.

84
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,940
That's it?

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,599
Isn't it strange?

86
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,039
Why would Mr. Gong run away?

87
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:26,579
I'll need to ask the chairwoman.

88
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,990
Then, who instigated Gong Deukgu's case?

89
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,959
Look into it and report to me.

90
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,099
Why didn't you knock before coming in?

91
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,740
I have something to show you.

92
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,209
My mother passed away...

93
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,180
after she followed Mr. Gong.

94
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,589
He was your driver back then.

95
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,819
Is that Mr. Gong?

96
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,860
Why was he there?

97
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,829
Did you perhaps ask him to drive my mom here?

98
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,469
What is she talking about?

99
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,339
Are you doubting my mom?

100
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,409
Who would I doubt, then?

101
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:28,240
Don't you know anything?

102
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:31,110
Or are you pretending not to?

103
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,349
Get out.

104
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,889
- Mother, you didn't do it, did you?
- I said, get out.

105
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,550
Why was Mr. Gong there?

106
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:14,320
That's what I want to ask you.

107
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:16,989
Did you send him there?

108
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,630
Seriously. Why would I?

109
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,268
If you didn't, then never mind. I'll check with Mr. Gong.

110
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:28,099
No, I'll talk to him.

111
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:30,098
Just leave it to me.

112
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:33,038
He's like a time bomb to you.

113
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,279
Stay put. I'll take care of it.

114
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:53,259
When did CEO Noh's mother-in-law pass away?

115
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,300
Get me Mr. Gong's transportation log of that day.

116
00:09:09,109 --> 00:09:12,079
- Yes! It's Lawyer Dong!
- You shocked me.

117
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,248
You suggested we stage a fraud,

118
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:17,150
but what will we do if the fraudulent couple breaks up?

119
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,920
Yes, well...

120
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,118
so we'll stick around each other every time.

121
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,129
We'll never...

122
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,959
So that we won't break up again.

123
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,629
Please don't.

124
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:29,459
Looking forward to your cooperation.

125
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,099
Oh, what should we do with Gong Deukgu?

126
00:09:36,969 --> 00:09:39,310
It's difficult to access him as he's in the intensive care unit.

127
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,839
I think we need to change our target.

128
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:44,749
Let's have the culprit speak, not the witness.

129
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,920
- Confession.
- Or soliloquy.

130
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:52,389
I'll throw them into the fiery pit of mistrust and confess their sins.

131
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,458
What we need is...

132
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:55,759
What we learned from Noh Yul Seong.

133
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:58,530
Instigating.

134
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,060
I know a person who acts well.

135
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
Me?

136
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,999
Why is it me again? What is it?

137
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:12,440
That son is trying to take over the law firm...

138
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,440
behind his own mother's back.

139
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:16,679
- Chayul Law Firm?
- Yes.

140
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,810
- So that rumour is true?
- Yes!

141
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,878
That woman doesn't give her son any authority at all.

142
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:24,290
She's so mean.

143
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:26,820
- Honey.
- Yes?

144
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:30,359
- You need to be aware of drivers.
- Why?

145
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,588
It seems that the son managed to sway...

146
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:33,900
her driver.

147
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,098
How many secrets do you think he heard while driving?

148
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:40,199
So many. Countless.

149
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,269
- That's what I'm saying.
- I should make them be wary.

150
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,969
Yes, you should.

151
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,608
They have so much time.

152
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:49,339
What could possibly happen between my son and me?

153
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:52,150
Anyway. Thanks, Ms. Kwon.

154
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,489
Come in.

155
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,560
What about Mr. Gong's transportation log?

156
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:07,228
On that day last year,

157
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:09,759
Mr. Gong drove CEO Noh's car.

158
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,838
And Gong Deukgu's accident seems to be caused by CEO Noh.

159
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,040
I'll investigate further.

160
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,170
(Mr. Gong)

161
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,239
(Mr. Gong)

162
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,040
(Mr. Gong)

163
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,239
(Chairwoman Cha)

164
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:12,989
Did you want to see me?

165
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:16,030
Why do you have Mr. Gong's phone?

166
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:20,640
I found it at the scene of the accident.

167
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,869
You purposely went to the scene?

168
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,410
You happen to have the phone that the police missed.

169
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:30,479
It was you.

170
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,279
You tried to kill Mr. Gong...

171
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,119
and ordered him to bring your mother-in-law to you.

172
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:39,219
What are you talking about?

173
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:41,420
How dare you ask me if I did it?

174
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,589
Why? Were you trying to frame me?

175
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:48,228
I'm your son.

176
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:50,328
I'm about to crack open my son's head...

177
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:53,998
and see what he is thinking,

178
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:55,540
so shut your mouth.

179
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:09,649
(My brother is being threatened by CEO Noh.)

180
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,650
(This is Mr. Gong's brother.)

181
00:13:10,651 --> 00:13:11,719
(He's in a desperate situation and asking for your help.)

182
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,389
"My brother is being threatened by CEO Noh."

183
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,160
"He's being coerced into saying that everything was instructed by you."

184
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,969
Noh Yul Seong, this crazy jerk.

185
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,780
(Calling)

186
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,690
(Chairwoman Cha)

187
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,290
(I'm unavailable for a call.)

188
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:03,070
Superintendent. It's me.

189
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:07,310
I need the police to take action.

190
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,878
Seo Yun, it's time to go to bed.

191
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,619
Okay. This is my last round.

192
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:18,589
It should be the last.

193
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:44,680
Seo Yun, what's this?

194
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,780
I need to put them together again.

195
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,249
Did you do this?

196
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,319
When I was in the States,

197
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,758
Grandma told me that you abandoned me.

198
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:57,119
So I abandoned you for a while too.

199
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,890
Seo Yun.

200
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:09,769
You know that Grandma lied, right?

201
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,109
Yes, of course!

202
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:16,180
I'm sorry, Seo Yun.

203
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,650
To you, they are your dad and grandma.

204
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,820
But I can't forgive them.

205
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:39,890
(CEO Noh Yul Seong)

206
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,400
Ms. Kim went into Hanjoo Party's building.

207
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,170
(Kim Sa Ra)

208
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:52,609
Hello?

209
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,810
Today is the Law School Select Committee's presentation day, right?

210
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,839
I'll speak about it since I'm at Hanjoo Party now.

211
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:58,079
Sure.

212
00:16:58,109 --> 00:17:00,150
Why are you proactively seeking out for me?

213
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:02,950
I'm bragging.

214
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,190
Telling you that I'm doing what I should.

215
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,160
Okay.

216
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,860
(Hanjoo Party)

217
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:31,110
(SOLUTION)

218
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:36,650
While Sa Ra... No. While Ms. Kim is on vacation,

219
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,489
will SOLUTION be on break?

220
00:17:40,489 --> 00:17:43,289
Well, not really.

221
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:47,329
About the five-member society...

222
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,830
I heard something more about it from my father.

223
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,670
But I can't reach Sa Ra.

224
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,769
I see.

225
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,738
I'm sure she didn't keep it a secret on purpose.

226
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:02,978
She might've been too busy.

227
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:04,380
Why? Is she sick?

228
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:11,350
She got remarried recently...

229
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:13,319
with CEO Noh.

230
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:20,690
I'm sorry. No,

231
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,170
I regret to tell you.

232
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,239
It's the worst, right?

233
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,969
You mean...

234
00:18:36,239 --> 00:18:38,279
she replaced...

235
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,120
my place?

236
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,190
No, it's not like that.

237
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,090
Ms. Han.

238
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:51,890
Ms. Han.

239
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,670
Long time no see.

240
00:18:59,969 --> 00:19:02,569
Congratulations on your remarriage.

241
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,239
I did it for revenge.

242
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:11,479
I'll make him repay what he did to me...

243
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,410
and to you.

244
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,880
We're still on the same side.

245
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,719
(Non-smoking Building)

246
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:32,568
It's been a while since he moved to this room, but he still sleeping.

247
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:34,670
I'm almost there. Wait for me.

248
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,369
- Please go out.
- This way, please.

249
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:42,380
- Wait a minute.
- Just a moment.

250
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,008
- Hurry and come out.
- Hurry.

251
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:45,649
- Hurry and come out.
- This way, please.

252
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,179
- Hurry and come out.
- My goodness.

253
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,880
There's nothing here.

254
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,690
- Move slowly.
- Slowly come this way.

255
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,019
- Where is the fire?
- Where?

256
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,459
- It was so hard to come out.
- There's no smoke.

257
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,690
- Where is the fire?
- I think we're good.

258
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:03,798
I think it was a false alarm.

259
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,799
- You can come in. Thank you.
- My goodness.

260
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:07,069
I'll help.

261
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,190
Hey.

262
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,090
How is Ms. Han?

263
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,519
Is she okay? How did it go?

264
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,890
I think she was very shocked.

265
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,959
I couldn't even talk about the five-member society.

266
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:37,870
Give her some time. I bet she needs it.

267
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,739
I thought I knew you the best, but I was shocked too.

268
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:44,569
It's natural.

269
00:20:45,469 --> 00:20:46,940
Are you fine now?

270
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:49,009
About what?

271
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Everything.

272
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,120
The fact that I went into his house again and everything.

273
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,860
What's wrong?

274
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,360
You're going through the toughest time right now.

275
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,729
So let's end this quickly.

276
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,209
Give me a minute.

277
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,140
- Yes, hello?
- Gong Deukgu ran away!

278
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:25,208
We're chasing him. Be careful!

279
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:27,509
How did he run away? By himself?

280
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:29,950
Someone got him out. I'm not sure who it is.

281
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:34,819
Stop the car.

282
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:38,759
- What's going on?
- Wait.

283
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:41,028
- Wait here.
- Let me follow you.

284
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:43,459
No. If they run away again, chase them immediately.

285
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,269
Hey. Darn it.

286
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:28,779
Get yourself together, Kang Bom. Don't lose yourself.

287
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,180
Who was that?

288
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,009
Let's get to a hospital.

289
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,308
Be careful!

290
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:08,849
Be careful.

291
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:12,090
It's narrow here. Be careful.

292
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,090
Are you okay?

293
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,219
You've gone through so much. Take a seat.

294
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:18,459
- Okay.
- Careful.

295
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,830
Are you okay?

296
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:24,229
The stitches were done neatly.

297
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,929
I thought I was going to faint,

298
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,469
thinking something might happen to Bom.

299
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:32,870
Just you wait. I'll bring them right in front of you.

300
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:42,219
Let's get better soon and catch them.

301
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,319
Right.

302
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:46,650
It must be Noh Yul Seong at the end of all of this anyway.

303
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
That is the problem.

304
00:23:48,489 --> 00:23:51,789
Noh Yul Seong will find out what you're doing.

305
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,958
What do we do? What if he goes mad...

306
00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:56,630
thinking about his mom and Ms. Kim?

307
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,969
We have to make a decision.

308
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,340
Ms. Kim, you should leave that house now.

309
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:06,840
Don't worry.

310
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,940
How can I not worry?

311
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,549
You can't stop me until the law school gets decided.

312
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,279
There's still some time left until that.

313
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,850
I knew it.

314
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:34,670
Stay still.

315
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:37,239
What is this?

316
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,039
There are no bugs on you for now.

317
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:44,709
You won't be leaving that house.

318
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,379
Then equip yourself, at least.

319
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,279
This is the start of a war.

320
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:00,489
Come in.

321
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:03,600
Let's get going.

322
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:08,239
Let's take a look at that cat with nine lives.

323
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,840
Who are you?

324
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,180
You must get interviewed as a witness...

325
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,419
regarding the case of Park Jeong Suk's death.

326
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,620
(Request for Attendance)

327
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,650
My mother-in-law?

328
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,489
This happened ages ago. Why bring it back up now?

329
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:29,090
Did something new come up?

330
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:31,089
I cannot tell you that as it is confidential.

331
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:33,590
Excuse me. I'm the CEO of Chayul.

332
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:35,758
I don't care how serious things are.

333
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:37,998
Who makes a request for attendance as a witness like this?

334
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:41,840
That is why I'm here to ask you.

335
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,640
What has Kim Sa Ra been babbling about this time?

336
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,950
The day your mother-in-law, Park Jeong Suk, died,

337
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,489
Gong Deukgu was driving your car. Am I correct?

338
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:01,589
Let's keep things fair. What started all of this?

339
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,830
I have to know to be able to provide a helpful answer.

340
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,059
We received a significant piece of footage. How's that?

341
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,430
The CCTV footage of Southwestern District Prosecutors' Office?

342
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:13,629
How am I supposed to know what my driver did?

343
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,100
Just answer my question before I make you the suspect.

344
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:19,309
Sir.

345
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,538
- The chief's call.
- Right now?

346
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:24,539
Yes.

347
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:32,620
I heard Gong Deukgu sold the fuel in the company's car.

348
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,058
And he got caught.

349
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:36,689
(Personnel Card)

350
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,889
(Disciplinary Actions)

351
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,160
We know how things will be for the one who holds grudges.

352
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:42,059
We will not call for him separately.

353
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:47,969
Personnel records?

354
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,969
Was the chairwoman here?

355
00:26:57,809 --> 00:26:59,549
So it wasn't Kim Sa Ra.

356
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,749
It was the chairwoman.

357
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,249
I make sure to pay her back with my loyalty.

358
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,759
You should also be a good son and melt away her worries.

359
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,890
What happened?

360
00:27:44,891 --> 00:27:46,559
The part about reporting you?

361
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,029
Or the part about bailing you out?

362
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:52,630
Both.

363
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:57,600
I can't send you to paradise.

364
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,269
But I can send you down the fiery pit.

365
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,340
And the only one who can save you out of that pit is me.

366
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,018
So that was why you wanted to...

367
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:10,680
teach your all-grown son a lesson.

368
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:12,449
I wanted to show you what would happen...

369
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,319
if you try to do something in secret on your own.

370
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:17,018
Always keep in mind that there are mothers and fathers...

371
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:19,259
who can eat their own children.

372
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,528
- Move. Look at me.
- No!

373
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:55,459
- No!
- I said look at me.

374
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:03,469
Bonk.

375
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,380
Great job making it back alive.

376
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:17,680
Before you die,

377
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,920
there's one thing left for you to do.

378
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:22,890
Right.

379
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:42,039
- You...
- What's wrong?

380
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:45,150
You wanted me nice and dead.

381
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,279
Are you shocked I'm back?

382
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,619
I have nothing to do with your accident.

383
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,519
No. I believe you are involved.

384
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,288
My life started falling apart as soon as you told me...

385
00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:00,690
to kill Na Yu Mi.

386
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:01,959
Will you not shut your mouth?

387
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,229
I just did as I was told.

388
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,170
And now you want me sent away?

389
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,340
- Can you really do that to me?
- Are you deaf?

390
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,340
I'll give you the money to live abroad.

391
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,110
Make it two million dollars upfront. Then I'll get lost.

392
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,340
This guy is making deals again.

393
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:22,479
That's enough. Get out of there.

394
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:28,660
What should I do? Call the cops or get the money from you?

395
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:41,430
My daily transfer limit is 300,000 dollars.

396
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,568
(CEO Noh Yul Seong)

397
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:47,870
(A total of 300,000 dollars has been transferred.)

398
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,680
If only you hadn't gotten on my nerves,

399
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,080
we wouldn't have come this far.

400
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,900
CEO Noh, you've heard everything nice and clear, right?

401
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:20,839
I'll send you 1.7 million dollars without the 300,000 dollars you got.

402
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,739
It'll be the end of you if you don't get on that plane.

403
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,278
Darn it. Why would you exclude the 300,000 dollars?

404
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:27,680
If you start making deals with Kim Sa Ra, you'll be dead.

405
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,660
You don't even know what your wife is doing behind you.

406
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,259
Was my wife around on the day of your accident?

407
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:11,690
What are you doing here?

408
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,660
I forgot to water the plants.

409
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:16,259
I'm done now.

410
00:32:54,729 --> 00:32:57,298
What do we do? What if he goes mad...

411
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,009
doubting his mom and Ms. Kim?

415
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,590
So...

416
00:33:47,749 --> 00:33:50,420
Gong Deukgu is hiding right behind CEO Noh?

417
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,430
That's enough. Call CEO Noh for me.

418
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,769
Why are you coming out from there?

419
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:09,779
I had a book to look up.

420
00:34:11,709 --> 00:34:13,679
Maybe you still smell.

422
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,700
Do you know that we use the same perfume?

423
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,270
You smell just like I do.

424
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,109
You can stop worrying about how I smell.

425
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,939
You should worry about the stench coming from your son.

426
00:34:43,279 --> 00:34:44,279
What?

427
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:04,299
CEO Noh tried to bug me.

428
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,969
But I wasn't the only one he tried to bug.

429
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:15,938
You spied on me?

430
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:18,008
What's the purpose behind this?

431
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:19,710
Calm down first.

432
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:23,919
You!

433
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:26,719
Darn it.

434
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:37,528
My life started falling apart as soon as you told me...

435
00:35:37,529 --> 00:35:38,899
to kill Na Yu Mi.

436
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:40,230
Will you not shut your mouth?

437
00:35:40,669 --> 00:35:42,540
I just did as I was told.

438
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,040
You...

439
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,270
Are you threatening me?

440
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:49,839
I'm making a deal.

441
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,709
I'm pleading you not to scare your son by calling the police.

442
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,819
Just don't go wild on your own.

443
00:35:56,919 --> 00:35:58,450
Mother, all of this has started...

444
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,559
because you got your hands on Na Yu Mi.

445
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,758
She came to me wanting to stop your remarriage.

446
00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:07,389
She would have caused trouble if I hadn't stopped her.

447
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,028
You should have just scared her.

448
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:10,559
Don't you see that I did this for your sake?

449
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,169
- How could you...
- Did I ask for your help?

450
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,040
Then why did you do that with your mother-in-law?

451
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:24,609
Noh Yul Seong.

452
00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:26,910
Hurry up and admit it.

453
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,919
Who says I did it?

454
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,290
Do you have evidence?

455
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,629
I...

456
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,429
do things the way you taught me.

457
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,438
Whoever shows their teeth against me will get bitten by me.

458
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:51,439
Do you get it now?

459
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,040
Being hasty will get you nowhere.

460
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:08,290
Come out to the garden.

461
00:37:23,569 --> 00:37:26,040
Gong Deukgu has departed to the Philippines.

462
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:30,580
I failed in getting Noh Yul Seong's admission.

463
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:32,779
I got evidence on Chairwoman Cha.

464
00:37:33,149 --> 00:37:34,509
I'm thinking about how to deal with her.

465
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:48,960
I forgot about Kim Sa Ra's crazy learning ability.

466
00:37:51,799 --> 00:37:53,330
She copied my method with the bugging.

467
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,669
- What?
- She knows everything.

468
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,209
The case of her mother and Na Yu Mi.

469
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,239
But why are you leaving her alone?

470
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:04,779
The D-day is when Chayul Law Firm gets selected.

471
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,609
You have to do well until then.

472
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,418
It's not me. It's Kim Sa Ra.

473
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:12,350
That was why I told you it was a no for her!

474
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,430
Until then, we're sleeping with the enemy.

475
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,599
You have to do a good job pretending to be fooled.

476
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,100
And bring down your temper just a little bit.

477
00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:33,209
Put me to bed.

478
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,838
What happened to yesterday's promise?

479
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:36,278
You said you were going to sleep on your own.

480
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:37,710
Just ten minutes. That's it.

481
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,249
Seo Yun.

482
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,680
Just ten minutes.

483
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,060
Where would Kim Sa Ra keep the bugged files?

484
00:39:34,129 --> 00:39:35,640
Gosh.

(Divorce Specialist SOLUTION)

486
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:14,169
What?

487
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:16,180
It's a gift to boost you up.

488
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,560
Are things not going well?

489
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:35,329
He's across the seas.

490
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,660
It's hard to get through to Gong Deukgu.

491
00:40:39,629 --> 00:40:42,298
You should do a good job.

492
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:45,169
Just like how you hacked my heart.

493
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:47,669
What?

494
00:40:49,609 --> 00:40:50,809
Let's hurry up and catch Gong Deukgu...

495
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,879
and eat something nice with me.

496
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:54,910
What?

497
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,250
The overseas gambling group in the Philippines?

498
00:41:00,589 --> 00:41:01,949
I heard someone got caught...

499
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,589
losing 1.3 million dollars in a week at a casino.

500
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:06,290
After searching who it was,

501
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,390
it turned out to be Gong Deukgu.

502
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,029
Where did he get the money?

503
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:17,969
Some law firm.

504
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,009
Some law firm?

505
00:41:21,169 --> 00:41:22,238
They're going to have a headache.

506
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:24,508
Gongdeukgu received two million dollars.

507
00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:26,549
The prosecution is suspecting money laundering.

508
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:27,980
He's being traced.

509
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:30,950
Noh Yul Seong will be doing his best to get involved...

510
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:32,149
and stop the investigation.

511
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,250
And we need to stop him from doing that.

512
00:41:35,419 --> 00:41:37,189
Got it. Let's talk when you come back.

513
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,460
Okay.

514
00:41:40,189 --> 00:41:42,329
How should we stop him? Do we need to act ahead of him?

515
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,299
Give me a call around 7pm.

516
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,930
The alienating solution...

517
00:41:48,899 --> 00:41:50,040

Here.

519
00:41:58,439 --> 00:41:59,810
You should sit here.

520
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,779
Seo Yun should sit next to his dad.

521
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,189
Come here.

522
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,020
There we go.

523
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:14,330
It's your favourite. Bulgogi.

524
00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:23,100
Will Kim Young A continue to support us?

525
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,910
We're still in talks.

526
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,910
Are you angry?

527
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,680
No. Not at all.

528
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:34,980
Let's eat.

529
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,919
Seo Yun loves bulgogi.

530
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:40,649
Eat up.

531
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,589
I don't like bulgogi.

533
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,399
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

534
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,609
Yes, Ms. Kim.

535
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:04,279
Gong Deukgu?

536
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:07,149
Yes. He was an employee at Chayul.

537
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:09,020
What?

538
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:11,419
Chairwoman Cha?

539
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,049
I'll check.

540
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,319
Thank you for letting me know. Bye.

541
00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:24,759
Did you give Mr. Gong money?

542
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:27,930
What are you talking about?

543
00:43:27,931 --> 00:43:31,770
I heard Mr. Gong got caught gambling abroad.

544
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,410
And the money was from Chayul.

545
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,509
Did Ms. Kim say that?

546
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,378
It was almost certain that Chayul would win...

547
00:43:39,379 --> 00:43:40,910
the law school deal.

548
00:43:41,379 --> 00:43:42,980
But it's about to be on hold now.

549
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:46,790
Did you give him money?

550
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:48,849
Why would I give him money?

551
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:51,259
I just gave him some severance pay as he was quitting.

552
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,859
I heard it was two million dollars.

553
00:44:01,529 --> 00:44:03,569
Seo Yun, can you go up to your room for a while?

554
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:10,609

555
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,319
All right. Let's head out.

00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,160
- What?
- What?

558
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:32,028
I wonder for which one of you the police have come...

559
00:44:32,029 --> 00:44:33,100
to arrest.

560
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,500

- Yes.
- What are you doing?

562
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:39,838
Do you really have to ask?

563
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:41,739
You already knew that I knew everything.

564
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,049
I've had enough of putting on a show.

565
00:44:46,279 --> 00:44:48,779

567
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,460
Yes, that's me.

568
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,960
You're under arrest for instigating Na Yu Mi's murder.

569

You have the right to plead the Fifth.

571

Did you just report me to the police?

572
00:45:10,169 --> 00:45:11,369
Do you think I had Na Yu Mi killed?

573
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,609
Go, and let them investigate then.

574
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:14,468
I'm sure the police have a plan too.

575
00:45:14,469 --> 00:45:15,469
Please come with us.

576

580

Did I answer your question? Take him.

581
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,620
You got the wrong idea. It wasn't me.

Yes.

593
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:47,068
I was really curious to see how Noh Yul Seong would react...

594
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:48,730
when he was framed...

597
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:55,509
By the way, when I read his statement,

598
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,979
I could understand why the police arrested you,

599
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,109
not him.

600
00:47:01,509 --> 00:47:04,779

Don't you know the announce for the law school is next week?

605

to stop you from building a law school or Chayul Town.

This was the perfect timing. Don't be so silly.

Anyway, I hope you won't go down for your son's crimes.

609

it will be the end of us. You know that, right?

617

At least I must remain free, so I can help with your trial.

618

719
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,199
You should have just scared her.

720
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,738
Don't you see that I did this for your sake?

721
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:41,009
How could you...

722
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,310
I'm sure some of you might remember.

723
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:47,349
This woman, Na Yu Mi, supposedly jumped out of a car...

724
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,049
and committed suicide, right?

725
00:54:49,149 --> 00:54:50,919
Gosh. This is bad.

726
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,250
On the day of her death,

727
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:54,850
she barged into the venue of the engagement party.

728
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,560
Gosh.

729
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,699
All right. Chairwoman Cha Hui Won is bound to be put away now.

730
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:06,399
Next up is CEO Noh Yul Seong.

731
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,069
This is Na Yu Mi.

732
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:24,419
He also dated her with a promise of marriage.

733
00:55:24,919 --> 00:55:25,980
Just like he did with me.

734
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,918
He betrays his lover whenever it is convenient for him.

735
00:55:28,919 --> 00:55:31,319
Then he concealed his mom's crime when she got rid of his lover.

736
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:33,730
Yet, he wants to be the icon of charity?

737
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:35,758
If you believe he's doing a good deed,

738
00:55:35,759 --> 00:55:37,128
you're falling for his trick.

739
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:39,500
- Hey.
- Stop her!

740
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,899
- Hey!
- Stop taking pictures!

741
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,039
- Hey, turn that off.
- Take them out!

742
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,468
- Aren't you Mr. Noh Yul Seong?
- Gosh.

743
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:48,469
Is she telling the truth?

744
00:55:48,839 --> 00:55:51,239
Everyone, everything she said is slanderous.

745
00:55:51,339 --> 00:55:53,909
I will send out a statement through my official channel.

746
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,048
Please say something now!

747
00:55:55,049 --> 00:55:57,249
Gosh. Stop taking pictures. Stop that!

748
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:58,479
- Stop that.
- No!

749
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,619
- Stop it.
- That's not true.

750
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,688
- Please give us a comment!
- Any comment, sir?

751
00:56:01,689 --> 00:56:03,290
- Hold on. Step back.
- That way!

752
00:56:03,589 --> 00:56:04,589
Stop that!

753
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,660
- Hurry up!
- Stop taking pictures.

754
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:08,759
- Get the car ready! Hey!
- Sir!

755
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:11,600
- You must explain yourself!
- Sir!

756
00:56:12,299 --> 00:56:13,870
Come on! Give that to me!

757
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:16,739
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

758
00:56:17,239 --> 00:56:18,640
A traitor for a traitor.

759
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:20,969
That's totally right up my alley.

760
00:56:21,069 --> 00:56:24,309
Exactly. But you and I really don't mix.

761
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:26,879
But this is the only thing we see eye to eye on.

762
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:29,379
Good work.

763
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,919
Do you want to go to the next room and have some food?

764
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,020
I get the feeling Noh Yul Seong prepared an expensive meal.

765
00:56:42,629 --> 00:56:44,259
- There she comes.
- She's out.

766
00:56:44,759 --> 00:56:46,028
Do you admit to murdering the girl?

767
00:56:46,029 --> 00:56:47,369
- A comment, please.
- Do you admit to the charge?

768
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,969
- Please answer our question.
- Just one question!

769
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:51,299
This whole thing is fabricated.

770
00:56:55,169 --> 00:56:57,439
Look. How could they arrest me based on a mere suspicion?

771
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,949
I've dedicated my entire life to uphold the law and justice.

772
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:01,950
Yet, this is how they treat someone with my reputation.

773
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,549
I can't imagine how badly regular people must've been mistreated.

774
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,149
I will fight to the end...

775
00:57:07,819 --> 00:57:09,589
and prove my innocence.

776
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,329
- Then do you deny it?
- Are you saying you're not guilty?

777
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,758
- So you're denying it?
- Ma'am!

778
00:57:16,759 --> 00:57:18,758
- One more question!
- Please clarify that!

779
00:57:18,759 --> 00:57:20,169
Are you saying the real culprit is someone else?

780
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:21,569
- One more comment!
- Ma'am!

781
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:24,099
- One more question!
- Please answer our question.

782
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,838
- Are you saying you're innocent?
- What's the truth?

00:57:26,839 --> 00:57:28,040
Please answer us!

Hello.

788
00:58:12,779 --> 00:58:15,950
Can you recognize me, sir?

789
00:58:16,689 --> 00:58:19,120
Honey. You remember the prosecutor, right?

790
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,370
My wife...

791
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,239
told me everything.

792
00:58:33,939 --> 00:58:35,069
I'm sorry.

793
00:58:35,739 --> 00:58:36,779
No.

794
00:58:37,939 --> 00:58:39,439
Thank you for waking up.

795
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,980
I mean it.

796
00:58:43,919 --> 00:58:46,119
- I can't believe he survived.
- Exactly.

797
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,450
That couldn't have been easy.

798
00:58:52,089 --> 00:58:53,089
What happened?

799
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:55,489
There had been some signs for some days now.

800
00:58:55,589 --> 00:58:56,859
But we heard the news only a while ago.

801
00:58:57,529 --> 00:58:59,229
What about his memory? Can he talk?

802
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:01,799
He's completely back. This is bad.

803
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:04,100
What's going to happen if Professor Seo starts talking?

804
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:05,870
Well,

805
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,640
we'll be charged with instigating and blackmailing to commit suicide.

806
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,080
Hold on.

807
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:15,950
Who will be charged?

808
00:59:16,049 --> 00:59:17,549
Who do you think? All of us.

809
00:59:17,649 --> 00:59:18,719
- All of us?
- Why?

810
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:23,859
- Come on. We're not accomplices.
- Right.

811
00:59:32,029 --> 00:59:33,100
What are you playing at?

812
00:59:33,330 --> 00:59:36,169
At times like this, it's better to clear things up.

813
00:59:36,370 --> 00:59:38,798
It's a fact that you were the one that blackmailed...

814
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,910
- Professor Seo that day.
- Yes.

815
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,169
Right.

Look who's talking. How could you show your face around here?

819
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:09,230
It's been a while. Why don't you say hi to him first?

820
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,279
Professor Seo, I can't imagine what you must've gone through.

821
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,009
I have a certain someone to thank.

822
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,850
Right.

823
01:00:24,149 --> 01:00:27,219
Ma'am. This must have been tough on you too.

824
01:00:28,149 --> 01:00:30,290
So I heard all the data on my phone got erased...

You found dirt on him, kept a secret file on him,

850
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:12,489
and made him destroy evidence.

851
01:02:12,759 --> 01:02:16,730

You can stop here now.

The moment you hand over the ledger,

896
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:57,019
you'll never see your son for the rest of your life.

897
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,950
You piece of trash. Call him now!

898
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:02,089
I want you to beg. Beg me to spare your life.

899
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:05,020
Were you going to kill my mom from the beginning?

900
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,120
Kim Sa Ra!

901
01:06:06,121 --> 01:06:07,528
My wish is that...

902
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:09,629
Seo Yun doesn't turn out like a piece of trash that you are.

903
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,759
This is a goodbye for real now.
