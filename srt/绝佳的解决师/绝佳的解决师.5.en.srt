1
00:00:02,273 --> 00:00:11,880
(Queen of Divorce)

2
00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:13,723
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

3
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:15,196
(in this drama are fictitious.)

4
00:00:15,657 --> 00:00:16,727
Hello?

5
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:20,167
Sa Ra, your shirt
is still in the car.

6
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,896
Tell me your address.
I'll give it to you.

7
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:26,066
It's okay. It's on my way home.

8
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:28,036
All right.

9
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:44,157
Ms. Kim.

10
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:45,857
Hey.

11
00:00:49,097 --> 00:00:50,456
What brings you here at this hour?

12
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:51,597
Well...

13
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:54,196
Ms. Kim.

14
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:56,566
Is something wrong?

15
00:00:57,637 --> 00:01:00,407
Could you give me a hug?
Just one hug.

16
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:02,176
What?

17
00:01:04,907 --> 00:01:05,946
Okay.

18
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:16,487
What's wrong?

19
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:18,187
I heard you caught the blackmailers.

20
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:30,536
Okay.

21
00:02:20,647 --> 00:02:22,516
(Episode 5)

22
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:23,557
Are you all right?

23
00:02:25,016 --> 00:02:26,087
What's wrong?

24
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:38,437
What's this?

25
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:53,747
(Recipient: Kwon Dae Gi,
acute myeloid leukemia)

26
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:55,247
(Donor: Kim Sa Ra,
Marital status: Unmarried)

27
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:56,316
Wait.

28
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,087
That was you?

29
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:01,427
I'm talking
about stem cell donations.

30
00:03:02,756 --> 00:03:06,196
I forgot that
I registered as a donor.

31
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:07,897
You did it ten years ago.

32
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:10,937
We recently got a patient
who's a DNA match to you.

33
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:19,247
If you don't want to do it,
you can turn it down.

34
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:22,946
But the patient must be
very desperate to find a donor.

35
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:25,476
Once the surgery gets scheduled,

36
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,916
we can apply for parole.

37
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:30,786
I can get out?

38
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:31,986
There's a precedent for that.

39
00:03:31,986 --> 00:03:35,527
Your prison term is almost over.
So I'm sure it will be accepted.

40
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:43,736
You saved my life.

41
00:03:47,636 --> 00:03:48,807
Actually, the truth is...

42
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:54,007
I wanted to be released early
from prison too.

43
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:58,577
But how did you find out
that I was the donor?

44
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:02,116
Well, I guess you can call it
white hat hacking.

45
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:03,957
I wanted to repay you.

46
00:04:05,856 --> 00:04:06,856
Gosh.

47
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:10,527
Is that why you applied to work
at SOLUTION on purpose?

48
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:12,126
Yes.

49
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:17,137
Wait. So your health is fine now.
Right?

50
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:18,637
Yes. I'm perfectly fine.

51
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:31,147
Then you're the person I met
when I was in my darkest time.

52
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:36,186
Will there be a tomorrow?

53
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:41,157
Will I be able to meet someone
who is my DNA match tomorrow?

54
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:45,767
I pray every day in tears.

55
00:04:46,866 --> 00:04:50,067
Every night, I wished that
tomorrow wouldn't come.

56
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,837
But after reading the journals
from patients,

57
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:54,236
it made me think more deeply.

58
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:57,536
To patients, tomorrow was...

59
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:01,347
one more day they had earned
after praying and hoping.

60
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:06,486
So I changed my mind.

61
00:05:07,246 --> 00:05:08,246
To live.

62
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,757
If I give up, it's only my loss.

63
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:20,267
By the way, why are you
suddenly bringing this up?

64
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:22,866
Gosh. I'm sure you know me by now.

65
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:25,397
Keeping a secret is
my Achilles heel.

66
00:05:25,697 --> 00:05:27,837
I will make sure to repay you.

67
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:29,176
Your blood...

68
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:31,976
is flowing through my body.

69
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:35,376
Having a touching moment
was enough for tonight.

70
00:05:35,947 --> 00:05:38,147
A scary moment this late at night
isn't suitable.

71
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:39,217
Okay. It was a bit weird, right?

72
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:18,457
Hello.

73
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:20,887
It's me. When will you get here?

74
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:21,926
Oh, that.

75
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:24,827
Something just came up.

76
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:27,897
I'll give it back to you
at work tomorrow.

77
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:30,637
- I see. Okay. Sure.
- Okay.

78
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:42,717
Gosh.

79
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:45,916
I was totally getting ahead
of myself...

80
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:50,286
when she wasn't on the same page.

81
00:06:57,527 --> 00:06:58,597
This is embarrassing.

82
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:00,626
How embarrassing.

83
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:13,876
When I went there,
there were so many copies.

84
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:15,447
So I pulled out each copy
one at a time.

85
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:18,116
I smashed them with a hammer.
I destroyed all of them.

86
00:07:18,116 --> 00:07:19,517
- That's so cool.
- When the guys tried to fight back,

87
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:21,647
I subdued with the tear gas.

88
00:07:21,647 --> 00:07:24,587
After all that,
I retrieved the original file.

89
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:26,286
That's so impressive.

90
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:28,157
That was an amazing feat.

91
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:31,796
Ms. Han asked me to thank you
for everything you did.

92
00:07:31,957 --> 00:07:34,496
I didn't think you were the type.
But you did follow through.

93
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,567
That was cool.

94
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:38,197
Gosh, Dae Gi.
There's nothing you can't do.

95
00:07:38,197 --> 00:07:39,407
Bam.

96
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:43,637
I get why Ms. Kim likes you.

97
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:46,577
All right. Good work, everyone.

98
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:48,777
Let's go back to putting pressure
on Noh Yul Seong.

99
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:50,616
Let's start with the abductors.

100
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:51,616
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

101
00:07:52,277 --> 00:07:53,286
Ms. Kim.

102
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:55,347
Right here. Wait.

103
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:02,926
All clear.

104
00:08:04,426 --> 00:08:05,757
- Have a good one.
- Thanks.

105
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,167
How did you find them?

106
00:08:12,297 --> 00:08:14,207
They weren't girls this time.
How did you find them?

107
00:08:14,736 --> 00:08:15,736
It's a secret.

108
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:42,126
Your trump card to
speed up your divorce.

109
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:01,516
I heard you had a private meeting
with the party representative.

110
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:03,886
But you failed to get her support
for the nomination.

111
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:07,057
Well, I had to plead with her
to get a chance...

112
00:09:07,057 --> 00:09:08,626
to even compete.

113
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:11,756
Once you join the election,

114
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:12,927
the party members will vote
for your opponent.

115
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,126
I heard she was supporting
your opponent.

116
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:16,896
Listen, Mom.

117
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:19,136
If the tortoise...

118
00:09:20,337 --> 00:09:23,077
wants to beat the hare,
what should he do?

119
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:26,906
If the race is being held on land,
he must bring the race to water.

120
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,476
If he can't win the race,
he must change the rules.

121
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:33,417
You want to change
the rules of the election?

122
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:35,417
Instead of holding a vote
within the party,

123
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,016
we must have the people
participate in the vote.

124
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:39,457
Then I will create a sensation
with the public.

125
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:43,557
I'll get the public's approval
and win by popularity.

126
00:09:49,636 --> 00:09:51,996
I must look into the chairperson
of the National Election Commission.

127
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:06,417
Gosh. The weather is great.
Isn't it?

128
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,886
Hey.

129
00:10:10,717 --> 00:10:11,817
What's this?

130
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:14,287
Gosh. I didn't start it. Hold on.

131
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,457
- I missed you.
- Me too.

132
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:19,797
You look beautiful today.

133
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:21,427
I love you.

134
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:24,567
How did you...

135
00:10:25,037 --> 00:10:27,236
Why did you turn that off?
We need to keep watching.

136
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:29,337
He's about to call your name.

137
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,307
I told you, didn't I?

138
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:37,646
Did I have to reveal my trump card?

139
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:41,417
Hold on. I never met him
after I married you.

140
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:42,516
I dare you to keep talking.

141
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:54,626
You won.

142
00:10:56,937 --> 00:11:00,537
Okay. Fine. Let's get a divorce.
I'll give you what you want.

143
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:02,807
A divorce? Why?
Who says I wanted a divorce?

144
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:11,746
Choose.

145
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:16,886
Do you want me to disclose this
to the entire world and divorce me?

146
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:17,886
Or...

147
00:11:19,116 --> 00:11:20,756
will you listen to me and cooperate?

148
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:24,896
What are you talking about?

149
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:26,396
You said I was a flaw
in your campaign.

150
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,467
Isn't that
why you wanted to divorce me?

151
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:31,736
Right. I did want that.
But I changed my mind.

152
00:11:33,937 --> 00:11:36,106
I'm thinking about giving you
a chance to make up for the loss.

153
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:55,986
- Yes, Ms. Han.
- What should I do?

154
00:11:57,827 --> 00:11:58,856
What's wrong?

155
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:03,337
My husband has the footage
from the spy camera.

156
00:12:05,667 --> 00:12:07,837
Let's talk in person.
Should I go to you?

157
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:09,976
No. I can't talk now.

158
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:11,807
I need to go.

159
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:24,457
Didn't you say
you got rid of the original file?

160
00:12:25,057 --> 00:12:26,886
Yes. What's wrong?

161
00:12:28,087 --> 00:12:29,927
Noh Yul Seong got his hands
on the video.

162
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,297
Who are you calling?

163
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,866
That jerk.

164
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,567
The number you dialed
does not exist.

165
00:12:42,937 --> 00:12:44,337
Please check...

166
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:48,606
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:55,486
(Number 2, Noh Yul Seong)

168
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:58,656
Each party has begun the race
to select their nominee.

169
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:01,457
But Hanjoo Party announced that
they would select...

170
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:03,496
their nominee
solely based on the opinion poll.

171
00:13:06,266 --> 00:13:07,297
Let's see.

172
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:09,226
All right.

173
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:13,837
Do you know the best way
to win over...

174
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:15,766
the public sentiment?

175
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,937
It's getting their sympathy.

176
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,847
Who's going to sympathize
with someone like you?

177
00:13:23,976 --> 00:13:25,516
You must be really grateful...

178
00:13:26,746 --> 00:13:29,587
that you became useful
in achieving just that.

179
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:33,827
It's all thanks to the new rule
they implemented for the election.

180
00:13:33,927 --> 00:13:37,697
Keep your promise that
you will get my father out on bail.

181
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:41,366
It depends on how well you do.

182
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:44,967
Let's go now.

183
00:13:55,106 --> 00:13:57,047
We demand Noh Yul Seong to withdraw.

184
00:13:57,047 --> 00:13:59,047
- Withdraw!
- Withdraw!

185
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,116
His father-in-law is a criminal.
How dare he run for office?

186
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:04,057
- How dare he?
- How dare he?

187
00:14:04,057 --> 00:14:06,886
Noh Yul Seong is trying to deceive
the people. He must withdraw!

188
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:08,656
- Withdraw!
- Withdraw!

189
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:11,856
Admit his father-in-law is guilty,
and step down with integrity!

190
00:14:11,856 --> 00:14:13,567
- Step down!
- Step down!

191
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,667
We demand Noh Yul Seong to withdraw.

192
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:16,866
(We demand Noh Yul Seong
to withdraw.)

193
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,136
(Noh Yul Seong, out!)

194
00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:38,917
- Comment on their public opinion.
- Withdraw!

195
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:40,526
- Withdraw!
- Withdraw!

196
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:42,996
His father-in-law is a criminal.
How dare he run for office?

197
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:49,736
- Are you all right?
- Get him!

198
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:50,937
Are you okay?

199
00:14:51,797 --> 00:14:52,797
(Number 2, Noh Yul Seong)

200
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:55,136
Are you all right?

201
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:57,006
- He's bleeding.
- Are you okay?

202
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:59,337
- Oh, no.
- He's hurt pretty badly.

203
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:02,906
- Are you all right?
- Oh, no!

204
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:07,386
How's my wife?
Can you keep her safe?

205
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:08,616
Are you all right?

206
00:15:15,587 --> 00:15:17,097
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

207
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:19,097
He's bleeding.

208
00:15:19,197 --> 00:15:21,597
Candidate Noh Yul Seong
of Hanjoo Party received stitches...

209
00:15:21,597 --> 00:15:23,667
for a stab wound inflicted by
an attacker when he tried...

210
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,537
to stop the assailant
from harming his wife today.

211
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,866
What's Ms. Han doing with him?

212
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:31,577
I heard he was going into politics.
He's putting on a show.

213
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:34,606
That explains why
they changed the election rule.

214
00:15:40,116 --> 00:15:42,787
Ms. Han. Please pick up your phone.

215
00:15:47,957 --> 00:15:50,597
Find out where Noh Yul Seong
got treated, and text it to me.

216
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:52,197
Okay.

217
00:16:05,537 --> 00:16:07,006
Let me explain.

218
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,177
Some people told me...

219
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:14,116
to leave my wife.

220
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:20,226
How could I abandon my wife...

221
00:16:21,795 --> 00:16:24,065
because of her father's flaw?

222
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:25,866
That's just ridiculous.

223
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,105
I will protect my wife to the end.

224
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:34,814
And as for the recent incident,

225
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:40,185
I believe those
who incited these assailants,

226
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,715
clinging to outdated principles...

227
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:44,385
such as guilt-by-association,
should be held responsible.

228
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:45,425
Who are those people?

229
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:47,155
Are you implying
your opponent's staff?

230
00:16:47,155 --> 00:16:48,354
Candidate Noh.

231
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,049
Can you stay out of our marriage?
Please?

232
00:17:07,918 --> 00:17:08,989
Get lost.

233
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,858
Shut your mouth...

234
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:13,098
before I reveal the truth
to the reporters.

235
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:17,898
Well, I'll have to disclose
her video too then.

236
00:17:19,229 --> 00:17:20,269
I'm sorry.

237
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:23,838
I want to stop.

238
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,608
Don't worry.
He can't disclose that video.

239
00:17:27,108 --> 00:17:28,179
He'll be arrested right away.

240
00:17:28,578 --> 00:17:30,779
Why would I leak the video myself?

241
00:17:31,979 --> 00:17:34,019
I don't want you to pursue
my case anymore.

242
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:36,549
Ms. Han.

243
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,189
How are you going
to keep living like this?

244
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:40,558
I'm sorry. Could you just...

245
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:43,959
leave?

246
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,509
I think you just got fired.

247
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:03,949
Get out.

248
00:18:35,578 --> 00:18:37,348
When people are given choices,

249
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:39,979
they're bound to choose the path
they can endure.

250
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,779
To her, being with him
must have been...

251
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,588
the path she could endure.

252
00:18:44,989 --> 00:18:46,719
In my opinion,
we should respect her decision.

253
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:52,459
Do you want to drink?

254
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,429
I'm kind of tired today.

255
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:01,168
Okay.

256
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:11,979
Hasn't she learned anything
from you?

257
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:14,519
How could she go back to him
after seeing what he did to you?

258
00:19:15,949 --> 00:19:18,449
It just shows how hard it is
to go through a divorce.

259
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:23,929
Lawyer Dong said Ms. Han...

260
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:26,358
chose the path she could handle.

261
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:29,259
This is a good sign.

262
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,668
What are you talking about?

263
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:35,838
You started
to develop feelings for him.

264
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:38,668
You mentioned him out of the blue.

265
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:42,679
Gosh. It's not that.

266
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,509
Try to make it work this time.

267
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:46,449
It took so many years
for you guys to be together.

268
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,660
(Seo Yun's Nanny, Ms. Lee)

269
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:56,789
Wait.

270
00:19:58,289 --> 00:19:59,289
Yes, Ms. Lee.

271
00:19:59,289 --> 00:20:02,259
It's been a while since
Ms. Han told me about your request.

272
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:03,729
I'm finally giving you a call.

273
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,668
Have you given it some thought?

274
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,338
I will match any conditions
you demand...

275
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:09,368
I'm sorry.

276
00:20:09,368 --> 00:20:10,838
I've thought about this,

277
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:12,308
but I can't let you talk to Seo Yun
on the phone.

278
00:20:12,638 --> 00:20:13,908
Ms. Lee.

279
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,249
If the chairwoman were to find out,
I would lose my job.

280
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:20,418
But I'll send you pictures
every month.

281
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:22,418
Okay.

282
00:20:22,918 --> 00:20:26,618
Then send me his pictures.
Please do that for me.

283
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:33,959
Is that Ms. Lee? Seo Yun's nanny?

(Seo Yun's Nanny, Ms. Lee)

285
00:20:43,168 --> 00:20:44,209
It's Seo Yun.

286
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:47,638
Gosh. Is that Seo Yun?

287
00:20:51,408 --> 00:20:53,279
He grew a lot while I was away.

288
00:20:54,648 --> 00:20:58,118
Gosh. The older he gets,
the more his eyes resemble yours.

289
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:05,058
I...

290
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,929
will bring back my Seo Yun.

291
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:11,128
I will be the one to raise him.

292
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:13,838
Of course, you will!

294

my loss.

301
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,918
There are claims that you have
incited Noh Yul Seong's terrorist.

302
00:22:05,249 --> 00:22:07,489
Why would I do that
against an opposing candidate?

303
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,789
That is just slander.

304
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:10,888

The materials for Han Ji In.

317
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:08,219
We can just follow the manual
and shred them up, right?

318
00:23:08,219 --> 00:23:11,019
No. The solution isn't over.

319
00:23:12,348 --> 00:23:13,388
Let's wait.

320
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:15,658
Until divorce can be bearable.

321
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:17,929

322

Keep tracking the kidnappers.

for liability.

getting in a group chat of

00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:46,979
You're so funny, Dae Gi.

358
00:25:49,808 --> 00:25:52,348
At least it wasn't, "Please give us
some pure chicken feet."

359
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:55,479
That's a good one too.

360
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:02,858
Gosh. I love it.

361
00:26:02,858 --> 00:26:05,328
- Was it too hard to understand?
- Gosh.

362
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:06,689
This was nothing.

363
00:26:08,658 --> 00:26:12,098
I wonder if you're girlfriend
knows you're like this.

364
00:26:12,098 --> 00:26:13,199
I'm dying to tell her.

365
00:26:14,368 --> 00:26:16,439
He got caught by me.

366
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:18,368
I thought she was a college student.
She looks really young.

367
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,479
Gosh. You're good.

368
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:25,148
Is she younger?

369
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,219
She's not older than you?

370
00:26:29,918 --> 00:26:32,249
What? Someone older?

371
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:37,529
The girlfriend with a baby face...

372
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:40,259
It's been four days
since we've become just friends.

373
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:42,898
You got dumped already?

374
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:46,469
- I was the one to dump her.
- Because you saw it coming.

375
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:49,138
"Dump her before you get dumped."
This is my motto.

376
00:26:49,138 --> 00:26:51,308
- That's so pathetic.
- Why is that pathetic?

377
00:26:51,308 --> 00:26:54,509
Hold on. Are you saying
you're single right now?

378
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:55,878
Yes.

379
00:26:57,108 --> 00:26:58,108
Why?

380
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:00,108
I'm not sure.

381
00:27:01,648 --> 00:27:03,479
- Is that so?
- Yes.

382
00:27:05,189 --> 00:27:08,088
Gosh. Then let's make a toast.

383
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:11,029
This is for the one
who got dumped by Dae Gi.

384
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:13,529
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

385
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:25,308
Please give us
some pure chicken feet.

386
00:27:27,908 --> 00:27:30,279
Shall we drink some more?

387
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,049
We'll get going now.

388
00:27:33,848 --> 00:27:35,118
Bye.

389
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:37,148
- Bye.
- All right. Bye.

390
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:38,618
- Bye.
- Bye.

391
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:39,848
- Dae Gi.
- Yes?

392
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,719
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

393
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:45,088
- I'm perfectly fine.
- Right.

394
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,959
Goodness. Those are the good times.

395
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:54,969
The air feels great.

396
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:57,939
It's stuffy.

397
00:27:57,939 --> 00:28:00,939
The weather is amazing too.
My goodness.

398
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,709
The moon is covered by the clouds.

399
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:04,378
- Gosh.
- Are you drunk?

400
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:07,918
Besides having headaches
thanks to our clients,

401
00:28:08,878 --> 00:28:10,549
life is great fun.

402
00:28:13,189 --> 00:28:14,219
Well,

403
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,189
I can't even remember
the last time I had fun.

404
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:21,959
Have you ever been...

405
00:28:23,058 --> 00:28:24,529
in a one-man band before?

406
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,799
Playing all the instruments
on your own.

407
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,469
- Gosh, that's just...
- Are you drunk?

408
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,709
I thought you were a better drinker
when you were younger.

409
00:28:33,709 --> 00:28:35,509
I've still got it.

410
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:37,348
I'm full of energy.

411
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,108
- Full of energy, my foot.
- Aren't I right?

- Gosh.
- What did you just say?

416
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:03,239
Oh, come on.

417
00:29:05,068 --> 00:29:06,739
Sir, we were just drinking together.

418
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:08,509
- We weren't doing anything.
- We feel wronged.

419
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:10,239
We're lovers.

420
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,679
This isn't prostitution!

421
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,848
Keep a straight face.

422
00:29:12,848 --> 00:29:14,679
- Right.
- Oh, hey.

423
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,818
Head over to the farthest room.
You'll find a similar guy.

425

Follow me.

This way.

427
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:35,598
Did you find him?

428
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:37,709
You can see him, right?
This is him, right?

429
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:38,969
It's him.

430
00:29:39,668 --> 00:29:41,539
The jerk who tore up my shirt.

431
00:29:42,509 --> 00:29:43,539
Confirmed.

432
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:49,979
It was Noh Yul Seong, wasn't it?

433
00:29:51,588 --> 00:29:53,959
- What?
- The kidnapping of CEO Noh's wife.

434
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,719
Let's be honest and get out of here.

435
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:58,959
Prostitution is just embarrassing!

437
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:04,128
Come out in order.

438
00:30:04,128 --> 00:30:05,828
I'll make sure to have the police...

439
00:30:05,828 --> 00:30:08,299
to deal with your phone
with extra care.

440
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:09,338
Give it back.

441
00:30:09,969 --> 00:30:11,469
Gosh.

442
00:30:11,469 --> 00:30:13,668
Sure. You can be the one
to give it to them.

443
00:30:18,878 --> 00:30:20,308

I'll get back to you.

447
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:34,229
He was sent to the prosecution,
but he's denying it.

448
00:30:34,229 --> 00:30:36,259
He's saying he did the kidnapping
on his own for money.

449
00:30:36,828 --> 00:30:38,199
Is he from the Suicide Squad?

450
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:40,199
Even so,
Pandora's Box has been opened.

no matter what.)

454
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:51,009

Everything says it's him.

00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,098
But he'll find a way out.

462
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,328
The evidence isn't clear enough.

463
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:18,769
If Candidate Noh gets elected,

464
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:21,279

will come to nothing.

(Hanjoo Party Seoha-gu

466
00:31:22,308 --> 00:31:25,408
I'm pretty sure he'll get released
by the power of his son-in-law.

467
00:31:25,949 --> 00:31:29,878
Candidate Jung,
I will make a promise right here.

468
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:32,989
Until the final decision
of my father-in-law's case,

469
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:36,259
I will not submit
a bail application.

470
00:31:37,058 --> 00:31:39,628
And if the result of this trial...

471
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,898
goes beyond common sense,

472
00:31:42,658 --> 00:31:44,799
I will stop any form of bail.

473
00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:47,568
Law...

474
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:50,838
must be equal to all people.

475
00:31:50,838 --> 00:31:52,939
That's my belief
as a man who knows the law.

476
00:31:53,239 --> 00:31:55,009
All right.
That was Candidate Jung's...

477
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:56,908
Has the bail application
not been submitted yet?

478
00:31:58,509 --> 00:31:59,878
I'm not sure.

479
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,588
So he hasn't submitted it.
I've just been used.

480
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:21,068
She left.

481
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:23,739
Is it over?

482
00:32:25,908 --> 00:32:28,279
CEO Noh made a nationwide promise.

483
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,078
He said he'd stop his father-in-law
from bailing out.

484
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:31,808
How does Ms. Han look?

485
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:33,449
She just left.

486
00:32:33,449 --> 00:32:35,578
You can just read it from her face.
"Very angry."

487
00:32:36,818 --> 00:32:38,049
Great work. Come back to the office.

488
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:39,118
- Okay.
- Okay.

489
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,058
It will sting if you get hit
on the back of your head.

490
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:49,098
Won't this be enough for her to feel
that divorce is bearable?

491
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:53,729
You're right. He just said he'd
stop her father from bailing out.

492
00:32:54,999 --> 00:32:56,138
Shall we begin, then?

493

you all want Seoha Station.

What's the most important thing?

513
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,679
It's preparing the related bills, right?

514
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,679
- Yes!
- Yes!

515
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,108
As a former lawyer,
I will make sure to...

516
00:34:11,108 --> 00:34:13,079
I know Noh Yul Seong very well!

517
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:16,949
I'm his former wife!

518
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,188
Who is she?

519
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:19,549
What?

520
00:34:19,648 --> 00:34:20,958
What are you doing? Stop her.

521
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:25,088

522
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:27,858
- Gosh!
- All right!

523
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,128
- We'll get going.
- Noh Yul Seong!

Congratulations.
You've still got a taste of it.

529
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:48,119
I got so surprised.

530
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,378
The things we do for work
is just crazy.

531
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:53,148
Gosh. My heart is about to jump out.

532
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:57,018
When he doesn't need his wife,
he'll kick her out.

533
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:58,989
While trying to kidnap
his current wife,

534
00:34:58,989 --> 00:35:00,458
he kidnaps his previous wife.

535
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:03,299
He does everything he needs to,
no matter what.

536
00:35:03,998 --> 00:35:06,969
I'm his former wife!

appears at his campaign rally.)

appears at his campaign rally.)

Where's Kim Sa Ra?

543
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:47,509
Are you messing with me?

544
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:52,679
Elections are right around the corner.
What have you done?

545
00:35:54,148 --> 00:35:55,148
Sue me.

546
00:35:56,449 --> 00:35:59,248
Sue me for defamation
based on false information.

547
00:36:00,688 --> 00:36:01,788
That was what that was for.

548
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,829
What?

549
00:36:16,338 --> 00:36:17,338
What are you saying?

550
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,208
You have to sue me
for the court to decide what's true.

551
00:36:20,668 --> 00:36:23,978
To know if you really tried to
kidnap your current wife...

552
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:26,179
but ended up kidnapping
your former wife.

553
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:30,619
I will...

554
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,418
do an interview tomorrow.

555
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:36,759
If anyone like a journalist...

556
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:39,059
asks you anything,

557
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:42,099
just admit that I was right.

558
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,128
Why should I?

559
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:46,829
Do you think that
the world revolves...

560
00:36:46,929 --> 00:36:48,068
just around you, Noh Yul Seong?

561
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:49,538
If you do that for me,

562
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:52,338
then I will update you on Seo Yun...

563
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:55,279
once a month. How does that sound?

564
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:04,719
Excuse me, Mr. Noh Yul Seong.

565
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,248
I make the offers.

566
00:37:08,788 --> 00:37:10,219
"I, Noh Yul Seong,"

567
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,088
"admit the responsibility
of the failure of marriage..."

568
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:15,559
"and will pay Han Ji In
an alimony of one million dollars."

569
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:16,998
Sign it right here.

570
00:37:18,168 --> 00:37:21,168
If you agree to do so,
I will do that interview...

571
00:37:22,398 --> 00:37:23,398
that you want me to do.

572
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32,309
What are you doing?

573
00:37:33,279 --> 00:37:36,549
Get out. Why are you causing trouble
in someone else's office?

574
00:37:39,788 --> 00:37:44,389
Gosh, Kim Sa Ra and Dong Gi Jun.
You two really made it work.

575
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:47,029
Forget it.

576
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:51,799
Make sure to say the right things
to those journalists.

577
00:37:53,568 --> 00:37:55,768
Brace yourself if you fail to do so.

578
00:37:55,768 --> 00:37:57,838
I won't care about you
or Seo Yun anymore. Got it?

579
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:02,878
Get out of my way.

580
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:24,728
Was he like that
when you lived with him?

581
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:27,469
How dare he use violence?

582
00:38:27,469 --> 00:38:30,869
I was getting on his nerves
on purpose to get him riled up.

583
00:38:33,208 --> 00:38:35,579
Well, it's D-Day tomorrow.

584
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:41,079
I guess it's great that he's moving
according to our plan.

585
00:39:05,068 --> 00:39:06,208
Thank you for coming.

586
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:08,838
Let's sit.

587
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:17,248
I wanted to see you
before ending things.

588
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:22,659
We got the kidnapper.

589
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:26,489
As expected, Noh Yul Seong...

590
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:28,099
was the one to instigate it.

591
00:39:34,029 --> 00:39:35,038
I...

592
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:37,838
will keep it in.

593
00:39:39,438 --> 00:39:42,378
If I do so, it will be of help
for my father.

594
00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:45,049
If you just keep it in like that,

595
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:48,349
that's all you'll do
for the rest of your life.

596
00:39:52,088 --> 00:39:53,288
That person...

597
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:02,228
knows my weakness.

598
00:40:02,628 --> 00:40:05,628
When he's cornered,
you never know what he'll do.

599
00:40:05,628 --> 00:40:06,728
You know he's that kind of person.

600
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:10,699
I sure do.

601
00:40:12,568 --> 00:40:16,208
So there's only one way to win.

I've been harassed
by my former wife. It's true.

She is someone who was imprisoned...

607
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,009
for doing things behind my back.

608
00:40:54,978 --> 00:40:57,478
After our divorce,

609
00:40:58,349 --> 00:41:00,318
unfortunately, she has been
continuing to slander me...

610
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:02,259
with false information.

611
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:05,188
Was your current wife
aware of this as well?

612
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:06,529
Yes, of course.

for my wife...

through all this.

Please say a word.

you understand what had happened.

Hello. I'm Han Ji In.

621
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:39,358
The things my husband's former wife
said yesterday.

622
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:41,759
So...

623
00:41:43,228 --> 00:41:46,429
her claim that Candidate Noh
tried to kidnap me...

624
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:48,599
but ended up kidnapping
his former wife...

625
00:41:52,268 --> 00:41:53,409
is all true.

626
00:41:54,409 --> 00:41:56,208
- What?
- What?

627
00:41:59,748 --> 00:42:01,748
Is there any evidence
that it was Candidate Noh?

628
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:03,748
It's all in this phone.

629
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:06,248
The kidnapper got orders
from Chayul Law Firm.

630
00:42:06,248 --> 00:42:08,489
- How did you get that?
- What?

631
00:42:10,088 --> 00:42:11,389
I never said it was
the kidnapper's phone.

632
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:12,858
It's just the same model.

00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:17,059
I will give a clear explanation
about this...

635
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:18,369
But why didn't you report this
to the police?

636
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,529
Because I am...

637
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,739
being threatened by my husband.

638
00:42:25,538 --> 00:42:26,869
Let's take the initiative.

639

Say you're being blackmailed by him
with hidden camera footage.

640
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:33,549
You want me to say it?

641
00:42:33,549 --> 00:42:35,818
That's the only way
to block Noh Yul Seong.

642
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,588
We can also hold him accountable
for the breakdown of the marriage.

643
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:43,818
- No.
- The contents of the blackmail...

644

is true.

647

Candidate Noh exploited
his wife's weaknesses...

648
00:42:55,998 --> 00:42:57,639
and made her
help his election campaign.

00:46:13,593 --> 00:46:14,923
Oh, right. Drink first.

708
00:46:16,162 --> 00:46:17,392
- Yes.
- Thanks for your efforts.

709
00:46:18,962 --> 00:46:20,033
Yes?

710
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:23,102
Yes, I'm Na Yu Mi's professor.

711
00:46:23,332 --> 00:46:24,403
Who is this?

712
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:26,973
What?

713
00:46:27,173 --> 00:46:28,703
Where is she?

714
00:46:29,243 --> 00:46:30,673
How hurt is she?

715
00:46:31,002 --> 00:46:33,872
Yes, okay.

716
00:46:33,872 --> 00:46:34,872
One thing for sure...

717
00:46:35,142 --> 00:46:38,513
is that he didn't know
about Yu Mi's accident before the call.

718
00:46:38,852 --> 00:46:41,453
But the fact that he committed suicide
because of that incident...

719
00:46:43,823 --> 00:46:45,122
is not understandable.

720
00:47:02,973 --> 00:47:05,243
Oh, hello.

721
00:47:06,412 --> 00:47:07,542
Who are you?

722
00:47:08,982 --> 00:47:11,783
You are
Na Yu Mi's grandfather, right?

723
00:47:13,312 --> 00:47:14,352
Yes.

724
00:47:17,082 --> 00:47:18,122
Here.

725
00:47:23,462 --> 00:47:25,662
You kept all of her belongings.

726
00:47:26,062 --> 00:47:30,232
Was there really someone
who said that Yu Mi...

727
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:31,562
didn't commit suicide?

728
00:47:32,703 --> 00:47:35,772
Yes, I'll call you
once I find that person.

729
00:47:35,942 --> 00:47:36,973
Okay.

730
00:47:38,303 --> 00:47:40,942
I'll check her belongings.

731
00:47:41,113 --> 00:47:42,113
Okay.

732
00:47:47,812 --> 00:47:49,352
(To Yu Mi)

733
00:48:00,662 --> 00:48:01,732
Wait.

734
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:05,673
I thought her phone was lost.

735
00:48:05,803 --> 00:48:08,173
I could only retrieve her call logs.

736
00:48:08,173 --> 00:48:11,073
Maybe it was her old phone.
It was in her drawer.

737
00:48:14,973 --> 00:48:17,783
If you're okay with it,
can I bring the phone...

738
00:48:17,783 --> 00:48:19,183
and look inside?

739
00:48:23,022 --> 00:48:24,423
I've unlocked it.

740
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:25,923
- Already?
- Yes.

741
00:48:26,752 --> 00:48:27,923
Dae Gi.

742
00:48:28,763 --> 00:48:30,923
- There's nothing you can't do.
- Stop.

743
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:33,363
Thanks.

(Photos)

747
00:48:47,212 --> 00:48:49,542
It was her second phone
that she used with him.

748
00:48:49,942 --> 00:48:51,412
Who is she?

749
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:53,252
It's a case
that I was investigating.

750
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:56,923
Let's not tell Ms. Kim for now.

751
00:48:58,923 --> 00:49:00,622
She might be bothered by it.

752
00:49:00,953 --> 00:49:01,962
Okay.

753
00:49:22,412 --> 00:49:26,383
Na Yu Mi, who's deceased,
and Noh Yul Seong were having an affair.

754
00:49:26,553 --> 00:49:28,982
Noh Yul Seong
took Professor Seo's phone...

755
00:49:28,982 --> 00:49:31,653
who had a last call with Na Yu Mi.

756
00:49:31,653 --> 00:49:34,122
(Na Yu Mi, Noh Yul Seong,
Seo Woong Jin)

757
00:49:34,122 --> 00:49:36,223
- For goodness' sake!
- I said I didn't want it!

758
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,093
- Listen to me!
- Jung Sang Joo!

759
00:49:38,223 --> 00:49:39,593
- Jung Sang Joo!
- Jung Sang Joo!

760
00:49:39,593 --> 00:49:41,192
I had trust.

761
00:49:41,392 --> 00:49:43,562
Party members and comrades.

762
00:49:44,263 --> 00:49:46,703
Your choice was right.

763
00:49:46,703 --> 00:49:47,772
(Hanjoo Party's Jung Sang Joo
is confirmed to go for by-election.)

764
00:49:47,772 --> 00:49:48,803
I, Jung Sang Joo,

765
00:49:49,303 --> 00:49:51,343
will not disappoint you.

766
00:49:51,602 --> 00:49:54,973
I'll do my best to win...

767
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:57,883
the by-election!

768
00:50:03,082 --> 00:50:06,053
- Jung Sang Joo!
- Jung Sang Joo!

769
00:50:06,053 --> 00:50:07,223
- Jung Sang Joo!
- Jung Sang Joo!

770
00:50:07,223 --> 00:50:08,522
- Is he coming out?
- He's coming out!

771
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:13,593
Did you predict that you'd lose?

772
00:50:13,732 --> 00:50:15,502
Do you think your ex-wife
and your current wife's teamwork...

773
00:50:15,502 --> 00:50:17,062
affected the result?

774
00:50:20,903 --> 00:50:23,803
Did you go through
your second divorce after that incident?

775
00:50:28,582 --> 00:50:31,513
Reporters, thanks for your efforts.

776
00:50:32,453 --> 00:50:34,212
It's not even a difficult question.

777
00:50:34,212 --> 00:50:36,522
- Please comment.
- Please say something about it.

778
00:50:36,522 --> 00:50:38,692
- Please comment.
- Please say something about it.

779
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:57,673
They only ask about your present
and past wife until the end.

780
00:50:58,002 --> 00:51:00,073
Those questions aren't for you
who lost in the election.

781
00:51:04,613 --> 00:51:06,553
Let's postpone our dinner.

782
00:51:07,412 --> 00:51:10,323
They ruined our plan.

783
00:51:10,522 --> 00:51:11,923
I can never forgive them.

784
00:51:19,692 --> 00:51:20,792
Me neither.

785
00:51:35,042 --> 00:51:38,183
I hesitated too much.

786
00:51:41,212 --> 00:51:43,783
No worries. I was like that too.

787
00:51:45,423 --> 00:51:47,692
Even if you break up
with someone you dislike,

788
00:51:48,223 --> 00:51:49,263
divorce is difficult.

789
00:51:50,593 --> 00:51:51,692
Thank you.

790
00:51:56,303 --> 00:51:58,933
Because of the reporters,
he would want to end this quickly.

791
00:51:59,303 --> 00:52:02,142
Regardless of the amount,
we will receive alimony and settle.

792
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,383
(Husband)

793
00:52:14,513 --> 00:52:16,082
- What?
- Let's meet today.

794
00:52:17,022 --> 00:52:18,283
The court.

795
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:19,923
See you at the court.

796
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:21,192
I'm going to file for divorce.

797
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:26,392
You know where Chayul Town is
going to be built, right?

798
00:52:27,232 --> 00:52:28,292
Come here.

799
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,363
Why would I?

800
00:52:30,363 --> 00:52:32,073
You aren't coming home.

801
00:52:32,073 --> 00:52:34,732
Do you want to meet me at my office
where thousands of people are?

802
00:52:39,812 --> 00:52:41,942
I know that place well too.

803
00:52:41,942 --> 00:52:43,113
Shall we meet there?

804
00:52:43,343 --> 00:52:46,352
Let me talk to Han Ji In.
I'm not talking to you.

805
00:52:48,283 --> 00:52:49,323
Aren't you...

806
00:52:49,953 --> 00:52:52,392
trying to negotiate
the divorce settlement?

807
00:52:54,053 --> 00:52:55,763
Or we can meet you at the court!

808
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:06,002
This area will be demolished,
starting next week.

809
00:53:06,403 --> 00:53:08,843
The law school will be built here.

810
00:53:08,843 --> 00:53:09,872
At S1.

811
00:53:13,542 --> 00:53:14,712
It's raining.

812
00:53:15,812 --> 00:53:17,642
Why the heck is it raining?

813
00:53:18,243 --> 00:53:19,252
I'm sorry.

814
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:22,283
The rain...

815
00:53:29,892 --> 00:53:31,062
I'm almost there.

816
00:53:31,062 --> 00:53:34,263
I think I'll be about ten minutes late
because of the traffic.

817
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:35,732
Please wait for me at the front.

818
00:53:36,232 --> 00:53:37,633
I'll meet him first.

819
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:40,002
No, wait. I don't feel it's right
for you to meet him alone.

820
00:53:40,633 --> 00:53:44,002
I'm his son's mother. Don't worry.

821
00:53:59,053 --> 00:54:00,093
Since it's raining,

822
00:54:01,323 --> 00:54:02,763
he's waiting inside.

823
00:54:13,332 --> 00:54:16,343
(We oppose to redevelopment.)

824
00:54:16,843 --> 00:54:18,203
(No entry)

825
00:54:25,243 --> 00:54:27,013
(We oppose to redevelopment.)

826
00:55:19,002 --> 00:55:21,903
I didn't know I'd meet you here.

827
00:55:22,803 --> 00:55:25,473
I thought you'd build...

828
00:55:25,473 --> 00:55:27,712
Chayul Town here
right after divorcing me.

829
00:55:29,212 --> 00:55:30,212
But I guess I was wrong.

830
00:55:31,082 --> 00:55:32,153
I'll give you 500,000 dollars.

831
00:55:33,352 --> 00:55:37,122
But drop the lawsuit
and agree to the divorce settlement.

832
00:55:38,553 --> 00:55:40,653
Can I consider that as the alimony?

833
00:55:40,653 --> 00:55:41,953
I'll give you 500,000 dollars,

834
00:55:42,892 --> 00:55:44,263
so we can sign a contract.

835
00:55:45,122 --> 00:55:46,763
Han Ji In isn't getting it
as the alimony.

836
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:52,872
I guess this was why
Hong Gil Dong felt it was unfair.

837
00:55:52,872 --> 00:55:55,433
She can't call her alimony
as alimony.

838
00:55:56,772 --> 00:55:58,912
If you're a representative,
you should negotiate...

839
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,013
as a representative.
Don't be obstinate.

840
00:56:04,113 --> 00:56:06,712
Do you know what people said
when I divorced without alimony?

841
00:56:07,412 --> 00:56:09,423
"What did she do wrong that she..."

842
00:56:09,522 --> 00:56:12,852
"couldn't even get a single penny
from Chayul and get kicked out?"

843
00:56:18,993 --> 00:56:21,133
I can't let Ms. Han
go through the same thing.

844
00:56:22,602 --> 00:56:25,732
I say 700,000 dollars.
Admit that this is for alimony.

845
00:56:26,933 --> 00:56:28,303
It'll be 900,000 dollars next time.

846
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,883
- Seo Yun, it's Daddy.
- Dad!

847
00:56:41,383 --> 00:56:42,723
- Don't you miss me?
- Seo Yun!

848
00:56:42,723 --> 00:56:43,723
- I miss you.
- Seo Yun.

849
00:56:44,122 --> 00:56:46,792
- I'll call you back. Okay?
- Let me talk to him!

850
00:56:46,892 --> 00:56:49,692
- You're crazy.
- Hey, are you crazy?

851
00:56:49,692 --> 00:56:52,093
Do you want to talk to your son?

852
00:56:52,863 --> 00:56:53,933
Agree to my terms, then.

853
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:57,263
Are you using our child?
You despicable jerk!

854
00:56:57,263 --> 00:57:00,433
I said I'd let you live comfortably.

855
00:57:00,933 --> 00:57:03,642
I told you I'd let you be my first!

856
00:57:03,642 --> 00:57:05,673
Why would I receive your money?

857
00:57:06,113 --> 00:57:08,942
I don't deal with rotten people.

858
00:57:09,312 --> 00:57:10,613
I'll take everything away from you!

859
00:57:10,613 --> 00:57:12,142
Try to take it away. Try.

860
00:57:15,153 --> 00:57:16,622
Hey. Take it away.

861
00:57:16,723 --> 00:57:18,383
- Mr. Noh!
- Try taking it.

862
00:57:18,383 --> 00:57:19,792
Try to take it away. Say something.

863
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:22,363
- Calm down. Don't do this.
- Try to take it away! Take it!

864
00:57:30,502 --> 00:57:32,933
You'll never see Seo Yun again.

866
00:57:51,352 --> 00:57:53,852
Stuck there, she needs to urinate
and defecate to come to her senses.

867
00:58:04,303 --> 00:58:07,703
Noh Yul Seong! Open the door!

868
00:58:37,703 --> 00:58:39,473
Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!

869

872
00:59:51,602 --> 00:59:52,613
Yes, hello?

873
00:59:52,613 --> 00:59:55,613
There's a fire at Seoha-gu
within the redevelopment area 1 and 2.

874
00:59:55,613 --> 00:59:56,642
Please come quick.

(Queen of Divorce)

883
01:02:56,622 --> 01:02:58,292
Hi. Lawyer Dong.

884
01:02:58,292 --> 01:02:59,533
Do you know each other?

885
01:02:59,533 --> 01:03:01,533
We used to date.

886
01:03:02,133 --> 01:03:04,133
Don't care so much about us.

887
01:03:04,133 --> 01:03:05,133
I don't!

888
01:03:05,462 --> 01:03:07,533
Shall we be together today?

889
01:03:07,673 --> 01:03:09,073
Choi La Hee, you're still the same.

890
01:03:09,272 --> 01:03:10,843
Your ability to make it impossible
to control.

891
01:03:11,872 --> 01:03:13,343
We can't just leave
Noh Yul Seong alone.

892
01:03:13,343 --> 01:03:15,013
What will you do
if he does that again?

893
01:03:15,343 --> 01:03:17,082
You can come to save me again.

894
01:03:18,142 --> 01:03:20,153
She doesn't say what's wrong.

895
01:03:20,153 --> 01:03:21,683
Oh, it's Lawyer Dong.

896
01:03:23,153 --> 01:03:24,482
Why are you here?

897
01:03:24,653 --> 01:03:27,953
Is it because you want to get close
to Noh Yul Seong through me?

898
01:03:27,953 --> 01:03:28,953
It's not like that.

899
01:03:28,953 --> 01:03:31,292
That's why you said
three months would be enough.

900
01:03:31,292 --> 01:03:33,033
That's not it, Sa Ra!

901
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:35,792
Let's end it here, then.

902
01:03:37,061 --> 01:03:39,001
