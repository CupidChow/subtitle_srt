(Seongwoong General Hospital)

6
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,929
Gosh.

7
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:20,210
Are you awake?

8
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,239
Are you okay?

9
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:26,078
How could I be?

10
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,219
Gosh, the pillow here is nice.

11
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,319
I found you passed out in my house.

12
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,190
I see.

13
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:37,060
- Gosh. Wait.
- What is it?

14
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,690
What's wrong?

15
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,000
- Prosecutor Park Jin Woo?
- Yes.

16
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:48,799
Both of our houses were ransacked.

17
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,738
I bet it has to do with restoring
the data from the phone...

18
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:52,310
or the video of Pastor Cheonji.

19
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:55,810
Prosecutor Park won't answer your call.

20
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,180
What?

21
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,380
Prosecutor Park got a
job at Chayul Law Firm.

22
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:34,449
What?

23
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,749
Noh Yul Seong must have
raided our houses...

24
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,270
in case we had any copies of the data.

25
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,060
I see.

26
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,900
I'm sorry. I trusted my friend too much.

27
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,859
Look what happened to me. I'm
here because I trusted my husband.

28
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:00,669
Gosh.

29
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:03,979
I'm the one who was trapped
in the prison of trust.

30
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,680
This is awful. You hurt your right hand.

31
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,859
I want to watch an action movie.

32
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,129
(Action)

33
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,840
Wait. No. I want to watch a comedy movie.

34
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,939
Romance. Romance sounds good.

35
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:41,919
(Ro)

36
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,469
Are you sure you can't use your right hand?

37
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,460
Let me.

38
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,639
Right. What was the title of that movie?

39
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,738
In the movie, Jesse and
Celine meet in Paris.

40
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:09,979
We watched that movie together.

41
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,549
You mean...

42
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,048
"Before Sunset?"

43
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,150
Yes. That's the one.

44
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,719
They also met after nine years. Right?

45
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,800
I want to watch that movie.

46
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,069
Watch this drama instead.
People say it's good.

47
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:27,929
- I'm leaving now.
- Wait.

48
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,970
What should I do when I finish the drama?

49
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,069
Close the laptop like this.

50
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,239
So I closed the laptop like this.

51
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,410
Let's go out.

52
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:45,308
Forget it. I can go alone.

53
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:47,249
No. I want to get some fresh air.

54
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,720
Can you get my shoes?

55
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,960
(Episode 8)

56
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,160
We won't be able to investigate
Professor Seo's further, right?

57
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,999
I'll start at square one.

58
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,900
I'll look for evidence that
Na Yu Mi's death was homicide,

59
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,169
not suicide.

60
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:08,739
- What if you find it?
- I'll demand for a reinvestigation.

61
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,938
I can use Na Yu Mi's case to
investigate Noh Yul Seong.

62
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,340
Then it might lead me to
Professor Seo's case too.

63
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,049
Right. Before I do that, I will have to...

64
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,749
watch a movie first.

65
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,549
- Get back inside.
- Okay.

66
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:31,929
Right.

67
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:37,900
You should sleep at a hotel tonight.

68
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:39,769
- What?
- I doubt you can sleep at home.

69
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,369
You easily get scared.

70
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,470
Who says I easily get scared?

71
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,938
Says you. You get scared easily.

72
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:50,979
Don't act like you don't.

73
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,030
(Park Jin Woo)

74
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,080
Did you throw that away?

75
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:37,879
You were too lazy to
throw this away, right?

76
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
I didn't find anything...

77
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,681
on the security footage from both houses.

78
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,778
The police officer who was
investigating dropped the case too.

79
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,379
Nice. I knew you were good. Why
couldn't you be like this before?

80
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,850
- Focus on Kim Young A. What's this?
- Yes, sir.

81
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,460
You can go now.

82
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,859
What's this?

83
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,998
My gosh. The chairwoman
went on and on about...

84
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:30,738
how you had to be the next
party representative...

85
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:32,508
no matter what. She
avidly advocated for you.

86
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:34,539
I'm grateful for the support.

87
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,239
That's why I prepared that for you.

88
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,949
This pastor is known as
Kim Young A's mentor.

89
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,349
Was this true?

90
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,631
Can you look at the next photo?
It gets more interesting.

91
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,789
This man, Pastor Cheonji, is
a cult leader, straight up.

92
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,460
He says he heals people with
superpower or something.

93
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,769
Oh, my.

94
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:03,569
Is Kim Young A a believer of this cult?

95
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,409
Even if she isn't, I doubt that...

96
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:07,670
she can neither accept
nor deny her connection.

97
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:10,478
Her husband is an actual
believer of this cult.

98
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:12,350
(Cheonji Dongsan)

99
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,769
Gosh. You know, I have a
hunch about you these days.

100
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,099
You've been going on blind dates, right?

101
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,970
So you're not blind today.

102
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,440
- What?
- You know,

103
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:45,059
you ought to discuss stuff
like that with the expert here.

104
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:49,579
I'll go and get some coffee.
Iced Americano, right?

105
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,919
No. I want chamomile.

106
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,420
A certain someone is
making my heart flutter.

107
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,429
Did you read Kim Young A's news article?

108
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:01,430
What?

109
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,430
(Kim Young A)

110
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:08,769
("Pastor Cheonji Was Indeed
Kim Young A's Mentor?")

111
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:13,040
There's even a controversy about
Kim Young A's faith in a cult.

112
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,580
Did you leak the photo?

113
00:11:21,979 --> 00:11:23,019
Why would I do that?

114
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,050
I had no idea he was a cult
leader when I took the photo.

115
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:28,489
This all worked out.

116
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,590
You must announce your divorce now.

117
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,258
As long as we get a divorce,

118
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,029
no one will care if I'm a believer...

119
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,200
of his religion or not.

120
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
What about the children?

121
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:41,399
They are mine, anyway.
They don't concern you.

122
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:54,979
You should tell the truth.

123
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,290
"I'm not the believer. My husband is."

124
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,248
"He's asking me for a divorce."

125
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:01,729
"But I'll do my best to overcome it."

126
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,859
How will my children face the consequences?

127
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,728
They already know, don't they?

128
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:09,010
But exposing this to the world
will be a different story.

129
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,930
I will avoid doing anything
that might affect my children.

130
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:15,600
Can you please make this
divorce thing go away at least?

131
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,119
Hey, Ms. Lee. What's wrong?

132
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:41,629
Ms. Kim. I mean, Lawyer Kim. I...

133
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:45,199
How dare you communicate
with her behind my back?

134
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Why are you coveting my precious grandson?

135
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,868
She's done nothing wrong. I asked her...

136
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:50,940
Bring Seo Yun.

137
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:56,080
- Listen to me, Seo Yun.
- Seo Yun.

138
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,950
Do you know why your parents got a divorce?

139
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:03,379
Your mother abandoned you
because she's with another man.

140
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,050
Ms. Cha!

141
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:06,489
Remember what I said.

142
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,590
You'll understand it when you grow up.

143
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,329
Seo Yun. That's not true.

144
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,560
Mom.

145
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,629
Mom.

146
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,369
Why are you crying?

147
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,340
Take him with you.

148
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:24,899
Do you get it now?

149
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,840
The more you get in our ways,
the more I will provoke Seo Yun.

150
00:13:29,239 --> 00:13:30,310
This is my warning.

151
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:42,659
(For customers only)

152
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:02,210
(Mom)

153
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,409
The number you dialled does not exist.

154
00:14:06,509 --> 00:14:09,350
Please check and dial again.

155
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:13,989
Mom.

156
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,989
How am I going to protect Seo Yun?

157
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:00,800
(General Ward A)

158
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,419
I thought I was going to starve
to death while waiting for you.

159
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,080
Thank you.

160
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,879
- Gosh. You must be his wife!
- Pardon?

161
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:16,779
You guys don't look so young.

162
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,089
You must hurry up and make a baby.

163
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,648
Yes. I'm trying.

164
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:22,118
That's not going to cut it.

165
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,858
- You must try harder.
- Harder.

166
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:25,290
- Yes.
- Yes.

167
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:31,830
What just happened?

168
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,498
Well, she kept saying I should
hire her as my caregiver.

169
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:38,840
I told her my wife was taking care of me.

170
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,639
Why is that me?

171
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,810
I never specified who she was.

172
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,339
Did we look like a married couple?

173
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,790
- I'm hungry.
- Gosh.

174
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:58,629
All right.

175
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:04,259
I at least make you laugh, don't I?

176
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,430
What?

177
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:11,170
It says so on your face. "I'm troubled."

178
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:18,609
As for Ms. Kim Young A,

179
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,710
she won't budge because she
doesn't want to hurt her kids.

180
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,320
I bet you two saw eye to eye.

181
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,719
That must be the reason
behind your trouble.

182
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,590
What else could it be than the children?

183
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:38,499
Let's keep trying and find the
perfect solution for Ms. Kim.

184
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,529
We must try harder.

185
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:54,180
(Incoming call)

186
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,359
- Hello.
- It's about Pastor Cheonji.

187
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,728
Talk to my secretary, please.

188
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:10,230
Wait. I know that your
husband is a believer there.

189
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,099
Because a successful businessman
was a believer of the faith,

190
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,499
my wife believed in the
pastor and went there.

191
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,639
But it was a total cult.

192
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,770
She's neglecting our
laundromat and our children.

193
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:21,740

195
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,119
- Is that the place?
- Yes.

(Dry Cleaning)

197
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,759
Give me back my wife!

198
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,959
Honey!

199
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,869
(We specialize in clothing repairs.)

200
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,219
They forced me out.

201
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,119
They used physical force to kick me out.

202

203
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,299

205
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:19,829

(Member of the Supreme Council, Ha Hyun Ho)

207
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,139
Well,

208
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,139
the husband of Representative
Kim also goes to that church.

209
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,609
It was a cult.

210
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,619
I lost all of my money
and wife to the church.

211
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:38,020
My family was ruined.

212
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:41,989
This is so unfair. It's so wrong.

213
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,218
What is this?

214
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:45,060
That's what I would like to ask you.

215
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:47,189
What have you been up to these days?

216
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,158
Given the recent events,

217
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:51,899
take responsibility as
the party representative.

218
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:54,669
Hand them out.

219
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:57,539
- What's this?
- What?

220
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,139
- Right.
- What is this?

221
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:01,570
- Oh, my.
- I can't believe this.

222
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,556
Take responsibility instead of
trying to cover this up with money.

223
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,020
- How will she face the consequence?
- How could she do that?

224
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,619
This is a big problem.

225
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,919
How will she fix this?

("Why Did Kim Young A Hand
Him the Shopping Bag?")

227
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:27,469
The husband of the laundromat closed
down the shop and disappeared.

228
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,469
- What?
- Talk about an odd coincidence.

229
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,780
Yes.

230
00:19:38,781 --> 00:19:40,510
What was in the shopping bag?

231
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:43,520
She bought a Swiss roll for his children.

232
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,050
Let me see the photo.

233
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,590
Okay. Can you hold it up?

234
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:50,990
Can you see it?

235
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,929
Something is off.

236
00:19:54,129 --> 00:19:56,899
Right? It's as if they were
waiting to take this photo.

237
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,730
I'm sure someone is
behind this whole thing.

238
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,230
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.

239
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:02,839
How are you feeling?

240
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,540
I can use chopsticks with my
left hand pretty well now.

241
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:06,639
I'll get discharged soon.

242
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,639
- Don't exert yourself.
- Okay. Have a good day.

243
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:16,780
What's the hurry?

244
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:19,050
- Pardon?
- What?

245
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,050
Let's find this person.

246
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,458
The one who leaked the photo of Ms.
Kim and Pastor Cheonji.

247
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:27,889
And the one who leaked the photo
of her with the laundromat owner.

248
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:30,760
In my opinion, it was
done by the same person.

249
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,139
I'm craving caffeine.

250
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,409
- Open the glove box.
- What?

251
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,870
Did you put some in here
because I said I liked this?

252
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:51,919
No way.

253
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,459
It's tastier because you got this for me.

254
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:04,859
He's out.

255
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,169
Go.

256
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,180
The first-term assemblymen of
Hanjoo Party declared today...

257
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,070
that they opposed Kim Young A
running for party representative.

258
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:29,159
Sir.

259
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:47,609
How did he find me here?

260
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:50,679
How did you find me here?

261
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,909
- What? You startled me.
- You jerk.

262
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:57,520
You. You're dead meat today.

263
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:07,688
You jerk. I gave you the pictures.
How dare you use them like that?

264
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:09,899
The photo at the restaurant
and the promotional photo.

265
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:12,269
Exactly. Why did you say that
Kim Young A wasn't a believer?

266
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,110
Why did you jabber that
nonsense, you old man?

267
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,799
- I can go inside, right?
- You piece of trash.

268
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,639
Gosh, that hurts. Darn it.

269
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,740
It hurts.

270
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:23,540
That jerk.

271
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:41,129
You jerk. I gave you the pictures.
How dare you use them like that?

272
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:43,329
You used the restaurant and
promotion pictures like that?

273
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,569
They were best buddies,
but they're fighting now.

274
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,070
I thought he would be
using Kim Young A instead.

275
00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:49,789
Noh Yul Seong is playing it smart.

276
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,269
You piece of trash!

277
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,108
Stop! It hurts.

278
00:22:54,109 --> 00:22:56,379
Just a moment. Gosh.

279
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:08,649
Yes?

280
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,520
How are things moving there?

281
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,060
Things moving?

282
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:15,898
Aren't you supposed to
be curious about me...

283
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:17,260
who you left out on the road?

284
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:20,000
I get it. But...

285
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:23,070
providing information
is part of our contract.

286
00:23:28,639 --> 00:23:31,179
Okay? Hello?

287
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,480
Is there anything new to share?

288
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,820
There's nothing new as for now. But...

289
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,290
can you really believe...

290
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,859
I'm keeping my contract duties?

291
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,189
I'm starting to get confused about who's...

292
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,560
on my team.

293
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:00,209
Gosh.

00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,079

- Resign!

296

- Nonsense!

- Nonsense!
- Nonsense!

302

Kim Young A must resign!

303
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,358

A cult is nonsense!

305
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,958
- Nonsense!
- Nonsense!

306
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,799
- Kim Young A must resign!
- Ms. Kim Sa Ra.

307
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,569
- Resign!
- Resign!

308
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,599
- A cult is nonsense!
- Let's talk as we head inside.

309
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,000
- Nonsense!
- Nonsense!

(Ambulance only)

311
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,969
You can't be like this.

312
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:36,079
Once the results come out...

313
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,408
I will discharge the patient!

314
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:38,409
Discharge?

315
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:41,408
We will not discharge him. I apologize.

316
00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:43,479
- What's wrong with you? Move away.
- I heard he had a bloody stool...

317
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,349
- and got here in an ambulance.
- Move!

318
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,049
- Gosh.
- It hurts so much.

319
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,659
- Gosh.
- It hurts.

320
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,388
Let's get on the bed, Sang Hoon.

321
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:54,060
I'm right here.

322
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,060
Be careful. Just a moment.

323
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,358
Take it slow. That's it.

324
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,399
Goodness.

325
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,769
Why are you being like this again?

326
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,468
Have you been skipping out on your pills?

327
00:25:05,469 --> 00:25:07,770
Dad took the pills from me.

328
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,079
Again?

329
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,839
Why are you stopping our sick
child from getting treated?

330
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,979
The pills are getting in the
way from the pastor's prayers.

331
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,079
That's why he isn't getting better.

332
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,149
Sang Hoon can't get better
without any medication.

333
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,790
Don't just be saying things
because this isn't your business.

334
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,159
Honey.

335
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:26,990
Don't stick that in him.

336
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,760
(Emergency Medical Center)

337
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,280
- Hello?
- It's me.

338
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,479
In the law of child welfare,

339
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,449
isn't there something
related to religious beliefs?

340
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,789
Oh, was it Article 17?

341
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,218
There's an article that
states that if a minority...

342
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:00,759
is stopped from being treated
due to religious beliefs,

343
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,858
it can be seen as child abuse.

344
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:03,928
Right. That one.

345
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,929
Is CEO Yoo Min Chul guilty of that?

346
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:09,340
Then even termination of
parental rights is possible.

347
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:12,569
That means Kim Young A...

348
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,439
can legally adopt the kids, right?

349
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:29,719
Mom.

350
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,959
Get a divorce with Dad.

351
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,060
Then...

352
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,800
I won't be able to live with you.

353
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,169
You know that.

354
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,240
It's just so embarrassing...

355
00:26:45,199 --> 00:26:46,840
that my dad is someone like that.

356
00:26:47,209 --> 00:26:49,409
You don't have to feel
that way in front of me.

357
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,609
Aren't we in the same family?

358
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,679
Don't you know what I'm saying?

359
00:26:55,149 --> 00:26:57,580
You should leave our family!

360
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,359
I...

361
00:27:09,859 --> 00:27:12,199
was always worried if
you two would get hurt.

362
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,699
But you're always worrying
about me, Sang Hee.

363
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,310
We can't leave each other.

364
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,879
We're always so worried about each other.
How is that possible?

365
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,090
Dad and the two us...

366
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,219
are of no help for you.

367
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:42,290
I will take good care of Sang Hoon.

Dad.

370
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:17,060
Is the pastor more important to you...

371
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:19,239
or are we more important to you?

372
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,939
We are nothing compared to him.

373
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:26,070
The pastor is someone who is way above us.

374
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:42,020

ambition than their competence...

(The generation-changing

378
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,169
is bound to cause trouble.

379
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:03,479
That's why I distanced
myself from Noh Yul Seong.

380
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,000
But I'm going through all the trouble.

381
00:29:07,209 --> 00:29:08,350
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes?

382
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:11,550
Please take a look at this.

383
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,820
- I will discharge the patient!
- Discharge?

384
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:18,820
We will not discharge him. I apologize.

385
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,259
What's wrong with you?

386
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,889
- Move away.
- Gosh.

387
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,599
There's no place to hide anymore.

388
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,270
You must address your stance.

389
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:30,969
Let's change the ending...

390
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:33,409
to your divorce solution.

391
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:35,769
You want me to get a divorce?

392
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,209
Even if you get a divorce,

393
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,448
I think I can find a way to
let you live the children.

394
00:29:41,449 --> 00:29:42,769
Will that make you get a divorce?

395
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:44,419
If that's possible,

396
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,350
Sang Hee and Sang Hoon's
thoughts matter the most.

397
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,459
I think the children have
already made up their minds.

(Together with the people)

399
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,369
- Mom.
- Sang Hee.

400
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,169
Mom.

401
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,810
I can't do it.

402
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,010
I can't live without you.

403
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,249
Of course.

404
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,379
What kind of daughter
parts from her own mom?

405
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,119
Sang Hee came to me.

406
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,388
If the two of you were to get a divorce,

407
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:25,959
she wanted me to help find a
way to live with her mother.

408
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,300
- You went to her?
- Sang Hoon agreed to it too.

409
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,036
Don't hesitate about getting
a divorce because of us.

410
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,070
Not all families must have
a dad and mom to be happy.

411
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,570
Right.

(Cheonji Dongsan)

413
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,628
Is Kim Young A a member
here with her husband?

414
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:04,776
Have they received treatment
with supernatural powers?

415
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,169
I'll reveal a surprising truth.

416
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:11,070
The CEO of Chayul came to me recently.

417
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:14,169
He wanted us to bring Kim Young A down.

418
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:15,638
Why would he want to do that?

419
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:17,638
Don't you remember the
previous nominations?

420
00:31:17,639 --> 00:31:19,810
The party representative
did not favour him.

421
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,878
That's why he holds a
big grudge against her.

422
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,999
But since I'm not helping
him with bringing her down,

423
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,289
he's making her a member of a cult...

424
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,389
and trying to bring me down as well.

425
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:33,158

- Just a moment!

426

- Pastor!
- Pastor!

00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:42,330
Why can't you finish things off neatly?

429
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:46,069
There's an article sent out
about the false information.

430
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,546
There won't be any favourable arrangements.

431

What can she do at this point?

434
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,718
The newly-elected members
are greatly against...

435
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,519
her being the party representative.

436
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,158
The party members are
holding protests against...

437
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:05,320
the family of cult members.

438
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:10,260
Well, it was a smart move...

439
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,830
to bring out Ha Hyun Ho.

440
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:16,070
If all of the members of the party
are turning their backs against her,

441
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,320
she has already received a
political death sentence.

point to bring out a miracle?

00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,540
I'll go somewhere else.

Right.

- What?

No. I'm just saying... Come on!
Just until you find a place.

Come on. You're the expert at crossing...

What? I thought you were getting
some clothes from your place.

530

535
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:24,440
You don't have to.

536
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,670
Right.

537
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:57,799
You just got discharged.
What are you doing?

538
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,310
I can go inside, right?

539
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:02,838
I'm moving out soon. Why bother?

540
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:05,079
You have to come in here on
your own until you move out.

541
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,580
Removing the traces will
make you feel better.

542
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,350
Here. Your shoes.

543
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,880
Oh, right. I thought you got rid of this.

544
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,119
I was also too lazy to get rid of it.

545
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:57,199
I didn't keep it because I was being lazy.

546
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,339
- Well...
- It's the same for you.

547
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:10,540
I wasn't able to...

548
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,040
get rid of Kim Sa Ra.

549
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,589
Did you like another man?

550
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:32,000
Is that why you're not seeing me?

551
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:47,779
The movie we were going to watch again.

552
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,319
It was an open ending.

553
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,589
What do you think happened to the two...

554
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,679
who got back together after nine years?

555
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,770
They both must have returned
to their own places.

556
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,798
Nine years ago, their hearts were burning.

557
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:15,909
But now, they're at an age
where their minds are burning.

558
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:20,980
At an age filled with thoughts.

559
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,380
Just like us.

560
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,330
My heart which has met
Kim Sa Ra once again...

561
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,569
is still burning.

562
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,199
Nothing can stop it.

563
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,290
When you're able to free up your mind,

564
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:52,759
come back whenever you want.

565
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,509
I'll be right here.

566
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:26,739
I thought there weren't going to
be any miracles for Kim Young A.

567
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,449
Looks like we're the ones
to get the death sentence.

568
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,330
She's a girl the chief
secretary's wife loves.

569
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,230
(Profile)

570
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:54,569
Come on.

571
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:57,349
Did you really have to,
in the middle of this?

572
00:42:58,009 --> 00:42:59,278
Did you not hear?

573
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:01,379
The party members of Hanjoo Party...

574
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,500
must get a call from the
wife to be considered close.

575
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:06,480
This is the only way to shake up the party.

576
00:43:33,139 --> 00:43:34,539
Were you able to free up your mind?

577
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:36,049
What?

578
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,550
You must still need more time.

579
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:41,479
You wanted to have a meeting.

580
00:43:48,989 --> 00:43:49,989
(Pastor Cheonji, Real Name: Cheon Ji San)

581
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:51,130
This solution...

582
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,299
is based on winning parental
rights and destroying Cheonji.

583
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:00,969
Shall we have headbands on this time?

584
00:44:03,779 --> 00:44:04,809
I guess not.

585
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,380
To win parental rights,

586
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,249
we must prove that the
husband's religion is a cult.

587
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,050
There are only rumours
and claims about this.

588
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,690
Can't we use the footage
Lawyer Dong got us?

589
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:18,719
They will just call it
malicious editing again.

590
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:23,389
That's why we'll go with no
editing and reveal everything.

591
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,670
No editing and everything revealed?
How do we do that?

592
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,600
Let's cast the heroine first.

593
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,139
Me again? What's up?

594
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:34,139
Ms. Son, try these on.

595
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:35,770
These?

596
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:41,110
My sister.

597
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,530
- Take them off.
- Take them off?

598
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:44,049
Ms. Son.

599
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,020
- Put them on again.
- Again?

600
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:50,089
- The sister from earlier.
- Take them off?

601
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,589
- What is it?
- Ms. Son.

602
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,088
So you're saying Pastor Cheonji...

603
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:56,528
won't be able to recognize
her without the sunglasses.

604
00:44:56,529 --> 00:44:57,560
That's right.

605
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:00,169
You want me to go back there? I'm scared.

606
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,369
It'll be fine.

607
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:03,449
You'll come with me, right?

608
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,250
Good luck.

609
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,650
Me? For what?

610
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:21,920
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

611
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:24,218
You just need to sit next to Ms. Son.

612
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:25,819
Sit stylishly as usual.

613
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,899
Now, we need Dae Gi and Bom...

614
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,929
to cast the male protagonist.

615
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,868
Who is it?

616
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:37,368
Cheers!

617
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:39,138
- Come out.
- Move, please.

618
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:40,908
Come out.

619
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:42,309
Who are you two?

620
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:43,369
Hello.

621
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:46,178
Do you think buildings are like noodles?

622
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:47,749
You were trying to sneakily eat it all up.

623
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:50,318
That's why you shouldn't
have a second-in-command.

624
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,880
(Certificate of all
registered matters: Building)

625
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:55,589
Did the pastor send you?

626
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:59,560
If you want to keep the
building, work with us.

627
00:45:59,989 --> 00:46:01,888
If you want to go to jail
for embezzlement and fraud,

628
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:02,989
decline our offer.

629
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:04,699
Which one do you prefer?

630
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:32,860
As soon as he gets in the car,
make him drink a vitamin drink.

631
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,730
That's the pastor's routine.

632
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:45,339
(Hwang Vitamin)

633
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,879
If you're not going to pay
for accommodation, wake up.

634
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,279
Gosh, my head hurts.

635
00:46:57,850 --> 00:46:59,750
Who are you?

636
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:03,119
Me?

637
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,330
I'm Prosecutor Son Jang Mi.

638
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,399
Why am I here?

639
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,429
Well,

640
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:16,170
you became unconscious after drinking this.

641
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,699
- Have this tested for ingredients.
- Yes.

642
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:22,509
I think he's on drugs.

643
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:24,509
- Yes.
- Let's see.

644
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:29,150
Name, Cheon Ji San.

645
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:31,850
Occupation, Pastor of Cheonji Dongsan.

646
00:47:32,279 --> 00:47:35,088
Your specialty is therapy
utilizing psychic abilities.

647
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:38,819
- Gosh. Your charge is...
- Prosecutor. Later, please.

648
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,459
I have a bad headache.

649
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,488
My goodness.

650
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:44,928
Someone has died.

651
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:47,329
You are now being urgently arrested...

652
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,069
for involuntary manslaughter.

653
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,368
Who are you?

654
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:52,199
It's a man who has done this many times.

655
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:54,310
First,

656
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:57,440
- look at this photo.
- Who is he?

657
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,600
He passed away while you were trying
to remove the cancerous growth.

658
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,349
Your psychic power was too strong.

659
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,279
I guess you can't control it.

660
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:06,880
Let's do that.

661
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:08,290
That thing.

662
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,860
Yes. Interrogation.

663
00:48:12,259 --> 00:48:14,588
Prosecutor, it's confrontation.

664
00:48:14,589 --> 00:48:16,659
Yes, that's right. Confrontation.

665
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,360
Let's do that. Let's do the confrontation.

666
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,670
It hurts.

667
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,040
Testing.

668
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:32,279
- Your earplugs are in, right?
- Yes.

669
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,579
Are you good at acting?

670
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,979
Bom, how's everything?

671
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,925
- Do it well.
- Outside is done with preparation.

672
00:48:37,949 --> 00:48:39,580
Okay. Let's go.

673
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:43,150
Come in.

674
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,020
My goodness.

675
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:49,529
- Have a seat.
- Oh, gosh.

676
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,599
Why are you here?

677
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,338
Did a church member who was being
treated by Pastor Cheonji...

678
00:49:00,339 --> 00:49:01,909
pass away?

679
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:05,079
Yes, I heard about it.

680
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,678
Hey! When did I?

681
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,310
When he removed the cancerous growth,

682
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,980
the heart stopped.

683
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,088
This never happened.

684
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:16,250
Are you joking?

685
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,618
Seriously, my hand hurts so bad!

686
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:20,190
Do you think this is a joke?

687
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:22,790
Stop the fraud. Tell us the truth.

688
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:24,900
Hurry!

689
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:27,969
Prosecutor, let's take a break.

690
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:29,270
Shall we?

691
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,439
I'll take a break.

692
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,000
My blood pressure is soaring.

693
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,339
What's going on?

694
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,339
What are you talking about?

695
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:43,349
The people who received
treatment from you...

696
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,119
have collectively filed complaints.

697
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:48,219
The psychic power was so strong
that their ribs were broken,

698
00:49:48,449 --> 00:49:50,790
their back was broken, and
they lost their eyesight.

699
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,319
For goodness' sake.

700
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:57,060
I don't have any psychic powers.

701
00:49:57,330 --> 00:49:58,330
Others might overhear.

702
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,729
Only you and I know that it's fake.

703
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,368
Others might overhear!

704
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:06,198
Only you and I know that it's fake!

705
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:07,838
If I had psychic powers,

706
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:10,939
my mother won't have passed away of cancer.

707
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,980
Never mind that.

708
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:13,609
Anyway, the prosecutor...

709
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:15,979
saw the video where you took
out the cancerous growth.

710
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,850
She truly believed that
you had psychic powers.

711
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:23,790
Hey!

712
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:25,388
- Blood from a slaughtered animal.
- Yes.

713
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:26,488
Where did you put it?

714
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:29,789
Let's tell them that the cancerous
growth was from that blood.

715
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:31,698
Then, we can get out of here.

716
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:32,999
Bring it here.

717
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,230
Yes, I'll tell them to bring it.

718
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:41,210
Crazy bastards.

719
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,080
There's no such thing as
psychic powers in this world.

720
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,380
What did you say?

721
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:53,719
You are...

722
00:50:54,049 --> 00:50:56,619
That's not important.

723
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,790
What did you say?

724
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:01,690
Well, it...

725
00:51:02,589 --> 00:51:04,929
doesn't matter what I said.

726
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:09,170
Why not?

727
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:12,600
It matters a lot.

728
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:46,739
- My goodness.
- Oh, my.

729
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:48,149
- What is...
- My goodness.

730
00:51:48,969 --> 00:51:52,480
- Why are we in a revival meeting?
- My goodness.

731
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,009
Everyone!

732
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:57,719
What should I do?

733
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,489
Arrange a revival meeting
inviting all the members in Korea.

734
00:52:01,949 --> 00:52:03,020
Don't let the pastor know.

735
00:52:03,449 --> 00:52:06,659
If it doesn't go well,
your building will be done.

736
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,190
A revival meeting. Okay.

737
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,830
Do you think this is a revival meeting?

738
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,239
Pastor Cheonji is a swindler.

739
00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:22,569
Wasn't it your scene of confession?

740
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:25,039
Crazy bastards.

741
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,710
There's no such thing as
psychic powers in this world.

742
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:38,889
You should know this. The
police are probably here by now.

743
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,960
No way.

744
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,130
You swindlers!

745
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:48,069
How dare you try to deceive me?

746
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:49,529
- Oh, my!
- My goodness!

747
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:52,940
- Oh, my!
- My goodness!

748
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,609
- Let go! Let go of me!
- Hey!

749
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,380
- Oh, my!
- My goodness!

750
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:01,709
- It hurts!
- Where do you think you're going?

751
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,710
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You little...

752
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,080
- Don't do this!
- Hey!

753
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:07,920
Don't we need to help them?

754
00:53:08,449 --> 00:53:09,489
Let it be.

755
00:53:21,429 --> 00:53:23,830
Oh, my.

756
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,520
(Cheonji Dongsan)

757
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,689
Oh, my.

758
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:42,849
- Hurry. Let's go.
- Oh, gosh.

759
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,190
- Come this way.
- This way.

760
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:47,319
Oh, no. What should we do?

761
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,400
How many members withdrew?

762
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,630
Maybe about 30 percent.

763
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,400
The husband is still one of the 70 percent.

764
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:02,940
It would be easier for Kim
Young A to win the custody.

765
00:54:10,779 --> 00:54:12,650
Family is something you're born into.

766
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:14,790
It's about blood relations.

767
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,619
That's what I thought.

768
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:21,030
But it's not after looking
at Kim Young A's case, right?

769
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,210
It's something you can create
even if you're not born into it.

770
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,630
Creating a family is easier than I thought.

771
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:32,670
It's nice.

772
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,449
- Oh, my. I dropped it.
- Why?

773
00:54:46,819 --> 00:54:47,889
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

774
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:56,259
What's wrong?

775
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,729
When we were driving,

776
00:54:58,730 --> 00:55:01,369
where did the coffee cup fall?
Front or back?

777
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:02,670
It fell backward.

778
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:04,368
It flew until here.

779
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:05,500
No.

780
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:09,170
Something falling out of a
running car can't move backward.

781
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:10,779
Newton's laws of motion.

782
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,049
Something that was moving forward
will maintain that motion.

783
00:55:15,409 --> 00:55:16,849
The car was moving fast.

784
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,718
So we believe it fell backward.
But actually it didn't.

785
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:19,779
Right.

786
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,618
So it's correct to fall in front...

787
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,219
of that speed bump I dropped.

788
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:25,690
But why?

789
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:27,929
But at the time of the incident,

790
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:30,959
they said Na Yu Mi opened the
taxi door while it was moving...

791
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,960
and that the driver
immediately hit the brakes.

792
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,899
According to the taxi driver's testimony,

793
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,310
Na Yu Mi should have been found in
front of where he hit the brakes.

794
00:55:43,569 --> 00:55:45,479
But in fact,

795
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,650
she was found about six meters
behind where he hit the breaks.

796
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,219
It doesn't make sense.

797
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:52,649
The position of the body is...

798
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:55,389
a bit strange to call it a suicide.

799
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,119
Then, is it a murder?

800
00:56:01,259 --> 00:56:02,259
Who?

801
00:56:02,589 --> 00:56:03,830
The police should find it out.

802
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:05,060
Reinvestigation.

803
00:56:11,069 --> 00:56:13,269
The brake marks start here,

804
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,239
so Na Yu Mi shouldn't have fallen here...

805
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:18,409
but here.

806
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,738
Physics give me headaches.

807
00:56:20,739 --> 00:56:21,879
But this makes sense.

808
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,008
Right? Let's reinvestigate.

809
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:26,649
- First, call the taxi driver.
- Leave after registering the case.

810
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:27,919
I'll contact you after checking.

811
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,250
That little...

812
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:31,419
When?

813
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,190
I'll contact you when the time comes.

814
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,500
Were you able to meet them?

815
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,779
A mystery of the mistress of
Chayul Law Firm's CEO's death.

816
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:54,040
The reporters are interested.

817
00:56:55,009 --> 00:56:56,110
Yes, so?

818
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:00,279
They can't write if there's no
proof that she was his mistress.

819
00:57:03,619 --> 00:57:05,889
There is a proof.

820
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:06,989
What?

821
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:19,540
(Photos)

822
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,580
I didn't want you to see these.

823
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,310
I'm sorry.

824
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,750
They'll be able to write
articles immediately.

825
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,689
Once the articles are written,

826
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,489
the police will be pushed to reinvestigate.

827
00:57:42,029 --> 00:57:43,060
They should be.

828
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,199
I wish the reinvestigation happens.

829
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,909
This is something to celebrate.

830
00:57:57,679 --> 00:57:58,679
- Here.
- My goodness.

831
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:01,250
Did you only drink here instead of working?

832
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,779
Why is there so much alcohol?

833
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:07,618
I kept it for a day like today.

834
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:08,850
I'm proud of myself.

835
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,900
Here.

836
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:28,839
Congratulations. Finally,
reinvestigation will happen.

837
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:32,610
Noh Yul Seong is getting
closer to the prison.

838
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,179
I hope your head temperature...

839
00:58:37,549 --> 00:58:39,150
gets at least one degree lower.

840
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,900
I'll get going. Take
this taxi to your house.

841
00:58:56,429 --> 00:58:57,839
I don't think I can.

842
00:59:07,509 --> 00:59:09,880
I told you not to linger around Sa Ra.

843
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:13,420
You're doubting me and
reporting me to the police.

844
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,150
When are you going to stop this nonsense?

845
00:59:20,989 --> 00:59:22,029
Look.

846
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:35,239
Hello.

847
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,638
(September 25, 2022, the
day of Na Yu Mi's death)

848
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:37,669
Hello. You came.

849
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:39,739
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

850
00:59:40,279 --> 00:59:42,178
- Hello.
- Hello.

851
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:45,049
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

852
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,790
- You're very beautiful.
- Thank you.

853
00:59:48,049 --> 00:59:50,689
Na Yu Mi got into an accident.
She committed suicide in the taxi.

854
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,388
- The food is great too.
- Oh, really?

855
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:53,460
Thank you.

856
00:59:53,589 --> 00:59:54,669
- Give me a minute.
- Sure.

857
00:59:58,460 --> 00:59:59,560
Did she commit suicide?

858
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:01,830
In the taxi?

859
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,181
I heard she jumped out from
the taxi while it was moving.

860
01:00:12,139 --> 01:00:13,139
Are you sure?

861
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:14,750
Yes.

862
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:16,810
Where?

863
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:17,980
(On her way home. She committed suicide.)

864
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:18,980
(I'm investigating further.)

865
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:19,980
(Keep me posted.)

866
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,830
Now you understand the situation, right?

867
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:37,869
Who would send messages like
that if I knew she was dead?

868
01:00:41,509 --> 01:00:43,269
I'm not the culprit in
your eyes too, right?

869
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:51,080
If rumours spread, and someone
writes an article about it,

870
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,790
do you know how much you would
need to pay for compensation?

871
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,520
It could be fake messages for an alibi.

872
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:01,230
Okay. Then, let's do this.

873
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:04,429
Compensate with money for its cause.

874
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:07,899
I'll claim damages from you...

875
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:10,699
enough to ruin you. Okay?

876
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:26,719
Noh Yul Seong isn't lying.

877
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:28,389
Noh Yul Seong isn't related...

878
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:31,920
to Na Yu Mi's death?

879
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:44,230
(Prime suspect)

880
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:58,880
(Who murdered Na Yu Mi?)

881
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,568
The divorce papers will
be ready by next week.

882
01:02:15,569 --> 01:02:17,270
It's all thanks to team SOLUTION.

883
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:22,009
I have a personal desire
for someone like you...

884
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:23,409
to succeed.

885
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,080
Would you like to expand
your personal desire?

886
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:32,650
Would you like to work with me?

887
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:34,479
For the campaign?

888
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,589
If I have three people like you,

889
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:38,589
I won't need a campaign to win.

890
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:41,929
Work with me.

891
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:46,759
I've never thought about it.

892
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:50,969
Consider it. We can talk about it again.

893
01:02:54,339 --> 01:02:56,468
CEO Noh Yul Seong is waiting.

894
01:02:56,469 --> 01:02:57,540
Let him in.

895
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,948
He contacted me so frequently
to let him meet me in person.

896
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:04,669
I purposely asked him to come at this time.

897
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,580
I want to repay you.

898
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:17,560
(Together with the people)

899
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,670
Did we have anything to discuss?

900
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:27,068
I didn't know you had a visitor.

901
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:30,670
It's fine. She's close
enough with me to be here.

902
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,350
You can leave if you feel uncomfortable.

903
01:03:50,759 --> 01:03:51,830
I apologize.

904
01:03:54,299 --> 01:03:55,675
I've made a mistake worthy of death.

905
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:59,369
Why did you when you can't even die?

906
01:04:01,869 --> 01:04:04,170
Please give me a chance.

907
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:09,009
If you give me the opportunity
to assist your campaign...

908
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:11,879
in this election, I will
support you from all angles.

909
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,080
You're too late.

910
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:16,948
I asked for Sa Ra's help...

911
01:04:16,949 --> 01:04:18,759
to join our campaign.

912
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:21,060
If she agrees,

913
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:24,829
I'll appoint her as the Chairperson
of the Election Committee.

914
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,060
It's a great promotion.

915
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:30,500
It's not just me.

916
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:33,339
I'm worried about you two.

917
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,369
Sa Ra, are you all right?

918
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:51,319
(Hanjoo Party)

919
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,630
No, I'm not.

920
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:17,080
(The generation-changing
Hanjoo Party of the nation)

921
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,020
Yes.

922
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:27,695
Keep your schedule empty for this weekend.

923
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:30,489
I got an appointment with the
lady I told you about earlier.

924
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,459
Mother, please cancel.

925
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:36,180
Do you know how much trouble I went
through to get this appointment?

926
01:05:37,529 --> 01:05:41,770
I've got a brilliant idea.

927
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:47,679
(Hanjoo Party)

928
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,290
You're in my way.

929
01:05:58,089 --> 01:06:00,920
Kim Young A likes you so much.

930
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:02,789
- It's not your business.
- Are you joining her camp?

931
01:06:02,790 --> 01:06:03,888
Why are you curious?

932
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:05,460
Seo Yun is coming back soon.

933
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:11,569
Can I meet him?

934
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:12,670
Of course.

935
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,310
But we should be a family first.

936
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:17,940
Let's...

937
01:06:21,409 --> 01:06:22,480
get married again.

938
01:06:36,529 --> 01:06:38,630
(Queen of Divorce)

939
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,230
What's the meaning behind these flowers?

940
01:07:09,389 --> 01:07:11,499
Why would you use Kim Sa
Ra to reach Kim Young A?

941
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,658
You need someone to put pressure on her.

942
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:15,669
I'm not doing this only for Kim Young A.

943
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,468
Kim Sa Ra and Dong Gi Jun are...

944
01:07:17,469 --> 01:07:19,569
investigating Na Yu Mi's case again.

945
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,739
The mother saw something!

946
01:07:22,009 --> 01:07:24,939
She was a witness for Na Yu Mi's case.

947
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:28,009
You're not related to
Na Yu Mi's case anyway.

948
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,509
Do you really think so?

949
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:31,110
Was there a part-timer here?

950
01:07:31,210 --> 01:07:33,020
We found the key man.

951
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,190
Let's catch him now. Noh Yul Seong.

952
01:07:35,449 --> 01:07:38,420
Are you still saying that the
part-timer isn't related to us?

953
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,588
What is this about?

954
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:41,389
Something you didn't
want to get involved in.

955
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,920
The incident that the mother
knew about when she was alive.

956
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:46,060
You know, right?
