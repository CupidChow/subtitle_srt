The client's name is Park Na Yeon. She's an actress.

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,619
Her husband, Jung Jae Min, kidnapped her son.

They're now at a vacation home.

9
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,489
He's demanding a fortune for the divorce settlement.

10
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,300
There's a gun?

11
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,809
I just heard about it. It's in her husband's study.

12
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,208
Should we proceed with our plan? Do we have bulletproof vests?

13

What do you think? Let's change the solution.

14
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,208

Hey. Where did you hide your son?

20
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,938
He's not my son. He's my wife's son.

I want the building in Cheongdam-dong.

27
00:03:52,529 --> 00:03:53,559
It's an exchange for her son.

28
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,200
You have a bank account under a borrowed name.

29
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,070
Do you want to see all the money disappear from the account?

30
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:01,869
What?

31
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,238
You will lose 10,000 dollars for every minute...

32
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,610
you delay telling us the location of the boy.

33

In the basement boiler room.

41

Oh, no.

- Let's go to your mom now.
- Okay.

I can't believe she just did that.

48
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,779
What kind of work did she do before?

49
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,780
Oh, her?

Currently, she's the queen of divorce.

Darn it.

53
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:35,730
I ask you to reconsider.

54
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,429
She used to be a lawyer.

55
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:41,470
And she served time in prison.

56
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:49,239

59
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:18,939
What? Did he buy a new car already?

60
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,879
Gosh.

61

62
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,020
What do you say? Do you want to race to the office?

63
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,519
Why is he so obsessed with winning?

64
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,248
Use that energy to fight better in court.

65
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:33,758

Do you think I'm doing this just to celebrate my birthday?

181
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:47,818
Hello, sir.

182
00:14:47,819 --> 00:14:50,419
- Gosh. Hello. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

183
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,619
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

184
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
Sure.

185
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,189
I hear that your son is resourceful and capable as he takes after you.

186
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,990
Thank you.

187
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,098
- He's my grandson.
- Say hello to him.

188
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:03,928
- Gosh. I see.
- Hello.

189
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:04,929
How adorable.

190
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,599
Hello.

191
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,568
I ask that you pass on your wisdom and insight to my son.

192
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:11,740
Gosh. You're too kind.

193
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:13,108
I'll look forward to learn from you.

194
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:16,079
- Sure. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

195
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:20,649
- Ma'am. Happy birthday.
- Hello.

196
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,749
Thank you.

197
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,780
They're completely ignoring Kim Sa Ra.

198
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,789
She's at least a member of the royal family.

199
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,189
What about us? We're mere workers of Chayul Law Firm.

200
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,719
What's the point of being in the royal family?

201
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,160
She has to take care of the law firm's dirty laundry.

202
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,029
She can't even join the board of directors.

203
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:39,369
Gosh. She's working hard for no reason.

204
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,068
Exactly. What else must I do other than...

205
00:15:43,069 --> 00:15:44,309
just working hard?

206
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:47,169
(Chayul Law Firm)

207
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,478
You got to have an extravagant meal. Why don't you give me some ideas?

208
00:15:51,479 --> 00:15:52,880
Do you remember that idea of mine...

209
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,589
Gosh. Seriously. You're so awful.

210
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,858
Ma'am. We'll get going now.

211
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:09,928
Sure. You should have left sooner.

212
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:12,229
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

213
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,370
This is tasty.

214
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,740
I wouldn't have any regrets even if I were to die right now.

215
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,550
My daughter is a lawyer now.

216
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,250
She's always married to a very influential family too.

217
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,750
They're just people like us.

218
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,119
Gosh. Just think about your dad.

219
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,958
He had lived his whole life, cooking and selling noodles.

220
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,828
Then all of a sudden, he wanted to build a factory.

221
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:15,199
He got too excited and fell for it.

222
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
After that,

223
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,530
he passed away.

224
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,200
That's when Yul Seong showed up.

225
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,809
He got us this restaurant.

226
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,379
He asked for my permission to marry you.

227
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:30,379
Gosh.

228
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:35,419
So you're happy now, right?

229
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:46,760
Why are you asking me that?

230
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:49,500
You should ask that yourself.

231
00:17:54,399 --> 00:17:55,599
You know,

232
00:17:56,899 --> 00:17:59,339
I'm happy when you're happy.

233
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,540
If you're not happy,

234
00:18:04,139 --> 00:18:05,950
I'm not happy at all.

235
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,318
So don't hold yourself back...

236
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,619
or put up with anyone for my sake.

237
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,919
You don't have to do that.

238
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:02,800
I'm home.

239
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,280
Mother. Did you like your birthday party?

240
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,889
Did you go and see your mother?

241
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,690
Just briefly.

242
00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:26,658
I told you to take a bath before coming down...

243
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:28,260
after visiting your mother.

244
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,430
You smell like food.

245
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,069
Mother.

246
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,399
Address me as the chairman. How many times must I repeat myself?

247
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,339
All this time,

248
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,408
I put up with your treatment of me...

249
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:42,879
to get your approval out of sheer determination.

250
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,649
I'm sure you know I've done my best to please you.

251
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:48,579
Everyone can do their best.

252
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,050
Why aren't you ironing my son's underwear these days?

253
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,628
He's my husband. I'll take care of him.

254
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:01,699
The most pathetic type of woman is...

255
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,429
the one who wants to be respected as the wife of a rich man...

256
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,169
while not taking care of him properly.

257
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:07,970
Why must I teach you every single thing?

258
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,250
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

259
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:23,180
Can you tell your mother to stop bringing up the food smell?

260
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:27,118
Can't you just do what she asks?

261
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:28,520
Washing up before going down isn't that hard.

262
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,129
Honey. You don't see what the problem is, do you?

263
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,128
Why are you asking me...

264
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:42,569
such a scary question this late at night?

265
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:45,710
Can you hang that for me?

266
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:15,500
You're not taking it seriously again.

267
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,569
What can you actually get done on your own?

268
00:21:56,339 --> 00:21:57,879
Mommy is all right.

269
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,819
I'm happy as long as I have you, Seo Yun.

270
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,710
Increase my allowance.

271
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,940
I can't survive with 200 dollars a month.

272
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,480
What's the point of increasing my wife's allowance?

273
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,849
She'll only think about hanging out with other younger guys.

274
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,490
Can you stop with those comments?

275
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:49,628
Don't you know there are so many guys going after...

276
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,270
rich and foolish women like you?

277
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:56,839
If I'm earning billions of dollars as a plastic surgeon,

278
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,770
just be happy to support me as my wife.

279
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,148
I paid for that spinach in your soup.

280
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:07,579
I'll take it back then.

281
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:11,289
I'm going to look for a part-time job at a supermarket.

282
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,088
What kind of woman lives with 200 dollars a month?

283
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:14,319
- Hey!
- An elementary school kid...

284
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:17,418
- probably will get more than that.
- I won't let you go tonight.

285
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:20,059
- Get over here. Now!
- Honey!

286
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,129
- Gosh! Honey!
- How dare you?

287
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,800
Honey!

288
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,470
Get back here!

289
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:31,539
How dare you talk back to me while I'm eating?

290
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,470
Honey, stop! I get it!

291
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,609
Honey!

292
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,609
Get down!

293
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,849
What are you looking at?

294
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,619
You're pathetic.

295
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:48,759
It's time, isn't it?

296
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,790
Right.

297
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:52,460
Let's go for it.

298
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,359
Hey!

299
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,500
You want to take Director Kim Tae Hyuk's divorce suit?

300
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,169
If we win the suit,

301
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,709
we can take all of Director Kim's cases.

302
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,279
He'll be a handful of trouble.

303
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,009
Room salon violence, first-class seat disturbance,

304
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,349
abuse of power on driver, and road rage.

305
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,280
He's the definition of owner risk.

306
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,649
We can never win this suit.

307
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,088
This is Chayul Law Firm.

308
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:29,230
How can you give up so easily?

309
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,770
Please hand this one over to Lawyer Ma.

310
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,369
I want to maintain a higher winning rate, Chairwoman Cha.

311
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:41,068
Director Park will be moving to Yongsan next month.

312
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:42,280
Win the suit, no matter what.

313
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:44,280
Then the vacant director's position...

314
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,309
will be yours.

315
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:52,450
Are you serious, Mother?

316
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,460
Then,

317
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:01,530
please promise me one more thing.

318
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:06,730
If I win the suit, please let me call you Mother.

319
00:25:07,569 --> 00:25:08,669
I'll take the case if you promise me this.

320
00:25:13,109 --> 00:25:14,469
(Injury Certificate)

321
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,409
These are the documents prepared by the wife to use as evidence.

322
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,849
How did you get all this?

323
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,918
Be ready for me if you move somewhere else.

324
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,118
I'll put you on the wanted list.

325
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,719
You know what will happen when you run away.

326
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,530
I'll always move with you.

327
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,159
This is the key point of this suit.

328
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:39,399
Parental and fostering rights.

329
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:41,399
We need to find the reasons for liability of the wife's side.

330
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:44,770
But the child is five years old.

331
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,169
Will it be right to live under a dad like that?

332
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,909
He's been a violent husband.

333
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:53,608
It doesn't feel right.

334
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:55,450
We don't judge our clients.

335
00:25:56,879 --> 00:25:58,520
We only find a way to win.

336
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,808
Help!

337
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:22,680
This is the footage of the plaintiff's escape last month.

338
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:25,879
That night, the plaintiff was beaten by her husband.

339
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,579
She got away without being able to put on any shoes.

340
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:30,219
It was self-fabricated.

341
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,849
There weren't any witnesses.

342
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,419
It's because the housekeepers are keeping their mouths shut.

343
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:38,730
There were seven more cases of violence other than that.

344
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,759
There are 32 photos of evidence.

345
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,829
(Photos of Son Jang Mi's wounds)

346
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,500
We acknowledge the defendant's cases of violence.

347
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,099
Seven cases do seem like a lot.

348
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:51,099
But how did the defendant feel during those seven cases?

349
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:55,108
The pieces of evidence that felt shameful to be brought up by a man.

350
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:57,440
These unrevealed pieces of evidence...

351
00:26:57,579 --> 00:26:58,909
will be revealed now.

352
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,519
(Photos of Kim Tae Hyuk's wounds)

353
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,579
(Photos of Kim Tae Hyuk's wounds)

354
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,559
- Did you fight back?
- No.

355
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,990
What is all that?

356
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,190
He even beat himself?

357
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,759
(Plaintiff, lawyer)

358
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,358
I have an objection, your Honor.

359
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:18,270
Your Honor, the important fact...

360
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,869
is that both sides use violence when worked up.

361
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,940
This is nonsense!

362
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:26,309
They're all lies!

363
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:29,878
If Defendant Kim Tae Hyuk takes the fostering rights,

364
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:32,579
a professional tutor will educate the child.

365
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:34,819
As for Plaintiff Son Jang Mi,

366
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,078
the child will stay with her mother all day...

367
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,889
who is a housewife.

368
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:41,219
If both sides are to use violence,

369
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,618
which side would be safer for the child...

370
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,858
and have a lower possibility of violence?

371
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:47,129
Please take that into consideration.

372
00:27:47,629 --> 00:27:49,859
Why would I beat my own child?

373
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,770
I went through a tough process of IVF to have my child.

374
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,970
Why would I do that?

375
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,679
The evidence to prove that it was not both sides involved...

376
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,379
in using violence will be submitted at the next trial.

377
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:09,480
But before that, please take a look at this video.

378
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,829
Well,

379
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,559
it's the most pathetic thing to do in the world.

380
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,129
Taking pictures of your husband in an affair.

381
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:30,000
But this won't work as evidence of an affair.

382
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,770
All of this?

383
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,079
Why not? Look at him with all these women.

384
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,579
Conversations, voice recordings, and text messages.

385
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:42,319
You need these things to make it work.

386
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,290
Hold on.

387
00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:50,089
What?

388
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,260
What is it?

389
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:54,389
I guess this could work.

390
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:55,829
What could work?

391
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,030
This guy will be sensitive to rumors.

392
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,210
What? What is all this?

393
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,280
This has not been prearranged, Your Honor.

394
00:29:09,379 --> 00:29:11,210
Lawyers of both sides, please come up.

395
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,588
Will you continue to carry things on like this?

396
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:23,959
Your Honor, this is an invasion of privacy...

397
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,628
and evident slander.

398
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:29,098
This is an important piece of evidence that can prove...

399
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:30,399
who is more responsible.

400
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,499
(Judge)

401
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,710
It will be accepted as evidence.

402
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:40,369
Please head back to your seats.

403
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:53,549
The two are very close friends.

404
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,720
That is all that can explain the two of them.

405
00:29:56,059 --> 00:29:58,119
A middle-aged man and woman who are known to be just friends...

406
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,629
are touching each other affectionately.

407
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:02,629
I wonder if I'm in a trial in Hollywood right now.

408
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:06,629
If family cases could be turned into jury trials,

409
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:08,470
I would love to ask for the people's opinions.

410
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:16,709
Gosh, what do we do?

411
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,249
If things go on like this, the scandal between us and them...

412
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,919
will spread everywhere.

413
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,849
But Director Kim is ten years younger than you.

414
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,389
What are you on about?

415
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,960
Director Kim is just...

416
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,499
Forget it. You don't have to worry about that lousy photo.

417
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,030
Just find more evidence that will help us win.

418
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:40,770
What if there are strange rumors?

419
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,299
Win the divorce suit first.

420
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,569
There will be a way to get things straight.

421
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:53,379
Yes?

422
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,020

Are you Kim Tae Hyuk's lawyer?

426
00:31:56,409 --> 00:31:57,480
Yes.

427
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:02,818
There has been a violation of the law of drugs...

428
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:05,149
based on the distribution and supply of propopol.

429
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:07,119
A search and seizure has been proceeded.

430
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:09,020
Everything has been explained.

431
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,490
Please ask Director Kim for the details.

Let's proceed with things a bit quicker.

435

What is this about?

If it's Chayul Law Firm you're asking about,

437
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:11,480
I know a few managers there.

438
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:14,749
Just tell them this.

439
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,219
If they are to help Kim Tae Hyuk,

440
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,029
tell them to know the lies he made...

441
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,230
to get himself married.

442
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:22,000
Yes. Understood.

Lawyer Kim.

445
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:35,909
He was already done cleaning up his books.

446
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:37,780
The prosecution won't be able to get anything from him.

447
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,250
Apparently, Director Kim Tae Hyuk likes men.

448
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
What?

449
00:33:46,721 --> 00:33:48,858
The propopol case was related to a gay bar too.

450
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:51,020
Any recommendations from that place led to a discount for the shots.

451
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,629
Was that why Chairwoman Cha was okay with the touching?

452
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:58,500
But that's strange.

453
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:01,269

454
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,839

- Yes.

Please do me a favor.

457
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,579
Of course.

This way.

459
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:25,390
Did the board of directors meet today?

460
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,390
I'm checking right now.

461
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,530
Yes. It happened today.

462
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,169
What about the vacant position of Director Park?

463
00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:34,169
Well...

464
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,039
It has been given to Lawyer Ma.

465
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:57,719
You promised me the director's position.

466
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,159

The next opportunity? When could that be?

470
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,109
Were you even considering it in the first place?

471
00:35:14,569 --> 00:35:17,140
Were you willing to let me call you Mother?

472
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,579
Was that why you married into our family?

473
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,619
Why is that important?

474
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,979
You knew all about it, right?

475
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,620
That Director Kim can't be in a married relationship.

476
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,200
You knew all along that it was a fraudulent marriage.

477
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,269
Yet, you still told me to win the suit.

478
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:42,640
Solely to win your favor,

479
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,439
I innocently stayed up all night to prepare for the trial.

480
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:52,910
So what? What is it that you want?

481
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,749
From now on,

482
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:03,859
I must do some thinking.

483
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:18,068
Are you still into Kim Sa Ra?

484
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:21,139
Why are you bringing that up again? Did something happen?

485
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,338
There are dogs that growl if they aren't fed.

486
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:24,510
Do you know why?

487
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:27,510
They think they're above their coddling owners.

488
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:29,978
We won't have any ill-behaved dogs in our household.

489
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,080
Keep that in mind.

490
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:20,669
Your Honor, we ask to cancel the request...

491
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,239
to submit evidence.

492
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,740
Are you talking about the video material?

493
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,640
Yes. We have learned something new about the defendant.

494
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:29,279
The defendant has no reason...

495
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,410
to affectionately touch a female.

496
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,550
What?

497
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:40,620
What is she saying?

498
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:43,519
This is all nonsense.

499
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:56,300
It's better for Director Kim to have that footage exposed.

500
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,740
At least, he'll be safe from being found out gay.

501
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:04,609
Of course. It will be over once that gets exposed.

502
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:09,679
Once that happens, parenting rights, fostering rights,

503
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,249
and the claim for division of property...

504
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:16,919
Everything will be in favor of the wife.

505
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:18,060
I'll call you again.

506
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,200
Excuse me.

507
00:38:23,499 --> 00:38:25,229
What were you talking about?

508
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,068
What about my husband?

509
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:30,240
If you heard me clear, my work here is done.

510
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
Goodbye.

511
00:38:32,069 --> 00:38:36,080
Lawyer Kim. Is this really true?

512
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,249
You went out taking pictures of him having an affair.

513
00:38:39,749 --> 00:38:41,349
Weren't you suspicious of something?

514
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,979
But I never expected him to be...

515
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:50,089
But why are you telling me all this?

516
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,330
You came to me on purpose, right?

517
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:55,660
In the world of divorce,

518
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,899
the ones who suffered and were sacrificed...

519
00:39:00,229 --> 00:39:02,869
must finish things with one fatal blow.

520
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,200
That's justice.

521
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:10,810
I hope you will be able to protect your child.

522
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:31,599
What are you talking about? That's a lie.

523
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,229
She's slandering me!

524
00:39:33,669 --> 00:39:35,600
Do something.

525
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:41,140
Your Honor, her claim has not been proven.

526
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,208
I have deeply considered whether to expose this claim,

527
00:39:47,209 --> 00:39:48,349
to be honest.

528
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,680
However, the defendant's gender identity...

529
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:53,890
is a crucial factor to the breakdown of marriage.

530
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,120
The evidence of the male bias of the defendant...

531
00:39:57,459 --> 00:39:58,719
will additionally be submitted.

532
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,229
I can't believe this.

533
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,260
This is an invalid trial.

534
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,129
What kind of trial is this?

535
00:40:06,229 --> 00:40:07,969
Why did you get married with me?

536
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:12,038
We could've just lived as strangers following the things we wanted!

537
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,768
- You could've just gone your way!
- Keep quiet!

538
00:40:14,769 --> 00:40:17,438
- You could've just left me alone!
- Please calm down.

539
00:40:17,439 --> 00:40:20,378
Why would you mess things up like this?

540
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:22,379
This is so embarrassing.

541
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:45,439
This a new dish they came up with. It's not bad.

542
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,640
Give it a try.

543
00:40:50,979 --> 00:40:55,079
The medical suits given to us by Director Kim.

544
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,180
He's making a big deal wanting out with us.

545
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,148
What about the Legislation and Judiciary Committee chairman?

546
00:41:01,149 --> 00:41:03,919
- Hello, Chairman.
- Oh, hello. Congratulations.

547
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:08,330
They're being strict there for some reason. Gosh.

548
00:41:09,129 --> 00:41:12,469
I need to come up with a plan.

549
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,329
He needs to change the law...

550
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:16,399
for there to be more law schools. Don't forget that.

551
00:41:17,169 --> 00:41:18,769
That needs to happen...

552
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,379
for us to set up Chayul Town.

553
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,418
- Who is this?
- It's his daughter.

554
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:32,919
Besides her having a divorce, she's perfect.

555
00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:36,319
Is there a better plan to win that strict man's favor...

556
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:38,390
than this?

557
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,330
You've had it your way with your first marriage.

558
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:44,959
Do it right this time.

559
00:41:47,499 --> 00:41:48,970
You want me to get married?

560
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,039
- What about Sa Ra?
- Why think about her?

561
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,609
You two have gotten a divorce a while ago.

562
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,620
She'll be getting that much from him?

563
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:08,519
The division of property for Director Kim Tae Hyuk's wife.

564
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,918
Director Kim is wealthy. That's why she'll get a lot from him.

565
00:42:11,919 --> 00:42:14,859
Gosh. You're a brave one, Sa Ra.

566
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,930
If the chairwoman finds out about this... Goodness.

567
00:42:18,629 --> 00:42:20,128
My mom said this to me.

568
00:42:20,129 --> 00:42:22,129
If I'm happy, she's happy.

569
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,039
I want to be a good daughter that does what she wants.

570
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:29,879
Sounds good.

571
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,779
About Director Kim's identity.

572
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,050
How did you know about it in advance?

573
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,780
There's someone I know.

574
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:41,189
This person can't stand watching bad people take the win.

575
00:42:41,419 --> 00:42:44,918
(Lawyer Kim Sa Ra)

576
00:42:44,919 --> 00:42:45,930
Hey, Secretary Lee.

577
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,259
What are you talking about?

578
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,829
The foreign affairs department of the Prosecutor's Office...

579
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,998
are widening their investigation of illicit admission...

580
00:42:55,999 --> 00:42:58,799
of social leaders' children to international schools.

581
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,539
To qualify for the condition of one parent being a foreigner,

582
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,179
a nationality fraud has happened?

583
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,379
Yes. That's right.

584
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:08,148
The wife gets divorced in disguise in Korea.

585
00:43:08,149 --> 00:43:10,378
She then gets married in disguise with a foreigner from places like...

586
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,679
Ethiopia or Ecuador.

587
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,949
After illicit admission of their child,

588
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,119
the husband and wife get back together.

589
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,490
What's this all about the international school?

590
00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:18,918
Did you apply without me knowing?

591
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:21,588
Did you expect me to let my grandson...

592
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:23,229
study with lowly kids?

593
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:29,740
Well, that's not what's important.

594
00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:34,709
Are we also caught for illicit admission?

595
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:37,179
How did you get Seo Yun into that school?

596
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,080
Mother, so that case...

597
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,720
So...

598
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,720
I said we should be careful with this.

599
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,789
You knew about it?

600
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,289
Does this make sense?

601
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,060
It can't be true.

602
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,970
You said you'd correct some register...

603
00:44:01,499 --> 00:44:03,539
and took my personal seal.

604
00:44:05,399 --> 00:44:07,269
- It's not related to that, right?
- Stop the fuss.

605
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:09,310
Why are you acting as if it's a big deal?

606
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,539
What do you mean?

607
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,649
This is a big deal!

608
00:44:15,249 --> 00:44:17,918
Honey, this means I unknowingly...

609
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:19,919
went through a fake divorce.

610
00:44:20,149 --> 00:44:22,189
I've become the mom who falsified my child's admission.

611
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:23,760
Just be ready.

612
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:26,530
Be ready for what?

613
00:44:26,629 --> 00:44:29,030
If things go wrong, you'd need to be responsible.

614
00:44:29,899 --> 00:44:30,958
Me?

615
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:33,429
Do you think I or he would go to prison?

616
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,470
Who'll be in charge of the company?

617
00:44:34,999 --> 00:44:37,100
- Chairwoman Cha!
- Regarding this matter...

618
00:44:37,899 --> 00:44:40,209
He and I weren't aware of this.

619
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:41,510
You did everything alone.

620
00:44:43,939 --> 00:44:46,780
Honey, say something!

621
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,680
Why are you overreacting?

622
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:52,319
It'll most probably end as a summary indictment.

623
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,729
- This is a reporter from...
- How are you feeling?

624
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:16,039
(Korea Video Journalist Association)

625
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,209
(Court)

626
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:32,359
Did you plan this from the start?

627
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:35,060
We go through a fake divorce,

628
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,100
send her to prison, and get a real divorce.

629
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:40,769
Were you able to control her...

630
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:43,069
before or after the marriage?

631
00:45:43,899 --> 00:45:45,800
I know that your heart belongs to her...

632
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:48,509
even though you have fun with others.

633
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,240
But she isn't the type who can be controlled.

634
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,149
So give up.

635
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,580
Mother.

636
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,318
She's Seo Yun's birthmother.

637
00:45:57,319 --> 00:45:59,119
How can you accomplish anything significant...

638
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,189
when you're caught up in such trivial relationships?

639
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:03,390
Anything significant?

640
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,699
(Plaque of Appreciation for Social Contribution)

641
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:14,899
Oh, right.

642
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:16,399
I need to do that.

643
00:46:18,899 --> 00:46:20,039
But Mother.

644
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,680
Do you believe that I can accomplish anything significant?

645
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:26,879
"This is your problem."

646
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,549
"You can't do it because of this and that."

647
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:32,050
These are what I've heard from you for my whole life.

648
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,220
Only now,

649
00:46:36,819 --> 00:46:38,859
you're saying I need to accomplish something significant...

650
00:46:39,959 --> 00:46:41,330
and abandon Sa Ra.

651
00:46:44,129 --> 00:46:45,830
I'm confused.

652
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,069
If you handle this divorce and remarriage well,

653
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:56,910
I will acknowledge you.

654
00:47:13,129 --> 00:47:14,189
Where is Seo Yun?

655
00:47:15,729 --> 00:47:17,729
He'll be shocked to be in a place like this.

656
00:47:36,649 --> 00:47:37,680
But...

657
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:41,589
why do I need to be responsible for all this alone?

658
00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:46,858
The broker has made all the statements,

659
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:48,629
saying that you are the main culprit.

660
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:50,599
I didn't plan any of this.

661
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,160
You know that!

662
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,369
The judges probably have their considerations too.

663
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:55,999
- Just wait.
- Honey.

664
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,810
Aren't you here to defend me?

665
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,039
Don't call me that anymore.

666
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,720
What?

667
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:14,689
We're already divorced.

668
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:16,189
Let's make it clear.

669
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:21,830
Let's just follow the law.

670
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:25,430
A divorce with a seal...

671
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,030
is irreversible by Korean law.

672
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:30,539
If you've committed a crime,

673
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:33,769
receiving punishment is the law.

674
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:37,780
How about Seo Yun?

675
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,149
The custody rights are...

676
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:44,148
legally documented as being in my possession.

677
00:48:44,149 --> 00:48:46,220
How could you do this to me?

678
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,589
Don't be emotional.

679
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:54,260
Listen and think carefully.

680
00:48:54,629 --> 00:48:57,830
What is the lifelong mission of our household?

681
00:48:58,629 --> 00:49:00,700
Establishing a law school...

682
00:49:01,669 --> 00:49:03,300
and building Chayul Town.

683
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:04,768
If these go well,

684
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:08,338
you, me, and Seo Yun can live happily for many years.

685
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:09,608
You know that, right?

686
00:49:09,609 --> 00:49:11,139
So our divorce is...

687
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,549
never for me.

688
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,209
It's for the three of us.

689
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,720
So...

690
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:21,950
what's all this about?

691
00:49:22,149 --> 00:49:23,289
Does this make sense to you?

692
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:27,330
How is that business related to our divorce?

693
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,830
Look. I'll become...

694
00:49:34,569 --> 00:49:36,399
the son-in-law of the Chairman of Legislation and Judiciary Committee.

695
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:38,269
Okay?

696
00:49:38,999 --> 00:49:41,010
This is why I told you not to be emotional.

697
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:43,640
Our divorce...

698
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,978
is just arranged.

699
00:49:46,979 --> 00:49:48,779
We just got rid of the married couple tag.

700
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:50,478
I'll make sure you have...

701
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:52,648
everything that you had when we were married.

702
00:49:52,649 --> 00:49:55,689
House, car, and living expenses.

703
00:49:55,919 --> 00:49:57,889
Tell me whatever you need.

704
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,060
Nothing is going to change.

705
00:50:07,399 --> 00:50:08,430
So...

706
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:12,100
you're openly asking...

707
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,510
me to be your second wife?

708
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:19,310
What? Second wife?

709
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,318
What second wife?

710
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,319
Sa Ra.

711
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:28,550
You're the only first...

712
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,490
in my life.

713
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,560
If you accept this reality,

714
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,229
everyone will be at peace.

715
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:43,039
Everyone will be happy.

716
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,800
I can give up on everything,

717
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,439
but not Seo Yun.

718
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,309
Once Seo Yun declines contact,

719
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,019

858

Not all wives file for a divorce...

903
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:23,878
when their husbands get involved in the MeToo movement, right?

904
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:26,279
My husband will lose in the trial anyway.

905
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,350
Which law firm is the husband working with?

906
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,049
It's Chayul Law Firm.

907
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:31,418
I disagree with taking this case.

908
01:05:31,419 --> 01:05:33,589
- I disagree too.
- Let's do this.

909
01:05:33,689 --> 01:05:34,760
The other party is...

910
01:05:36,859 --> 01:05:37,899
Chayul Law Firm.
