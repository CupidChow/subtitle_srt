from the Southwestern

19
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:48,478
Excuse me. I must take this call.

20
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,309
- It's a work call.
- Sure.

21
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:56,550
Dong Gi Jun?

22
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,419
What's this about?

23
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,470
I need you to come into the office.
I have some questions for you...

24
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,690
regarding Na Yu Mi's death.

25
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,529
Prosecutor Dong. I don't think...

26
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,529
you know why I'm busy right now.
Let me tell you what I'm doing.

27
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,799
If you're busy, I can
reschedule the interview.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,139
Hold on.

29
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,569

30
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:18,745
at the Southwestern
District Office, correct?

31
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,210
I'll just call him instead.

32
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,608

ID from the deceased's body.)

they matched her identity.)

38
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,660
- It's all mushed.
- Okay.

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Hurry up, and leave.

40
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:48,169
Look at her.

41
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,039
- Gosh. Seriously.
- I told you to stop that.

42
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,139
It's over. Did you know that?

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,448
What on earth is that clown doing now?

44
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,249
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

45
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,650
She sure is trying hard.

46
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,019
She made a fist.

47
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,619
- There you go.
- Hey.

48
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,318
Gosh. That was fantastic.

49
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,160
She put his picture on that. Oh, my.

50
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,430
Okay. All right. Go.

51
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,239
- Hey. You ought to kick it higher.
- Like this.

52
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,440
If I give up,

53
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,639
it's only my loss.

54

Yes. This is Prosecutor Dong Gi Jun.

55
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,888
Is this the prosecutor,
handling the case...

56
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:47,160
of the girl who fell
out of a taxi and died?

57
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,299
Who is this?

58
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:52,169
It's about the dead girl.

59
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,999
She didn't commit suicide.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,668
I watched a video.

61
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,969

(Recording)

63
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,979
Can you repeat that? What did you watch?

64
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,749
But my daughter was sent to prison
for something she didn't do.

65
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,620
If I tell you about the video,
can you help my daughter?

66
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:13,720
Yes. Why don't we talk in person?

67
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,189
I'll go to your office.

68
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,728
I can just go to the Southwestern
District Prosecutors' Office, right?

69
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:18,758
Yes. That's where I am.

70
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,830
But before that, can
you give me your number?

71
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,359

77
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,510
The police already concluded
that it wasn't homicide.

78
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,649
I made a statement that she stalked me.

79
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,450
He ought to take my word for it.

80
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,058
Come on. He and I both
practice law for a living.

81
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:49,558
Does he not have any courtesy
for people from the same field?

82
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,058
- You know?
- Gosh. Calm down.

83
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,159
Goodness. That punk.

84
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,600
I'll take care of this. Okay?

85
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,129
I mean, he's a prosecutor.

86
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,699
How could he let his imagination
go wild to catch a culprit?

87
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,600
What kind of country are we living in now?

88
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,369
Come on. Answer me, sir.

89
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,570
Gosh.

90
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,869

92
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,285
You should just start working
at Chayul Law Firm soon.

Don't waste your energy
at a dump like this.

didn't have to come down here.

95

00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,960
Upstairs. On your left.

111

What brings you here?

112
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,830
Well,

in charge of Sa Ra's case.

What? Where did she go?

127
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,470
She was here with a guy.

- A guy?
- Yes.

00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,699
Was he as tall as me and in a suit?
Does that sound like him?

134
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,830
He was shorter than you.

135

me the earlier footage?

Yes, that's her.

140
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:54,999
Did she come with the man?

141
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,540

Let's help out people like
me with a one-stop service.

151
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,580
They ought to go to law firms to get help.

152
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:47,420
I can't practice law for five
years even when I get released...

153
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,289
because I'm facing jail time.

154
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,389
Right. Exactly. I don't need a lawyer.
I need a fixer.

155
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,529
A fixer for divorces.

156
00:10:02,739 --> 00:10:03,739
A fixer?

157
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,739
But it's hard to run
such businesses legally.

158
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:11,340
Then why did you help me
in the restroom that day?

159
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,879
You knew my husband could weasel
his way out of it by using the law.

160
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,620
It was crystal clear I would lose.
That's why you helped me.

161
00:10:17,779 --> 00:10:19,190
- Right?
- Your case...

162
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,560
It was a special case.

163

the type to break the law,
rules, or cross the line.

165

Did you change your hairstyle?

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,749
Oh, this? I was born with curly hair.

170
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,550
Back then, I used to
straighten my hair on purpose.

171

I wanted to look like I
belonged in Chayul Law Firm.

172
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:03,060
I'll tell you what. If you
ever want to cross the line,

173

don't hesitate to call me anytime.

174

when you don't look at the photo?

175

a hole on that photo.

What? She's going home?

180
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,470
(CEO of Chayul Law Firm)

181
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,060
Mom...

182
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,229
I'm so sorry.

183
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,409
What is my mom doing here?

184
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,080
She went to your father's old factory...

185
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,680
and jumped off.

186
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:00,149
You're here.

187
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:02,519
You must have been shocked.

188
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,249
What are you doing here?

189
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,719
Leave. Get out of here!

190
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,858
This is your fault.

191
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:12,190
You put me in jail. So my mom...

192
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:14,689
That's why my mother went there and...

193
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,329
- Calm down.
- It's your fault.

194
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,460
Calm down.

195
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,529
- You...
- It's okay. Step back.

196
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,430
Calm down. You should say hello
to your mother first. Okay?

197
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,249
Sir. Thank you for coming.

198
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:36,149
Gosh. Thanks for coming.

199
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,080
Would you like to drink?

200
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,989
Yes? Let me pour you a drink.

201
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,960
We always meet at funerals.

202
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Right.

203
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:48,259
You told me your wife was sick.

204
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
I see.

205
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:01,779
I checked the investigation
report from the police.

206
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,978
Given the cause of death,
the estimated time of death,

207
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:06,979
and the location,

208
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,080
they didn't find any possibilities
that it might be a homicide.

209
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:14,820
They concluded the case as a suicide case.

210
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,529
I brought your mother's belongings
they collected from the scene.

211
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,529
She left a text message which
may be her suicide note.

212
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,070
I think she texted that to your number.

213
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,139
I am going to join your father now.

214
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,180
I love you, my daughter.

215
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:02,939
Mom. Why did you do it?

216
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,739
How am I going to live without you now?

217
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:20,050
Mom. How am I going to live now?

218
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:22,290
That's enough now. Okay?

219
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,820
People are waiting outside.

220
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:29,859
- I...
- Okay. There.

221
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,720
My mom is leaving for good.

222
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:01,029
Let her see her grandson one last time.

223
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,330
Are you talking about Seo Yun?
He can't come.

224
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,340
He went on a trip with my mom.

225
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,439
Is it absolutely necessary for him to come?

226
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,479
We're not a family anymore.

227
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,749
Why did you come here then?

228
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,060
I just wanted us to be on good terms...

229
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:32,790
and wish each other the best.

230
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:37,076
Are you here to make nice with
me because you're afraid that...

231
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,700
I might stab you in the back later?

232
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,628
You're becoming more hostile
toward me day by day. Seriously.

233
00:16:41,629 --> 00:16:43,970
You know what? Here's what I want.

234
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,070
I want to have an amicable
breakup or something like that.

235
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:52,050
A breakup can only be amicable
with good-natured people.

236
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:54,149
A breakup can't be amicable on its own.

237
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,279
You can just have a breakup
that's befitting of you.

238
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:01,590
The dirtiest and cruelest
breakup in the world.

239
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,060
What have I done so wrong?

240
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,569
Sa Ra. Tell me. What have I
done wrong to deserve this?

241
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,398
I told you even if we got a divorce,

242
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:17,240
I would still have
supported you financially.

243
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:19,139
Remember?

244
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,438
When I brought that up,

245
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,839
you complained about becoming my mistress.

246
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,649
It was you who got angry and complained.
Remember?

247
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:28,750
I'll tell you what will
happen if you keep this up.

248
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,849
I can't put up with
this kind of behavior...

249
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,849
even if it's coming from you.

250
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,490
No, I won't.

251
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,080
They're all here.

252
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,169
- Forgive me for my tardiness.
- You're here.

253
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:31,309
He's been keeping his identity
a secret all this time.

254
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,178
The last member of our five-member society.

255
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,459
This is Professor Seo Woong Jin.

256
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:35,918
I've heard a lot about you.

257
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,750
Gosh. I think he's just easily scared.

258
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,118
Gosh. Stop it. Don't tease him like that.

259
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,290
Let's go!

260
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:49,128
- Go for it.
- Let's go.

261
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,429
- You got this.
- Yes!

262
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,230
- There you go! Kick!
- Let's go!

263
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:54,570
Nice!

264
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,899
- How dare you challenge her?
- Push her.

265
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,039
- Go!
- Punch her!

266
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,369
- Great!
- Yes!

267
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,378
- Crush her.
- You did well.

268
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:10,580
- Go.
- Let's go.

269
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:12,918
- Hey, come on.
- Go for it.

270
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,789
- Come on. Keep going.
- Hurry up.

271
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,719
- What are you doing? Punch her.
- Go!

272
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,510
How dare you?

273
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,919
The chief is throwing a fit...

274
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,560
because you're still
investigating Na Yu Mi's case.

275
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,658
- Gosh. Nice.
- Come on.

276
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,530
Goodness. Who is it this time?

277
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,969
- Professor Seo Woong Jin.
- What?

278
00:20:03,899 --> 00:20:06,709
Hey, he's a famous professor.

279
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,510
You made him come in?

280
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,339
Gosh. He kept tossing my requests.

281
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,579
So when I said I would
get a warrant if I had to,

282
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,879
he finally started to comply.

283
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,649
Professor Seo was the last person
Na Yu Mi talked to on the phone.

284
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,370
What was their relationship?

285
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:20,249
He was her professor from
the graduate program.

286
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,090
But he keeps changing his stories.

287
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,309
He won't let us take a
look at his phone either.

288
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,678
Gosh. Go easy on him. If
you make one wrong move,

289
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:46,350
it could cause you trouble.

290
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,389
What happened?

291
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,199
This is bad.

308
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,439
It's been four days since the professor...

309
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,409
became unconscious.

310
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,980
I will pray for his swift recovery.

311
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,908
However,

312
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:57,109
we didn't use any coercive
tactics while investigating.

313
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,850
I will uncover the truth
through the supplemental...

314

Sir, Prosecutor Dong...

320
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:18,939
really caused some trouble.

321
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,678
Gosh. My head is about to explode.

322
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,909
But don't you know
Professor Seo Woong Jin too?

323
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,849
I do know quite a lot of people.

(Chief Prosecutor Na Chan Il)

325
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,859
Oh, right. We should meet soon.

326
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,760
What was it? Right.

327
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:40,330
I found an excellent pufferfish place.

328
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,800
Yes.

329
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,530
All right. See you soon. Bye.

330
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:51,269
It wasn't excessive or forced.

331
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,039
Why won't you clarify things?

332
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,868
I told you not to do it from the start.

333
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:56,679
Why bring things this far?

334
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,678
When the new district attorney arrives,

335
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,510
I'll make sure to make things clear.

336
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:01,980
Sir!

337
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,590
Yes, sir.

338
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,250
Right.

339
00:23:07,949 --> 00:23:09,520
It's exactly as I reported to you.

(Seo Woong Jin)

342
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,108
We'll make our statement. Let's move there.

343
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:29,080
- Right.
- Please stand right there.

344
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,648
Here. Please stand here.

345
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:34,349
- The journalists may move here.
- Please look here!

346
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,350
- Hold on.
- We've waited for a while.

347
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,080
- Hold on.
- Please speak to us.

348
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,188
- Hold on. Take a step back, please.
- Please look here.

349
00:23:40,189 --> 00:23:43,659
All right. Our district
attorney will explain things.

350
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,159
I have promised to protect the
human rights of suspects...

351
00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:51,628
as my primary assignment.

352
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:53,399
With this promise,

353
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:57,398
as my very first task,

It's Professor Seo Woong Jin.

- Excuse me.

- What?

Right? Weren't you in
charge of Professor Seo?

361
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,549
- Why are you here?
- Why did the suicide occur?

366
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,520
I'm the one who is most
curious about that question.

367
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,030

proceeded in a forceful manner.

369
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,629
But hear me out.

370
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,070
Someone came up with an idea
to use this for promotion...

371
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,740
while knowing the
investigation wasn't forceful.

372
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,139
Who could that be?

373
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,939
There's our chief prosecutor.

374
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,149
He looks like he's about to poop his pants.

375
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,678
It'll be the end of him...

376
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:45,549
if this event fails because of me.

377

Please take good care
of our chief prosecutor.

378
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:48,990
I'll be off.

379
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,358
Is it okay for the press to
announce that it wasn't forceful?

380
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,199
- Why did the suicide occur?
- Please tell us.

00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,650
I can't handle it anymore.

535
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,449
What did your husband say?

536
00:34:43,049 --> 00:34:45,279
He didn't want me to
bring up divorce at all.

537
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:47,649
He thinks he's Clinton.

538
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,159
He asks why I can't side
with him like Hillary.

539
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:57,900
If your husband did something
like that, how would you feel?

540
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:00,929
I would want to kill him.

541
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Right.

542
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
Yes?

543
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:23,988
Seo Min Hee has charged
him with sexual assault.

544
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:27,028
Anchor Jang says they both made
a mistake because of alcohol.

545
00:35:27,029 --> 00:35:28,089
He says it was not forced.

546
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:30,560
The first trial starts next month.

547
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:34,029
My husband will lose anyway.

548
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,139
How are you certain about this?

549
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,380
I just feel like he'll lose.

550
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:51,650
I'm his wife, after all.

551
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,899
As your husband said,

552
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,029
wouldn't it be better to get
a divorce after the trial?

553
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,799
I heard trials go for around two years.

554
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,639
I can't make my daughter
suffer through this any longer.

555
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,048
(A sex offender? Jang Jae Gook out!)

556
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:23,948
(I feel ashamed to live in
the same town with you!)

557
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,509
(Sex offender Jang Jae Gook, move out!)

558
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,789
(A sex offender? Jang Jae Gook out!)

559
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,860
(Filthy Jang Jae Gook!)

560
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:37,900
Let's go, Soo Ji.

561
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,699
I can't handle it either.

562
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,670
If I don't get a divorce now,

563
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,679
I feel like I'll suffocate and die.

564
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,610
As soon as things get settled,
I'll leave Korea with my daughter.

565
00:36:57,319 --> 00:36:58,350
Just a moment.

566
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:05,019
Hey. What brings you to
call me at this hour?

567
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,560
Mom, I'm sorry.

568
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:10,560
I love you.

569
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:15,429
What's wrong, Soo Ji? Are you at school?

570
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,239
Soo Ji?

571
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,618
Over here!

572
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,889
Get it!

573
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:37,589
Pass!

574
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:39,559
- What are you doing?
- Hey, what are you doing?

575
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,230
Look over there. Who's that?

576
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:43,528
- Someone's there.
- What?

577
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:45,258
- What?
- What's going on?

578
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:46,299
Someone's there.

579
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,100
What's going on?

580
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,799
This is so unfair.

581
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,045
What does my dad's wrongdoing
have anything to do with me?

582
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:56,210
Why would you blame me for what he did?

583
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,509
She's standing right there!

584
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,709
Stop!

585
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,908
Go back! It's dangerous!

586
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:03,949
Soo Ji!

587
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,179
Soo Ji!

588
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,989
Bom. Gear up.

589
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:09,089
Right.

590
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,929

592
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,299
Don't come near me. I'll jump if you do.

593
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:55,029
Ms. Kim!

594
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:57,899
- What?
- Oh, no!

595
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,500
- Gosh!
- Look!

596
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:01,469
Oh, no.

597
00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:03,479
I told you not to come!

598
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,079
I'm not going to you.

599
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,549
What is she doing?

600
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,380
Is this railing all yours?

601
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:35,770
My mom did the same.

602
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,710
She reached the top of a
building and threw herself.

603
00:39:42,509 --> 00:39:44,519
- What is she doing?
- What?

604
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,980
What's going on?

605
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,650
I didn't know what had happened
because I was away from her.

606
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,159
I didn't know how much she suffered.

607
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,029
I felt awful.

608
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,338
It was painful.

609
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:05,599
Excuse me. What are you doing?

610
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,770
What? Did you expect me to stop you?

611
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:11,579
What are they saying?

612
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,139
They're talking.

613
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:18,020
I'm not one to stop someone from dying.

614
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,649
- What?
- What?

615
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,650
- She should stop her.
- Come on.

616
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:25,790
If you're brave enough to jump, look down.

617
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:28,629
If you jump,

618
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,698
you might think it's the
end of your suffering.

619
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:31,730
But your mom...

620
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,069
will suffer endlessly.

621
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:42,239
Like me who wasn't able to save my mom.

622
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:51,049
Soo Ji. Your mom will be left alone.

623
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,650
Think about how painful
it will be for her...

624
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:58,159
for the rest of her life.

625
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:08,500

Don't come near me.

630

I know it's hard.

631
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,420
But scars get worse the
more you think about them.

632
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,589
Resentment grows bigger
the more you think of it.

633
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,929
So let's just focus on how to get back up.

634
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:36,560
Only that.

635
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:38,699
Okay?

636
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:02,920
Look!

637

650
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,379
After the husband gets
involved in a Me Too case,

651
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,548
it's not like all wives get a divorce.

652
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:11,460
Getting a divorce doesn't
make them worse than Hillary.

653
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:16,189
In a social media group chat,
the daughter got harassed.

654
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,499
One even said the daughter
should experience...

655
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,830
the same thing her dad did.

656
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,729
There were signs of harassment...

657
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,250
even on the day she attempted suicide.

Let's go through it together.

659
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:26,670
Jang Jae Gook, the husband.

660
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,710
He has never lost his place
on top for public confidence.

661

away after this incident.

up their text messages...

Why?

A lot of victims react like
that when they are taken aback.

679
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,539
Casually speaking, what if it was mutual...

680
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,109
but later claims she didn't
want it to go that far?

681
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,169
Then what?

The man's life is already ruined,
but later found that he's innocent.

683
00:44:37,779 --> 00:44:38,979
Then who takes responsibility?

684
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:43,718
Speaking like that could lead
to secondary victimization.

685
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:46,278
No, I didn't mean it that way.

686

Oh, yes!

00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,888
We must uphold the principle of
innocent until proven guilty!

Both of you have valid points.

689
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:54,759

690
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,130

691

- Yes.

I'm against taking on this case.

695
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,638
I'll judge whether he's
really a bad guy or not...

696
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:12,079
after seeing the verdict.

697
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,139
I'm against it too.

698
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:14,678
I don't understand why Lee Joo Won...

699
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:16,579
uploaded such texts if
she wanted a divorce.

700
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,750
She didn't even apologize.

based on a majority vote?

were sincere.

706
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,139
Her daughter's state is unstable too.

707
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,150
On top of that, the other party is...

708
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:44,779

709
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:50,250

00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:58,520
really a trash?

714
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,339
Oh, you're here.

715
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:12,579
Shouldn't it be, "Did you bring it?"

716
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:16,110
You're quick-witted. Give it to me.

717
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,480
Are you taking this precious
information for free?

718
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,750
How could I?

719
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:28,589
Goodbye.

720
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:46,139
Gosh, this is an amazing world.

721
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:47,940
You're using your ex-girlfriend.

722
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,169
She's...

723
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:50,579
After talking for two weeks
and spending one night,

724
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,610
she ghosted me.

725
00:46:51,779 --> 00:46:52,810
It was a month ago.

726
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,449
You asked for a favor
to that kind of a woman?

727
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:57,948
You said you needed this.

728
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:00,619
Meeting records of Jang Jae
Gook at the JBC audit office.

729
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:03,250
Yes, we shouldn't be prejudiced
when using one's talent.

730
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,500
We shouldn't be prejudiced
when using one's talent.

731
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,429
(JBC entry log)

732
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,929
Yes.

733
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,230
Yes, I heard Seo Yun isn't in Seoul.

734
00:47:17,239 --> 00:47:18,799
Haven't you found him yet?

735
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:24,339
Yes, I'll wait.

736
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:27,449
Hello!

737
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,080
What brings you all the way here?

738
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:34,999
I heard Writer Lee Joo Won came.

739
00:47:35,549 --> 00:47:37,189
What will you do? Will you take her case?

740
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,360
Most probably.

741
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:43,900
Then shall I prepare to raise your pay?

742
00:47:44,299 --> 00:47:46,360
Where did you learn to be so sensible?

743
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,000
You'll be more touched after seeing this.

744
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,709
I finally found a legal advisor.

745
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,469
That's great.

746
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:58,539
I like everyone who you like.

747
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,610
Is that so?

748
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,230
(Dong Gi Jun, former prosecutor,
currently working as a lawyer)

749
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,419
Oh, this person.

750
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,118
Yes! You remember him, right?

751
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:13,389
He made my ex-husband's hospital
chaotic when I was filing a divorce.

752
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,860
- Yes.
- He...

753
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:19,359
just resigned from his prosecutor job.

754
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,505
It looks like he quit for good.

755
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:23,270
I feel a deep connection with him.

756
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:25,770
I can't with this man.

757
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,238
Oh, is it because of the
professor's suicide attempt?

758
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,408
It was later found that it wasn't coercive.

759
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:32,338
I asked around. It wasn't coercive.

760
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:34,250
Well...

761
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,179
Prosecutors don't know much about divorce.

762
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:38,919
He can learn from you.

763
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,219
You should work with him.

764
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:44,118
Our teammates might not like him.

765
00:48:44,119 --> 00:48:45,618
What are you talking about?

766
00:48:45,619 --> 00:48:47,658
We have an ex-lawyer, ex-detective,

767
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:50,259
ex-hacker, and now we'll
have an ex-prosecutor.

768
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,028
It's fantastic!

769
00:48:53,029 --> 00:48:54,469
It's perfect.

770
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:56,770
What's wrong?

771
00:48:57,369 --> 00:49:00,170
Did he ghost you after dating?

772
00:49:01,509 --> 00:49:04,008
No, right? If not, let's just go with him.

773
00:49:04,009 --> 00:49:05,609
I can't find anyone like him.

774
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,650
So you just need to meet
him and seal this contract.

775
00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:12,118
I also asked around about his personality.

776
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,118
He's very considerate...

777
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,088
with great patience.

778
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:19,089
He usually doesn't get emotional.

779
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,699
Why is he so late?

780
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,130
Oh, there you are.

781
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:29,770
- One more soju, please.
- Yes.

782
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:33,170
Hey.

783
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:36,170
Answer the calls from our seniors.

784
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,508
Everyone asks me where you're working.

785
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:39,940
Don't answer their calls.

786
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:45,449
It's a law firm that everyone wants to go.

787
00:49:45,779 --> 00:49:46,819
Why are you hesitating?

788
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,619
For Seo Woong Jin's case...

789
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,059
Can you get me the investigative materials?

790
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,130
Let go.

791
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:02,799
Is this what you wanted to do?

792
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:06,298
It happened while I
conducted his investigation.

793
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:08,669
I need to find out why it happened.

794
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:10,715
The higher-ups don't even
allow me to touch the case.

795
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:13,339
I'm happy that I don't need to
ask for their permission anymore.

796
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,350
Are you declining offers from
the law firm to buy time?

797
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:21,789
Gosh, no wonder you're
called as a Shepherd.

798
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:23,519
You never let go of your case.

799
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,520
Stop.

800
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:27,020
Try dating like that.

801
00:50:28,389 --> 00:50:29,529
Mind your own business.

802
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,239
Thank you, Father-in-law.

803
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,770
Yes, I'll visit you with
Ji In on the weekends.

804
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:44,639
Yes, goodbye.

805
00:51:31,659 --> 00:51:33,699
About the proposed changes
to the Law School Law...

806
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,320
It will be sent to the
floor in the next session.

807
00:51:36,989 --> 00:51:39,560
It's about building three more law schools.

808
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:41,270
Look.

809
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,468
Being a family with the
Chairman of the LJC...

810
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:44,770
was a great move, right?

811
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:48,569
I behaved so well in front of him.

812
00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:53,389
It will be a success only
if the bill passes...

813
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:56,250
and we get the permission
to build a law school.

814
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,920
Keep that in mind.

815
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,249
But didn't I manage my divorce...

816
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:03,350
and remarriage well?

817
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:05,389
Leave the law school case...

818
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,230
to me, Mother.

819
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,500
Sure. I'll leave it to you.

820
00:52:13,029 --> 00:52:16,529
But don't forget that I
don't trust anyone but me.

821
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:19,299
No exception to my child.

822
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:29,949
How's Professor Seo?

823
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:32,279
He won't make it.

824
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:35,150
It's a done game. Don't
talk about it anymore.

825
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:38,360
Then we should change our name.

826
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,690
From the 5-member society
to the 4-member society.

827
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,929
We aren't making name cards.
Why bother to change?

828
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,460
You're right.

829
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:49,730
Oh, Mr. Noh.

830
00:52:50,299 --> 00:52:51,600
- Hello.
- Hi.

831
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:54,670
Have a seat.

832
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,639
Gosh.

833
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,709
Indeed, you're different.

834
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:04,278
It's not easy to increase
the number of law schools.

835
00:53:04,279 --> 00:53:05,349
Right?

836
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:07,749
Now, we just need to wait...

837
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,149
until our 10 million dollars turn
into 1 billion dollars, right?

838
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:11,189
- You're right.
- Yes.

839
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,258
Demolish everything here...

840
00:53:13,259 --> 00:53:15,229
and build the grand law school.

841
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:17,190
- Gosh.
- Yes.

842
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:18,859
Since we're in a good mood,

843
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,169
let's try finding a new
place for our hangout.

844
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,428
It's not good to meet in a place
with bad air quality like this.

845
00:53:23,429 --> 00:53:24,669
We're not gangsters.

846
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:25,699
Not a chance.

847
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,939
This is our last gathering.

848
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,008
Why?

849
00:53:30,009 --> 00:53:31,540
Is this Chairwoman Cha's order?

850
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,210
What are you talking about?

851
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:36,580
She doesn't even know about
the five-member society.

852
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,020
I see.

853
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:43,649
The main game will start.

854
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:44,730
What comes next is crucial.

855
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,488
We will take actions personally.

856
00:53:47,489 --> 00:53:49,359
If there's anything to update,

857
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,929
do it to me privately.

858
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,669
I invested so much.

859
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,468
I need to know the progress.

860
00:53:56,469 --> 00:53:59,138
If something happens while
covering for each other,

861
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:00,199
then...

862
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:03,190
we should pretend that
we don't know each other.

863
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:06,139
If I go down alone,

864
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:08,810
the investment funds and
dividends will still remain.

865
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:12,949
But if we all go down together,

866
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:15,318
I'll be done too, and
all the invested funds...

867
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:17,118
will disappear. Am I wrong?

868
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,589
So the five-member society doesn't
exist in this world. I see.

869
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:30,270
(Dong Gi Jun)

870
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:38,110
(Today's News)

871
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:44,350
- Yes, Ms. Son.
- What happened with Lawyer Dong?

872
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,920
Well...

873
00:54:49,089 --> 00:54:51,059
I haven't called him yet.

874
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,559
Still?

875
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,730
That makes me look weird.

876
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,829
I told everyone.

877
00:54:56,830 --> 00:54:59,460
You don't like the person I chose?

878
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:01,669
- I mean...
- Then...

879
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,770
you should find a suitable candidate.

880
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:20,989
(Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow)

881
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:29,730
Well...

882
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:32,719
I guess this is what you've been up to.

883
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:36,170
Divorce Specialist, Kim Sa Ra.

884
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,679
I heard you got divorced.

885
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:49,179
I'm not sure what to say
in a situation like this.

886
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:51,949
"Congratulations."

887
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:00,119
In Solution, we say this once
the divorce is confirmed.

888
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,060
Congratulations.

889
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:07,670

890
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:12,900
Congrat... I can't say it.

advisory regarding our clients.

How long has it been since we last met?

893
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:22,008
Excluding the brief encounter we had...

894
00:56:22,009 --> 00:56:23,178
when I went for a search and seizure,

895
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:25,650
has it been about nine years?

896
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,049
We also provide...

897
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,689
a separate office space
for legal practices...

898
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,719
that you will operate.

899
00:56:32,819 --> 00:56:35,389
We're seeing each other for
the 1st time in 9 years.

900
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,368
You can take charge when the
client proceeds to the lawsuit.

901
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:43,889
- And...
- That day, nine years ago...

902
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:51,480
You first need to explain
what happened that day.

903
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:54,650
That's the right order...

904
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:56,610
between us.

905
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:15,899
Come in and sleep.

906
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,469
That way, your bridal
makeup will look good.

907
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,360
You'll be an ugly bride tomorrow.

908
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,680
Since you won't have a good
sleep before your wedding.

909
00:58:25,699 --> 00:58:27,000
Don't get married.

910
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:33,739
I regretted saying that
you should be with him.

911
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,889
Even the tea scent is warm.

912
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:51,699
I'll get going.

913
00:58:57,199 --> 00:58:58,699
I thought about you every day.

914
00:59:02,509 --> 00:59:04,810
If I didn't give up on
you, would you have stayed?

915
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,750
Would you still have left?

916
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:14,650
Earlier,

917
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:19,360
I ran without thinking and ended up here.

918
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:22,259
I'm sorry.

919
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,600
I need to leave.

920
00:59:33,569 --> 00:59:34,639
Don't go.

921
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:43,179
Let's not do anything that we will regret.

922
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:46,819
Please?

923
00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:51,560
Let's leave together tomorrow.

924
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,839
Time really flies.

925
01:00:10,969 --> 01:00:13,210
Isn't it all good since
we're both living well?

926
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:27,189
We will give you the highest
salary you can get in this field.

927
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,989
(Legal Advisory Contract)

928
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,869
I don't understand.

929
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:44,810
Now you want to work with me?

930
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,880
This is Solution's
official stance as of now.

931
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,089
From now,

932
01:00:57,690 --> 01:00:59,360
this is my personal plead.

933
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:03,389
Please decline Solution's offer.

934
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,560
If you decline, our CEO will contact you.

935
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:07,929
But please...

936
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,540
decline until the end.

937
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,080
Is this...

938
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,679
all you have to say to me?

939
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,029
That day...

940
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:45,069
The day we promised to leave together.

941
01:01:48,569 --> 01:01:50,670
I just chose the reality.

942
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:53,880
Marriage.

943
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:58,319
Did you want to listen to
this obvious answer from me?

944
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:03,619
I'm sorry,

945
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:07,659
but I'm busy living my life.

946
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:11,330
I have no room to think about the past.

947
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:19,500
I appreciate the advice you
gave regarding my client before.

948
01:03:52,759 --> 01:03:55,170
The conditions that you offered...

949
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,529
What do I do?

950
01:03:57,569 --> 01:04:00,239
It was what I was searching for.

951
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:04,369
I don't want to lose the chance...

952
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,110
to work with you.

953
01:04:12,819 --> 01:04:15,920
- Lawyer Dong.
- What?

954
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:20,860
Yes?

955
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:24,029
Will you be fine working with me?

956
01:04:24,389 --> 01:04:26,159
What will not be fine about it?

957
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:31,130
We live very busy lives anyway.

958
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,610
My position as a legal
advisory won't be hierarchical.

959
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,850
Shall I consider you as my partner?

960
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,549
Let's partner up after a long time.

961
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:52,159
A business partner.

962
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:21,790
(Queen of Divorce)

963
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,718
Here comes the Welcome Quiz.

964
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:53,948
Lawyer Dong's nickname. It ends with a D.

965
01:05:53,949 --> 01:05:54,949
Legend.

966
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:58,049
- Shepherd.
- How did you know?

967
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:02,460
Mr. Jang's wife hired
Lawyer Kim to defend her.

968
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,158
Former lawyer, Kim Sa Ra.

969
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,229
What are you talking about? She
cannot act as a representative.

970
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,910
They have a separate legal representative.

971
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,299
It's Lawyer Dong Gi Jun.

972
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:13,169
- I'm nervous.
- Don't be.

973
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:16,069
- Who is it?
- I'm here to check your gas meter.

974
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:21,580
Darn it! I'm sorry.

975
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:27,650
This solution is for two people
who can never cooperate...

976
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:29,989
joining hands.
