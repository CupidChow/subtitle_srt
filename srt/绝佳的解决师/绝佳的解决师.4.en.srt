(Queen of Divorce)

5
00:00:44,709 --> 00:00:46,778
The pretrial procedure...

6
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:48,278
for Han Joo Hyuk, the former chairman...

7
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:49,526
of the Legislation and
Judiciary Committee, had begun.

8
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,490
Assemblyman Han is still
denying the allegations.

9
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,389
To ensure he became the
son-in-law of the assemblyman,

10
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,380
I heard Noh Yul Seong made sure
you didn't get out on bail.

11
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,459
Your source is quite useful.

12
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,469
Gosh. That sly jerk.

13
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:08,300
That scumbag.

14
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:12,669
Well, I know you can't swear.
So I'm doing it on your behalf.

15
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,209
That piece of trash. Darn that jerk.

16
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:24,819
I've served time, you know.

17
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:26,220
I'm not the same girl anymore.

18
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,359
- Which way should I go?
- Gosh. Take the left lane.

19
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,428
- The left lane?
- Try to get into the left lane.

20
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:33,728
Hold on. Cars are coming behind us.

21
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,899
- That was a foreign brand.
- Gosh.

22
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,569
You know, this is my strong suit.

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,630
I can prove to people
that our marriage is over.

24
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,868
(Uncontested Divorce Agreement)

25
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:42,940
Here.

26
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:46,508
(Noh Yul Seong, Han Ji In)

27
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:48,708
Anyone who interferes with my
plan of building Chayul Town...

28
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,838
will be eliminated. I don't care who it is.

29
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:52,850
I doubt that she will
agree to getting a divorce.

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,419
Making her the guilty
party will be the key.

31
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,479
Don't worry about that.

32
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,750
I'll settle the divorce
without giving her any alimony.

33
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:02,660
Okay.

34
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:04,458
You'll become an assemblyman soon.

35
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,490
You can't be the guilty
party in the divorce.

36
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,000
Why aren't you going in, Ms. Han?

37
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,578
You'll be able to print
documents from upstairs too.

38
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,979
- I see. Thank you.
- Sure.

39
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:26,949
I heard you were the guy to
talk to about electronics.

40
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,650
How come you didn't go into IT?

41
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:30,419
Because he found the perfect job.

42
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,499
- Pass.
- What are you doing?

43
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,258
There's a long list of awful jerks...

44
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:45,068
who ended up on the losing side in court.

45
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,469
What if she opens the package...

46
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,269
and a frog jumps out of it?

47
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,499
We ought to put another
title on his business cards.

48
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,109
The package screener for Ms. Kim.

49
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,180
How may I help you?

50
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,250
Please help me.

51
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,720
I'm...

52
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,819
the wife of Chayul Law
Firm's CEO, Noh Yul Seong.

53
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,060
I'm Han Ji In.

54
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,900
Can we talk in private?

55
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,569
Can you see the steam coming out of Ms.
Kim's head?

56
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,139
This is the most difficult case yet.

57
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:53,130
I found out how your divorce went down...

58
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,169
only recently.

59
00:03:58,069 --> 00:03:59,370
Why does that matter?

60
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,110
You must know how he'll
handle the divorce...

61
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:05,079
better than anyone.

62
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,889
You know what? If we were to
run into each other by chance,

63
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,870
we should pretend we didn't see each other.

64
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,859
I can't have children.

65
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,289
That's how my first marriage ended.

66
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,629
When my potential marriage
with Yul Seong came up,

67
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,429
I liked him because he
said he didn't need...

68
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,030
to have another child.

69
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,299
- But now...
- I'm sorry to cut you off.

70
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,739
But you came to the wrong place.

71
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,470
Go to another law firm.

72
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,879
I'm here because they can't help me.

73
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,789
I think my husband has something on me.

74
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,590
If he leaks it, my life will be over.

75
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:50,160
What does he have on you?

76
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,559
- I'll tell you if you take my case.
- Gosh. I don't need to hear it.

77
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,999
Please leave.

78
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,510
There's a video.

79
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,280
A video of me from a spy camera.

80
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:16,379
Assemblyman Han Joo Hyuk of
the Hanjoo Party was arrested.

81
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,649
It was the first time the
former chairman of the LJC...

82
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,788
had been arrested...

83
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:19,889
since the establishment
of the Constitution.

84
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,688
- Assemblyman Han is denying...
- Is this true?

85
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,858
- Do an interview before you go in.
- Answer our questions.

86
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:26,059
This is you, right?

87
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,160
(Restricted number)

88
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:34,169
- I missed you.
- Me too.

89
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:35,869
You look beautiful today.

90
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,739
I love you.

91
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,070
I love you too.

92
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,710
(Restricted number)

93
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Hello.

94
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:51,918
You know what? I prayed to the deity...

95
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,449
that your father would be...

96
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,720
a bit more famous.

97
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:57,419
I had been waiting for the
right moment all this time.

98
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,589
Darn it.

99
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,035
How could your family's reputation
go down the drain overnight?

100
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:02,129
Wait.

101
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,928
- Who is this?
- Given your situation,

102
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:07,070
I'll give you a deal.
I want 300,000 dollars.

103
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,010
What's wrong?

104
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,739
It's nothing.

105
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,760
I dated him briefly before
I married Yul Seong.

106
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:30,988
That man threatened you?

107
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:33,390
No. It wasn't him.

108
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,260
I don't know who it is.

109
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,129
Anyway, you think he sent
the video to Yul Seong too?

110
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:41,669
I think so.

111
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,308
What's this all about?

112
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:46,639
The party is trying...

113
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,010
to drive out anyone who's
close to your father.

114
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,849
Before his scandal could affect my son,

115
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,330
you should have come to us first
and said you wanted to leave.

116
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
My father told me...

117
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,189
he would be proven innocent.

118
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,688
Moreover,

119
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,058
my father had helped Chayul Law
Firm a lot with his influence.

120
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:07,659
Hey, we were deceived by your family.

121
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,259
You went to a mediocre
school, can't have babies,

122
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,460
and don't have a proper job.

123
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,428
And the only asset you
brought to this marriage...

124
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:14,070
was your father's influence. Am I wrong?

125
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,539
What are you doing?

126
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,048
There's no reason you
can insist this on me.

127
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:26,379
No, think carefully...

128
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,770
why I can insist on this divorce.

129
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,000
Do you want me to show you something?

130
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,320
Guess what this is.

131
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,358
What's that?

132
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,298
This contains a collection of files...

133
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:44,059
on all the dirty secrets
of our VIP clients.

134
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,570
You can't be an exception.

135
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,340
Honey.

136
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,719
You lied to me about your infertility...

137
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,950
when you married me.

138
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,320
What are you talking about?
You knew all about it.

139
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,298
You also didn't disclose the
fact that you had been treated...

140
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:16,530
at a psychiatric facility.

141
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:18,769
It was a simple therapy session.

142
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,290
Gosh. You have a bipolar disorder.
And it's pretty serious too.

143
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,239
Do you think you can kick me out like this?

144
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:25,640
With fabricated evidence?

145
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:31,279
Gosh. If I dropped this many hints,

146
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,650
shouldn't you have realized
what I have on you?

147
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,779
You're so frustrating. Listen carefully.

148
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,420
As for my last trump card,

149
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,219
it will solely depend on you.

150
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,359
Just remember that. Okay?

151
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,529
First of all, report him to the police.

152
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:48,429
The more I listen to you,

153
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,059
the more certain I am that
I cannot be part of this.

154
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,529
I can't report him to the police.

155
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:54,049
My father is already getting investigated.
Me in the news?

156
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,470
This is happening anyway.

157
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,570
Help me win this divorce suit, at least.

158
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:02,009
I can't give him what he wants that easily.

159
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,379
It's about Seo Yun.

160
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,879
You know he went to the US, right?

161
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,450
I'll get a number you can call.

162
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,090
You probably want to ask me if
I'm okay or something. Right?

163
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:52,389
Yes. Are you all right?

164
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:56,560
No.

165
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:58,470
I don't think I'm okay.

166
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,139
But I did remember what you said, Mr. Dong.

167
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,979
"The assailant fears it the most..."

168
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,609
"when the victims join forces."

169
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,820
I'll always vote with you.

170
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:22,819
I'm with you too.

171
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,560
Even we couldn't find a phone
number to get in touch with Seo Yun.

172
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,769
No. This is too much.

173
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Okay.

174
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:39,769
I'll sleep on it.

175
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:43,379
What did you say?

176
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,509
Ms. Han met up with your ex-wife.

177
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:47,979
Why?

178
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,619
- Did Sa Ra approach Ji In?
- No.

179
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,189
Ms. Han requested Ms. Kim
to take her divorce suit.

180
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,529
Exactly. Why did she go to Sa Ra?

181
00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:30,319
Why are you coming home so late?

182
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,359
You startled me.

183
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:33,590
How did you find me here?

184
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,899
Gosh. I know everything about you.

185
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:46,409
You should be picky about your clients.

186
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,809
You won't defend my wife, will you?

187
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,649
You really are consistent, at least.

188
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,220
You're treating your wife just
like you treated your ex-wife.

189
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,148
Come on. Don't cross the line.

190
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:02,119
Why are you interfering in my divorce?

191
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:05,629
Is that what you and Dong
Gi Jun plotted together?

192
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,599
Is he trying to stand in my
way at every chance he gets...

193
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,158
to take revenge for not
being able to marry you?

194
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,159
Don't you dare...

195
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,970
mention him with your dirty mouth.

196
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,639
Listen up.

197
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:27,080
What do I hate the most in this world?

198
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:30,450
It's when people come after what's mine.

199
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,220
Don't approach my people.

200
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,359
My son and my wife. Got it?

201
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,029
"You're still my first."

202
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,200
It's an upgrade from that.

203
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:50,138
Too bad. I'm getting fired up now that...

204
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:51,639
you're telling me not to do it.

205
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,850
It's me.

206
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,450
See you tomorrow in my office.

207
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,519
Bye, Ms. Han.

208
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,919
Gosh. Seriously.

209
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
Let's see who comes out
as a winner this time.

210
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:44,889
It's me.

211
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:49,759
Hey. Let's take on Ms. Han's case.

212
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,800
Are you sure you can do this?

213
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,499
It might be uncomfortable and unpleasant.

214
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,100
It's fine as long as we win.

215
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,440
You don't want to?

216
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,680
Well, if we're going up
against Noh Yul Seong,

217
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,350
I wouldn't say no to that.

218
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:08,820
Why?

219
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:11,279
Because you hate him.

220
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,090
I'll get the team ready.

221
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:17,690
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

222
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,229
(Divorce Specialist Solution)

223
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,339
First of all, we must
learn all the details...

224
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,540
about your marriage.

225
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,008
Tell us everything about your
husband that comes to mind.

226
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:10,009
Violence, gambling, or affairs.
Tell us anything.

227
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,809
He didn't have any visible flaws like that.

228
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,749
Up until my father's arrest, that is.

229
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,350
None? Are you sure?

230
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,619
Didn't he lose his temper in
the middle of your conversation?

231
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,158
When you pushed his buttons...

232
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,858
I told you not to speak to me like that.

233
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,299
- Didn't he verbally attack you?
- That's why I'm doing this!

234
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,520
I bet there were traces of cosmetics
on his shirts all the time.

235
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,639
Are you sure he did none of these?

236
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,339
Right, he did.

237
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,470
Those behaviors are
considered visible flaws.

238
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,180
Didn't he insult you every
time he opened his mouth?

239
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:47,389
He might have said you smelled
bad after visiting your family.

240
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,180
Well, not really.

241
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,089
But he did complain often that
my father wasn't taking...

242
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,960
a more active role to help him.

243
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:58,989
"You can't even have babies."

244
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,430
"You already failed once."

245
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:04,479
"Your father's influence is
the only thing you have."

246
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,810
He insulted me every time he spoke to me.

247
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,540
Let's say he verbally insulted her.

248
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:10,999
Okay.

249
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,809
It's impossible to demand...

250
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,649
the division of assets from Noh Yul Seong.

251
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,609
He has no assets to divide.

252
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:22,580
But he's the CEO of Chayul Law Firm.

253
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:26,790
All the assets are under Chairwoman Cha.

254
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,220
I didn't get anything either.

255
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,988
You know, if Noh Yul Seong
really has the video,

256
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:35,129
why didn't he use it?

257
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,898
"Should I leak the video? Or
do you want to get a divorce?"

258
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,200
He might have done that.

259
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,569
Anything she did before marriage
can't be grounds for divorce.

260
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,970
Threatening her outright will
put him at a disadvantage too.

261
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,940
He knows that.

262
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:48,039
So he's looking for a way
to use the video indirectly.

263
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,080
That's why we'll go with a
two-track system for this.

264
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,050
First things first. Check
the file he has on her.

265
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,580
Is that on his computer?

266
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,019
It's a USB card.

267
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,758
"NYS." His initials are on the card.

268
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,629
If it's a USB card, will
he carry it with him?

269
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,199
No. He usually stores all
of his data in his office.

270
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,029
She already searched the house.

271
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,899
Apparently, he has a secret hideout.

272
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,569
Ms. Han gave us this photo.

273
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,668
(The area will be demolished soon.
Please move out quickly.)

274
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:21,069
(Noh Yul Seong's hideout: Obtain
the USB card and check it.)

275
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,379
Next, we will find the man
that blackmailed Ms. Han...

276
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,130
and destroy the original footage.

277
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,948
That means the blackmailer hasn't
extorted money out of her yet.

278
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,679
That's why he'll contact her again.

279
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:34,219
That's when we'll all set out.

280
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,590
- Okay.
- Okay.

281
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,049
(Plan to retrieve Ms. Han's video)

282
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,659
Mr. Dong. I need you to accompany me.

283
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,429
You want me to go through
Noh Yul Seong's office?

284
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:56,079
I'm a judicial officer,
not a troubleshooter.

285
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,839
Don't you know...

286
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,579
that it's difficult for lawyers
to make a living these days?

287
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,979
You must be a versatile asset.
Don't be silly.

288
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,420
No. I'm doing all right as a lawyer.

289
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,249
Besides, why do I have to be...

290
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,520
a petty thief in broad daylight? Why me?

291
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,188
Why not you?

292
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,889
Well, you see, as for my task,

293
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,530
I have to distract Noh Yul Seong,

294
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:17,800
so he doesn't catch on.

295
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,069
- I see.
- People call this teamwork.

296
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,599
I prefer to work alone.

297
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,720
That's why I don't eat pizza
with a team of toppings.

298
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:28,340
Okay. You must have forgotten that.

299
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:29,810
I did.

300
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,879
If you need money, I'll give you some.

301
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,790
Did you have to get
involved in my divorce suit?

302
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,820
You know that this is just wrong.

303
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,619
To me, this is the right thing to do.

304
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,429
Helping your victim win the lawsuit.

305
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,939
You know,

306
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,639
this is a losing battle.

307
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,979
I'm sure you know that.
Let's just end this quietly.

308
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,980
Have her sign the agreement. Okay?

309
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,119
Ms. Han won't go down like me...

310
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:15,590
because I'll be with her
every step of the way.

311
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,259
So what? What do you want?
I'll hear you out.

312
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,300
Okay.

313
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:25,770
As for the alimony,

314
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:28,409
we want exactly one million dollars.
No more or no less.

315
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,169
Okay? Then Ms. Han will
agree to the divorce.

316
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:34,439
Gosh. This is crazy.

317
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:37,040
A million dollars? You're funny.

318
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,648
By the way, what happened to the lawyer?

319
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:44,379
The one that's been following
around you like a puppy?

320
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:46,590
- You didn't come together?
- Seo Yun.

321
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,430
Give me a number I can reach him at.

322
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,530
Let me ask you something.

323
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,399
Why do you keep getting
involved in my business?

324
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:03,950
Are you trying to mess with me?
Or is this about Seo Yun?

325
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,969
Well, it's obvious. Must you ask?

326
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,879
It's both.

327
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,408
You must know...

328
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,649
messing with me will push Seo
Yun farther away from you.

329
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,250
Says who? Do you want
to see if that's true?

330
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,550
Should I turn on the lights?

331
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,129
What's this? Why did the lights come on?

332
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,330
Hey. Honey.

333
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:35,369
What did you say?

334
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:37,570
What?

335
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:48,709
It feels a bit surreal to hear
that from you after all this time.

336
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,790
Right. This used to be our relationship.

337
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,290
So listen.

338
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,359
Can't we go back to how it was before?

339
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,999
Think about our son, Seo Yun.

340
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,069
Do you think our son will be happy...

341
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,439
if we always fight and bicker
at each other like this?

342
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,240
Put yourself in his shoes.

343
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,580
Wouldn't he want me to come to
him even if I have to fight you?

344
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,719
Bring the alimony for Ms.
Han the next time I see you.

345
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:42,070
That felt weird.

346
00:21:54,109 --> 00:21:55,179
Do you want some coffee?

347
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,679
No. This will do for me.

348
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,760
Let me have one too.

349
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:13,468
As for Noh Yul Seong's hideout,

350
00:22:13,469 --> 00:22:14,999
it's not an ideal place to hide anything.

351
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,099
We found it at Chayul Law Firm.

352
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,198
- Is that so?
- Yes.

353
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,559
We're trying to decipher the code.

354
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:22,909
Done.

355
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,979
(Chayul Director Kim Seong Jun,
Chayul Director Lee Jae Ho...)

356
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,618
(Han Ji In, Social media secret account)

357
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:31,979
The video file...

358
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,020
is missing.

359
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,888
They're all text files.

360
00:22:34,889 --> 00:22:36,389
It's like a collection of rumors.

361
00:22:38,719 --> 00:22:39,929
There's the specialty.

362
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,399
Making threats without having anything big.

363
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:45,869
It's our job to stop it before
Noh Yul Seong finds out.

364
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:47,969
Let's get the blackmailer
as soon as possible.

365
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:49,299
Before Chayul does.

366
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,380
- Understood.
- Understood.

367
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,939
It was like banging my
head against a stone wall.

368
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,530
I was worried my head would start to bleed.

369
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:58,109
We should set up a trap.

370
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:00,009
A trap to help us end things.

371
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,280
You know that's illegal, right?

372
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,350
This is not the prosecution.

373
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,550
Noh Yul Seong already set
up a trap for his wife.

374
00:23:09,459 --> 00:23:11,490
Did you always cross the line like this?

375
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,060
The Kim Sa Ra I knew was never like this.

376
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,399
I never cross the line.

377
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:21,500
I just decide where the line is.

378
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,270
I see. Amazing.

379
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,938
- Here.
- Gosh.

380
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:29,079
- Thank you.
- Goodness.

381
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,509
- Thank you so much.
- My goodness.

382
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,949
Are you really going
to take CEO Noh's case?

383
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:37,480
Trauma might get you.

384
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,389
Just enjoy the fun.

385
00:23:39,889 --> 00:23:42,619
Lawyer Dong, you should
take good care of her.

386
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:45,659
Ms. Kim is an expert at crossing lines.

387
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,189
- She might go wild.
- She already has.

388
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,969
I'll have my eyes fixed on her.

389
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,368
Okay. Feel free to talk.

390
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,145
- Thank you for the food.
- Don't mention it.

391
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,139
She's always worried about me these days.

392
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,310
Our CEO.

393
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,609
She might have failed in marriage,

394
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,010
but her divorce was a success.

395
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,149
Can you fail in marriage?

396
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:17,320
Is it a failed marriage if you
end things like me in the middle?

397
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,760
Is it considered a success
to manage to survive?

398
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:25,629
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

399
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:29,770
I'll keep Solution's viewpoint in mind.

400
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,070
I apologize.

401
00:24:34,209 --> 00:24:36,980
There's no success or failure in marriage,

402
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,810
Lawyer Dong.

403
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,949
There are people who
choose to end marriage...

404
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,119
and people who choose to maintain marriage.

405
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,760
This is why a newbie needs
an orientation session.

406
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,230
How foolish of me.

407
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:00,368
Everything here is on me. Enjoy the food.

408
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:01,369
I'm sorry.

409
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,709
- I need a drink.
- Right.

410
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,619
(Kim Sa Ra)

411
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,959
(Taboo word: Failed marriage)

412
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,699
Hello.

413
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,500
I'm Jang Hui Jin.

414
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,109
Manager Jang?

415
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,109
Nice to meet you. Over here.

416
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,010
- You're our new manager?
- Yes.

417
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,849
We heard about you from our CEO.

418
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,550
- Welcome to our office.
- Thank you.

419
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,179
We'll plan a welcome dinner soon.

420
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:53,719
Sure.

421
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,320
Shall we go up?

422
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,730
This is your room.

423
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,939
Right.

424
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,840
You'll be done with those
gestures after today, right?

425
00:26:15,469 --> 00:26:17,780
You're flipping yourself like a flip phone.

426
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,050
Yes.

427
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:24,349
Just saying. Oh, right.

428
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,589
Everything here runs just
like any other law firm.

429
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,090
You'll be dealing with lawsuits.

430
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,888
The Solution Team on the first floor...

431
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:32,260
- will provide further advice.
- Right.

432
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:34,659
I have a meeting to be in.
I'll head downstairs.

433
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,189
It's me. I'm at the office.

434
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:11,230
Okay.

435
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,415
It was sent by an unknown sender
through a quick delivery service.

436
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:19,609
Did you lose it?

437
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,639
What about my wife?

438
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,240
She cannot be reached.

439
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:27,050
I was told she will be
away for the time being.

440
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,999
What about the meeting with
the party representative?

441
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,378
I'm sorry. I'll make sure
to make it happen soon.

442
00:27:32,379 --> 00:27:34,779
Get over here. Is there anything
that's working in my favor?

443
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,180
You haven't met up with the
party representative yet?

444
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,100
I will meet her soon.

445
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,999
This is why there are rumors our
district is leaning toward...

446
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,530
Chief Auditor Jung Sang Joo.

447
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,069
Is there anywhere else
you can get nominated...

448
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,270
in the capital area while
being under the Hanjoo Party?

449
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:54,139
Get yourself together!

450
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,786
(The generation-changing
Hanjoo Party of the nation)

451
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,080
If you trust me,

452
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,970
I will get all of the
assemblymen under Han Joo Hyuk.

453
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:06,250
Every single one of them.

454
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,089
I will line them up before you.

455
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,790
(Hanjoo Party)

456
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:14,629
For the nomination, you'll end things...

457
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,859
with your father-in-law.
Is this what you're saying?

458
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,030
To be honest,

459
00:28:20,899 --> 00:28:22,270
it's been a while...

460
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:26,909
since I've been filing for a divorce.

461
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:30,980
So you're going to become
the worst son-in-law.

462
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,249
This doesn't seem like a good idea.

463
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,648
If a candidate filing
for a divorce appears,

464
00:28:35,649 --> 00:28:38,050
I can't imagine how much
of a target you'll become.

465
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:40,919
That will never happen.

466
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,060
Before I get submitted as a candidate,

467
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,639
I will make sure to get the papers sorted.

468
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,830
It will be neatly done.

469
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,169
(Hanjoo Party)

470
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:00,668
The person is unable to answer the phone.

471
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:01,810
- Please leave...
- Gosh.

472
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:05,510
Why won't she ever pick up?

473
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:09,669
She wants you to contact your
previous wife for divorce matters.

474
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:11,520
She refuses to meet.

475
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,389
Just bring her to me.

476
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,319
There are less than ten days
before candidate registrations.

477
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,689
Does that mean...

478
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,059
Just bring her to me! You heard me!

479
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,898
Persuade her or kidnap her.

480
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,168
Do whatever you can.

481
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:27,230
Understood.

482
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,300
Noh Yul Seong is nothing.
Don't be afraid of him.

483
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:34,868
The blackmailer wants...

484
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:36,709
- the money by this week, right?
- Yes.

485
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,980
If you get a call, let us know.

486
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,208
All right.

487
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:42,409
- Let's go, Lawyer Dong.
- Hold on.

488
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,949
I need to ask him something
about legal matters.

489
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,389
If this becomes a lawsuit,

490
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,590
will you take this case?

491
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:53,929
Of course.

492
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:03,600
But it won't be easy.

493
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:23,689
Let go of me.

494
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,359
Who is this?

495
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,129
Do you think we're still your servants?

496
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,388
Let's be polite.

497
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:30,029
Ever since the day your
father went to jail,

498
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,428
happy days were over for you too, old lady.

499
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:33,629
My gosh.

500
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,429
You guys don't even check the face?

501
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:36,999
I'm not Han Ji In!

502
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,070
Just stay still!

503
00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:24,379
Gosh.

504
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,590
That crazy jerk.

505
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,590
Oh, gosh.

506
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,899
Darn it.

507
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:14,699
Gosh.

508
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:51,340
You jerk! Let go of me.

509
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,580
Oh, gosh!

510
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,490
Darn it.

511
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
Darn it.

512
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:15,629
Darn it.

513
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,899
Hey! Darn it.

514
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,030
Hey!

515
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,310
My gosh.

516
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,179
What do we do? Both of them got away.

517
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,510
Are you okay?

518
00:33:35,949 --> 00:33:37,149
It was bad.

519
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,949
They kidnapped me thinking I was Han Ji In.

520
00:33:40,449 --> 00:33:41,689
Who would do that?

521
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
No idea.

522
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:47,830
Your workouts really paid off.

523
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:52,100
I have just my own body to trust.

524
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
Gosh.

525
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:56,240
- Your...
- Gosh.

526
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,800
Cover up yourself.

527
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,108
You have to take care of
your body if you trust it.

528
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,850
You don't even look that strong.

529
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:39,210
Why don't you do that too?

530
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,210
You don't look that strong either.

531
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:50,259
Right? This can be called an
accident during work, right?

532
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,159
Probably.

533
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:53,989
Please talk it out.

534
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,698
It wouldn't make sense
for the blackmailer...

535
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:05,339
to try and kidnap her.

536
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,710
Could it be Noh Yul Seong?

537
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,040
Why would he do that?

538
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,509
There could be a reason
he needs that divorce.

539
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,889
Where are we going?

540
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,400
You looked uncomfortable in that shirt.

541
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,670
Should I choose for you
something that you'll like?

542
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,839
There's no need for that.

543
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:09,639
The dress is beautiful, isn't it?
I think you'll look great in it.

544
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,845
I won't be needing those
kinds of dresses anyway.

545
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:13,909
I'll just get the shirt.

546
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,080
The license plate was H3742.

547
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,839
It must be an illegal car, right?

548
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:22,009
Probably. Let's try tracking it down.

549
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
All right.

550
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,829
Here. Just to your liking.
You only get iced Americanos.

551
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,270
What if I've changed?

552
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,249
People don't change what
they like that easily.

553
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:54,210
I must meet Noh Yul Seong.

554
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,380
I can tell from his eyes.

555
00:36:57,319 --> 00:36:58,980
I can tell if he's lying or not.

556
00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:14,529
Was that her?

557
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,440
We were mistaken.

558
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:22,810
Will you not do things right?

559
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:24,039
I apologize, sir.

560
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,580
I beg you, Mr. Baek!

561
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,679
I'm terribly sorry.

562
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:33,290
Darn it. Why aren't you leaving?

563
00:37:34,489 --> 00:37:35,689
Should I leave? Fine. I'll just leave.

564
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,759
I'll leave, sir.

565
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,270
What do you want now?

566
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,219
I just can't believe it.

567
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:06,448
You two are always together.
You must like each other.

568
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:07,719
What's with the kidnapping?

569
00:38:07,819 --> 00:38:09,088
What kidnapping?

570
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:11,759
It was by your people,
and it happened today.

571
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:14,130
Me?

572
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,259
I made them kidnap you?

573
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:26,540
I never said it was me.

574
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,139
Gosh.

575
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:36,649
Sa Ra. Making a scene at your
ex-husband's workplace...

576
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,119
is uncivilized.

577
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:40,150
Isn't the jerk...

578
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:43,690
who kidnapped his wife
much more uncivilized?

579
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,460
Aren't I right?

580
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,029
Was this some kind of threat...

581
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,968
to force a divorce?

582
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:58,040
Hey, Dong Gi Jun.

583
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,509
Don't be near him.

584
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:07,509
He made someone commit
suicide with all his nonsense.

585
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,850
He's a murderer.

586
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,880
Forget it. Let's get going.

587
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,500
It was Noh Yul Seong's idea, wasn't it?

588
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,600
If we find the evidence,
it will greatly favor us.

589
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:34,969
Forget about what he said.

590
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,909
He keeps caring about
you even after a divorce.

591
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,119
I'm...

592
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,049
his child's mother.

593
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,290
It's inevitable to think about each other.

594
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,569
Yes, Ji In.

595
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:06,909
No. Don't do that.

596
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:08,710
You have to plan things with us first.

597
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:10,839
Wait for us.

598
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,480
She said she would be meeting
up with the blackmailer.

599
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:23,889
(Meeting room)

600
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,389
Kang Bom.

601
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,059
Did you get kicked out?

602
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,399
No greeting. No questions.

603
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,529
Help me find this jerk.

604
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:39,269
Those who did that to Ms. Kim.

605
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,110
I will catch them with my own hands.

606
00:40:41,409 --> 00:40:43,068
Gosh, these punks.

607
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:46,679
Something's different.
It's definitely different.

608
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:50,520
What are you talking about?

609
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,150
Do you like Ms. Kim?

610
00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:00,130
Don't you like her too?

611
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,600
So there is something going on.

612
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,460
What is this about?

613
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,730
What are you talking about?
Just answer your phone.

614
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:11,739
Hurry.

615
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,940
Yes, Ms. Kim. We'll be right there.

616
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,239
(Seoul Jungang Police Station)

617
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:30,089
We don't see them yet.

618
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:42,428
What is that jerk doing? That little...

619
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:44,138
- Ms. Kim.
- Yes?

620
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:46,600
- You're really giving it away.
- Is that so?

621
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,069
- Look natural.
- Right.

622
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:52,639
That guy with the cap.

623
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,980
Doesn't he look suspicious?

624
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,179
Hey.

625
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,649
- It was a long wait, wasn't it?
- There's his girlfriend.

626
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,750
There's his girlfriend.

627
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,449
Leave it on the tray at the return station.

628
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:07,360
She's listening to him.

629
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:25,940
There. That guy on the right.

630
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:28,179
He looks suspicious.

631
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:29,880
Okay.

632
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:37,420
Shouldn't we call the cops?

633
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:40,860
Ms. Han was totally against that.

634
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:45,130
If we encounter them, don't run
away and aim for where it hurts.

635
00:42:47,029 --> 00:42:48,999
Make sure not to fall for my fists.

636
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,639
Gosh. I'm already falling for them.

637
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:01,679
Don't look back. Just
leave in that direction.

638
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:07,818
- Why were you so late?
- Oh, my gosh!

639
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:10,088
I'm so sorry. I thought
you were my boyfriend.

640
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:12,989
No. I thought you were my friend.
I apologize.

641
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:17,198
- Gosh!
- Oh, no.

642
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:19,028
Gosh. Just forget it!

643
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:21,969
- You should get it cleaned up.
- Just go.

644
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:27,239
Do you want to leave with me or the police?

645
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:29,739
Go.

646
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,819
Hey, just come with us.

647
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:46,659
Darn it.

648
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,350
Gosh, I'm sorry!

649
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,389
Sorry.

650
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,500
- Oh, gosh!
- I'm sorry.

651
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:27,500
I'm so sorry!

652
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:34,469
Gosh, that's hot!

653
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,569
Gosh!

654
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,310
Oh, gosh.

655
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,060
What's going on? Gosh!

656
00:45:13,949 --> 00:45:15,009
Are you okay?

657
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:22,549
What is this?

658
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,119
What on earth is this?

659
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:26,258
Why are you...

660
00:45:26,259 --> 00:45:29,089
shooting a noir movie in my bakery?

661
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:31,330
I'm sorry.

662
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:34,269
We'll pay back everything.

663
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,429
Do you think you're covered with flour?

664
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:39,138
It's gold powder.

665
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:42,169
It's what they talk about in the news...

666
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:45,609
since importing is blocked!

667
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,639
Oh, my goodness!

668
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:58,290
(All-purpose Flour A)

669
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:01,860
Will these be enough to
cover these four's mistake?

670
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,759
They're all flour.

671
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,899
Excuse me. It's gold powder.

672
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,899
It's enough for three months.

673
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,499
Are you giving these for free?

674
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,569
Yes.

675
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,739
Unload them. Hurry!

676
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,509
Ms. Son, what's going on?

677
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:19,609
I have both pride and money,

678
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,750
but I have more money.

679
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:22,779
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, my.

680
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,948
Why are you surprised? Wait.

681
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,650
Please come.

682
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:29,719
What?

683
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,529
This is a bonus for saving Sa Ra.

684
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:37,299
Please scrap your old car.

685
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,468
- Oh, it's for work.
- No, it's an incentive.

686
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:41,830
Thank you, Ms. Son.

687
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:45,039
But we didn't catch him.

688
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,239
- Yet, you gave me a huge gift.
- What do you mean?

689
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:50,069
We can use this new car to catch him.

690
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:51,809
- Right?
- Sure.

691
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,679
You should all get cleaned.

692
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,479
The angle isn't good.

693
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,190
Can you zoom in on this part?

694
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:07,258
The star tattoo on the hand is unique.

695
00:47:07,259 --> 00:47:09,690
But it's difficult to catch
using this star tattoo alone.

696
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,330
I'll try to convince Ms. Han again.

697
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:16,270
The only answer to this is
to report to the police.

698
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,500
Hello!

699
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,439
May I join the meeting?

700
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,480
Sure.

701
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,186
It's better to hear yourself than
being shared by him every time.

702
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:28,508
Well, sure.

703
00:47:28,509 --> 00:47:30,279
But we're almost done for today.

704
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,189
He'll contact Ms. Han again.

705
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,219
Let's wait.

706
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:36,889
Okay.

707
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,389
- I'll get going. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

708
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,330
What is that?

709
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:53,138
The client is being threatened.

710
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:54,439
He is the culprit.

711
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,880
It's sensitive as it's about a
hidden camera before marriage.

712
00:47:58,179 --> 00:47:59,409
I see.

713
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,079
Why do you look so ashamed?

714
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,179
You always stumble in fear.

715
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,360
Don't worry. I'll catch him.

716
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,199
Please don't...

717
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,376
try to convince her to
report to the police today.

718
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,469
Why?

719
00:48:28,469 --> 00:48:30,139
I failed to catch him.

720
00:48:30,779 --> 00:48:31,810
So I'll catch him.

721
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:34,480
Where will you catch him?

722
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:37,049
Please believe me.

723
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,420
(Seohan University Hospital is
a safe hospital for citizens.)

724
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,790
- Thank you for everything.
- No worries.

725
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,519
I'll come to see you from time to time.

726
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,329
- Cheer up.
- Thank you.

727
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,629
I'll leave after meeting your doctor.

728
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:53,199
- Okay.
- Be strong.

729
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,549
You're here.

730
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,619
Why are you here again?

731
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,319
Leave.

732
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,819
Mom, she's here as he's worried about Dad.

733
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:19,420
Well...

734
00:49:21,089 --> 00:49:22,259
this isn't much.

735
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:24,389
But please use this for
the hospital charges.

736
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,860
We don't need it!

737
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,220
Mom, why are you doing this?

738
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,900
Just save my husband.

739
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:36,170
What's the use...

740
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:38,279
of doing this now?

741
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:42,009
Ma'am.

742
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,850
Please take care of yourself.

743
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:48,350
Professor Seo will wake up soon.

744
00:49:54,889 --> 00:49:58,060
You said you haven't opened
his phone yet, right?

745
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,230
Yes, the passwords weren't matching.

746
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,139
Can't we convince your mother...

747
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,899
to let the professionals decode it?

748
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,439
She thought about it a lot.

749
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,909
She agreed in the end.

750
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,110
Someone took his phone.

751
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,710
- Who?
- The man who came by just now.

752
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:19,819
- Who is he?
- Oh, he's...

753
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:23,049
I'm sorry.

754
00:50:23,219 --> 00:50:25,289
He's been taking care of us.

755
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:27,020
But he doesn't want to reveal himself.

756
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:13,968
(Chats)

757
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:15,310
(Solution)

758
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,779
(Kim Sa Ra)

759
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,130
(Kim Sa Ra)

760
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:40,529
Why were you curious about
CEO Noh's divorce story?

761
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:43,230
How is it related to Professor Seo's case?

762
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,600
No. It's not because of that.

763
00:51:46,199 --> 00:51:48,039
It's because of my team
leader at the company.

764
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,009
She's Noh Yul Seong's ex-wife.

765
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,650
Did you accept the job
offer because of her?

766
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,360
To get some information
about Chayul Law Firm?

767
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,219
It's not exactly like that.

768
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,159
Gosh. You're persistent.

769
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:11,830
I wondered why you'd work there.

770
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:15,130
Does she know that you're
investigating this case?

771
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:18,600
She won't feel good if she knows.

772
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:20,469
It's not the right time yet.

773
00:52:21,069 --> 00:52:22,610
What's this philanthropy?

774
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,520
Is the chief prosecutor doing well?

775
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,369
He's now working at Chayul Law Firm.

776
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,360
What?

777
00:52:46,699 --> 00:52:49,229
The district attorney, the
chief prosecutor and all.

778
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:51,369
It's going to be Chayul
district prosecutors' office.

779
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,269
The chief prosecutor who was trying
to cover up Professor Seo's case...

780
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,339
went to Chayul Law Firm.

781
00:52:57,509 --> 00:52:59,838
The phone that Professor Seo kept...

782
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:01,850
was taken by Noh Yul Seong.

783
00:53:04,179 --> 00:53:06,048
Professor Seo's phone? Why?

784
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,219
Na Yu Mi.

785
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:09,790
Seo Woong Jin, Noh Yul Seong.

786
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,980
These three must have some connection.

787
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,060
Honey!

788
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,929
This is driving me crazy.

789
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,170
Please answer.

790
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:32,539
Why are you doing this?

791
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,810
Why didn't you answer when
you were in the house?

792
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,819
I'm not in a hurry to divorce you.

793
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:40,500
There's nothing much about
me in the files you kept.

794
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,190
Gosh.

795
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:48,060
I knew you were with them.

796
00:53:49,389 --> 00:53:50,389
Never mind.

797
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,569
Let's just exchange things that we need.

798
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,130
Like what?

799
00:53:57,369 --> 00:53:58,440
I'll make sure...

800
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:01,270
to take Father out.

801
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:06,940
How?

802
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:09,610
Kim Young Hak is the
judge for the first trial.

803
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,160
We have his file in Chayul.

804
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,735
But I need you to seal
our divorce papers now.

805
00:54:19,759 --> 00:54:20,790
It'll save your father.

806
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:35,270
You must have time to be here.

807
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,409
There are rumors saying...

808
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,300
that it'll be hard for you to be nominated.

809
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,949
Please mind your own business.

810
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,850
This is about our marriage.

811
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:51,119
It's my job to interfere
in others' marriages.

812
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,060
Honey, think carefully...

813
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,169
about who would be beneficial...

814
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:04,169
for you. Okay?

815
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:05,569
You should really consider...

816
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,040
your choices carefully.

817
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:18,779
Bring me the alimony...

818
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,679
and admit your faults.

819
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:22,020
Then I'll seal that paper.

820
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:35,830
See you next week!

821
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:46,239
Hey! Can't you speak?

822
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:49,279
That jerk... Aren't you apologizing?

823
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,949
You should apologize.

824
00:55:56,989 --> 00:55:58,060
Dae Gi!

825
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,460
I thought I saw a ghost.

826
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,599
I thought you were dead.

827
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,339
Are you annoyed that I came back alive?

828
00:56:11,799 --> 00:56:14,269
Hey! I'm your only brother.

829
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:15,270
Brother?

830
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,179
Why did you run away?

831
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,479
Why isn't he coming?

832
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,889
At least pick up your phone!

833
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,189
Is he not reachable yet?

834
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:32,889
It was difficult to arrange this surgery.

835
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:35,290
If he doesn't come,

836
00:56:36,389 --> 00:56:38,229
what will happen to me?

837
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:40,759
A very high-volume anticancer
drug is in your body,

838
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:42,270
so if he doesn't show up...

839
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,310
I'll die for sure.

840
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:56,679
Oh, my gosh. What should we do?

841
00:56:57,179 --> 00:56:59,619
We explained this to his brother too.

842
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,089
Let me know if he arrives.

843
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:04,520
Okay. Oh, gosh.

844
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:09,960
- Mom.
- Yes.

845
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,630
Mom, I'm fine.

846
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,409
Do you know how much I
waited for you that day?

847
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,580
Mom fainted out of frustration.

848
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,920
You killed her.

849
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:34,290
Why are you here?

850
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:36,488
What do you want me to do now?

851
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:38,718
Did you run away to threaten
others with hidden cameras?

852
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:40,679
You didn't care whether
your brother dies or not?

853
00:57:41,029 --> 00:57:43,028
You're so annoying.

854
00:57:43,029 --> 00:57:44,500
I just did someone's errand.

855
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:50,699
If you scream, you'll die immediately.

856
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:53,739
I rehearsed so many times...

857
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,139
to kill a man who killed my mother.

858
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,580
Who is it?

859
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,350
Oh, my gosh.

860
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,989
What's this all about?

861
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:09,750
- Hey!
- It hurts!

862
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:31,508
Are you still selling data
from secondhand phones?

863
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:32,509
Well...

864
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:34,480
My goodness.

865
00:58:45,619 --> 00:58:48,330
Dae Gi, it hurts!

866
00:58:49,429 --> 00:58:51,698
Stop!

867
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:53,199
- No.
- Please save us, Dae Gi.

868
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,399
It's only you and me...

869
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,440
in the world now.

870
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,339
For goodness' sake.

871
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:06,210
If you do this one more time,

872
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:09,049
you'll end up in prison for ten years.

873
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:25,259
Are you okay?

874
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,569
I'm sorry.

875
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,221
You're certain that there
aren't any other copies, right?

876
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:39,940
I wouldn't lie to you again.

877
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:46,580
Let's not see each other again.

878
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:12,980
Me?

879
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:18,920
She's new, but she's pretty good.

880
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,089
She's spying on them well too.

881
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:45,339
(Solution)

882
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,489
Oh, this new car smell.

883
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,040
Hello?

884
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:16,540
Sa Ra, your shirt is still in the car.

885
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:19,679
Tell me your address. I'll give it to you.

886
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:23,009
It's okay. It's on my way home.

887
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:24,750
All right.

888
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,299
Let's see.

889
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:46,600
Let's see the item that you
insisted on showing me in person.

890
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:50,940
You're quite impatient.

891
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,710
You're better looking...

892
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,409
in person.

893
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:02,889
Hey, lady.

894
01:02:04,589 --> 01:02:05,960
I'm Jang Hui Jin.

895
01:02:09,929 --> 01:02:10,989
Ms. Jang.

896
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:15,069
I'm higher in the hierarchy.

897
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,369
Don't be confused.

898
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:21,509
I thought...

899
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,610
we were partners.

900
01:02:25,339 --> 01:02:26,679
I worked so hard.

901
01:02:34,049 --> 01:02:37,520
I don't like being below someone. Goodbye.

902
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:43,489
Let's see your item first.

903
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:45,429
I get it. Sit down.

904
01:02:49,969 --> 01:02:51,999
To decide whether you'll be
my partner or subcontractor,

905
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,969
I need to see the item. Sit down.

906
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:11,388
What is this?

907
01:03:11,389 --> 01:03:14,860
Your trump card to speed up your divorce.

908
01:03:35,049 --> 01:03:37,449
- I missed you.
- Me too.

909
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:46,889
You look so pretty today.

910
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:48,889
I love you.

911
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:51,900
I love you too.

912
01:04:11,549 --> 01:04:12,619
Cheers!

913
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:45,119
Okay.

914
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,989
(Queen of Divorce)

915
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:01,428
Do you want to reveal
everything and get a divorce,

916
01:06:01,429 --> 01:06:03,488
or do you want to cooperate?

917
01:06:03,489 --> 01:06:05,698
- Today, CEO Noh Yul Seong...
- Are you okay?

918
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:07,830
Tried to save his wife from a terrorist...

919
01:06:08,299 --> 01:06:10,629
It's a bitter feeling to be
betrayed right in front of you.

920
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:11,798
Solution isn't done yet.

921
01:06:11,799 --> 01:06:14,738
This time, we're jumping into politics.

922
01:06:14,739 --> 01:06:17,238
Noh Yul Seong tried to
kidnap his current wife,

923
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,778
but he ended up kidnapping his ex-wife.

924
01:06:18,779 --> 01:06:21,649
I'm his ex-wife!

925
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,149
The election is just around the corner.

926
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,420
What on earth are you up to?

927
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:28,749
I told you I'd provide for you
and support you financially.

928
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,719
Why would I be dependent on you?

929
01:06:30,989 --> 01:06:33,818
I don't deal with nasty people.

930
01:06:33,819 --> 01:06:34,829
Kim Sa Ra!

931
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:36,190
I'll destroy everything!

932
01:06:36,529 --> 01:06:38,199
Hey. I'm not drunk.
