1
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,349
(E Ji Ah)

2
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:22,990
(Kang Ki Young)

3
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,460
(Oh Min Suk)

4
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,039
(Queen of Divorce)

5
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,678
Kim Young A likes you so much.

6
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,720
It's not your business.

7
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,520
Are you joining her camp?

8
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,690
- Why are you curious?
- Seo Yun is coming back soon.

9
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,160
- Can I meet him?
- Of course.

10
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,429
But we should be a family first.

11
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,330
Let's...

12
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,769
get married again.

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,749
(Hanjoo Party)

14
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,650
- Have you gone mad?
- Remember what I told you?

15
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,388
You would always be my first for everything.

16
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:35,120
Be my first again, if you will.

17
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,829
I even hate the idea of being the last woman for you.

18
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:39,730
Then think only about Seo Yun.

19
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,268
Imagine how badly Seo Yun must want to live with his mother.

20
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,540
You're not asking me for his sake. It's because of Ms. Kim Young A.

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,139
What's so bad about that?

22
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:51,468
Just think about winning her over to our side...

23
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:53,479
and building Chayul Town.

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,408
Seo Yun's life will be on a whole new level.

25
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,749
His life will be more than just comfortable.

26
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,150
Nothing will ever stop him.

27
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:03,149
Stop using him to get your way.

28
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,689
Gosh. You're driving me crazy.

29
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,159
How could you be angry about this?

30
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:10,459
You'll be happy because you'll have Seo Yun in your life.

31
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,028
I'll be happy because I'll have connections to Ms. Kim Young A.

32
00:02:12,029 --> 00:02:13,629
Then Seo Yun will be happy to have his mother in his life.

33
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,359
This will be a huge win for everyone.

34
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,929
Can't you put two and two together?

35
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,169
No, you're wrong. It will be a huge win for a greedy rat.

36
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,280
Gosh. Come on.

37
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:37,690
Seo Yun.

38
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:40,290
- It's me.
- Hi, Mom.

39
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:42,419
Did you have a nice day at school?

40
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:44,858
You'll go on a school break soon.

41
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:47,399
Yes. That's why I'm coming to Seoul next month.

42
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,500
When I come back, will I be able to see you?

43
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,669
Of course. We'll definitely meet.

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,539
I'll make sure of that.

45
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,810
Okay. I miss you so much, Mom.

46
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:05,410
Seo Yun. I'm sorry that we're apart, so you ended up missing me.

47
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:10,720
I'll call you again.

48
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:13,589
- I love you.
- I love you too.

49
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:30,109
Gosh. That's a load of nonsense!

50
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,310
Hey, this is absurd!

51
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,578
Sa Ra. Should I go out and buy you a doll?

52
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,380
We can put it up here and stab it with a bamboo needle. Yes?

53
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,560
What's up with that gaze of yours?

54
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:53,230
Don't tell me you're considering it.

55
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,329
No, right?

56
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,239
Is it because of your son?

57
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,810
Come on, Sa Ra.

58
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,250
Whenever I think about Seo Yun,

59
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,030
I feel like an awful mother who only cares about herself.

60
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,999
Then I feel like a crazy woman...

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,769
for getting tempted by his offer like this.

62
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:36,709
Seriously. I'm such a mess.

63
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,680
Hey.

64
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:52,849
(Episode 9)

65
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,469
Okay. Tell him not to be late.

66
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:07,539
Mom, I'm going into a meeting.

67
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,839
It's not just a regular date. It's a blind date for marriage?

68
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,010
Aren't you a bit too young to think about marriage?

69
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:20,180
Well, my mom kept pestering me about these dates.

70
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,050
I envy you...

71
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:26,920
that you have a pestering mom.

72
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:29,159
Ms. Kim Sa Ra?

73
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,929
Yes.

74
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,760
Sir, I got it. I'll give it to her.

75
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:35,229
Okay.

76
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:36,899
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

77
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,468
Is there a special occasion?

78
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:45,339
No. But even if there was a special occasion,

79
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:47,510
who would send me stuff like that?

80
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,510
What is it?

81
00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:01,420
How beautiful.

82
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,459
(From Noh Yul Seong)

83
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,809
Gosh. That was random.

84
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,010
Wait. Is something going on with you and Mr. Noh Yul Seong?

85
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,680
No.

86
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:25,110
- Return this.
- Yes, ma'am.

87
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,849
No. I'll do it.

88
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,219
(Mom)

89
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,860
Hello?

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,529
Who is this?

91
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,969
I see. I'm sorry.

92
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:27,010
Oh, right. You can make a phone call first.

93
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,240
No. I can't do it anyway.

94
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,450
I was calling Mom.

95
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,348
I see.

96
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,450
The machine always said the number didn't exist.

97
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,219
But someone has taken her number already.

98
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:41,189
I used to make a lot of those calls to my parents too...

99
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,589
when my parents passed away.

100
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:48,430
Well, are you all right?

101
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:51,070
Yes.

102
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,079
What is it?

103
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,909
It's fine as long as you're all right.

104
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:14,789
Well, you know, these flowers...

105
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:17,159
What do they mean?

106
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:28,370
Well,

107
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,680
this must be a delivery mistake.

108
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,750
I see. Okay. Have a good day.

109
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,119
Thanks.

110
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,930
Did you want to see me?

111
00:08:58,099 --> 00:09:00,569
Did you think this kind of move would work on her?

112
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,599
(Please tell your son not to send me his dirty flowers.)

113
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,108
Please tell your son not to send me his dirty flowers.

114
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:14,150
From Kim Sa Ra.

115
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,348
Gosh. This is embarrassing.

116
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,020
Are you naive or foolish?

117
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,118
You're the perfect prey for that audacious witch.

118
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,160
Mom.

119
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:28,559
Is there anything more important to us than getting the law...

120
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,060
passed about law schools to build Chayul Town?

121
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,440
(Successful Strategy for Law School Law and Chayul Town)

122
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,009
(Current Status)

123
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:44,379
(Expected votes with Kim Young A's support)

124
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,378
The person Kim Young A trusts and wants the most...

125
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,420
is Kim Sa Ra.

126
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,088
Why do you want to use Kim Sa Ra to get Kim Young A's support?

127
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,290
You must get her on board by finding dirt on her to put pressure.

128
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,458
I tried to take that path, but it didn't work.

129
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:56,889
Then I must take a different path.

130
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,359
And that path is Kim Sa Ra?

131
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:02,700
You know what? Don't even try to do anything. I'll get it done.

132
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,999
Do you think I'm doing this just to get her support?

133
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:08,339
Kim Sa Ra and Dong Gi Jun. These two...

134
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,739
started to investigate Na Yu Mi's case again.

135
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,009
That's good.

136
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:24,249
You don't have anything to do with Na Yu Mi's case anyway.

137
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,320
This is good?

138
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:30,560
Do you truly mean that?

139
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,660
What are you getting at?

140
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:39,069
Anyway, I'm the one who started the Chayul Town project.

141
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,400
So I'll see it through.

142
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,469
Let me handle it.

143
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,419
Hey, as for the things I told you to prepare for today,

144
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,578
bring the most luxurious and expensive ones.

145
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:57,719
They must dazzle her.

146
00:10:58,249 --> 00:10:59,320
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:10,729
Bom. What are all these?

148
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,499
They're for the first memorial service for Ms. Kim's mother.

149
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,339
She said she was going to do it alone.

150
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:18,940
Wait. You're going to load them into the car, right?

151
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:24,310
Gosh. Lawyer Dong.

152
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,579
- What brings you here?
- I'm coming in.

153
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,790
Where should I put this box?

154
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,320
That box? Put it on the chair.

155
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,390
Thank you.

156
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,400
Lawyer Dong said he had 15 years of holding memorial services.

157
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,639
Oh, right. That's the path her mother would enter from.

158
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,709
We must leave the door open.

159
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:52,239
I doubt that she knows the passcode.

160
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:54,140
I see.

161
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:00,410
First of all...

162
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,650
Red food goes on the east side, and white food, on the west side.

163
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:05,088
What about the order of dates, chestnuts, pears, and persimmons?

164
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,249
(Table setting for memorial service)

165
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,358
What? The order?

166
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:09,759
What was the order?

167
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,989
Are you taking an exam on the table setting?

168
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:17,469
When I do something, I tend to do my best.

169
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,069
As for the placement of the food...

170
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,199
and the order of the nuts and fruits,

171
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,439
they aren't even recorded in documents.

172
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,070
What was your mother's favorite food?

173
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,738
It was mung bean jeon.

174
00:12:25,739 --> 00:12:26,770
Give me that then.

175
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,009
Here.

176
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:34,079
- All right.
- What else?

177
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,820
After that,

178
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,950
- give me the seasoned vegetables.
- The seasoned vegetables.

179
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:41,689
The seasoned vegetables.

180
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,089
Put the vegetables on the ceremonial plate.

181
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:49,328
When you're able to free up your mind,

182
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:50,570
come back whenever you want.

183
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:52,800
I'll be right here.

184
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:58,609
Okay.

185
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,079
Ms. Kim.

186
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,009
Let's get to work.

187
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,280
- What should I do?
- You can get to work.

188
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:12,589
Hurry up. Come on.

189
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:18,489
Go on.

190
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,729
You got the expensive ones, right?

191
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,759
Yes, sir. I bought the highest-quality ones.

192
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,170
Did Dae Gi get off work?

193
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,200
He's probably investigating Na Yu Mi's case.

194
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,070
Yes. I asked him for his help.

195
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,939
I asked him to go over Na Yu Mi's whereabouts...

196
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,579
on the day of her death from start to finish.

197
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:38,379
If Noh Yul Seong isn't the culprit, who could it be then?

198
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:42,349
We must find the witness, but it won't be easy.

199
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,160
Gosh. It's so heavy.

200
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:51,089
I'm not late.

201
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:55,859
It's your mother's memorial service today.

202
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,969
I brought something for the service too.

203
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,539
What are you doing?

204
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,799
Isn't it obvious?

205
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,468
She's Seo Yun's grandmother.

206
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,170
Who's going to take care of her memorial service if not me?

207
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,709
Do you think my mother will want to eat the food you brought?

208
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:11,450
Take it back as you leave.

209
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:14,119
Sa Ra.

210
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:16,650
Can't we...

211
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
act like adults now?

212
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,589
Didn't you hear what she said?

213
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,759
- She told you to leave.
- What are you doing here?

214
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,229
Can you help me? I want to throw all of them out.

215
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:52,550
This is awkward.

216
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,589
Okay, fine.

217
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,290
I'll bring Seo Yun next time we meet.

218
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:00,800
See you then. I'll get going now.

219
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:08,270
Bye.

220
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,209
Bye.

221
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,390
The flowers and the food for the memorial service.

222
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:31,489
What are you getting at?

223
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,859
Oh, you... I guess she hasn't told you yet.

224
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:38,070
Go upstairs, and hear it from her. It will be fun news.

225
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,109
Let's go.

226
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,129
The witness...

227
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:15,070
What happened to the girl you mentioned before?

228
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,410
On the day of Na Yu Mi's death,

229
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,770
a part-timer came into the room. Remember her?

230
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:22,839
Oh, her. I've been watching her. She's been quiet so far.

231
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,578
She might not have anything to do with that.

232
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:28,150
Keep checking. So they don't get their hands on her.

233
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,450
Yes, sir.

234
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,119
You won't tell me what's going on?

235
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:39,430
He must want to use me to be on good terms with Ms. Kim Young A.

236
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,759
He's suddenly acting friendly.

237
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:45,430
Gosh. Seriously.

238
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,069
I wonder how any facial hair comes out through his skin,

239
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,669
given his skin is thick like iron.

240
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,770
Don't mind him.

241
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,139
I'm reminded of the bean soup your mother used to make.

242
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,348
- It was the best.
- It was really good.

243
00:16:58,349 --> 00:16:59,979
I had only heard about her.

244
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:02,079
I had never met her in person either.

245
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:05,950
Thank you.

246
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,420
This is my mother.

247
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,930
I see.

248
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,200
Have I met your mother before?

249
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,140
No, I doubt it.

250
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,509
But why does she look so familiar?

251
00:17:36,979 --> 00:17:38,120
Wait.

252
00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:43,690
Can you watch this with us, Bom?

253
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:50,600
This lady right here. Doesn't she look like her mother?

254
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:57,539
Mom!

255
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,609
Isn't that my mom?

256
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,479
She does look like your mom.

257
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,410
Right. Then listen to this.

258
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,950
Can you repeat that? What did you watch?

259
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,920
But my daughter was sent to prison...

260
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,619
- for something she didn't do.
- Mom.

261
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,129
If I tell you about the video, can you help my daughter?

262
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,389
Is this your mother's voice?

263
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,529
Yes. Why don't we talk in person?

264
00:18:22,729 --> 00:18:24,058
- It's her voice.
- I'll go to your office.

265
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,298
I can just go to the Southwestern District...

266
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:26,629
- Prosecutors' Office, right?
- What's all this?

267
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,899
She was an informant for Na Yu Mi's case.

268
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,840
But before that, can you give me your number?

269
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,680
My mother was the informant for Na Yu Mi's case?

270
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,279
Then her daughter who went to prison...

271
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,950
Hold on.

272
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,459
The date...

273
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,130
It was exactly a year ago from today.

274
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,360
Keep watching this video.

275
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:02,340
Right here.

276
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,110
Can you recognize this man here?

277
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,739
No.

278
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:12,579
Your mother came to the prosecutors' office to make a report.

279
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,610
All of a sudden,

280
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:15,650
she followed an unidentified man.

281
00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:18,749
- That's the day...
- I don't believe this.

282
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:22,459
I mean... This makes no sense.

283
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,090
Does this mean my mother didn't commit suicide?

284
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,988
Wait. It's too soon to say so.

285
00:19:26,989 --> 00:19:28,659
We don't have any proof that she was murdered.

286
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,558
He's right. She was too kind for anyone...

287
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,728
to hold grudges against her.

288
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:33,469
But my mother saw something.

289
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:36,538
My mother was the witness for Na Yu Mi's case.

290
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,208
No. Don't jump to conclusions.

291
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:40,239
If you do,

292
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,410
you'll get farther away from the truth.

293
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:57,219
Thank you for today.

294
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,529
Get home safely.

295
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,959
Stay strong.

296
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:05,729
This is just the beginning.

297
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:21,640
Noh Yul Seong.

298
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,779
The anonymous man.

299
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:42,330
Are the two of them related...

300
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:44,600
or not?

301
00:21:46,469 --> 00:21:47,499
Are they?

302
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,910
This must be it.

303
00:21:55,709 --> 00:21:56,840
This one.

304
00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:03,079
(The best tteokbokki in Seoul!)

305
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,590
(Danmuji and kimchi self-served)

306
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:15,330
Coming right up.

307
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,769
They're here. We're over here.

308
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,028
Here.

309
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:20,670
What were you up to?

310
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:23,268
We'll have one set here.

311
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:24,440
Got it.

312
00:22:26,509 --> 00:22:27,808
Here's the set.

313
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:29,580
- Here.
- Thank you. It looks great.

314
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,709
It looks good.

315
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,048
- Let's eat.
- Thank you.

316
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,120
- Let's eat.
- It looks so good.

317
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:46,059
(The best tteokbokki in Seoul!)

318
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:58,209
The prison officer's daughter, right?

319
00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:00,870
Yes. Hello.

320
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,080
It doesn't seem like someone from this area.

321
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,150
Has she said she was going to report someone?

322
00:23:10,249 --> 00:23:11,620
No.

323
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,059
When was the last time you saw my mother?

324
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,160
It was two days before she passed away.

325
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:26,330
I scolded her for grilling meat for the part-timer.

326
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,939
I told her taking too much care of the part-timer...

327
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,440
would make the other restaurants look bad.

328
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:31,339
Was there a part-timer?

329
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,680
She always called her, "So Hee," and took great care of her.

330
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:36,380
She said the girl reminded her of her daughter.

331
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:39,449
Do you have her number?

332
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,850
No. I only knew she was a student of the school in front.

333
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
Oh, right.

334
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:47,989
Here she is.

335
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,590
She brought her when we were eating together.

336
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:56,029
Right. Her last name was Bae. Bae So Hee.

337
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,200
- Bae So Hee?
- Bae So Hee?

338
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,670
Open up, So Hee.

339
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,969
Did you think I would not know about you meeting another guy?

340
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,709
Open up!

341
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:10,840
Open up, Bae So Hee!

342
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:12,509
Hello?

343
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,349
Please stop.

344
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,019
Don't you know how much I love you?

345
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,019
You're all I have.

346
00:24:23,489 --> 00:24:26,160
I'll call the cops. Leave now.

347
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:33,529
One, two...

348
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,370
Darn it! If you call the cops again,

349
00:24:36,469 --> 00:24:38,839
- it won't end with just your ribs.
- I want to report a stalker.

350
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,870
Gosh!

351
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,910
Hey, be ready for me.

352
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,029
Ms. Bae So Hee.

353
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,969
Is Ms. Bae So Hee here?

354
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,860
Ms. Bae So Hee?

355
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,090
Please open the door, Ms. Bae So Hee.

356
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,830
Ms. Bae So Hee?

357
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,170
Ms. Bae So Hee! Just a moment!

358
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,319
Who are you to come out from there?

359
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,390
Hold on!

360
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,009
I apologize, sir.

361
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:22,880
Are you still going to say that part-timer isn't related?

362
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,679
You said she got away as soon as she saw you.

363
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,180
She might have run away because of that stalker.

364
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,950
I apologize, sir.

365
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,160
But if he's a stalker,

366
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,670
he must be an expert at finding girls.

367
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,870
Well, yes.

368
00:26:47,969 --> 00:26:48,969
Call that guy.

369
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,100
We have to use everything we can.

370
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:52,769
Understood.

371
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:57,809
I told you I lost contact with all of my exes.

372
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,110
The reason I reached out a friend's friend of my ex...

373
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:02,279
was because of you.

374
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:05,749
I'm sure there will be at least one.

375
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,920
Someone who is still in touch with the disappeared Bae So Hee.

376
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,640
Did you think I wouldn't find you...

377
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,940
if you move and switch jobs?

378
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,150
Excuse me.

379
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:37,279
What are you doing?

380
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,620
Ms. Bae So Hee?

381
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,759
Is it you? You crazy lawyer punk.

382
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:48,200
What are you doing?

383
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,330
- Ms. Bae So Hee!
- Bae So Hee!

384
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,440
Ms. Bae So Hee?

385
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,350
So the prison officer's daughter is...

386
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,130
Yes, it's me.

387
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,130
But why did you run away?

388
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,430
Who did you think I was?

389
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,209
Are you being chased?

390
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,590
I'm sorry. I don't want to be involved in more.

391
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,529
What is that?

392
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:56,029
What don't you want to be involved in?

393
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:59,499
You know what my mom had gone through...

394
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,229
before she died, right?

395
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,969
Ms. Bae So Hee!

396
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,809
Ms. Bae So Hee!

397
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:13,580
Ms. Bae So Hee!

398
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:44,680
Darn it!

399
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,549
Who's that guy?

400
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,120
Bae So Hee's stalker.

401
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,620
He went mad even during the investigation.

402
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:55,690
He went half mad.

403
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,360
He looks like a dangerous one.

404
00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:02,499
Then So Hee should have asked for our help.

405
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,959
Why? What did she say?

406
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,200
She didn't want to get involved.

407
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:09,400
It seemed like she knew about my mother's case.

408
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:24,279
Will you give me your phone for just a moment?

409
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:26,920
- My phone?
- Yes.

410
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,620
Why?

411
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,830
All right.

412
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,059
- What are you doing?
- Just a moment.

413
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:46,769
Whenever you miss your mom...

414
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:48,809
Just a moment.

415
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,880
(Mom, Daughter)

416
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:55,450
It's your mom's new phone.

417
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,049
Whenever you miss your mom, dial number one...

418
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:01,789
and tell her everything you want.

419
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:06,028
Whenever you feel steam coming up from your head,

420
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:07,489
call you mom and cool down.

421
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,229
I'll wait for Kim Sa Ra's head to cool down.

422
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:36,259
(Mom)

423
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:41,229
(Daughter)

424
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:45,669
The call cannot be connected. Please leave a message after the tone.

425
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,069
You will be charged.

426
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,140
Mom.

427
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:54,239
What happened that day?

428
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,150
I will make sure...

429
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,549
to find out.

430
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,249
Thanks.

431
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,950
My head has cooled down a bit, thanks to you.

432
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,528
Call me when you feel down.

433
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:53,768
(Dong Gi Jun)

434
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:54,870
I will go to you any time.

435
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,419
The stalker boyfriend feels more suspicion.

436
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,579
It has to be conviction more than suspicion.

437
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,420
That will make him go wilder.

438
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:13,289
Understood.

439
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:20,659

(Please help my mom.)

443
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,160
Please help my mom.

444
00:33:55,499 --> 00:33:56,558
Please.

445
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,769
(Please)

446
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:08,809
I will meet you in an hour. Send me your address.

447
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,610
Bae So Hee will come to us.

448
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,279
Is she done with her hiding?

(Divorce Specialist SOLUTION)

450
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:30,730
She was...

451
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,430
very good to me.

452
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,109
But why did you run away that day?

453
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:42,239
I was afraid.

454
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,279
What were you afraid of?

455
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:52,750

(The day of Na Yu Mi's death)

457
00:34:53,819 --> 00:34:56,290
After getting off work at the tteokbokki place,

458
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,089
I went to my next part-time job.

459
00:34:58,759 --> 00:34:59,960
That was the start.

460
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:03,399
I went to set up the room for the guests.

461
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,330
That was when I saw a suite room for the first time.

462
00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:10,700
I got a bit excited.

463
00:35:35,629 --> 00:35:38,229
A family member of the deceased Ms. Na...

464
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,668
continued to request for a reinvestigation through a protest.

465
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:42,568
I got so surprised after hearing the news.

466
00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:44,068
Investigation continues...

467
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:45,640
What's wrong?

468
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,609
Do you know that person?

469
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:49,009
The woman that died...

470
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,779
didn't commit suicide.

471
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:58,649
Stop the party before I reveal these photos...

472
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,419
to your fiance.

473
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:05,120
When did you take these?

474
00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:09,029
Gosh. It's a nice photo.

475
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,759
Yu Mi.

476
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,500
My marriage isn't the world you think it is.

477
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,770
And these won't be enough to stop it.

478
00:36:20,169 --> 00:36:21,339
- Is that so?
- Yes.

479
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,439
Then how about the story with you and the five-member society...

480
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:28,210
offering bribes here and there.

481
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,819
Will that stop the marriage?

482
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,020
Are you insane?

483
00:36:38,189 --> 00:36:39,189
Hey.

484
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:43,399
The important part is in the back.

485
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:46,299
Get all of the photos and recordings...

486
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,629
from Na Yu Mi.

487
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:50,540
If she gets into nonsense, take care of her.

488
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,270
How far shall I take things?

489
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,649
Hey, there are so many ways to get rid of her.

490
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,680
Why would you ask me that?

491
00:37:06,919 --> 00:37:10,319
So she came to see me after that.

492
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,430
My mom went to prosecution.

493
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,859
Did you know about this?

494
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,798
Yes.

495
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:23,339
Did she go on her own?

496
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:28,810
No. She went with me.

497
00:37:34,509 --> 00:37:36,418
Mrs. Park, I'll go to the restroom real quick.

498
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:37,419
Sure.

(The day of Sa Ra's mother, Park Jeong Suk's death)

After coming back from the restroom,

501
00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:47,330
she wasn't there.

502
00:37:47,759 --> 00:37:49,060
I looked around for her,

503
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,329
and I saw her.

(Prosecution Service)

505
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,069
Whose car was it?

506
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:57,799
Well...

507
00:38:01,669 --> 00:38:04,109
It was the secretary of the son-in-law.

508
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,109
- Right.
- The guy in the hotel footage.

509
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:09,779
Noh Yul Seong...

510
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:13,649
Was the son-in-law not around?

511
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,390
Someone was next to her.

512
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,629
But I couldn't see the face clearly.

513
00:38:21,029 --> 00:38:25,029
So the hotel footage was all deleted, right?

514
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,870
Yes.

515
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,608
Please testify to the police everything you just said.

516
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:41,549
Will that make a difference?

517
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,980
You're the only hope I have.

518
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,789
First of all, leave the place you're staying right now...

519
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,419
before the stalker comes for you again.

520
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,818
Right. Let's do that.

521
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:52,560
We'll find a safe place.

522
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,270
Here.

523
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,640
Great work.

524
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:39,609
I thought I would get an apology. But it's an envelope instead.

525
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,040
I guess this isn't too bad.

526
00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:46,410
You can stop now.

527
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:51,149
So it ends as a termination of contract?

528
00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:54,290
If that's so,

529
00:39:55,089 --> 00:39:56,960
I'll choose the gift for resignation.

530
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,089
Put me in as a candidate too.

531
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,960
- A candidate for what?
- As a daughter-in-law.

My gosh.

534
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:10,499
Don't say that elsewhere.

535
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,039
Someone might think it's true.

536
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,109
Do I sound like I'm joking?

00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,449
- Are you getting off work?
- Yes.

00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,489
- Let's go.
- Hello, Chairwoman Cha.

541
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600

00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:48,040
Yes. That's right.

545
00:40:48,469 --> 00:40:49,540
Enjoy dating him.

546
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,040
He can date whoever he wants.

547
00:41:14,899 --> 00:41:17,099
(Gositel)

548
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,399
(3-da-gil 6, Tongin-ro)

549
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,509
Darn it.

550
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:37,259
So Hee decided to go to the police. Let's go.

551
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,660
This will do.

552
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:47,930
Let's go and get Noh Yul Seong now.

553
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:00,850
Am I a ghost? Why are you scared?

554
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,980
Were you calling someone you were not supposed to?

555
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,819
What's wrong with you?

556
00:42:06,919 --> 00:42:07,950
You're caught.

557
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,419
A lawyer.

558
00:42:14,489 --> 00:42:16,330
I'm calling because of work.

559
00:42:17,529 --> 00:42:18,969
Did he buy you this?

560
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,669
Yes?

561
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:23,500
I had it before.

562
00:42:23,899 --> 00:42:26,640
What did you do for those shoes?

563
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,779
You two have gone mad.

564
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:34,649
(Lawyer)

565
00:42:36,649 --> 00:42:38,049
I'll explain everything.

566
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,689
I'll explain everything.

567
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:41,149
Let me go.

568
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,560
Hey, did you sleep with him?

569
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,299
Let it go.

570
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,969
They said she just went out, but she's not answering the phone.

571
00:42:57,939 --> 00:42:59,040
Where did she go?

572
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,310
I'll try to call her again.

573
00:43:18,589 --> 00:43:20,889
The phone is turned off. Please leave...

574
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,529
a message after the tone.

575
00:43:33,509 --> 00:43:34,569
For goodness' sake.

576
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,680
Hey, So Hee.

577
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,589
(Lawyer)

578
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,819
(Lawyer)

579
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:59,230
Is there no other data left by the part-timer?

580
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:00,859
I checked everything.

581
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,089
Good. It's clear.

582
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,960
But she returned your flowers again.

583
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,169
Don't report something like that.

584
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:12,469
Kim Young A got selected as the party representative now.

585
00:45:15,939 --> 00:45:18,109
For goodness' sake. This is annoying.

586
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,250
Deliver the flowers.

587
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:25,520
To SOLUTION?

588
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,390
Send it to the presidential candidate for the next election...

589
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,129
under both my name and Sa Ra's.

590
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:36,529
Send new flower boxes to SOLUTION.

591
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,100
Okay.

592
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,250
Don't think about anything today...

593
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:57,450
and just sleep well.

594
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:02,960
Goodbye.

595
00:47:30,939 --> 00:47:31,980
Her birthday?

596
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,049
Phone number?

597
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,680
Sa Ra!

598
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,480
Sa Ra! Kim Sa Ra!

599
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,419
Sa Ra, are you okay?

600
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,649
You're fine. Relax.

601
00:48:15,819 --> 00:48:17,989
Breathe. Breathe slowly.

602
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,230
Breathe out.

603
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:31,000
Breathe in. You're fine.

604
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,120
Did you get to your senses?

605
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,089
How's your breathing?

606
00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:01,029
How much did you cry to experience hyperventilation?

607
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,319
What would we do without Bae So Hee?

608
00:49:24,589 --> 00:49:26,629
We should look for another way.

609
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:31,830
It's so unfair for my mom.

610
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,330
Stay strong.

611
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,640
To prove whether So Hee's words are true,

612
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,540
it could become a messy fight.

613
00:49:47,379 --> 00:49:48,649
Oh, wait.

614
00:49:51,149 --> 00:49:52,149
Here.

615
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:54,520
Thank you.

616
00:50:03,029 --> 00:50:06,100
But how did you come in?

617
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:07,969
Well,

618
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:12,000
I keyed in my birthday, 1214.

619
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,540
It's something I used before.

620
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,918
It's safe since no one will know.

621
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:26,049
Yes, only one person can think of it.

622
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:27,988
There's no meaning to it.

623
00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:29,390
Of course.

624
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,890
I'll see you leave.

625
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,160
I have a bad headache.

626
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,700
Never mind. I'll leave.

627
00:51:01,549 --> 00:51:03,589
The chess piece, which is our memory,

628
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,029
is still here because it's too much trouble to throw away,

629
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,100
and the fact that the entrance passcode is my birthday...

630
00:51:17,169 --> 00:51:18,669
doesn't mean anything either.

631
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:25,180
We held hands in the hospital room,

632
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,080
but you didn't fall for me.

633
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,850
All right. I'm fine with everything,

634
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,219
so I'll wait.

635
00:51:39,259 --> 00:51:41,430
But it's too hard for you...

636
00:51:44,129 --> 00:51:45,259
to suffer alone during this time.

637
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:54,830
Oh, you're here.

638
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:57,529
Why didn't you rest more?

639
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,060
I'm okay.

640
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,169
Thanks for yesterday.

641
00:54:02,899 --> 00:54:03,899
Sure.

642
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:07,210
I'm going to meet Na Yu Mi's taxi driver.

643
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,568
We need to solve that case...

644
00:54:08,569 --> 00:54:10,239
in order to find clues related to your mother's case.

645
00:54:30,259 --> 00:54:31,299
I seem...

646
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:36,129
to be a star sign that constantly feels sorry toward you.

647
00:54:38,399 --> 00:54:40,439
Don't be sorry to me.

648
00:54:41,739 --> 00:54:43,379
Then I'd need to understand you again.

649
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:46,879
Wait.

650
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,089
Yesterday, I was...

651
00:54:54,919 --> 00:54:56,319
too emotional.

652
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:00,660
Are you not today?

653
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,230
I liked you being emotional.

654
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:09,629
Yes, I liked it.

655
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,540
I'll go to see him.

656
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:23,680
So I won't feel sorry anymore.

657
00:55:38,259 --> 00:55:39,700
Oh, hello.

658
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:43,000
- Hey.
- Among the drivers,

659
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,339
is there anyone named Gong Deukgu?

660
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,568
Oh. Mr. Gong? He resigned a long time ago.

661
00:55:49,569 --> 00:55:52,279
Where will he be working now?

662
00:55:52,379 --> 00:55:55,980
I think he's hired as a driver for a company.

663
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,089
Thank you.

664
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:18,939
Is anyone home?

665
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:25,480
Is anyone there?

666
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:54,339
Mr. Gong Deukgu.

667
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,918
A driver who wears designer shoes that are worth 9,000 dollars.

668
00:57:36,919 --> 00:57:38,279
(Gong Deukgu)

669
00:57:55,899 --> 00:57:58,040
Get in. I have something to tell you.

670
00:57:59,339 --> 00:58:01,910
What are you doing? Go to the passenger's seat.

671
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,119
(Prime Minister)

672
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,029
(Congratulations on your election)

673
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,460
It's difficult for me to resign from SOLUTION.

674
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:27,069
But if you can appoint me as a freelance Advisory Committee,

675
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:29,500
I'll do my best to assist you.

676
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:34,838
It's nice of you not to harshly refuse my offer.

677
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:38,439
I'm sorry, but I have one condition.

678
00:58:40,649 --> 00:58:41,710
Right in my face?

679
00:58:42,509 --> 00:58:45,980
Let's hear what the scenario is this time.

680
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:51,160
Oh, Mr. Noh sent me a flower with your names on it.

681
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:53,489
(Noh Yul Seong and Kim Sa Ra)

682
00:58:57,359 --> 00:58:58,700
(Hanjoo Party)

683
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:02,129
I'll tell you my scenario.

684
00:59:04,569 --> 00:59:06,500
(Messenger Service)

685
00:59:22,189 --> 00:59:23,560
- Here you go.
- Yes.

686
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,859
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

687
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,858
It's him again.

688
00:59:27,859 --> 00:59:30,029
Maybe it's not a mistake.

689
00:59:33,029 --> 00:59:34,129
I'll take care of it.

690
00:59:34,399 --> 00:59:35,399
It's okay.

691
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,640
Put it on the table.

692
00:59:38,839 --> 00:59:40,540
It's nice to have some flowers in the office.

693
00:59:42,609 --> 00:59:45,379
Since I'm a bit distracted with my mom,

694
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:49,310
please make sure the client list is organized by the two of you.

695
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:51,950
Okay.

696
01:00:04,859 --> 01:00:05,899
What's wrong with you?

697
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,399
Aren't you sending the flowers away?

698
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:14,140
I'll just take them.

699
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,939
Noh Yul Seong sent them.

700
01:00:22,509 --> 01:00:23,680
He wants to marry me again.

701
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,549
Who? Noh Yul Seong?

702
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:30,390
So?

703
01:00:34,189 --> 01:00:35,259
I'm going to...

704
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
go back to his house.

705
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,680
(Queen of Divorce)

706
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,608
Stop it now. Don't mess with Sa Ra.

707
01:01:28,609 --> 01:01:29,980
I don't think about anything impossible.

708
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,250
I only think about something possible.

709
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:33,048
What's the end of this remarriage?

710
01:01:33,049 --> 01:01:35,750
I'm creating a solution for me this time.

711
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:37,418
The solution code is Kim Sa Ra.

712
01:01:37,419 --> 01:01:39,059
You're such an idiot.

713
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,188
I told you many times not to trust anyone.

714
01:01:41,189 --> 01:01:42,389
That's why you're a failure.

715
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:44,629
Then why do you trust Gong Deukgu?

716
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:45,730
Is he the right person?

717
01:01:45,731 --> 01:01:47,700
Was he Na Yu Mi's taxi driver?

718
01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:48,898
Is he the one who took my mom too?

719
01:01:48,899 --> 01:01:51,469
I think I saw those shoes before.

720
01:01:51,899 --> 01:01:53,540
I've kept my secret until now.

721
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,439
I'm looking for this man.

722
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:59,580
Isn't he Gong Deukgu?
