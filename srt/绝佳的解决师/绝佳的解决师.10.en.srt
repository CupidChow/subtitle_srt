(Queen of Divorce)

5
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,749
What's wrong with you?

6
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,020
Aren't you sending the flowers away?

7
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,730
I'll just take them.

8
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,929
Noh Yul Seong sent them.

9
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,830
He wants to marry me again.

10
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:16,769
Who?

11
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:19,880
Noh Yul Seong?

12
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,010
So?

13
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:25,249
I'm going to...

14
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,519
go back to his house.

15
00:01:37,329 --> 00:01:39,029
I'll make him go to prison.

16
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:41,630
Are you going to live as his wife again?

17
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:44,799
No, I'm going to trick him.

18
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,200
As if I became his wife.

19
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:47,299
My goodness.

20
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:50,638
This is too much. You know, right?

21
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,169
Staking everything. If we fail, it's the end.

22
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:56,340
There's no other way.

23
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,159
There is another way.

24
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,498
I told you we're starting from Na Yu Mi's taxi driver again.

25
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:14,659
If that were to work,

26
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,430
it should've worked when you were investigating as a prosecutor.

27
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:23,570
You don't believe in me.

28
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,040
No, I mean...

29
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,779
Professor Seo killed himself right after Na Yu Mi's case started.

30
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,220
So you got fired, and all stopped.

31
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,549
We are trying to reinvestigate, but all the clues are gone.

32
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,820
So,

33
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:42,889
what can you do in his house?

34
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,359
On the day my mom passed away,

35
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:51,869
I'm going to find out who was sitting next to her.

36
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,139
If that was Noh Yul Seong,

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,669
or if there's another person behind this.

38
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,179
What if you fail?

39
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:05,049
What's the end of this remarriage?

40
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,280
I don't think about anything impossible.

41
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,019
I only think about something possible.

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,700
Noh Yul Seong!

43
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:25,299
What's going on?

44
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:29,339
- Stop it now.
- Let this go.

45
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,769
Don't mess with Sa Ra.

46
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,439
Let it go. Aren't you letting this go?

47
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,049
Don't worry and leave.

48
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,750
There'll be no such thing as remarriage.

49
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,160
- Mother.
- Go back...

50
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,789
and tell her to stop being greedy to take over my house.

51
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,060
You should also...

52
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,329
keep an eye on your son.

53
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,630
So that he doesn't attempt to seduce Sa Ra.

54
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:10,679
Leave now.

55
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:23,660
Did you come to our office that day?

56
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,229
I saw you.

57
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,930
On the day Sa Ra's mother passed away.

58
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,269
Is it weird for a lawyer to visit the prosecutor's office?

59
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:38,869
You're trying to remarry her...

60
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,539
to hide the fact that you met her mom there.

61
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,010
It's impossible not to have a reasonable doubt.

62
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,579
Your imagination is immoral.

63
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,380
Oh, immoral?

64
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:52,490
I think you're very capable of it.

65
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:58,389
Wait. Hey.

66
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:02,560
Why are you so worked up?

67
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,930
Is there any good news that I'm not aware of?

68
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,810
Sa Ra.

69
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,420
Let's sit and talk.

70
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,860
Aren't you leaving?

71
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:46,778
I'm getting nervous.

72
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,810
Sa Ra,

73
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:51,680
what do you want to tell me? What brought you here?

74
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,750
Let's do this. Remarriage.

75
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,820
Good.

76
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,159
It is typical of you. You're straightforward.

77
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:08,630
But why?

78
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,170
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

79
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:16,700
You treated me like an irredeemable troublemaker.

80
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,950
I decided to only think of Seo Yun.

81
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:32,219
Will I have Kim Young A on my side?

82
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,359
I'll do my best.

83
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,788
Anyone can do their best.

84
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:39,529
We're professionals. You should prove it.

85
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:46,570
Never mind, then.

86
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:49,069
Let me meet Kim Young A.

87
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,240
Then, I'll trust you.

88
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,839
I'm afraid that if I feel sorry, I will stop doing this.

89
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:36,610
I'm sorry...

90
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,610
that I can't even apologize.

91
00:09:13,849 --> 00:09:17,890
(Divorce Specialist SOLUTION)

92
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,759
You said you had something to say, but what is this nonsense?

93
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,729
Are you resigning?

94
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,959
No, only for two months.

95
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,160
I need a vacation.

96
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:32,670
So why?

97
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,900
Are you burnt out?

98
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,570
Actually,

99
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,109
I'm remarrying...

100
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,849
Noh Yul Seong.

101
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
- Ms. Kim.
- Ms. Kim.

102
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,958
What's gotten into you? Are you sick?

103
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,290
This isn't right.

104
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,029
I'm creating a solution for myself this time.

105
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,729
The solution code is Kim Sa Ra.

106
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:05,868
Gosh, I disagree.

107
00:10:05,869 --> 00:10:08,270
We should follow the majority decision.

108
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:10,169
Wait. Where is Lawyer Dong?

109
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,570
Call him first.

110
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:14,940
I already told him.

111
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:18,050
How can you do this if you aren't insane?

112
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,209
No pain, no gain.

113
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,618
Everyone says you can't achieve it without going crazy.

114
00:10:21,619 --> 00:10:25,189
That doesn't mean you should go this crazy.

115
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,660
I'm full of dopamine now.

116
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:30,060
So please support me.

117
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,629
This is not a solution. It's a suicide bomb.

118
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,869
Let me listen first. What's your plan?

119
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,099
It's a grand fraud show for Chayul Law Firm.

120
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,810
First, I need to make Noh Yul Seong to trust me.

121
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,549
He must trust me unequivocally...

122
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,509
so that he won't have any suspicion of me having something up my sleeve.

123
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:58,920
It's quite surprising.

124
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,759
You managed to make plans with Kim Young A willingly.

125
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,989
Not willingly, but barely.

126
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:09,759
Did you tell her our situation? What did she say?

127
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,170
Ask her yourself.

128
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,570
She's here.

129
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,310
Ms. Kim!

130
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:20,369
Thank you for coming.

131
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,219
I need to congratulate you first.

132
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:31,920
Your remarriage.

133
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,530
Did you hear that I disagreed a lot with her decision?

134
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:42,430
Did you?

135
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,869
Didn't you know that I dislike you?

136
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,499
I'm ashamed.

137
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,810
But I still came here. That must tell...

138
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,739
how hard I'm working to recruit Sa Ra.

139
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:05,619
Anyway, let's talk about the Law School Act next time.

140
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:08,690
We should have a congratulatory party today.

141
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,859
Of course.

142
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:13,229
Let me fill your glass, ma'am.

143
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:22,599
Where are they?

144
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,570
On the second floor.

145
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,469
Chairwoman Cha.

146
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,310
Chairwoman Cha.

147
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,749
Inside, there is...

148
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,410
What are you...

149
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,290
Oh, you're here.

150
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,359
Please say hello. She's my mother.

151
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:45,829
Hello.

152
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,929
I'm sorry. I came to the wrong room.

153
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,940
I came to earn a favor from Sa Ra.

154
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,770
We'll invite you somewhere nicer next time.

155
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,739
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

156
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:11,849
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

157
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,140
I enjoyed tonight.

158
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,540
I hope you'll get home safely.

159
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,349
What should we do?

160
00:13:46,119 --> 00:13:48,618
Shall we reserve a hotel and arrange our wedding?

161
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,690
Forget that, and just sign the papers.

162
00:13:57,869 --> 00:13:59,969
(Remarriage Contract)

163
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,469
What's this?

164
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:04,369
A remarriage contract?

165
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:07,940
You're cute.

166
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,479
We need to officially register our marriage. Okay.

167
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,349
Kim Sa Ra is responsible for childcare. Okay.

168
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:19,218
Three million dollars for alimony in case of divorce? This is absurd.

169
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:21,020
I can't be kicked out empty-handed again.

170
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,660
- One million dollars.
- Forget it.

171
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,290
Two million dollars.

172
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,628
But it's under the condition of you...

173
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:28,530
cooperating in the Chayul Town plan.

174
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:33,229
Sign it and send it over.

175
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:35,440
Okay.

176
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:38,910
I'll get going.

(Search and Seizure Warrant)

180
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,909
Kim Sa Ra, you have been reported...

181
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,539
for violating the Attorney Law Act by handling legal affairs...

182
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,838
and referring a lawyer, despite not being a lawyer.

183

184
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:17,810
- Passing through.
- Passing through.

What about Lawyer Dong Gi Jun?

186
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,650
There is suspicion that he shared profits with you.

187
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:27,390
You know that is subjected to criminal penalties, right?

188
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,259
Let's start from that side.

189
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,039
Is this because you conducted the consultation?

190
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,879
Legal consultation is only allowed when one has a lawyer's license.

191
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,419
Since I always accompanied you, that's okay.

192
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,219
How about the accounting part?

193
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,619
It's clean.

194
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,759
If they issued a search and seizure warrant,

195
00:16:02,859 --> 00:16:04,829
it means the police have something.

196
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,060
What could it be?

197
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:11,400
So why were you so greedy?

198
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,169
Did you report us to the police?

199
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,310
Do you understand what will happen when you try taking Chayul Law Firm?

200
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:20,070
Are you blackmailing us?

201
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,280
I heard you two had something, so I thought you would intervene.

202
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:27,208
But I'm very disappointed, Lawyer Dong.

203
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:28,280
Please stop.

204
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,618
Stop what you're doing for everyone.

205
00:16:31,619 --> 00:16:34,790
Then, I'll resolve this situation.

206
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,209
Let's clean up.

207
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,790
Gosh. How long has it been since our last date?

208
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:14,459
I feel butterflies in my stomach, which I find funny.

209
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:18,999
Stop right now.

210
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,100
Stop what?

211
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,840
Chayul Law Firm is working...

212
00:17:26,469 --> 00:17:29,110
to suspend Lawyer Dong's lawyer's license.

213
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,910
- It's not me.
- Convince her.

214
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,850
Or else, there's no remarriage.

215
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:42,159
Are you trying to cancel our remarriage...

216
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,819
because of Lawyer Dong?

217
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:50,630
My co-workers in SOLUTION are against our remarriage.

218
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,870
Everyone is trying to convince me to stop,

219
00:17:56,569 --> 00:17:57,640
and honestly, it's exhausting.

220
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:04,080
There's no need to increase hostility in the midst of this.

221
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,680
I want to restart with support.

222
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,590
You're the only one who can make that possible.

223
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:25,299
Ms. Kim!

224
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,809
There's a fake account on the seizure list of our office.

225
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:33,869
What do you mean by fake account?

226
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,410
We never had such a thing.

227
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,508
Someone left it in the office.

228
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:42,279
I'll search for the CCTV records.

229
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,620
Ms. Kim, you need to see this.

230
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,559
The main board for the CCTV is gone.

231
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,629
They didn't delete the footage, but just took the whole thing?

232
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,729
They know...

233
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,370
that we have someone to recover the deleted data.

234
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,350
Why was the search and seizure only done on the first floor?

235
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:18,950
Don't you think it's weird?

236
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:21,788
What are you talking about?

237
00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:23,759
I'm searching the second floor myself.

238
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,288
Wait! Whose permission do you have?

239
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:28,360
Mine.

240
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,709
Let it go.

241
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:52,850
Why do spies always leave something behind?

242
00:19:52,989 --> 00:19:56,459
Is it because they're anxious about how they will be used?

243
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,159
We will file charges for trade secret infringement...

244
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,229
and obstruction of business. Be prepared to face legal action.

245
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,769
I salute your capability.

246
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:17,409
But Yul Seong and you don't match well.

247
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,450
You know that, right?

248
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,249
Were you his girlfriend?

249
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,620
Why? Did the chairwoman say she'd accept you?

250
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,759
Well, it depends on how well I do.

251
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,959
(Cashbook)

252
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,130
Why are you giving me this mission?

253
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:38,569
If you're not confident, don't.

254
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,069
Could I also have an opportunity if I do well?

255
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,940
Does this mean that?

256
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,080
It depends on what you think.

257
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,279
You're not obsessed...

258
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:56,850
with Mr. Noh, are you?

259
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,190
You go ahead and be obsessed all you want.

260
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,219
Get out.

261
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:22,610
Manager Jang was the culprit?

262
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,979
We won't need to worry about the police.

263
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,680
Are you sure you want to go to that house despite all this?

264
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,190
Reconsider one last time.

265
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:42,259
Don't become...

266
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:45,569
Noh Yul Seong's wife again.

267
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:54,640
We've always...

268
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,479
quarreled over the solution methods.

269
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,650
Right?

270
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,420
Right. Well, if that's the case,

271
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,959
I'll leave SOLUTION.

272
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:15,700
Won't your husband be bothered if we work together?

273
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,729
Aren't you the one feeling bothered?

274
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,709
You know that, and you're using this as a solution?

275
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:32,680
I just don't get it.

276
00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:35,620
I won't be able to congratulate you...

277
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,190
or root for you.

278
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:41,519
I'm off.

279
00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:01,039
Are you really going to be like this?

280
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,979
Where are you going without us?

281
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:06,049
Ms. Kim.

282
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,390
I can't agree with a solution that hurts and damages...

283
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:14,590

284
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,519
Whether it be body, soul,

285
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:23,059
and even promises. Anything.

286
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:26,569
I'll see you again.

287
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,469

288
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,650
As you have asked, we have prepared a separate room.

289
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,180
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

290
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,529
Hello, Chairwoman Cha.

291
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,110
Why is she standing before me?

292
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:21,110
Who let her in my house?

293
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,248
I told you.

294
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:25,249
She will be living with us starting today.

295
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,090
What's this?

296
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,120
Mr. Noh sent this to me today.

297
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:33,259
That is why I moved in.

298
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,768

You sign this piece of trash and call yourself a lawyer?

304
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,180
An alimony?

305
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:56,650
Just think of it as funds for lobbying.

306
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,620
That will make life easier.

307
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:03,090
I will head to my room.

308
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:37,289
Wait just a little longer, Mom.

309
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:49,969
Whenever you miss your mom, dial number one...

310
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,640

I won't have you at the same table.

because I can be with Seo Yun.

347
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:33,900
So that's the only reason you came back?

348
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:37,039
Then you two should share the same room.

But Chairwoman Cha, why did you ask me to do it?

367
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,120
You wanted to be treated like a daughter-in-law.

368

That's not it. You're doing this on purpose to get a hold on me.

380

Chairwoman Cha is someone who finds people suspicious all the time.

381

00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,589
Who could that be?

544
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,100
So you're coming back to SOLUTION, right?

545
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,569
I'll need to think about that.

546
00:42:56,469 --> 00:43:00,669
I just thought of a way to get Gong Deukgu to speak up.

547
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:09,049
If you agree to come back to SOLUTION, I'll tell you.

548
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,770
Hello.

549
00:43:28,899 --> 00:43:31,069
I got curious about something again.

550
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,069
Yes?

551
00:43:34,169 --> 00:43:38,540
Could you tell me where you were on October 31...

552
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,850
last year?

553
00:43:44,649 --> 00:43:46,149
October 31...

554
00:43:47,649 --> 00:43:49,460
Gosh. I can't seem to remember that day.

555
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:01,930
This man...

556
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:05,969
Isn't this you in the photo?

557
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,839
I don't think so.

558
00:44:13,879 --> 00:44:15,310
Please take a closer look.

559
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,950
I was quite surprised because you looked so much like him.

560
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:22,390
That's not me.

561
00:44:27,529 --> 00:44:28,660
I see.

562
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,529
I'm looking for the guy in the picture.

563
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,370
I see.

564
00:44:36,371 --> 00:44:38,270
I want to hear about my mother's last moment...

565
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:40,609
before she died.

566
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:43,080
I see.

567
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,379
I'm sorry I asked such questions.

568
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:55,250
Then I'll get going now.

569
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,879
- What did he say?
- He said it wasn't him.

570
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:18,140
Are you sure you'll be okay?

571
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:21,379
He will probably tell Noh Yul Seong or the chairwoman right away.

572
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:24,080
Well, that was the intention. That's why I showed him the photo.

573
00:45:26,419 --> 00:45:27,450
Be careful,

574
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:29,819
both physically and mentally.

575
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,259
She had security footage.

576
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,029
Your wife is suspecting me.

577
00:45:43,469 --> 00:45:46,040
My wife has been investigating her mother's case?

578
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:47,568
I'm not sure.

579
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:50,180
Anyway, if you give me two million dollars as I asked,

580
00:45:50,509 --> 00:45:51,680
I'll leave Korea.

581
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:55,410
Hey.

582
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,179
Do I owe you any money?

583
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,680
I kept my silence this time again.

584
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:01,089
I kept it a secret to the chairwoman all this time too.

585
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,020
Do you have the brain of a goldfish?

586
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:07,329
You're the one in the evidence video...

587
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,859
with my late mother-in-law on the day she died.

588
00:46:09,089 --> 00:46:11,258
You know what? The moment you talk,

589
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:13,398
you'll be admitting your own crime.

590
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:14,469
Don't you get it?

591
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:17,370
Just leave.

592
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,669
I'll call you when I'm ready.

593
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,049
That idiot.

594
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:38,060
Gosh, Kim Sa Ra.

595
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,029
She's been investigating this case behind my back?

596
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,759
You cannot meet with the chairwoman as her schedule won't allow it.

597
00:46:45,399 --> 00:46:46,399
Gosh. Come on.

598
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:48,770
What brings you here?

599
00:46:51,169 --> 00:46:52,939
Did you already get back together with Ms. Kim?

600
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,140
Are you here to congratulate me?

601
00:46:54,141 --> 00:46:55,669
The police want me to come in for questioning.

602
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,778
The chairwoman told me to do it. She must take responsibility.

603
00:46:57,779 --> 00:46:59,509
Is there proof that she made you do it?

604
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,479
You know what? Next time, date a man...

605
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,020
who tells you that you are enough and is happy with you. Okay?

606
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:09,290
Know your place. Got it?

607
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,310
Let's get that one.

608
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,640
You're home.

609
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,080
Yes.

610
00:47:34,149 --> 00:47:35,980
Gosh. Really?

611
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:42,859
Mom. Look at this.

612
00:48:28,029 --> 00:48:29,399
You startled me. Goodness.

613
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,579
There's a guy named Gong Deukgu, working for the company.

614
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,040
The team leader of transportation.

615
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:41,950
Yes.

616
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:44,719
Can you take a look at this?

617
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,088
This is the security footage from the prosecutors' office...

618
00:48:49,089 --> 00:48:50,589
on the day of my mom's death.

619
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,460
I didn't know my mom went there.

620
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,589
Really?

621
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,600
But why?

622
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,000
I don't know.

623
00:49:00,799 --> 00:49:04,600
But look at the man next to my mom. Doesn't he look like Mr. Gong?

624
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:11,910
I'm not sure. I can't really tell.

625
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,210
But how did you get this video?

626
00:49:18,419 --> 00:49:21,219
Lawyer Dong. He asked me if this was my mom.

627
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,419
Gosh. Come on. Are you still in touch with him?

628
00:49:25,859 --> 00:49:27,789
I kept thinking about it, but it didn't make any sense.

629
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,430
So I asked Mr. Gong.

630
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:32,500
But he said it wasn't him.

631
00:49:33,899 --> 00:49:35,000
Then it wasn't him.

632
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:36,799
Maybe, you're too sensitive.

633
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,339
Am I?

634
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,109
Come out, and have your meal.

635
00:50:08,169 --> 00:50:10,370
I ran out of sleeping pills in my room. Get some more.

636
00:50:16,509 --> 00:50:18,580
Is something making you anxious?

637
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,279
That's when people usually get insomnia.

638
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:22,779
How could I sleep?

639
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,819
When I have you in my house.

640
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:30,120
Right. This is what I heard. If people don't get...

641
00:50:31,189 --> 00:50:33,858
at least 7 hours of sleep starting at the age of 50,

642
00:50:33,859 --> 00:50:35,859
their chances of getting dementia will increase.

643
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:38,859
You should keep that in mind.

644
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:52,739
(Lee Jae Hyuk)

645
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,180
- Hello?
- We did it.

646
00:50:55,181 --> 00:50:56,580
They passed the law regarding law schools.

647
00:50:59,419 --> 00:51:01,188
- Is the plenary session over?
- Yes.

648
00:51:01,189 --> 00:51:03,588
It's been decided that there will be three more law schools.

649
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:04,789
If we get to build 1 of the 3 schools,

650
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:05,989
we'll be golden.

651
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:10,929
Good work. I mean it.

652
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,370
I'll come out. Let's grab a drink.

653
00:51:29,379 --> 00:51:30,419
It was passed.

654
00:51:32,149 --> 00:51:33,489
Good work.

655
00:51:38,189 --> 00:51:40,359
Good work, honey. I mean it.

656
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,529
I told you, didn't I?

657
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:44,200
She definitely helped us out this time.

658
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:48,830
Congratulations, ma'am.

659
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,910
Do you honestly believe that your contribution was critical?

660
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:57,079
Besides, has it been decided that we'll build one of the law schools?

661
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,008
Gosh, Mom. Why do you have to spoil the mood on a day like today?

662
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:00,810
It's not the time to give each other an attaboy and an attagirl.

663
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:18,460
I have you to thank, Ms. Kim.

664
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:20,599
Thank you for your effort.

665
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,929
I didn't do much.

666
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,000
I told you that this would happen anyway.

667
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,270
Right.

668
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,839
Are you casting me for a role in your grand scheme of deception...

669
00:52:31,239 --> 00:52:32,379
you're putting together?

670
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:36,048
To put it simply, yes.

671
00:52:36,049 --> 00:52:37,080
(The generation-changing Hanjoo Party of the nation)

672
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:42,020
The law regarding the law schools will get passed anyway.

673
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:45,489
- Really?
- Personally, I'm for it.

674
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,858
But I'm working on it behind the scenes for now.

675
00:52:48,859 --> 00:52:50,999
How come you said you were neutral about the law?

676
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,229
If I didn't say so,

677
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,899
many opportunists would have pestered me.

678
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,810
You know, we have our own scenario too.

679
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,710
SOLUTION isn't the only one with it.

680
00:53:02,669 --> 00:53:05,108
Is it safe to say that I returned the favor?

681
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:06,609
For helping me keep my children.

682
00:53:08,049 --> 00:53:09,548
You've done more than enough.

683
00:53:09,549 --> 00:53:11,648
But I will take a neutral stance...

684
00:53:11,649 --> 00:53:13,750
when it comes to deciding who gets to build the law schools.

685
00:53:15,189 --> 00:53:16,219
Yes.

686
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:19,989
My show must come to an end before that decision is due.

687
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,600
So Chayul Law Firm naturally gets eliminated from the list.

688
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,129
Yes. Bye.

689
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,810
Wasn't it obvious?

690
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,519
There was a lot of news coverage on the law school monopoly...

691
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,148
starting a few days ago. The tide had turned.

692
00:53:45,149 --> 00:53:46,688
That's how the law got passed.

693
00:53:46,689 --> 00:53:47,789
Sa Ra had nothing to do with it.

694
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:49,858
But still. The final selection still remains.

695
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,960
It'll be helpful to have her on our side until then.

696
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,060
Anyway, you're such an idiot.

697
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:56,430
I told you many times not to trust anyone.

698
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:58,359
This is why you will never succeed.

699
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:07,439
Then what about you? Why do you trust Gong Deukgu?

700
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,339
You...

701
00:54:13,009 --> 00:54:14,250
Did you think I didn't know?

702
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,319
- How much of it do you know?
- I know everything.

703
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,759
Do you honestly believe that he worked only for you?

704
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:29,830
You tell me that I'm an idiot and this is why I can't succeed.

705
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,398
Now, you must stop telling me that.

706
00:54:31,399 --> 00:54:33,029
You don't have the right to tell me that.

707
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,499
- Where are you going?
- To meet with my investors.

708
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,668
Today is a good day...

709
00:54:37,669 --> 00:54:39,339
although you totally ruined it.

710
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:45,180
That jerk, Gong Deukgu.

711
00:55:10,669 --> 00:55:12,270
He drank a lot as today is a good day.

712
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:15,540
I'll take it from here. You can leave now.

713
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:17,540
Okay.

714
00:55:18,379 --> 00:55:19,410

(Garbage disposal, next Monday at 8pm, Sinyeong-ro 24-gil)

721
00:56:52,299 --> 00:56:53,810
(Kim Sa Ra)

722
00:56:57,609 --> 00:56:58,609
Yes, it's me.

723
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:01,680
I need you to get ready next Monday.

724
00:57:02,149 --> 00:57:04,319
Is it what you expected? Is there something happening?

725
00:57:05,149 --> 00:57:06,520
That's probably D-Day.

726
00:57:07,189 --> 00:57:08,250
Okay.

727
00:57:09,419 --> 00:57:12,259
I mean... How were you able to predict this?

728
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,829
There's only so much Noh Yul Seong and his mother...

729
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:17,600
can possibly do once they find out that...

730
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:19,359
we are on to them.

731
00:57:22,669 --> 00:57:24,239
I guess moving in there paid off.

732
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:27,339
Do you see it now?

733
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:29,810
Yes, I do.

734
00:57:32,609 --> 00:57:34,479
- I'll see you that day.
- Okay.

735
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,080
Right. Continue to be careful.

736
00:57:37,419 --> 00:57:38,450
Okay.

737
00:57:52,629 --> 00:57:53,669
Over there.

738
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,640
Let's follow him.

739
00:58:38,839 --> 00:58:41,549
We'll reach the destination in ten minutes.

740
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:44,950
Then let's do it at the next traffic light.

741
00:58:47,549 --> 00:58:48,589
Okay.

742
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,239
Hold on tight.

743
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,499
Gosh. What was that?

744
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,628
Were you even looking ahead?

745
00:59:34,629 --> 00:59:36,838
How could you get your eyes off the road?

746
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:37,968
Are you all right?

747
00:59:37,969 --> 00:59:39,869
Hold on. Let me check on your back. Oh, no.

748
00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:41,639
- Gosh. Look at your wrists.
- Oh, no.

749
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,508
- Let me check on your wrists.
- Goodness.

750
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:45,409
Gosh. You're going to be okay.

751
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:47,410
You were going to Sinyeong-ro 24-gil, correct?

752
00:59:48,549 --> 00:59:49,580
Mr. Gong Deukgu?

753
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:52,179
Who are you guys?

754
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,390
Untie me right now!

755
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,290
Let's go.

756
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,088
- What are you doing?
- Gosh. Wait.

757
00:59:58,089 --> 00:59:59,119
"Who are we?"

758
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,189
Keep walking.

759
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,129
We just saved your life.

760
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,838
(I've arrived.)

761
01:00:10,839 --> 01:00:12,369
(Stay in the car.)

762
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,339
(Don't let anyone see you.)

763
01:00:26,049 --> 01:00:27,089
Watch it for yourself.

764
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:38,460
I told you, didn't I? We just saved your life.

765
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,799
Hey. How did you guys know...

766
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,500
What are you doing here, Ms. Kim?

767
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:49,910
Do you still not understand who's behind this?

768
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:54,350
Noh Yul Seong.

769
01:00:55,549 --> 01:00:56,919
Why did you do that to my mother?

770
01:00:59,049 --> 01:01:01,918
Your mother's death had nothing to do with me.

771
01:01:01,919 --> 01:01:03,460
You took my mother!

772
01:01:07,589 --> 01:01:08,629
That's because...

773
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,160
I was told to do that.

774
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:14,069
You were told to do that? By whom?

775
01:01:17,739 --> 01:01:18,770
That day...

776
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,238
Let Secretary Baek take care of the car.

777
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:22,738
There's an old lady,

778
01:01:22,739 --> 01:01:24,239
dressed in a purple jacket in front of the desk.

779
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,879
Yes. There. Go to the desk already.

780
01:01:27,009 --> 01:01:28,508
I took Mr. Noh's car to the office as backup.

781
01:01:28,509 --> 01:01:30,580
- Ma'am.
- Then he gave me an order.

782
01:01:32,219 --> 01:01:34,048
The prosecutor will be coming down shortly.

783
01:01:34,049 --> 01:01:36,450
- Please wait.
- Okay. Thank you.

784
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:39,588
Excuse me. Are you here to see Prosecutor Dong Gi Jun?

785
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:41,858
- Yes.
- You can follow me.

786
01:01:41,859 --> 01:01:43,390
- Is that so?
- Yes.

787
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:50,299
Gosh. Ms. Kim.

788
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:52,999
Afterward,

789
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,939
I was told to get out of the car in the middle of the road.

790
01:01:57,379 --> 01:01:58,410
By whom?

791
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:06,549
Mr. Noh Yul Seong.

792
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:17,929
That's all I know.

793
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:20,399
I don't know what happened after that.

794
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:22,569
Then what about Na Yu Mi's case?

795
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:24,270
You were behind it, right?

796
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:31,379
Who made you do it?

797
01:02:32,009 --> 01:02:33,080
Chairwoman Cha?

798
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,120
Can I...

799
01:02:39,379 --> 01:02:41,189
smoke a cigarette?

800
01:02:53,669 --> 01:02:54,700
Are you all right?

801
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,200
Noh Yul Seong was behind it.

802
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,609
Hey!

803
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:23,290
- Hey! Stop it!
- Mr. Gong.

804
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:48,549
No.

805
01:03:57,129 --> 01:03:59,299
(Queen of Divorce)

806
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:28,830
We must change the target.

807
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:30,599
We must corner them into the abyss of mistrust.

808
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,229
So they end up revealing each other's crime.

809
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:34,330
- What we need to do is...
- To make them turn on each other.

810
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:35,729
Then at least take some weapons with you...

811
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:37,468
because we're at war now.

812
01:04:37,469 --> 01:04:39,238
Do you still smell like food?

813
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:41,139
Did you know that we wear the same perfume?

814
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,870
You should focus on trying to get the stink off your son instead.

815
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,508
You were the one who tried to kill Mr. Gong...

816
01:04:45,509 --> 01:04:47,309
and gave out the order to bring Sa Ra's mother-in-law.

817
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:49,080
I wanted to ask you that.

818
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:51,218
Two million dollars were wired to Gong Deukgu.

819
01:04:51,219 --> 01:04:53,890
As money laundering was suspected, they're pursuing a certain law firm.

820
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,549
Gong Deukgu was your driver, Mother.

821
01:04:56,589 --> 01:04:59,258
All right. Don't fight now. Why don't you go together?

822
01:04:59,259 --> 01:05:02,689
I wonder which one of you the police have come to arrest.

823
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:06,006
