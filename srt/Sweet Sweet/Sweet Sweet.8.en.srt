27

To be honest.

28
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,233
Despicable matters.

29
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:59,600
How did Su Mu make it so natural?

30
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,807
This is my sister.

31
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,400
Sister as in the real sister?

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,066
No, that is not the point.

33
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:10,933
This is my first kiss!

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,033
He can even cause an accident at a beach party.

35
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:18,180
If we live under the same roof...

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,060
It'll... Oops...

37
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:33,133
That person is his sister?

38
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:37,406
And he kissed me in front of his sister.

39
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,533
Could it be...

40
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,966
he likes me?

41
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,466
I think perhaps...

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,900
Little crab, why are you here?

43
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:09,400
Hey, little crab.

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,300
Do you know what kissing feels like?

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,233
You definitely have no idea.

46
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:21,700
Because you don't have soft lips

47
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,200
Let me tell you.

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,600
The feeling of kissing

49
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,434
is refreshingly... sweet.

[Wei Lai Aviation]

51
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:39,666
Hello, everyone.

52
00:03:41,366 --> 00:03:43,891
Today is the celebration of Wei Lai Aviation Company.

53
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,461
At the same time, we have reached a strategic cooperation with the Seng Hai Company,

54
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,833
and will soon coorporate with Wan Xing Company.

55
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:54,243
In the future, we will work together to launch new flying products.

56
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:58,208
This is the joint effort of every Wei Lai's employees.

57
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:02,433
I wrongly blamed him.

58
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:05,100
I thought he was an asshole.

59
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:08,833
Do you think Su Mu was wronged?

60
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,033
Hey, little crab.

61
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:15,266
Do you know how it feels to be in love?

62
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,766
Judging from your appearance, you look like you have never been in love.

63
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:27,266
He also said...

64
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:31,033
later he will come to me.

65
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:35,633
Later means when?

66
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,700
Why is he coming to see me later?

67
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:44,366
Does he...

68
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:46,466
want to kiss me again?

69
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:49,280
Oh no, no... no...

70
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,766
Mu Mu, hold this one. Hold it...

71
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,800
Hey, Brothers, continue working.

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,833
My wife and I have to go out and get something.

73
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,770
- Oh, okay.
- Let's go.

74
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,490
Today, I announce that the new product line of the brand new model G101

75
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,561
has officially launched.

76
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:05,542
The person in charge of the new product line,

77
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:10,224
who is also the new co-chairman of our company is my younger brother, Su Mu.

78
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:12,586
Lord Su Mu is the younger brother of Chairman Mia?

79
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:15,600
Why didn't she tell us earlier?

80
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,006
He is rich and talented.

81
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:18,232
So handsome!

82
00:05:18,232 --> 00:05:20,566
Thank you, everyone, for coming today.

83
00:05:20,566 --> 00:05:24,116
In the new year, we will create brilliance together!

84
00:05:32,902 --> 00:05:36,566
De De! De De! Did you hear that?

85
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,974
They are not a couple but siblings.

86
00:05:38,974 --> 00:05:43,700
- I know...
- I told you that your future was bright!

87
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,600
Look at you now.

88
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,633
Your forehead is bright with luck in love.

89
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:52,233
I think your future is... stable!

90
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:54,166
Yes...

91
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:56,333
It's stable.

92
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:15,333
Why are you eating it by yourself?

93
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,200
Is there a rule that I can't eat it by myself?

94
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,766
Well, there is no rule.

95
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:22,366
But I haven't eaten it yet.

96
00:06:22,366 --> 00:06:25,033
Oh, then I will make another one for you.

97
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:27,266
You just have to feed me, one spoon.

98
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:31,833
Sir, you have drunk too much. Let me make one for you.

99
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,033
I said, no.

100
00:06:34,033 --> 00:06:35,500
I can eat yours.

101
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,440
Hey, what are you doing?

102
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,300
Hey, you have a little crab.

103
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,919
I think you look like a little crab, don't you be shy.

104
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,600
I'm warning you, if you do this again, I won't be polite.

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,566
I know you won't be polite.

106
00:06:47,566 --> 00:06:50,300
Being polite makes you a little crab.

107
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,566
What are you doing?

108
00:06:51,566 --> 00:06:53,657
- Let go!
- No.

109
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:54,846
I want you to let go of me!

110
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:56,971
Getting angry? Do you know who am I?

111
00:06:56,971 --> 00:06:58,497
I don't care! Let go!

112
00:06:58,497 --> 00:07:00,086
Let go!

113
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,366
What happened?

114
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:04,300
I dare you to touch her again. Let go!

115
00:07:05,066 --> 00:07:07,266
Mr. Liu, you are drunk.

116
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,566
You're the drunk one!

117
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:17,466
Chairman Mia, I have shown enough respect.

118
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:19,300
Is this the way you serve your guests?

119
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,466
To offend me for a waitress? Is it worth it?

120
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:26,257
Mr. Liu, the celebration tonight is very important.

121
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:27,966
Don't make any trouble here.

122
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:29,533
How important is it?

123
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:32,333
Aren't you just a company that makes lousy aircraft?

124
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,466
Without us, Wan Xing company to design for you,

125
00:07:34,466 --> 00:07:36,866
can your products be released online on time?

126
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:46,433
I am announcing now...

127
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,300
to formally terminate the cooperation with your Wan Xing Company.

128
00:07:57,234 --> 00:07:58,166
What are you saying?

129
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,833
Don't you understand?

130
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,266
Get lost now!

131
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:05,700
Sure.

132
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:08,533
Remember this!

133
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,239
Let's go!

134
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:17,433
Are you okay?

135
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:26,033
That's it for the celebration tonight.

136
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:27,600
You're all dismissed.

137
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,150
Why did he do that?

138
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,904
Mu Mu, I'll accompany the uncles to go out for a drink.

139
00:08:52,904 --> 00:08:54,484
Clean this up quickly.

140
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:56,927
Remember to send De De home later.

141
00:08:56,927 --> 00:09:00,433
- No problem!
- All right. Wifey, I'm leaving now.

142
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:07,866
Hey, Mia, your dress looks quite nice.

143
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:09,966
It's okay, but a little troublesome.

144
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,133
So I changed it right after the celebration.

145
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:18,200
The celebration was going well today until that issue happened.

146
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,300
Don't worry about Liu Tai. I'll fix it.

147
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,433
Then I have to thank you.

148
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,733
Well... I'll go first.

149
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,136
I have to send Mr. Yamanaka back.

150
00:09:28,136 --> 00:09:29,566
Then, be careful on your way.

151
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:33,233
Su Mu, I'm leaving now.

152
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:39,678
Let's go.

153
00:09:39,678 --> 00:09:40,900
Oh, it's okay.

154
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,072
I'll wait for Wang Yanyi to send me.

155
00:09:43,072 --> 00:09:45,492
Sure, well...

156
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:50,182
You can leave first.

157
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,466
I'll talk to you about your matters later. I am a little tired now.

158
00:09:53,466 --> 00:09:54,656
Bye.

159
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:08,133
The number you dialed is unavailable.

160
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,460
Please call again later.

161
00:10:19,466 --> 00:10:21,333
We are going home, De De.

162
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:23,334
Did you fall asleep?

163
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,233
The north gate is closed. Use the south gate. Quick, quick.

164
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:29,629
Sure.

165
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,366
We are leaving.

166
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:40,033
Oh, it's finally over.

167
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,866
Let's go, Su Mu.

168
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,379
What's going on? Let's go.

169
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:50,733
It's nothing. Let's go.

170
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,000
Where's the car?

171
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:08,233
Where's my phone?

172
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,300
Xiao Zhang, put on some music.

173
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,166
♫ Hello ♫

174
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,900
♫ It's me ♫

175
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:16,900
♫ I was wondering if after all these years should last ♫

176
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:19,733
♫ to go over... ♫

177
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:30,000
Sorry, I am late.

178
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,850
But my heart reached early.

179
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,933
Again. Have some wine.

180
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:35,466
I'm speechless.

181
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:38,900
What is going on with Su Mu?

182
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,539
Because of a girl, he lost eight million.

183
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:44,266
What's the matter?

184
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,523
Ah... Nothing. It's nothing.

185
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:49,166
Is he a human being? He is an asshole!

186
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:52,800
Other than us, no one can make such stupid designs for him.

187
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,900
Don't come to me and beg on your knees later.

188
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,166
I'll never forgive them.

189
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,801
Wait a minute. I will be back soon.

190
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,966
Yo, Mr. Liu! You guys are drinking here.

191
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:06,666
Who are you?

192
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,767
- I am from Wei Lai Company.
- It's you.

193
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:12,666
Aren't you Su Mu's follower?

194
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:21,483
We have arrived, De De.

195
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:23,583
Get out of the car.

196
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,700
Get out!

197
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,666
De De!

198
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,631
Why... clothes?

199
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:34,166
De De? De De?

200
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:36,476
Hey, this... I lost her...

201
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:40,133
De De? De De?

202
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:44,100
Tian Tiande! Tian Tiande, are you back?

203
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,071
De De?

204
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,233
Mu Mu, I'm here.

205
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,366
De De!

206
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:58,400
Where did you go? I-I-I thought you were in the car.

207
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,966
I never thought that it was just a shirt.

208
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:01,900
I thought you were missing.

209
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,400
Hey, what are you saying? How can an adult like me be missing?

210
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,366
I was in her...

211
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:33,039
Go home early.

212
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,960
Ah, thank you.

213
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,883
Let's go.

214
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,351
They are fighting.

215
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:49,654
He is bleeding.

216
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:51,715
- How dare you hit me?
- I am kicking your ass!

217
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:54,104
- What's going on?
- It's nothing to do with you!

218
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:55,418
Get lost!

219
00:14:55,418 --> 00:14:58,385
- Do you think it's fair for four people to fight one?
- You leave now.

220
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:01,179
- I will beat you up too, if you don't stop talking.
- Bring it.

221
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:15,870
Here.

222
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:22,500
Why did she come back in your car today?

223
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,333
I met her alone by the roadside and you said she was my neighbor.

224
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,733
So I sent her back.

225
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,500
I didn't know her when I lived here previously.

226
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,333
You just moved here.

227
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,600
How did you get to know her?

228
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:39,733
Because I wanted to eat the ice cream she made.

229
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,495
She was the one who made you ice cream?

230
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:44,128
Yes.

231
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:47,487
She came here to make it every day?

232
00:15:49,133 --> 00:15:51,733
Only making ice cream?

233
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,466
You kissed her just now!

234
00:16:06,714 --> 00:16:09,333
Why did you bring a little crab back?

235
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:13,033
He is my good friend and wanted to follow me back.

236
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,166
You have a good relationship with Su Mu's sister now.

237
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,166
You came back in her car.

238
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,966
Not at all.

239
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:23,500
I'm not close to his sister.

240
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,300
We ran into each other coincidentally on the road.

241
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,266
She didn't say a word in the car.

242
00:16:29,266 --> 00:16:31,033
It was so embarrassing.

243
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:33,400
Didn't Su Mu say anything?

244
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,866
What could he say?

245
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:36,466
He called me.

246
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:38,333
I didn't even answer.

247
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,500
We don't even have each other's Wechat ID.

248
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,750
You two haven't even had each other's WeChat ID after this long?

249
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,766
Yes.

250
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:49,666
I used to think that you were just a big kid.

251
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,500
Didn't understand these things at all.

252
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,350
I didn't expect you to do that today.

253
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:58,433
- You got a problem with that?
- I think the girl was also embarrassed.

254
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:01,966
It seems that she didn't expect that coming from you.

255
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:03,599
Right.

256
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:05,700
You agree?

257
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,600
I mean you were so reckless like that.
[Searching: DeDeHappy] [Weibo: Invincible Beautiful Girl]

258
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,233
- In the future, you should take note of the occasion.
- Okay.
[Friend Request: I am Su Mu.]

259

Mu Mu! Tang Mu Mu!

260
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,355
Is your mouth consecrated?

261
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,466
He added me.

262
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:26,866
You see, he added me.

263
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:29,366
- Added me!
- He added you!

264
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:31,133
Don't! Don't!

265
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,066
We are girls. We need to be more reserved.

266
00:17:33,066 --> 00:17:35,035
Just let him wait.

267
00:17:35,035 --> 00:17:37,583
Yes, let him wait for a while.

268
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:42,563
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Done waiting!

269
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:46,566
- That's it?
- It's almost done.

(Looking through her WeChat Moments timeline)

271
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:58,100
What did he say?

272
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,266
He isn't saying anything.

273
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:03,233
Keep looking.

274
00:18:09,366 --> 00:18:11,333
There is still nothing at all!

275
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,833
He hasn't posted anything.

276
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:28,233
I'll go back first if there is nothing.

277
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,266
Hey, you won't stay here anymore?

278
00:18:30,266 --> 00:18:34,333
Forget it! I don't think I can stay here anymore!

279
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,421
My studio is almost done.

280
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,133
I'm going to retreat from now on and will not go back to the company.

281
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:48,200
You can go wherever you like.

282
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,833
Anyway, I haven't been able to control you since you were young.

283
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,566
You figure it out yourself.

284
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,433
By the way, don't forget to handover to the company tomorrow.

285
00:18:55,433 --> 00:18:56,833
Understood.

286
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,666
I am leaving.

287
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:09,533
Mu Mu, is it... he added me...

288
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,666
Should I send him the first message?

289
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,117
Yeah, you send the first one.

290
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:15,277
I'll send it now.

291
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,410
Ah... I am doomed, Mu Mu... I...

292
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,900
I sent a "Hi or Not" sticker.

293
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,100
Withdraw it.

294
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,005
No, I can't withdraw it.

295
00:19:29,005 --> 00:19:33,333
If I withdraw it, it shows that I am nervous and my hands are shaking.

296
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,450
It cannot be withdrawn.

297
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:43,151
How did she know that I am looking through her "Moments."

298
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:47,154
He answered me.

299
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:48,244
What did he send back?

300
00:19:48,244 --> 00:19:49,900
He sent...

301
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,174
He replied, "Um"!

302
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:54,200
What does that mean?

303
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,500
He meant that he is saying "Hi," a super "Hi!"

304
00:20:01,396 --> 00:20:03,500
Wake up!

305
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,700
You continue to chat. I'm leaving now.

306
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,100
Ah! No way, Mu Mu!

307
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,333
You have to advise me.

308
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,292
No, my heart can't take it.

309
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:15,900
I am leaving.

310
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,966

311
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,600
Be careful!

312
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,433
Okay.

313
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,537
Let's go to the mountain and talk.

314
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:01,833
Let's go to the mountain and talk.

315
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:08,933
Let's go to the mountain and talk.

316
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,461
Go to the mountain?

317
00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:14,511
Why do you want to go to the mountain?

318
00:21:14,511 --> 00:21:17,096
Go to the mountain...

319
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:27,116
Why go to the mountain?

320
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:30,016
Why go to the mountain?

321
00:21:32,238 --> 00:21:33,480
Are you going?

322
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,800
Little crab, should I go?

323
00:21:36,391 --> 00:21:38,552
You are not moving. Does that mean we shouldn't go?

324
00:21:38,552 --> 00:21:40,833
What's wrong if I go? It only takes two or three minutes.

325
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,033
If we don't go, doesn't it seem that I am overthinking?

326
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,552
So we should go, right?

327
00:21:44,552 --> 00:21:46,230
We should go.

328
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,566
Mom and dad, you guys are back.

329
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,633
Are you going out?

330
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,966
Yes, I am going out.

331
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:22,216
Where are you going after such a tiring day?

332
00:22:23,933 --> 00:22:25,700
Hey, a friend of mine has broken up.

333
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,833
He is very sad now and crying on the mountain alone.

334
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,333
I pity him. I have to console him.

335
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,700
Then, you go.

336
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,133
Hey, wait!

337
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:38,633
How do you console him since you have never been in love?

338
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:40,366
I just comfort him.

339
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:44,092
Isn't it okay for me to accompany him? Such a simple matter.

340
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:45,686
Mom and Dad, I'm leaving.

341
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:48,033
Hey, be careful!

342
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,266
Ah... I am so tired. I am going upstairs.

343
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:27,933
Su Mu, where are you?

344
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:29,700
I seem to be lost.

345
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,400
This is not the same as before.

346
00:24:01,466 --> 00:24:03,366
This is nice!

347
00:24:03,366 --> 00:24:05,666
Did you build this?

348
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,833
It's done so quickly.

349
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:12,333
It looks good from the outside.

350
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:15,300
But the interior renovation is not very good.

351
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,233
The overall color is too dark. It's missing color.

352
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:19,804
This is my new studio.

353
00:24:19,804 --> 00:24:23,240
In the future, you can come here to make me ice cream.

354
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:27,133
Ah... Did you build the house according to my drawing?

355
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:31,100
Or did you specially build it for me?

356
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,790
This house is built exactly like what I thought.

357
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,733
He must have used my creativity

358
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:05,466
but is embarrassed to say it.

359
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:25,489
Thank you.

360
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,800
Oh no! My motorbike!

361
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,433
Are you stupid?

362
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:50,253
What's wrong?

363
00:25:50,253 --> 00:25:51,900
Moving your motorbike in the heavy rain.

364
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,590
Which is more important, the motorbike or you?

365
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,200
Dry yourself quickly. Don't catch a cold.

366
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:38,600
Hey, Mom?

367
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,200
How is your friend? Did he calm down?

368
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,833
He keeps crying. He cries even worse when it rains.

369
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:47,433
Then, you send him home quickly.

370
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,125
I'm at his home.

371
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,586
Then, we'll wait for you to come back.

372
00:26:51,586 --> 00:26:53,758
Hey, don't wait for me. You go to sleep first.

373
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,203
Be careful!

374
00:26:55,203 --> 00:26:56,265
Ah! Okay.

375
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:57,500
Bye-bye.

376
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,133
Bye-bye.

377
00:27:24,403 --> 00:27:26,803
Let's go to the mountain and talk.

378
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,600
Let's go to the mountain and talk.

379
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:53,839
Let's go to the mountain and talk.

380
00:30:08,794 --> 00:30:13,413
♫ In the season, I got to know you ♫

381
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:18,233
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

382
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,788
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

383
00:30:21,788 --> 00:30:24,014
♫ Inadvertently ♫

384
00:30:24,014 --> 00:30:29,970
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

385
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:37,512
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

386
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:43,727
♫ I can always protect you ♫

387
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:50,790
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

388
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,907
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

389
00:30:54,907 --> 00:31:02,862
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

390
00:31:04,385 --> 00:31:11,317
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously into the night sky ♫

391
00:31:11,317 --> 00:31:18,251
♫ That innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

392
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:26,075
♫ You must have faith that we can be together, smiling ♫

393
00:31:26,075 --> 00:31:32,252
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
