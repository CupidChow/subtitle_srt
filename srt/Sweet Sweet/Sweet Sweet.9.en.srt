♫ I can't help ♫

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,700
Mu Mu said the relationship between me and Su Mu is stable.

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,300
I'd say, right, it's stable.
I… I…

26
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,400
He added me.

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,104
- He added me.
- I have never been so anxious

28
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:02,095
wanting to read messages that people sent to me.

29
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:03,667
The voice messages he sent,

30
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:06,133
I've listened to them many times.

31
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:08,466
What does he want to do?

32
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:09,800
I must go.

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,814
It seems that I'm over thinking.

34
00:02:11,814 --> 00:02:13,033
I'm not afraid.

35
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,533
But why did I accidentally,

36
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:17,366
right in his mountain top little hut,

37
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:19,533
fell asleep.

38
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,966
Get up if you are awake.

39
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:50,700
All-All right.

40
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:25,776
Are you dumb? Are cars or humans more important?

41
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,633
That…

42
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:46,933
I fell asleep last night.

43
00:05:46,933 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:56,066
Hey, I'm talking to you.

45
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,000
Can't hear.

46
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,733
Apologized for nothing.

47
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:07,400
But I fell asleep last night.

48
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,166
I suppose nothing happened.

49
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,533
Fortunately, I slept on the sofa.

50
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,700
What if I slept on the bed?

51
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,434
Would he have come into bed?

52
00:06:17,434 --> 00:06:19,140
I wouldn't.

53
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:28,333
Today's weather is really nice.

54
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,066
Look at the blue sky and white clouds.

55
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:37,466
Yo, the young couple has reconciled?

56
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:44,933
Why don't you explain? People think that we are a real couple.

57
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,633
What others think is their business.

58
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,400
Whether it is or not is our business.

59
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,800
That's true. But don't you think that we are.

60
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,030
- Watch the road.
- Okay.

61
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:11,933
So… at 7:00 tomorrow night, our agreement resumes.

62
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,433
Okay. Then I'll go back first.

63
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:15,766
You go back quickly.

64
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:18,066
Be careful on the road.

65
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:26,533
Are you afraid of me falling?

66
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:27,480
It's not that…

67
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,703
Hurry up, go back.

68
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:30,833
I-I'll go too.

69
00:07:33,133 --> 00:07:35,533
What stupid thing did I say?

70
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,700
So embarrassing.

71
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:57,100
Dad.

72
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:17,866
What did you do?

73
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:21,800
Mom, you scared me.

74
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,645
Why are you in my room?

75
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:26,284
You didn't come back last night.

76
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,833
Mom, why is your skin so good?

77
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,366
So young and fine.

78
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,866
Extraordinarily beautiful today.

79
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:41,033
I know I look good.

80
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:44,833
Tell me honestly. What did you do last night?

81
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,966
What do you want me to be honest about?

82
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:50,000
I chatted with my good friend.

83
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,833
While we were chatting, I fell asleep.

84
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,600
Why didn't you come home?

85
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,570
Mom, how old am I? I'm already 22 years old.

86
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,596
Isn't it normal to stay over at a friend's house?

87
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,400
You're so daring. Not controlled for a few days, you dare to not come back at night.

88
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:07,166
I know, my friend broke up and was in a bad mood.

89
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,800
I watched the stars with him and his mood became better.

90
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:14,500
Then, the storm came. That's why I didn't come back.

91
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,111
Watching stars.

92
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:19,652
For a breakup, you should go and play hard.

93
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:21,366
You watch the stars when you're in love.

94
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:22,766
You are a master.

95
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:26,366
I didn't know. I haven't been in a relationship.

96
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,082
I know you don't understand.

97
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:29,333
You're dating every day.

98
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:32,035
I don't even know where your boyfriend is.

99
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:38,333
My boyfriend… is in the future.

100
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,012
Future?

101
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:43,666
I don't think you have a future.

102
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,933
Hey, let me tell you.

103
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,800
You can't be like this anymore, not returning home at night.

104
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,143
Okay…

105
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:51,110
I got it, Mom.

106
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:56,700
Oh, watching stars.

107
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,833
It's been a long time since your dad and I watched the stars

108
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,000
No problem. I'll take you to Inner Mongolia.

109
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:04,202
Let's go to Inner Mongolia to watch the stars.

110
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:06,633
Your dad and I won't bring you along.

111
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:08,400
Okay, fine. Don't bring me… Don't bring me…

112
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,360
I'll stop talking to you. I'll go take a bath.

113
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,167
I have to help Li Di's friend with his proposal.

114
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:13,833
I couldn't make it yesterday.

115
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,833
Hurry up, go. You stink.

116
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:18,521
How fragrant!

117
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:21,133
I have a body scent, okay?

118
00:10:25,633 --> 00:10:27,900
Wait until…

119
00:10:59,266 --> 00:11:01,266
Not leaving yet? Why are you moving so slow?

120
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:03,400
I'll go now.

121
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,340
I was just thinking that you'll be arriving soon.

122
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,802
Hey. After the new product concept was launched at the conference,

123
00:11:22,802 --> 00:11:24,400
it received a very good response.

124
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,033
But a lot of people are watching.

125
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:29,066
We need to push forward our timeline.

126
00:11:29,066 --> 00:11:32,033
I haven't rested for a few days due to this.

127
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:33,366
Same as Su Mu.

128
00:11:33,366 --> 00:11:35,533
How has he been doing recently?

129
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:37,587
My friend just returned.

130
00:11:37,587 --> 00:11:39,766
Why not… bring him over to have a check-up?

131
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:42,803
He completed the work for the chip quite smoothly.

132
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:45,966
After that situation, it's never happened again.

133
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:48,265
Did he take any medicine?

134
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:49,567
Medicine?

135
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,517
He didn't take any at that time.

136
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:53,633
But he likes to eat ice cream recently.

137
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:58,184
He said that his mood will become better after eating ice cream.

138
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,833
After all, this is his psychological problem.

139
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:03,049
If he can find a solution,

140
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:05,766
it's better than taking medicine.

141
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:08,833
But losing Liu Tai as a partner…

142
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,600
Our exterior design...

143
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,400
will be in trouble.

144
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,800
Liu Tai is really unlikeable.

145
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,233
But his dad has the top technology in this industry.

146
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,900
Hey, if this really doesn't work, I'll talk to his dad.

147
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:25,466
We've collaborated before anyway.

148
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,301
- That's the only way.
- Um…

149
00:12:27,301 --> 00:12:30,400
This time, I'll have to trouble you again.

150
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,700
What are we? If I don't help you, who should I help?

151
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,033
Do you want to help me or Su Mu?

152
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:39,993
I'll help both.

153
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:43,366
Hey, you're both here.

154
00:12:43,366 --> 00:12:46,060
Why were you at the police station last night?

155
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,900
Yesterday, when I went drinking, I met Liu Tai. We had a fight.

156
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,600
Why?

157
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,200
He scolded Su Mu. Scolded us, Wei Lai.

158
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,966
I had to beat him up.

159
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,800
That's it. We were discussing just now about speaking to him again.

160
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:04,933
It's out of play now.

161
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:07,533
- I'll apologize to him.
- He is not a reasonable person either.

162
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:09,600
If you go, he will only beat you up a few times.

163
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,800
Let's think of other ways.

164
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:17,233
Actually, I had no choice.

165
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:19,166
You all were not there.

166
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,433
If you're there listening to what he said, you wouldn't have been able to take it either.

167
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:24,066
You would also beat him up.

168
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:25,500
You…

169
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,233
Did you beat him or the other way around?

170
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:30,033
Two on four.

171
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:32,966
You didn't see Liu Tai's face. It's like a pig head.

172
00:13:32,966 --> 00:13:36,366
Two on four? Su Mu was also there?

173
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:39,666
He wasn't. We met a little brother and he helped.

174
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:43,153
That's good. I was scared to death.

175
00:13:43,153 --> 00:13:46,166
- Good?
- Yeah.

176
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,333
I'm like this…

177
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:52,800
You two treat us so differently.

178
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,766
Hey, you are here.

179
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:04,360
Thank you.

180
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:09,566
It's been so many years. Your habit of drinking cold drinks still has not changed.

181
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:14,900
Oh, yeah.

182
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,699
- I heard Mia say you like eating ice cream recently.
- Yeah.

183
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:20,533
The shop downstairs?

184
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,266
Yes.

185
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:25,433
If it's so delicious, I'll try it another day.

186
00:14:30,566 --> 00:14:32,166
Come, come.

187
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,900
Be careful.

188
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,300
Done, done.

189
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,566
Is it arranged like that?

190
00:14:41,566 --> 00:14:45,066
How's the painting? It will be done soon.

191
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:50,166
Hey, don't touch it! It's not dry yet.

192
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:52,697
What's wrong with your hand?

193
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh.

194
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,466
It's fine.

195
00:14:55,466 --> 00:14:58,000
Didn't it rain yesterday? I fell off my bike.

196
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,033
Why are you so clumsy? You can't ride a bike when it's raining.

197
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,633
Let me see.

198
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:05,333
The bandage is tied too loosely.

199
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,800
Be careful, don't let it get wet.

200
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:22,433
- What are you looking at?
- Done. Haven't you seen it before?

201
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:23,933
Never seen it.

202
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,700
Never seen it? I'll beat you up and wrap it for you, for you to experience it. Okay?

203
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,780
No need, no need.

204
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,633
Everyone, hurry up.

205
00:15:32,633 --> 00:15:34,533
6:00. We'll start right on time at 6:00.

206
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:37,900
- 6:00.
- Okay!

207
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,266
Hey, Zhou Zhou. Did you prepare the fireworks and drinks?

208
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,733
All done.

209
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,433
Since everyone is almost done,

210
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:46,233
- I will be leaving later.
- Huh?

211
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:48,266
Don't go. There will be a party at night.

212
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:50,400
I won't be going. I have something on.

213
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,539
What do you have at night?

214
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,100
Hey, did you bring the camera?

215
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,166
- I brought it.
- Where?

216
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,234
- It's in the car.
- Hurry up, take it and find a place to put it up.

217
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:02,435
How can you forget such an important thing?

218
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:11,033
Su Mu, tell me your thoughts.

219
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:13,417
My lab is now ready.

220
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,448
Technology research and development is also on the right track.

221
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:19,300
Next, I am going to do the exterior design by myself.

222
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:23,633
It's too risky.

223
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,200
I believe in your capabilities, but it will take time.

224
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,333
If you are willing to take risks,

225
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,033
I do have someone to recommend to you.

226
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,333
He should be able to help you.

227
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,400
- Who?
- A very capable professor.

228
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,033
Gao Bo. He is a senior in the aviation industry.

229
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:41,120
I know that in Pinghaishan, he has an old factory.

230
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Known as the Infant Terrible in the industry, he doesn't like to work with others.

231
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:45,766
He has a bad temper.

232
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:46,933
If you want to get him,

233
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:48,600
we will have to find a way.

234
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,066
I've heard of him.

235
00:16:50,066 --> 00:16:53,700
It can be said that all classic aircraft's' exterior designs now

236
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,766
are influenced by him.

237
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:58,433
If we can ask him to be our consultant, it'll be a leap.

238
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,200
This old man is amazing.

239
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,666
We must get him over.

240
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,133
Didn't you listen to Hui Zi?

241
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,491
He's a weirdo.

242
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:05,700
Where does your confidence come from?

243
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,758
That old man is a weirdo.

244
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,866
Isn't our Su Mu weird, too?

245
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,166
This weirdo meets another weirdo.

246
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:20,740
Maybe you both will reciprocate?

247
00:17:22,281 --> 00:17:23,933
Hey, I know the address of his company.

248
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:27,366
- Why not… go look for it?
- Okay.

249
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:29,533
- I'll go now.
- I'll go with you.

250
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:32,866
How I deal with you, I can do the same to him.

251
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:34,666
Let's go.

252
00:17:34,666 --> 00:17:37,533
Okay, I will give you the address then.

253
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:45,933
Hey, Gao Bo's place is quite far.

254
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:48,179
Can we come back in time tonight?

255
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:50,800
We must be back tonight.

256
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,933
What time will it be when we come back?

257
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:56,233
Okay, let me drive faster.

258
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:03,600
Okay!

259
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,133
Done.

260
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,990
[Su: I have something going on tonight. I will be back later.]
[Wait for me.]

261
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,830
[Okay, be late if you have to be late.]

262
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,700
It's not easy that we have to come to a beach. Why are you still acting like you are in the office?

263
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:30,120
Look up and see the scenery. How beautiful it is.

264
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,433
What happened to you?

265
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:34,600
You just noticed?

266
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,633
You really care about me.

267
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:38,268
It's all because of you.

268
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:39,802
Me?

269
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,500
Went to the bar for a drink that day. Met Liu Tai. Had a fight.

270
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,533
That's all, this reaction?

271
00:18:51,533 --> 00:18:54,666
You look energetic. You should be fine.

272
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,050
Hey, recently I find that

273
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,800
you're in a good condition.

274
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,233
Knowing how to joke.

275
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:02,266
Getting more human-like.

276
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,666
Are you in love?

277
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:21,966
Hey, I just placed it here. Why are you eating?

278
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:23,566
Did you just place it?

279
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:25,341
I'm hungry. Need to recharge.

280
00:19:25,341 --> 00:19:29,541
Who just urged everyone to speed up? Making trouble here now.

281
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,600
What's wrong with eating a piece of cake?

282
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
So petty.

283
00:19:35,014 --> 00:19:36,462
Have a look. Are you satisfied?

284
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:38,800
If you're satisfied, I'll go work on the fireworks.

285
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,166
No hurry, it's still bright.

286
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,600
Why put fireworks up during the day? Wait for the night.

287
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,716
You just urged us just now.

288
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:47,666
No more hurry now?

289
00:19:48,933 --> 00:19:50,760
The proposer is also not in a hurry.

290
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,000
Why are you in a rush?

291
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,333
Okay, I'm going to check on the others.

292
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:59,676
Put it straight. Pay attention to the details.

293
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,600
Okay, I'm not joking with you anymore. Let's discuss strategies.

294
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,166
Later when we get to the Infant Terrible, I'll go up and do the talking first.

295
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,800
Then, why am I here?

296
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,100
You see… You speak so directly.

297
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,100
If you go straight to the point and ruin it, how can we talk later?

298
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,166
Wait for me to go first.

299
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:24,066
After I make him understand, then you'll go and talk about the professional issues.

300
00:20:24,066 --> 00:20:29,200
Don't worry. If they try to abduct it, I want to abduct it back.

301
00:20:31,889 --> 00:20:34,033
Are you in love?

302
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,625
Put it in the center.

303
00:20:48,433 --> 00:20:50,233
Pretty good.

304
00:20:50,233 --> 00:20:51,766
Li Di, what are you doing?

305
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:53,933
I'm thinking of where to mount this camera.

306
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:58,533
The stand should be at a higher place.

307
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,966
Hey, what do you think of that position?

308
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:06,800
Can get comprehensive and stable shots. Or just put it next to the CCTV.

309
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,600
That's right.

310
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:12,184
Hey, do you think the security guard will agree?

311
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:15,366
Oh, yes, the security guard.

312
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,933
- I have an idea.
- What idea?

313
00:21:23,404 --> 00:21:26,766
Hey, I just set it up, and you're taking it away again.

314
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,820
Hello.

315
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,400
You...

316
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:40,533
Aren't you the uncle who lent us paint the last time?

317
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:43,733
Yeah. Why? Ran out of paint again?

318
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,900
I want to ask you for a favor this time.

319
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,517
Just tell me. As long as I can help, I will definitely help.

320
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:55,233
Um, can you let us put our camera right next to your CCTV?

321
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:57,766
We want to record the wedding scene.

322
00:21:57,766 --> 00:22:02,700
Don't have to mount the camera. I can give you a copy of the monitor then.

323
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,366
You see how clear the display is.

324
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,198
- It's so clear.
- Yeah.

325
00:22:07,198 --> 00:22:09,233
Uncle, you're so nice. Have a piece of cake.

326
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:11,260
- No, no.
- Give it a try.

327
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:14,866
- Hey, I'll try it for you.
- Is it sweet?

328
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,791
Sweet. When is the proposal?

329
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,258
I come here every night because of this.

330
00:22:20,258 --> 00:22:23,000
- Ah! The proposal starts tonight.
- Really?

331
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,500
That's great.

332
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,300
- Eat one more.
- Put it here.

333
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:30,800
Okay, have it all.

334
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,866
- I'll leave first then.
- Go, go.

335
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:35,000
- Thank you, Uncle.
-Okay!

336
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,500
What's going on? My brother is coming soon.

337
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,634
We haven't found the camera spot.

338
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:03,830
- Sister De De went to ask the security guard.
- Hey!

339
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,800
How was it?

340
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,728
- Done!
- We can mount it there?

341
00:23:10,728 --> 00:23:12,966
- No.
- Then, what is done?

342
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:16,766
The security guard promised to give us a copy of the CCTV recording.

343
00:23:16,766 --> 00:23:19,766
This is much clearer than the camera.

344
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,800
That's great!

345
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,366
Okay, all right, all right!

346
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:26,533
All is ready, except for the opportunity.

347
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,766
There is one more thing.

348
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:31,100
Hide.

349
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:46,233
Girl, anything?

350
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:48,733
Hey, Grandpa.

351
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:53,833
Who's your grandpa? What are you doing?

352
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,500
We are here for Professor Gao. Do you know where is he?

353
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,861
Don't know.

354
00:23:57,861 --> 00:23:59,300
Can we go in and find him?

355
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,231
Find wherever you want. Don't bother me.

356
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,483
Hey, you old man, believe it or not, that I'll make a complaint about you.

357
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:08,533
The complaint box is outside, feel free.

358
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:11,033
Forget it. Let's go ourselves.

359
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,700
Thank you, Grandpa.

360
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:23,266
Go find him, silly boy. .

361
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:30,281
Hey. Why does this place look like an abandoned factory?

362
00:24:30,281 --> 00:24:32,166
There's no one here.

363
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:37,400
Let's go there and have a look.

364
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:49,611
Hey! Where's the old expert? There's no one after a long search.

365
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:54,066
Why do I feel this place is kind of weird?

366
00:24:54,066 --> 00:24:55,380
What do you think, Su Mu?

367
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,530
Su Mu! Su Mu! Wait for me, Su Mu!

368
00:24:57,533 --> 00:25:00,033
Why are you so strong?

369
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:03,200
- Don't you know me?
- You like eating meat.

370
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,933
I can't compare with you.

371
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:07,200
Stop saying that.

372
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,860
Xiao Zhi, what is this?

373
00:25:09,866 --> 00:25:12,933
When we came last time, there seemed to be nothing.

374
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:17,333
It seems like there's an event. I'm not too sure.

375
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,766
Look at that. So pretty.

376
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,866
- Hey, take a photo.
- No, it's okay.

377
00:25:25,866 --> 00:25:28,766
It doesn't matter. Take a picture. Secretly.

378
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:41,759
Su Mu! Su Mu!

379
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:46,092
Su Mu!

380
00:25:52,366 --> 00:25:55,955
One… Two… Three…

381
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,180
I still remember the first time here.

382
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,630
You said you wanted to bring me to fly.

383
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:18,833
Today, I'm bringing you to fly.

384
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:21,000
I will bring you to fly forever.

385
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:23,466
I love you.

386
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,133
Will you marry me?

387
00:26:30,365 --> 00:26:32,233
I do.

388
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,900
- Be together.
- Be together.

389
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:51,200
Really good.

390
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:32,000
- Kiss.
- Kiss.

391
00:27:35,766 --> 00:27:38,800
- Kiss.
- Kiss.

392
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,900
What are you looking at? I have been looking for you?

393
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,300
Why are you here?

394
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,333
- Hey, did you find the old man?
- No.

395
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:20,500
I guess we can't find him. Let's go.

396
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,639
It's raining!

397
00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:31,416
Hurry up!

398
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:37,033
Oh, it's raining. I've waited for days for the rain.

399
00:28:37,033 --> 00:28:39,426
- Oh my goodness.
- We're all wet.

400
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:42,570
- I am all wet.
- Why is it raining so suddenly?

401
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,700
Ah, our plans are gone now that it's rainging.

402
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,400
It's okay! We can find another place for the party.

403
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,766
Hey, take a look.

404
00:28:57,296 --> 00:28:59,866
Why is it raining so heavily all of a sudden?

405
00:29:01,833 --> 00:29:03,466
Your hair is messed up.

406
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:05,381
Is it messy?

407
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:08,198
I need to take a call.

408
00:29:11,066 --> 00:29:12,600
Hey, darling.

409
00:29:13,287 --> 00:29:15,117
Say it.

410
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:38,900
- You…
- You…

411
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,766
I'm looking for someone.

412
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:47,859
I'm helping a friend with his proposal.

413
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:49,666
Proposal?

414
00:29:52,866 --> 00:29:55,632
That painting was by you?

415
00:29:55,632 --> 00:29:57,430
Ah. Yes, I painted it.

416
00:29:58,008 --> 00:29:59,964
Hey! What do we do if the painting gets wet?

417
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,233
Ah, it's okay! Isn't it over? It's a success.

418
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:06,670
- Yes. It's okay.
- Okay.

419
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,850
- The rain seems to be subsiding.
- Yeah, it's subsiding.

420
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:17,400
- Brother Li, let's go?
- Shall we go first?

421
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,038
Ah. You go first. I'll wait for a while. I'll have something else later.

422
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:23,166
- You're really not going?
- I'm really not going.

423
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:25,503
I'm going to get the materials in a while. You go ahead.

424
00:30:25,503 --> 00:30:26,466
Let's go, Brother Li

425
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:27,700
- Let's go. Let's go.
- We'll go now.

426
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,421
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- Be careful, bye.

427
00:30:29,421 --> 00:30:31,200
I'll go get the car. You wait here.

428
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,466
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

429
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,630
♫ In the season I met you ♫

430
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,330
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

431
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,860
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

432
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,635
♫ Inadvertently ♫

433
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:17,200
♫ Dreams weren't fulfilled at that time ♫

434
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:24,700
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

435
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:31,260
♫ I can always protect you ♫

436
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,930
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart♫

437
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,060
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

438
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:50,771
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

439
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:59,460
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously into the night sky ♫

440
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:06,500
♫ That innocence and helplessness is given to this evening breeze ♫

441
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:14,400
♫ You must have faith that we can be together, smiling ♫

442
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,577
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
