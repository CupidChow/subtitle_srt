00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,680
♫ I can go away slowly when I think of you ♫

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,450
♫ Little torturous pixie ♫

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,400

11

18
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,440
♫ This long journey, step by step ♫

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,420
♫ I can't help ♫

23
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:58,500
I shared the bed with Su Mu.

24
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,900
I like you.

25
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,650
A gentle good morning...
- Good morning.

26
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,100
...is enough to put me in a trance all day.

27
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,166
But seeing him being so close to Hui Zi

28
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,566
and having to divide the ice cream I specially made for him.

29
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:14,200
Old rules, separate into half.

30
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:18,200
Is it going to end before it starts?

31
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:37,866
- Sister De De, send it to me through We Chat.
- Okay.

32
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:48,800
Wow!

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,566
I'll go for a walk.

34
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,333
Hey, be careful!

35
00:02:57,966 --> 00:02:59,500
- I'm so hot.
- Look, look!

36
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,366
Xiaoyu, look!

37
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:10,533
I'm going to set off fireworks to confess.

38
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:13,133
Find a chance to draw Tian Tiande away.

39
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:14,900
Keep in touch.

40
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,953
When you hear 'Pa!' Then light it.

41
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:19,933
- Is there any problem?
- Okay.

42
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,633
Hey De De, let's go buy some drinks.

43
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:24,666
Don't we have some here?

44
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:26,700
Buy more, buy more.

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,733
Aren't we going to buy drinks?

46
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,133
Why are we here?

47
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,133
Brother Yi wants to confess to Ding Xiayu.

48
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:58,366
I'm here to set off fireworks for him.

49
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:00,800
Ah, he really wants to confess to Ding Xiaoyu?

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,366
Yeah, he is taking the initiative.

51
00:04:03,366 --> 00:04:04,600
Of course, he is taking the initiative.

52
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,033
He is an old hand in the love field.

53
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:10,300
But I think he is serious this time.

54
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,400
Hopefully.

55
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,033
Xiaoyu.

56
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,200
I think you already understand my intentions.

57
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:20,933
I just need your word.

58
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,166
I do not understand.

59
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,366
I'll tell you again.

60
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:32,533
Since I met you for the first time,

61
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:36,666
I... have fallen deeply in love with you.

62
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,833
I can't sleep every night.

63
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,800
I can't eat, I think about you all the time.

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,366
I miss you even when I breathe.

65
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,933
So you have to be my girlfriend.

66
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:46,500
Otherwise, I can't live anymore.

67
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,720
No, no, no. It's too mushy, I can't listen to it anymore.

68
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,100
I'm going to the bathroom.

69
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,900
Oh... okay.

70
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,233
Do you understand now?

71
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:57,666
Oh, I got it.

72
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,100
What are you doing?

73
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,133
What else can I do?

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,233
You...

75
00:05:37,466 --> 00:05:38,933
You scared me.

76
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,500
Why are you here?

77
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,700
Didn't you come to look for me?

78
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,033
I'm here to help Li Di... set fireworks.

79
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:49,933
You can go then.

80
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,466
Your face is muggy again.

81
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:54,000
Whose face is muggy?

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,666
Your face has been muggy the whole today, did I call you out?

83
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,166
Since when was my face muggy?

84
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,800
From yesterday to now. So inexplicable.

85
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,466
So inexplicable.

86
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:04,200
You and Huizi are the inexplicable ones.

87
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,566
What's wrong with me and Huizi?

88
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,033
You and Li Di are inexplicable.

89
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,300
What's wrong with me and Li Di?

90
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,900
Li Di and I are good brothers.

91
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,500
Are you and Huizi good brothers?

92
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,533
You gave her the ice cream I made for you.

93
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,066
She wanted it but I didn't give it to her.

94
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,233
You both are the ones.

95
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,466
Pitching camps, catching fish, and holding hands.

96
00:06:18,466 --> 00:06:20,666
Ours is a game, is yours a game?

97
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,300
I am inexplicable?

98
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,500
I know it very well in my heart.

99
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,700
I won't give the ice cream to others

100
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,400
and I won't simply make ice cream for others.

101
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,360
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

102
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,360
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

103

♫ Inadvertently ♫

♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

106
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,500
Such good timing.

107
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,800
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

108
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:18,400
♫ Can always protect you ♫

109

♫ But I miss you so much ♫

110
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:26,330
Initially, I thought I couldn't live without ice cream.

111
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,000
Now I have found out, I can't live without you.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,900
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

113
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,300
Be my girlfriend.

♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

115

♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

♫ Inadvertently ♫

122
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:31,866
How was it?

123
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:35,466
Did I control the timing perfectly?

124
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:37,600
Good.

125
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,200
Extraordinarily good, very good.

126
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,366
That means you nailed it.

127
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:46,566
I'm was too impatient.

128
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,966
Generally in this kind of situation, it's basically solved.

129
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:51,000
She is definitely different.

130
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,033
Hey, this one is a bit embarrassing.

131
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,100
It's okay.

132
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,900
Just set off fireworks the next time and it'll be fine.

133
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,466
Where is Tian Tiande?

134
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,366
Isn't that her?

135
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:22,600
Hey, what did you two do?

136
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,200
I went to watch the fireworks.

137
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,266
Did you guys see them?

138
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,100
Did Xiaoyu see the fireworks?

139
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,066
Yes, I saw them. Who set them?

140
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:34,066
- Wang Yanyi, because of you—
- To create the atmosphere for everyone.

141
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:36,800
We've eaten and watched the fireworks.

142
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Go to bed, go to bed.

143
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:41,874
I'm sleeping.

144
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:42,966
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

145
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:44,366
Goodnight.

146
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,033
Let's sleep.

147
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,766
Goodnight.

148
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:27,100
Xiaoyu.

149
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,533
Goodnight.

150
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:20,900
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

151
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,566
Oh, you guys are up so early.

152
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:29,366
How was your sleep last night?

153
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:31,733
Oh, the ground is too hard. It was very uncomfortable.

154
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,166
What about you?

155
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,566
I...

156
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:36,066
Several mosquitoes got into the tent.

157
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:37,466
I finally killed one.

158
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:39,033
It comes again. It comes again and I hit it again.

159
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,466
I keep hitting and hitting...

160
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,666
Brother Yi, you woke up too.

161
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,533
How was your sleep last night?

162
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,333
Not too good.

163
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,333
I had a dream last night.

164
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,266
I dreamed that I was in a meeting.

165
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:55,366
There's an uncle above who has been talking nonsense.

166
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:57,633
Talking nonsense all night.

167
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:05,833
You heard it, too?

168
00:12:07,066 --> 00:12:10,033
How can I hear your dream?

169
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,866
That's right.

170
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:18,866
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

171
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:22,366
Nothing much. Was talking about an uncle.

172
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,800
Uh, okay. Everyone, pack up quickly. Let's go back.

173
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,466
Hurry up.

174
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,933
You talked to me this morning.

175
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:43,500
Why was it so soft?

176
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,600
Oh, I'm still a little uncomfortable having a boyfriend.

177
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,700
So, I'm not used to it.

178
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,366
Do you have anything else today?

179
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,700
No.

180
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,566
Let's go on a date.

181
00:13:58,566 --> 00:14:01,533
Ah, date? For real?

182
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:04,733
Didn't you say you're not used to having a boyfriend?

183
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,666
I'll let you try getting used to it today.

184
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,400
Okay.

185
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,933
Then, go back and pack, and we'll head out.

186
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:40,566
Just get used to it.

187
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:55,433
Didn't you go out with Li Di yesterday?

188
00:14:55,433 --> 00:14:58,600
Why come back holding hands with him?

189
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,133
It wasn't just Li Di who went there yesterday.

190
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,833
My main point is...

191
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:06,133
Why did you come back holding hands with him?

192
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:11,333
Say. What did you do last night?

193
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:13,766
Mom.

194
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:18,900
Su Mu and I seem to be together.

195
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,900
Seem?

196
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:23,766
Just say yes if you both are.

197
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:25,633
What do you mean by "seem"?

198
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:29,500
Mainly it's because I can't believe it.

199
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,533
I can't believe it either.

200
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:34,866
Did you pursue him or he pursued you?

201
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,533
Of course, he pursued me!

202
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,000
Then, I can't believe it even more!

203
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,889
Why?

204
00:15:39,889 --> 00:15:42,800
How would Su Mu be interested in you?

205
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,860
Mom, I'm not bad, too. Okay?

206
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,166
I'm your biological daughter.

207
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:48,133
Look, a boy like Su Mu.

208
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:51,400
Good looking and good family conditions.

209
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,866
Of course, our family is not bad either.

210
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:56,500
You said he pursued you.

211
00:15:57,433 --> 00:15:59,500
Did he officially announce?

212
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,966
Mom, we just got together yesterday.

213
00:16:01,966 --> 00:16:04,733
I haven't had time to say it.

214
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:07,433
Later, do you still have anything on?

215
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:11,233
He asked me out for a date later.

216
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:14,400
This is your first date?

217
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,200
You can date.

218
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:23,933
But I have a few points to tell you

219
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:26,600
to see if he really likes you.

220
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,866
First of all, it depends on how generous he is to you.

221
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:34,766
Secondly, if he answers other calls in between.

222
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:36,066
What's more.

223
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:40,466
Whether he always wants to bring you to places,

224
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,366
confined places take advantage of you.

225
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:46,900
Hey, he's not that kind of person.

226
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,866
You two only got together.

227
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:50,366
How do you know what kind of person he is?

228
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:55,300
Again, you can date

229
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,233
but don't be deceived.

230
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,900
Understood.

231
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:03,533
I'll go and pack up.

232
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,433
Dad.

233
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:15,366
Go unpack.

234
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:24,000
She just wants to date.

235
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,400
Don't you also want our girl to properly date?

236
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,266
Why do you set so many rules for her? What for?

237
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:34,100
How can our girl properly date like this?

238
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,866
You, as a dad,

239
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:37,800
aren't worried about your daughter at all?

240
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,133
I'm not worried about her.

241
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:41,033
I'm relieved.

242
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,066
Aren't we practicing freedom to love?

243
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,833
Isn't she free now?

244
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:54,900
Mom, let me tell you.

245
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,066
- I have a meeting at 3:00 in the afternoon.
- I know.

246
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:01,300
This time, I'll be back in a few days after having the meeting.

247
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,966
What happened to you?

248
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:11,300
I'm okay, Mom. Where are you going?

249
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,733
I'm going to Shanghai to attend a meteorological exchange conference.

250
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:16,366
You're back in time. You can take Mom to the airport later.

251
00:18:16,366 --> 00:18:18,400
I still have a meeting.

252
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,833
I can't. I have a date later.

253
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:33,800
- Date?
- Date?

254
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:53,466
Mom, what are you doing?

255
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,333
Why are you so pretty?

256
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,366
Don't I have to go on a date later?

257
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:01,033
If a man really likes you...

258
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:03,666
he likes everything about you.

259
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:04,633
Stop doing makeup.

260
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:07,500
Oh, aren't I supposed to dress up for a date?

261
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,600
I am happy when I look at myself.

262
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,366
A little bit of makeup would be fine.

263
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:15,433
Yeah, just a bit. I got it.

264
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,633
Mom, can't you just stop looking at me?

265
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:24,033
Or else, I don't know what to do.

266
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,766
Okay, okay.

267
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,366
Hey, don't you usually ride a bicycle?

268
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:09,233
This must be the car you used to pick up girls.

269
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,900
I bought this with a scholarship.

270
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,533
I haven't opened it since I bought it.

271
00:20:12,533 --> 00:20:14,566
My sister didn't even ride it.

272
00:20:15,233 --> 00:20:19,600
Am I the first girl to ride in your car?

273
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,633
And the last one.

274
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Thank you.

275
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,500
What are you doing?

276
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:54,333
I...

277
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:13,133
There seem to be no good seating.

278
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,466
Hey, are there any other time slots?

279
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:17,500
There is none left.

280
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,400
Then we'll pick this.

281
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,100
1314... or...

282
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,900
What are you doing?

283
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,000
I choosing a spot. Haven't you watched a movie?

284
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:34,666
Bi Xian. Bi Xian.

285
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,166
You are my past life.

286
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,900
I am your posterity.

287
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,200
To make a wish because of me,

288
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,066
please draw a circle on the paper.

289
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,166
Bi Xian. Bi Xian.

290
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,166
- Why are we the only ones here?
- You are my past life.

291
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,266
I'm yours.

292
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:49,633
Wang Yanyi told me, girls like to watch horror movies.

293
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:51,133
They like to watch them alone.

294
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,766
So, I just booked a show.

295
00:21:54,966 --> 00:21:57,733
Okay, let's watch.

296
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,400
If you are scared, we can change to another one.

297
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,433
How could I be scared?

298
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:04,500
It's starting.

299
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,200
Please draw a circle on the paper.

300
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,866
Bi Xian! Bi Xian!

301
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:09,400
You are my past life.

302
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,033
I am your posterity.

303
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:12,533
To make a wish because of me,

304
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:15,066
please draw a circle on the paper.

305
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,533
Wow! So exciting.

306
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:24,600
- Are you scared?
 - Please draw a circle on the paper.

307
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:29,300
- No, it's just a bit bright.
- I am your posterity.

308
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,400
- Then watch properly.
- To make a wish because of me,

309
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,133
Brother, they scared me, you scared me too.

310
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:41,900
Are you okay?

311
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,700
Really okay?

312
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,666
It dropped!

313
00:22:57,466 --> 00:22:58,400
The eyeballs fell out, too!

314
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,333
Your eyes are looking at its eye balls.

315
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:10,560
Okay, don't be afraid.

316
00:23:11,866 --> 00:23:13,960
Okay... don't be scared.

317
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:24,266
Don't move around.

318
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,400
It can't be.

319
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,800
I think this matter needs to be understood from another angle.

320
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:35,000
Don't worry too much about this.

321
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,300
Good things are overwhelming.

322
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,033
Our girl just fell in love for the first day,

323
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:42,866
you've already said so many things that affected her mood.

324
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:44,100
That shouldn't be.

325
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,933
Hey, I'm reminding her.

326
00:23:45,933 --> 00:23:49,266
We can't wait till the naive girl is deceived, sad, and regrets, only then.

327
00:23:49,266 --> 00:23:52,400
Oh, don't worry so much.

328
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,366
She is dating, not doing math calculations.

329
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:58,266
She won't succeed in applying the formula. Let her go ahead.

330
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:01,133
That would still require clear understanding, right?

331
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:04,833
Let me talk to his mother casually

332
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:09,233
to see if he and his mother's values fit our family's.

333
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:13,833
I want to see if he has admitted in front of his family about Tian Tian?

334
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:18,000
Ask yourself. You brought so many purposes and interests,

335
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,433
are these matters to casually chat about?

336
00:24:22,966 --> 00:24:26,033
I'm sorry, I raised my voice.

337
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:28,400
I won't talk to you anymore.

338
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,466
Old and knows nothing.

339
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:32,033
Bye.

340
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,566
Nothing. I just came over to chat casually.

341
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:43,433
Not to just talk about the kids.

342
00:24:44,133 --> 00:24:45,933
Isn't that stupid?

343
00:24:45,933 --> 00:24:48,000
I am determined.

344
00:24:49,866 --> 00:24:52,233
I'm not here to chat.

345
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:53,666
I came to find my daughter.

346
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:56,100
My daughter is missing.

347
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,066
Isn't this more stupid?

348
00:24:58,066 --> 00:25:00,700
What should I do?

349
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,340
I'm here to invite you to my house.

350
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,866
That's good, that's good.

351
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:22,266
No one.

352
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:25,066
No one?

353
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:26,866
Next time then.

354
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:31,400
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

355
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:38,833
Was the movie nice?

356
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:44,200
Don't be shy. You were so cute just now.

357
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:50,433
Right. What else do you want to do?

358
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:52,760
Let's play this. I'm super good.

359
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,200
Okay.

360
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,633
Brother, I'm a girl.

361
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:14,400
Why don't you have some compassion towards girls?

362
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,333
Let me do it.

363
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,666
Do you know?

364
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,333
I can try.

365
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,500
You go.

366
00:26:46,066 --> 00:26:47,233
That's amazing!

367
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:49,866
Come on! Come on!

368
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:55,066
Wow! Yay!

369
00:26:55,066 --> 00:26:57,000
Little brother, don't get disappointed.

370
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,466
Failure is common.

371
00:26:58,466 --> 00:27:01,800
You will be amazing if you have a girlfriend in the future.

372
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:07,000
Let's go, little brother.

373
00:27:11,433 --> 00:27:14,133
I didn't expect you to play so well in games.

374
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,066
Isn't it simple?

375
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:20,266
That's true. With your IQ, everything is easy.

376
00:27:22,066 --> 00:27:25,866
Why are you looking at me? I'm not easy to deal with. I'm smart.

377
00:27:25,866 --> 00:27:27,800
You are the smartest.

378
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,600
That's true.

379
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,566
What are we doing next?

380
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,966
We'll go buy groceries. I'll cook for you tonight.

381
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:37,666
You're cooking for me?

382
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:40,666
Wow...

383
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:43,600
Hello?

384
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:55,666
Hello, I want two cups of milk tea.

385
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,866
This... There's something urgent in the company.

386
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:16,733
Let's go back first.

387
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:18,266
Okay.

388
00:28:31,433 --> 00:28:33,200
Don't play.

389
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,700
I'm not playing anymore.

390
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,066
Hey, why are you so impatient after losing?

391
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:44,500
I have been too unlucky recently.

392
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,733
I confessed to Xiaoyu but failed.

393
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:48,866
I played games with you yet you abuse me.

394
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:51,133
I feel that you are serious about it this time.

395
00:28:51,133 --> 00:28:54,633
Of course, I like her.

396
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,633
It's not like you.

397
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,933
I used to... play around.

398
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:02,500
I actually didn't know when I liked someone, what was it like.

399
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,233
But after I seeing Xiaoyu,

400
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:08,200
I seem to know.

401
00:29:08,766 --> 00:29:10,866
Is there anything special about Ding Xiaoyu?

402
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:12,400
Of course, she is special.

403
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,966
She is special...

404
00:29:13,966 --> 00:29:15,666
She is special...

405
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,066
Anyway, I am happy when I see her.

406
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:19,833
Then don't be anxious.

407
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:20,933
Wait for a good opportunity.

408
00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:23,066
How can you wait for this?

409
00:29:23,066 --> 00:29:25,233
It'll be too late.

410
00:29:30,033 --> 00:29:33,990
Hello. Okay, I'll be there right away.

411
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,410
Late? Am I the kind of person who will be late?

412
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,930
Bye.

413
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:40,800
I have to go to the company. Bye-bye.

414
00:29:54,533 --> 00:29:59,400
Go in then. See you in our hut tonight. I'll pick you up.

415
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,733
Okay. Bye-Bye.

416
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:02,233
Bye-bye.

417
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:33,866
What are you doing?

418
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,000
Laughing so happily.

419
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,466
I'm officially together with Su Mu.

420
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:42,866
Really? You guys are really together?

421
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:45,766
We were dating just now.

422
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:47,366
So happy!

423
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:49,566
Then you have to tell me honestly about it.

424
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:52,333
Everything that happened between you both.

425
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,400
Su Mu, why are you walking so fast?

426
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,033
Don't we just have a meeting? Why are you in a rush?

427
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,166
What's up?

428
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,133
About the Japanese division.

429
00:31:12,133 --> 00:31:15,300
There are several companies in Japan who want to boycott us

430
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,466
saying that our aircraft has safety issues.

431
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:22,000
Our partners also asked us to reissue a safety statement.

432
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,266
No problem.

433
00:31:24,266 --> 00:31:25,833
Yes.

434
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:29,066
Just like the last time you two worked together to produce a blueprint.

435
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:31,333
No problem at all.

436
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:34,233
I'm saying that there is no issue with safety.

437
00:31:35,733 --> 00:31:37,000
Send them directly.

438
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,633
Let them evaluate it.

439
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:40,700
But if you send it directly,

440
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,966
I'm afraid they will steal our core technology.

441
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:44,300
Yes.

442
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,766
We have to be cautious.

443
00:31:45,766 --> 00:31:49,633
We have to take some time to come up with a detailed explanation.

444
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:55,266
Give me half an hour.

445
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:57,966
I'll come up with a brand new explanation.

446
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:05,833
What is so urgent?

447
00:32:05,833 --> 00:32:09,700
Seaside, fireworks, and forced kiss.

448
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,666
Su Mu is brilliant.

449
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:14,866
It happened so suddenly that I was shocked.

450
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:17,066
But at that moment,

451
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,800
I fell for it.

452
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,366
So skilled.

453
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:22,900
Do you mean him or me?

454
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:26,333
- Hey, both of you are.
- I'm not.

455
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:30,000
I couldn't believe it when it happened.

456
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,833
Why did I fall in love suddenly?

457
00:32:33,833 --> 00:32:36,133
Why is it hard to believe?

458
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:40,180
Love comes very quickly like this.

459
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:42,033
Let me tell you, Mu Mu.

460
00:32:42,033 --> 00:32:44,633
I did not tell anyone except for you and my mom.

461
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:46,100
I need to take it slow.

462
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,500
What's there to be slow about?

463
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,600
If I had such a good boyfriend,

464
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,700
I would tell the world immediately.

465
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,150
That's you.

466
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,800
That's so good.

467
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,730
Hey, boss. I want two original flavored ice creams.

468
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:02,260
Coming right up.

469
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,133
Hey, I ran into Su Mu when I came out.

470
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:08,200
Why do I feel he is being weird lately?

471
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,466
I think so, too.

472
00:33:09,466 --> 00:33:11,166
Although he has always been weird,

473
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:13,100
but recently he's extraordinarily strange.

474
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,300
I always feel that there is some kindness on his face.

475
00:33:18,933 --> 00:33:20,733
Yes. When I saw him at the meeting today,

476
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:23,833
he is always smirking at the computer.

477
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:26,500
Isn't he really in love, is he?

478
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:30,300
Oh, by the way. Look at what they were spreading a few days ago.

479
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,700
- Photos of him and his rumored girlfriend.
- Which photo?

480
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,533
The photo eating ice cream.

481
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:37,100
Hey, let me show you.

482
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:40,090
This one.

483
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:43,633
Isn't this Hui Zi? Our new shareholder.

484
00:33:43,633 --> 00:33:46,533
They used to be classmates.

485
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:50,300
They're really a good match. Good fate.

486
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,600
Didn't you like Su Mu before this?

487
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,866
Is it sad to hear the news now?

488
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:58,866
I liked him casually and didn't really act upon it.

489
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:01,866
Otherwise, I didn't know what to do.

490
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:03,800
You're quite confident.

491
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,666
That's him in front of us.

492
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:09,733
Who knows how he is privately?

493
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:11,766
Why are you guys gossiping behind people's backs?

494
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:14,000
What does it have to do with you?

495
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,666
Because... I'm Su Mu's girlfriend.

496
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,100
You...

497
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,900
- You said you are Su Mu's girlfriend?
- Yes.

498
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:28,400
If you are his girlfriend, we are all his girlfriends.

499
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,266
- I-I really am.
- Dream on being Su Mu's girlfriend.

500
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:33,733
Just think about it. Don't take it too seriously.

501
00:34:33,766 --> 00:34:35,666
It's all rumored in our company.

502
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:38,566
Su Mu has Hui Zi. You have no chance.

503
00:34:38,566 --> 00:34:41,900
Impossible. I can prove that she is Su Mu's girlfriend.

504
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,166
Why don't you say that you are also his girlfriend?

505
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:45,433
Hey, why are you talking like that?

506
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,133
How do I talk?

507
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:48,800
- I am his girlfriend, too.
- She as well.

508
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,566
Say it again.

509
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:05,066
Mr. Su, she said she is your girlfriend.

510
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:09,133
Why do you say that?

511
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,630
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

512
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:23,000
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

513
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,030
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

514
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,796
♫ Inadvertently ♫

515
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:34,230
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

516
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:40,860
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

517
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,300
♫ Can always protect you ♫

518
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,260
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

519
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:59,900
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

520
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:04,300
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

521
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:15,700
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

522
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:22,700
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

523
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:32,000
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

524
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,030
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
