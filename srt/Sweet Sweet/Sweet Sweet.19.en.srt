27
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,866
Wang Yanyi prepared a lot of fireworks to confess to Xiaoyu.

28
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:56,266
I suddenly appreciate this asshole's courage.

29
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:59,426
- You…
- Su Mu stopped me from behind.

30
00:01:59,426 --> 00:02:03,233
I finally told him all the dissatisfaction in my heart.

31
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:05,400
He shut my mouth with his kiss.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,366
When he said he couldn't live without me,

33
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:11,366
my thoughts were like fireworks in the sky

34
00:02:11,366 --> 00:02:13,033
blooming everywhere.

35
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,133
Be my girlfriend.

36
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,227
Su Mu took the initiative to date me.

37
00:02:18,227 --> 00:02:21,321
Unexpectedly, the little brother who doesn't seem to be afraid of anything

38
00:02:21,321 --> 00:02:24,800
is afraid of a ghost movie.

39
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,466
Chairman Su, she said that she is your girlfriend.

40
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:45,033
Why did you say that?

41
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:49,384
I…

42
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:02,600
Had you not agreed to my pursuit?

43
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,366
That means… you agree now?

44
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:20,866
All right. From now on, I am your boyfriend.

45
00:03:36,877 --> 00:03:38,404
Why are you in a daze?

46
00:03:38,404 --> 00:03:42,004
Didn't we say we were going to have dinner together?

47
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:43,995
Oh. I…

48
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,233
I'll deliver them with you.

49
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:02,133
Go back and tell them. This is my girlfriend.

50

♫ I smile when I think of you ♫

60
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:40,415
Hey, why are you sitting there? Let's go play.

61
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,900
You have been actively playing recently.

62
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,484
Of course.

63
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,814
I think you are not really into playing ball, right?

64
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:49,866
The love for a person extends even to the crows on the roof of their house.

65
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:52,400
You were still unhappy while playing games at my place.

66
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,866
You're happy now, all of a sudden.

67
00:04:54,866 --> 00:04:57,733
I was fine at that time, okay?

68
00:04:57,733 --> 00:05:01,900
If I have sunshine in my heart, it's sunny everywhere.

69
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,200
How is the progress?

70
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,921
Everything goes according to normal conditions.

71
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,226
Normal conditions? You two are together?

72
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:12,455
Not yet. However, it's just a timing problem.

73
00:05:12,455 --> 00:05:15,666
As long as she is alive, I will never give up.

74
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,300
Besides, she must like me.

75
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,766
It's just that she doesn't know it.

76
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:24,233
My purpose is to let her know.

77
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:26,366
Are you so confident?

78
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:30,133
There must be confidence. But not blindly being confident.

79
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:33,900
Look at her! I asked her for a baseball match, and she came. Right?

80
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,300
Look at her again. Didn't she react when I said hello to her?

81
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,066
The two of us must have some foundation.

82
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:46,100
Aren't you afraid that she takes you as her good friend?

83
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,566
I want her to be my good friend.

84
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:51,033
Couples always start off as good friends.

85
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:53,667
Then only will there be some progress.

86
00:05:53,667 --> 00:05:57,033
So, according to you, all good friends are lovers.

87
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:01,466
Are we good friends? But are we a couple?

88
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:04,766
- Of course not!
- Isn't that right?

89
00:06:04,766 --> 00:06:07,966
Why do I think you're stuck in love issues?

90
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:13,033
I mean… No matter what she takes me as,

91
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:15,733
I will treat her as my girlfriend.

92
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:20,633
You wouldn't understand it, no matter how I explain.

93
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:25,200
Hey, you are such a big guy! You won't know the result if you have no courage to try.

94
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:30,200
In your case, you will regret it when you lose it.

95
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,000
Why are you sitting there? Come and play!

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,447
Coming!

97
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:40,633
See, she misses me when I am away for a while.

98
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,333
Let's play! Let's play!

99
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:45,466
I'm coming, Xiaoyu!

100
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:01,037
- It's right in front.
- Okay.

101
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,100
Wow!

102
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,566
Hey, this is very similar to the house I designed previously.

103
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,109
But the examiners gave me a zero score.

104
00:07:16,109 --> 00:07:17,781
Why?

105
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:21,833
Because he thinks that this house is flying in the sky, and thus not very realistic.

106
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,233
But life is not entirely realistic.

107
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:28,016
Let's go.

108
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,533
Wow, such a big meal.

109
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,100
Thank you.

110
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:01,733
Oh, why is there is no appetizer?

111
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,200
There is.

112
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,000
Is it sweet?

113
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,833
Starting from today,

114
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,500
we are official boyfriend and girlfriend.

115
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:02,266
From now on, we can…

116
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:04,933
I am sorry.

117
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:07,033
Hello, Mom?

118
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:09,833
Why are you not back yet? Are you done dating?

119
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:13,200
Not yet. We are eating now.

120
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,300
You cannot stay over. I am waiting for you at home.

121
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,210
Got it.

122
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,040
I'll be back soon. Bye-bye.

123
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:24,700
Um, you were saying… what can we do in the future?

124
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,300
Can…

125
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,633
we go home together.

126
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:34,633
Together… eating breakfast.

127
00:09:41,733 --> 00:09:43,919
- Eat.
- Um.

128
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:00,100
[It should be how love looks like.]

129
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,357
[One breakfast. One good night.]

130
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:03,683
[Everything becomes so simple. With the right person.]

131
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,500
Are you tired?

132
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,800
Not tired.

133
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,821
You walked so many rounds outside just now.

134
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:20,566
Still not tired yet?

135
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:24,233
Mom, you saw it?

136
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:26,566
I saw it.

137
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:31,366
Your dad thought he was about to come in,

138
00:10:31,366 --> 00:10:33,800
the brewed tea is now cold.

139
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,600
What a waste of my good tea.

140
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:41,500
Mom, we only chatted for a while.

141
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,781
No worries, you should chat.

142
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:46,269
How can you understand each other if there is no chatting?

143
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:51,900
Mom, why do you suddenly… change?

144
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,478
Your mother was the one having gone through it before.

145
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:57,166
I think Su Mu is quite a good kid.

146
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,424
Reliable.

147
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,933
And mainly, he just lives opposite our house.

148
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:04,526
The wedding cars don't even need to go outside the neighborhood when you marry.

149
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,225
Hey, why suddenly about marriage?

150
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,847
What is this…?

151
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:13,775
Don't you two date for the purpose of getting married?

152
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:17,366
Oh, it's too early for now.

153
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:22,266
Wifey... This matter is too early for you to plan.

154
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:25,966
Of course, I have to handle my daughter's affairs.

155
00:11:25,966 --> 00:11:29,311
Did your mom bother you when we were dating?

156
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:31,473
She did. Why not?

157
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:35,241
She stared at you every day on the balcony when you sent me back.

158
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,200
No wonder every time I sent you home, you became another person.

159
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,366
You became so gentle and quiet.

160
00:11:46,366 --> 00:11:51,006
It was because my mother-in-law was standing on the balcony.

161
00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:52,866
Am I not gentle now?

162
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:55,933
Gentle. How can you be not gentle?

163
00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:59,671
For your own daughter, seeing others…

164
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:01,966
All right. All right. Enjoy yourselves.

165
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:04,066
I will leave first.

166
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,300
Hey, wait.

167
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,145
Before this, you said that you wanted to send your portfolio to the UK.

168
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,566
Have you sent it?

169
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:11,400
Oh, I already sent it a few days ago.

170
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,666
Did it get through?

171
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:14,800
I don't know yet. I'll check it later.

172
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,900
You and Su Mu are not stable yet.

173
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,386
You have just gotten together.

174
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:20,900
If this passes…

175
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:26,366
For you both, it will really be a challenge.

176
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:31,566
It's okay, girl.

177
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:34,933
Your mother and I will support you, no matter how.

178
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:36,900
But... this is your future.

179
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,266
You have to make your own decision, okay?

180
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:53,719
Brother Li, why are you still sitting here? Let's go.

181
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,966
Yeah, you came but didn't practice.

182
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:58,900
Brother Di, I'm leaving.

183
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:02,266
Haven't figured it out yet? Are you leaving?

184
00:13:02,266 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's go.

185
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,700
Hey, Xiaoyu.

186
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,566
Wait for me.

187
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:23,500
It passed?

188
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,466
Your portfolio has passed.

189
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:31,700
Please attend an interview in Beijing one week later.

190
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:34,933
Oh my goodness!

191
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,300
If I pass the interview in Beijing,

192
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,966
it means that I can go to the UK.

193
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:44,203
to study abroad for a few years.

194
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:48,766
It's awesome! Finally…

195
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:56,300
But… this means I will be separated from Su Mu.

196
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,650
[Brother Di]

197
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,470
Hi, Brother Di, anything?

198
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,933
What are you doing?

199
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,033
Nothing, and you?

200
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:15,433
Oh, I'm not doing anything too. I'm at the court.

201
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,566
Oh, right!

202
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:19,333
I have two very important things to tell you.

203
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,600
What's the matter?

204
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,093
[Come to the balcony.]

205
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:26,775
Hey, do you have time these two days? Let's talk when we meet.

206
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:29,968
I have to train at the court these two days.

207
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:33,666
Training? It's fine. Can you come and see me after you finish training?

208
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:35,733
- Ah, okay. No problem.
- Goodbye!

209
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,127
Goodbye, bye-bye.

210
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,323
Hurry up, Li Di!

211
00:14:39,323 --> 00:14:40,924
Okay.

212
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:48,466
I'm on the balcony. What's wrong?

213
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:52,333
I want to ask you

214
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,633
does Aunt agree about us being together?

215
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:00,717
Not…

216
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,090
only agrees,

217
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,450
she even complimented you.

218
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,833
Hey. I can't see your expression.

219
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,400
Are you laughing?

220
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,333
I can see your face.

221
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,333
So, I'm laughing.

222
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,433
Hey. Mugging face little brother.

223
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:26,800
If we were separated in two places, what should we do?

224
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,200
Wouldn't it be fine if you go downstairs and I also go downstairs?

225
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,766
How good it would be

226
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:36,300
if we could be together when you and I go downstairs together.

227
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,000
What happened?

228
00:15:45,566 --> 00:15:48,533
Nothing, it's just…

229
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:52,200
Didn't my mom not know that we were together?

230
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,666
So I can sneak up the mountain to the hut and be with you.

231
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,300
Now she knows.

232
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,333
She thinks I am with you, every time I go out.

233
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,233
What's wrong?

234
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:05,200
Isn't it bad?

235
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,833
Isn't it that I can't be with you every day?

236
00:16:10,266 --> 00:16:13,533
Well… What do you want?

237
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:15,233
Live together?

238
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,967
You wish!

239
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:27,133
I just want to wake up every day

240
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,500
and be able to see you.

241
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,300
Isn't that living together?

242
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,700
No!

243
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,066
Understood.

244
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,033
Little Su Su, let's play a game together.

245
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:49,500
What game?

246
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,000
Well, we'll both be quiet and not speak,

247
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,100
looking each other. Okay?

248
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,066
Do you think this game is very childish? Not fun?

249
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,233
I have started.

250
00:17:08,423 --> 00:17:12,686
♫ Jasmine, Jasmine, my love ♫

251
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:16,953
♫ Jasmine, the air in Jasmine Day ♫

252
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:21,321
♫ The break of dawn is full of longing ♫

253
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:25,521
♫ Anticipating your feelings ♫

254
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:29,783
♫ Jasmine, Jasmine, practicing love ♫

255
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:34,056
♫ Jasmine, Jasmine, my darling ♫

256
00:17:34,056 --> 00:17:38,498
♫ I can go away slowly when I think of you ♫

257
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:40,311
♫ Little torturous pixie ♫

258
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:43,230
♫ How can you be so sweet? ♫

259
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,045
♫ This long journey, step by step ♫

260
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,859
♫ Put you in the pocket ♫

261
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,100
Morning.

262
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:53,533
♫ Your chest is warm and soft ♫

263
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:55,504
Good morning.

264
00:17:55,544 --> 00:17:56,541
♫ When I think of you ♫

265
00:17:56,566 --> 00:17:58,525
How did you come?

266
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,300
Didn't you say last night?

267
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,210
You want to see me once you open your eyes.

268
00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:06,808
♫ Happy memories, scene after scene ♫

269
00:18:06,808 --> 00:18:10,845
But how did you come in? Who opened the door for you?

270
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:12,441
I was afraid to disturb Uncle and Aunt.

271
00:18:12,441 --> 00:18:14,775
So I came in from the balcony.

272
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:16,566
You climbed the balcony again?

273
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:19,033
How unsafe is that?

274
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:21,733
What if I meet a bad guy?

275
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,600
Who is the bad guy?

276
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,233
You are.

277
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:33,233
Am I?

278
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:37,400
De De.

279
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,100
Well... Breakfast is downstairs.

280
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,866
Have some after you finish hugging.

281
00:19:39,366 --> 00:19:42,166
Uncle. Aunt. Good morning.

282
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,164
- Morning.
- Morning, morning.

283
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:47,833
I'll leave first.

284
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,333
Sure, sure.

285
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,720
Hey, when did you come?

286
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,400
He came long ago.

287
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:06,166
Time to eat!

288
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:15,926
Girl, why don't you ask your little boyfriend to eat together?

289
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:17,933
When did he come in the morning? Why didn't I know?

290
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:20,600
Oh, he just came for a while.

291
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,633
Did you open the door for him?

292
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,433
Yeah, right.

293
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,033
Hey, let's not talk about this.

294
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:29,733
Mom, I have something to tell you.

295
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:32,166
My portfolio has passed.

296
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,733
They want me to go to Beijing for an interview in a few days.

297
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,433
If I also pass the interview,

298
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:39,509
I can go to the UK to study for a few years.

299
00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:42,771
- This is good news!
- This is really good news!

300
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:44,600
I have said,

301
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,233
there is nothing wrong with my girl's portfolio.

302
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:51,033
Well, I believe that you will pass the interview.

303
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:55,300
Girl, why are you unhappy?

304
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,066
I can see that.

305
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:03,566
She is worrying that she will be separated from Su Mu after she passes the interview.

306
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,866
Hey, no big deal.

307
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,300
Girl, don't worry.

308
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,066
After you pass the interview, we will discuss this.

309
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:13,433
Let's eat.

310
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,300
Come, eat.

311
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,300
Wifey.

312
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:23,500
Su Mu cooked for me.

313
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,100
But I've never cooked for Su Mu.

314
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,466
Hey, don't worry about it.

315
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:30,866
Let your dad teach you.

316
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:34,333
Yes, let Dad teach you how to cook.

317
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,133
I'll do it myself.

318
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,000
It smells so good.

319
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,600
I announce...

320
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,000
to warmly celebrate that my girl's first attempt in cooking is successful.

321
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,000
- Is it successful?
- Some motivation.

322
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,482
- Successful!
- Successful!

323
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:49,200
How do we eat this?

324
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,100
Don't blame yourself, girl.

325
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,400
I knew the outcome.

326
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,966
I had ordered a takeaway for you.

327
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,766
It is coming very soon.

328
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:06,000
This level… and I'm still thinking to cook for Su Mu.

329
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:10,933
Girl, how about this?

330
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:13,366
You ask Su Mu to come home tomorrow.

331
00:24:13,366 --> 00:24:15,633
Of course, you don't have to cook.

332
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:17,633
Your mom and I will cook

333
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:21,433
and have a good chat with Su Mu.

334
00:24:23,766 --> 00:24:27,633
It's not good to ask him to come home to eat, right?

335
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,000
It's not that he had never come before.

336
00:24:30,066 --> 00:24:31,700
What's wrong?

337
00:24:33,533 --> 00:24:35,900
Okay, deal.

338
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,933
Hubby, what do you think

339
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:41,566
about my pink sweater that day?

340
00:24:41,566 --> 00:24:44,666
You look nice in everything.

341
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,000
Oh, by the way, girl.

342
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,400
Dad wants to write an invitation card.

343
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,333
Help me send it to Su Mu.

344
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,033
Dad, invitation card?

345
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:56,833
This is too exaggerated!

346
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:59,833
This is the courtesy of the Tian family.

347
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,666
I'll do it now.

348
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,733
Mom, taste it.

349
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,700
Anything?

350
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,066
My parents want to invite you, tomorrow at 12:00 noon,

351
00:25:41,066 --> 00:25:43,533
to come to my house for a meal.

352
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:54,766
Is this a parents meeting?

353
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:01,100
Uh, no. It's a very normal and very simple ordinary meal.

354
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,412
Really?

355
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:08,245
You… You can also not come.

356
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:23,872
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

357
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:30,907
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

358
00:26:30,907 --> 00:26:38,661
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

359
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:44,963
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫

360
00:26:44,963 --> 00:26:49,446
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

361
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:54,252
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

362
00:26:54,252 --> 00:27:00,283
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

363
00:27:00,283 --> 00:27:03,028
♫ Inadvertently ♫

364
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,466
♫ Give me a kiss ♫

365
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:56,672
♫ Can or not ♫

366
00:27:56,672 --> 00:27:59,919
♫ Kiss me on my face ♫

367
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,759
Girl?

368
00:28:03,466 --> 00:28:06,008
See who's here?

369
00:28:06,008 --> 00:28:07,667
Um, who?

370
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,366
Why are you here so early?

371
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:15,669
It's not early. It's 12:00.

372
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:18,840
It's time to show Little Su your life.

373
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,300
What's wrong with me?

374
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:06,748
Oops, the toothbrush fell into the toilet bowl!

375
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:12,466
Little Su,

376
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:16,100
my daughter is always careless.

377
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,400
I know, it's cute.

378
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:35,533
Ah, Su Mu. Why are you named Su Mu?

379
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:39,700
My father likes Song Ci, Su Muzhe.

380
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,359
So he named me as Su Mu.

381
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:45,033
Su Muzhe.

382
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:47,753
I know. I know him.

383
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:50,040
You know?

384
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,466
We ate together once.

385
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:54,300
Uncle likes calligraphy, too?

386
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,166
Ah, I like it. I like it a lot.

387
00:29:58,166 --> 00:30:01,100
Hey, Little Su, let me show you my work.

388
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,494
Sure.

389
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,866
Little Su, this is my work.

390
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,254
One portion of pamper.

391
00:30:14,254 --> 00:30:16,400
Massive sweetness.

392
00:30:17,825 --> 00:30:21,725
Uncle, your Shu Jing Ti is really good.

393
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:25,000
Your father taught you well.

394
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,466
Nowadays, young people like you

395
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:30,033
who likes traditional art are scarce.

396
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,500
Little Su. Look at the Tang poems I wrote.

397
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,997
Okay.

398
00:30:39,997 --> 00:30:43,766
How is Little Su interested in listening to you about this?

399
00:30:43,766 --> 00:30:45,944
Hey, Little Su, have a seat here.

400
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:49,390
Mom, the water pipe is broken again!

401
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,466
I will call the property management now.

402
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:53,100
It's okay, Uncle.

403
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,833
I'll fix it.

404
00:30:56,787 --> 00:31:00,066
Yes, he is familiar with this.

405
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:11,366
You're wearing a suit?

406
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:14,339
Why did you dress so formally?

407
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,704
I have an appointment with a client this afternoon in the office. I have to dress formally.

408
00:31:17,704 --> 00:31:20,166
So I wore it here. Don't have to change anymore.

409
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,366
Isn't your house just across the way?

410
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:25,466
It doesn't take long to change clothes.

411
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,066
Don't talk. I don't want others to disturb me when I am working.

412
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,866
Let me help you.

413
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:48,700
Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean it.

414
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,553
I am sorry.

415
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:21,466
Why did you kiss me again?

416
00:32:37,266 --> 00:32:41,220
This painting…is pretty too.

417
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,200
Hey, is it fixed?

418
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,433
Why are you two giggling? Is it fixed?

419
00:32:51,433 --> 00:32:56,400
It's repaired, but the clothes got wet accidentally.

420
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,966
Then bring Little Su upstairs and dry his hair.

421
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:01,066
Don't catch a cold. Hurry up.

422
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:03,100
Go, let's go.

423
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:08,766
Take off your clothes.

424
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,100
I will get you a hairdryer.

425
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,420
The microchip.

426
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:17,000
I see.

427
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,766
I am coming.

428
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,600
Come on, I'll blow dry your hair.

429
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:39,233
Why are you laughing again?

430
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:02,997
