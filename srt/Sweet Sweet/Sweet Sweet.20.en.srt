♫ The break of dawn is full of longing ♫

25
00:01:36,535 --> 00:01:41,552
♫ I smile when I think of you ♫

26
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:45,331
♫ I can't help ♫

27
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,433
I am Su Mu's girlfriend.

28
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,966
He has protected me.

29
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:57,666
Su Mu's sweetness to me is always a surprise.

30
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:02,200
There may be new surprises in the next second.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,900
Just because I said I want to see him as soon as I open my eyes.

32
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,333
He unexpectedly climbed the balcony early in the morning.

33
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:11,300
Waited for me to wake up by my bed.

34
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,475
I was anxiously holding my dad's

35
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:20,433
handwritten invitation letter to find Su Mu.

36
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,833
He bowed his head and kissed me.

37
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,300
The sun was too dazzling.

38
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,900
I can finally have the confidence to tell my mom this time.

39
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,400
This is my little brother.

40
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:37,600
I am coming.

41
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,733
Come on, I'll blow dry your hair.

42
00:02:55,766 --> 00:02:58,200
Why are you smiling again?

43
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,666
I am going to change my clothes.

44
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:59,800
Go out quickly.

45
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,433
Um, what are you two smiling at?

46
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:22,033
We are not smiling.

47
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:26,232
They are the same as us when we were dating.

48
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:29,933
Oh, by the way, Little Su.

49
00:05:29,933 --> 00:05:32,800
When did you know each other?

50
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,533
She broke my aircraft at that time.

51
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:38,133
I pushed her into the mud pit.

52
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:40,033
Then we got to know each other.

53
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,333
- That time.
- That time.

54
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:49,100
So, when you two met for the first time,

55
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,566
it was not very pleasant.

56
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:53,700
Then, when did you guys fall for each other?

57
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,794
- Just that time.
- Just that time.

58
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,066
I still have one question.

59
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:06,100
I always wanted to know

60
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,066
who pursued whom?

61
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,266
Hey, don't ask this.

62
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:15,776
We are not able to eat, if you continue asking.

63
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,178
- Eat.
- Eat.

64
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:19,769
Eat.

65
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:23,000
Come, Wifey.

66
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,700
Come, Hubby.

67
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,666
Let's eat.

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,933
De De.

69
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,691
You walk Su Mu out.

70
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:45,680
Mom, do I still need to walk him? It's so near.

71
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,565
Hey, this is the courtesy of the Tian family.

72
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:50,199
Go.

73
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:53,933
I'll walk you out.

74
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,433
Goodbye, Uncle and Aunt.

75
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:57,402
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

76
00:07:20,433 --> 00:07:21,600
Hey, are you okay?

77
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,966
My parents are talkative.

78
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:25,400
But you seldom talk.

79
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,600
Were you nervous?

80
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,633
Was I nervous?

81
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,639
You don't seem to be nervous.

82
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,333
Don't you have a social anxiety disorder? I'm afraid you are not used to it.

83
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,833
I'm okay.

84
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,833
That's great. It means that you have overcome it.

85
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:45,600
You have become a matured man. You are great!

86
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,333
My mother will be back tomorrow.

87
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,206
You meet her too.

88
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:59,966
Brother Di, the hit was weak; there was no strength.

89
00:07:59,966 --> 00:08:01,183
Yes, Brother Di.

90
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:03,133
It must be a homerun, if it was Clayton.

91
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:05,255
Can he compare with Clayton?

92
00:08:05,255 --> 00:08:07,191
Did you go to Clayton's autograph session two days ago?

93
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:08,666
I don't know. I didn't go.

94
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,844
Didn't you go? Did you get his signature?

95
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:11,819
I did.

96
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:14,225
- Did you grab the tickets for the exhibition match?
- I don't know.

97
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:17,425
- Check it out now.
- Let me see.

98
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,500
What happened? Did you get them?

99
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,341
Yes, and there are two.

100
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:26,966
- Hey, applaud.
- Applaud. One for me.

101
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:29,600
Forget it, his ticket must be reserved for Sister De De.

102
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,166
Ah, of course!

103
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,266
We have to do what we have promised others.

104
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:48,072
Exchange ticket.

105
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:01,495
What should I do? His mother will be back tomorrow.

106
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,074
Okay, I want it.

107
00:09:04,074 --> 00:09:05,430
Sure.

108
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,433
Aunt, don't take this fish. It is not genuine.

109
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,400
My family runs the same business.

110
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,966
- Really?
- Um.

111
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:14,480
Thank you. Boss,

112
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,604
I am sorry.

113
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:16,833
I don't want it anymore.

114
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,533
Thank you.

115
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:25,066
Hey, little girl.

116
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:29,500
Didn't you say that this fish is fake and shouldn't be bought?

117
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,566
He... gave it to me.

118
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,466
I...

119
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:39,733
Will she remember me? I'm so special.

120
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,200
Oh no.

121
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,718
It seems like that's the only way.

122
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,268
Wifey, what do you think this word "Lan" of Lan Hua?

123
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:57,566
Powerful.

124
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:59,766
Strength in softness.

125
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,133
What do you think?

126
00:10:16,066 --> 00:10:18,433
Why do you dress like this?

127
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,866
I'm going to see Su Mu's mother today.

128
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:24,666
So... I dressed up.

129
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:28,233
Oh, girl. I think it's not appropriate.

130
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:30,200
Since you are meeting other's parents.

131
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,900
You should dress neat and fresh.

132
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,400
Like a young girl.

133
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,600
You see, you have changed to another person after dressing up.

134
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,637
- Changed?
- Changed.

135
00:10:40,637 --> 00:10:42,689
That's right!

136
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:45,500
I'm leaving then.

137
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,248
Come back. The gift.

138
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,263
Yes.

139
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:51,933
Bye-bye.

140
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,300
Dear.

141
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,105
Why?

142
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:01,373
- Let's go.
- Where?

143
00:11:01,373 --> 00:11:03,466
Since our daughter is not at home.

144
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:06,600
Let's find a small restaurant for a drink.

145
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,958
The world of two people?

146
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,541
Yes.

147
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,554
Let's go.

148
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:36,733
How is it?

149
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:39,603
Do you think I have changed to a different person?

150
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,266
No.

151
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:45,433
Well, you are a male chauvinist.

152
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:47,966
You wouldn't notice even if I put on makeup.

153
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,600
I noticed that you put on makeup.

154
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:55,320
There is something dirty on your face.

155
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,700
Hey. I did it purposely.

156
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:04,859
You look good with and without makeup.

157
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,533
Then you...

158
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:12,733
Because of what happened last time when I bought the goldfish.

159
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,480
I'm afraid your mother will recognize me.

160
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,566
It's really bad.

161
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:18,466
It's okay, my mom has face blindness.

162
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:19,847
Really?

163
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:20,790
That's good.

164
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,385
This is nice.

165
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:25,133
Done marinating.

166
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,833
I'll cook two dishes later, you cook two as well.

167
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,600
Mom.

168
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,466
This is my girlfriend, Tian Tiande.

169
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,366
You?

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,633
Aren't you the girl who bought the goldfish last time?

171
00:13:12,766 --> 00:13:17,000
Aunt, about what happened last time. I am sorry.

172
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,400
Ah, it's okay, it's okay.

173
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,533
It shows that your resilience is very strong.

174
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,066
An IQ should not be low.

175
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:24,900
This is good for the next generation.

176
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,900
Hey, isn't it all the same?

177
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,966
Different.

178
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:44,500
Okay, you do it yourself then.

179
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:50,600
He is too annoying. I can't do it with him.

180
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:03,850
I'll help him to cook.

181
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,400
Leave him alone, he has obsessive-compulsive disorder.

182
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,300
It's okay.

183
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:14,266
- Let me help you.
- Okay.

184
00:14:14,266 --> 00:14:15,287
So I'll help you to break the eggs.

185
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,079
Break this one.

186
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:20,439
- Uh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

187
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,833
To eat this meal,

188
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,449
I'm afraid I'm going to starve to death.

189
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:22,711
Forget it. Let's call takeaway food.

190
00:15:22,711 --> 00:15:25,600
No need, I have already ordered.

191
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,933
Today is really embarrassing.

192
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:42,033
We didn't cook, and I dressed up like this.

193
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,200
Does Aunt think I'm acting smart?

194
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,633
How would it be?

195
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:49,233
Didn't she say that you have a high IQ and good genes?

196
00:15:49,233 --> 00:15:51,500
You are making fun of me.

197
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,433
Didn't I go back and change my clothes?

198
00:15:54,433 --> 00:15:57,733
And I will improve my cooking skills in the future.

199
00:15:57,733 --> 00:16:01,000
In this case, I will cook whatever you like.

200
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:04,433
Don't you laugh.

201
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,833
Aren't you...

202
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,700
Cannot.

203
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,766
We have met the parents.

204
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,833
So, we are mature adults.

205
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,466
We can't behave like kids anymore.

206
00:16:18,466 --> 00:16:19,433
What should we do then?

207
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:21,359
We need to be more formal.

208
00:16:21,359 --> 00:16:23,805
You... can only send me till here in the future.

209
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:25,933
Do not exceed this yellow line.

210
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:27,800
Do you understand?

211
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:30,682
You have to understand even if you don't.

212
00:16:30,682 --> 00:16:32,400
Good night.

213
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,700
Good night.

214
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,233
Su Mu!

215
00:17:24,933 --> 00:17:28,096
You two. When did you guys get together?

216
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:32,633
We started when we were camping last time.

217
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:34,566
Why didn't you tell me previously?

218
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:36,466
I wanted to tell you.

219
00:17:36,466 --> 00:17:39,066
Do you remember the last time I called you?

220
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,200
I said there were two very important things to tell you.

221
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,566
This is one of them.

222
00:17:43,566 --> 00:17:46,566
But I didn't say it because you went for training.

223
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,233
You wanted to tell me about this last time?

224
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,900
Hey, not really, there's one more thing.

225
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,366
I passed the interview.

226
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,633
I'm going to Beijing for an interview in two days.

227
00:17:57,633 --> 00:17:59,233
If I pass the interview again,

228
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:02,363
I can go to the UK to study for a few years.

229
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:10,300
Why are you in a daze?

230
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,166
I'm not in a daze.

231
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,100
I am good.

232
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,662
Hey, I am taken now. When is it your turn?

233
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:22,922
I... am one step late.

234
00:18:22,922 --> 00:18:26,533
Not late, you will find one soon.

235
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:32,900
Why were you looking for me?

236
00:18:45,366 --> 00:18:49,533
Nothing. I grabbed two coupons for the buffet?

237
00:18:49,533 --> 00:18:51,766
Later, I thought we two had eaten before.

238
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:54,300
Then I threw them away.

239
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,839
- Thrown?
- Yes.

240
00:18:57,515 --> 00:19:00,000
It's okay, I'll bring you to eat something else.

241
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:03,591
Hey, I'm going back first. I have something else.

242
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:06,145
I just remembered that Chenfeng is looking for me.

243
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,633
I'll leave first.

244
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:10,866
You are leaving now? Why don't you eat anything?

245
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,998
Another day. Next time, for sure.

246
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:15,033
You treat me, okay? Oh no, I'll treat you.

247
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:17,822
Sure, sure. I will walk you out.

248
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,100
I'm leaving.

249
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,266
Be careful on the way. It's going to rain soon.

250
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,600
Hey, by the way, do you remember Clayton?

251
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,566
Are you okay? Of course, I remember.

252
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:52,020
That's our favorite baseball player.

253
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:54,500
Yes.

254
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,800
Slowly.

255
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,433
Do you still like him now?

256
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,666
Brother, have you lost your memory?

257
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,966
We just went to his autograph session two days ago.

258
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:06,600
I will always like him.

259
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,404
Never change.

260
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:10,686
Fine.

261
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,832
I just wanted to say...

262
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,666
Me too.

263
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:21,600
I always liked (you).

264
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,233
Never changed.

265
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,800
What's wrong?

266
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,133
Uh, nothing.

267
00:20:37,133 --> 00:20:39,566
I wanted to say,

268
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:41,200
it's going to rain.

269
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,525
You must be careful.

270
00:20:42,525 --> 00:20:46,965
♫ How long has it been since we connected ♫

271

299
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,133
Do you like him?

300
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,733
No.

301
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:59,333
Come on, I can tell from your face.

302
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:03,266
Well... Not really.

303
00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:05,533
Maybe just a little bit.

304
00:24:05,533 --> 00:24:08,100
Let me tell you... A guy like him

305
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,433
does the same to every girl.

306
00:24:11,433 --> 00:24:13,433
It can't be.

307
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:16,333
Guys that look bad

308
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,266
isn't bad actually.

309
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,033
Oh my goodness.

310
00:24:20,033 --> 00:24:22,400
I also hope he was not bad.

311
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,466
But he seems to be going after my junior.

312
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:27,566
So you have to figure it out.

313
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:32,433
How can I figure it out?

314
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:34,749
I really don't know what to do with you.

315
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:42,266
Wang Yanyi, I have something to tell you.

316
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,000
That... You two talk first.

317
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,233
I'll order some drinks for you.

318
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:11,900
Do you like me?

319
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,800
N-No.

320
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:22,900
That's not a coincidence.

321
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:26,766
I like you.

322
00:25:30,202 --> 00:25:32,406
You won't really believe it, right?

323
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,800
I was kidding.

324
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,566
How can you say this casually?

325
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:44,233
Not just this. I can say everything.

326
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,985
Don't you believe it?

327
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,500
Did you see that girl?

328
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:04,633
Wait for me.

329
00:26:11,564 --> 00:26:14,588
Hi. Can I sit here?

330
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,666
Yo! Mu Mu, why are you here?

331
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,633
I'm sorry.

332
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:50,933
This is my girlfriend.

333
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:53,533
Why don't you leave first?

334
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,466
You asshole!

335
00:27:04,466 --> 00:27:06,500
See it?

336
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,533
I used to be like this.

337
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,466
So, what you see is not who I am.

338
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,933
But I just like you.

339
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:22,033
That's your business. I won't stop you either.

340
00:27:22,566 --> 00:27:24,633
I just want to tell you.

341
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:27,000
I have a girl that I like.

342
00:27:29,945 --> 00:27:31,962
Her name is Ding Xiaoyu.

343
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,966
I have changed a lot for her.

344
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:37,166
I have stopped flirting.

345
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:42,300
So, I also hope you can find the right guy.

346
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,870
Good bye.

347
00:28:26,866 --> 00:28:29,400
It's okay to like someone.

348
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,966
Most importantly,

349
00:28:30,966 --> 00:28:33,633
that person has to like you, too.

350
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:37,433
All right.

351
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:43,900
We can come out and have fun another day.

352
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,439
I'll send you back first.

353
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:49,000
Be careful when you are on your way back.

354
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,333
Hey, you go back first.

355
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,033
Li Di?

356
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:02,166
Mia? Sister Mia.

357
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,166
Why are you drinking so much?

358
00:29:04,166 --> 00:29:05,700
Nothing.

359
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,500
Too much?

360
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,433
Do you want one?

361
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,200
Thank you.

362
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,800
Do you like watching baseball?

363
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,766
I've always liked.

364
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,933
Never changed.

365
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,033
Isn't it more fun when you watch baseball with a group of people?

366
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,394
Other people are busy with other things.

367
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:32,589
They don't like watching as well.

368
00:29:35,308 --> 00:29:37,000
Is it because

369
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,700
Su Mu and Tian Tiande are together,

370
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,300
that's why you're drinking here alone. Right?

371
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:45,566
No.

372
00:29:45,566 --> 00:29:48,566
I am very happy that Tian Tiande is dating.

373
00:29:48,566 --> 00:29:51,300
I don't think you are happy at all.

374
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:56,000
I am really happy for her.

375
00:29:57,733 --> 00:29:59,600
I am upset with myself.

376
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,600
Don't you want to snatch Tian Tiande back from Su Mu?

377
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,700
Am I so childish?

378
00:30:06,866 --> 00:30:09,466
If I can be with Tian Tiande...

379
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,900
there would be no chance for Su Mu.

380
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,100
At first glance when I saw them,

381
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,733
I knew they would be together.

382
00:30:19,766 --> 00:30:22,100
It's not because that Su Mu is my brother.

383
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,933
When I saw Tian Tiande at first sight,

384
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:27,433
I thought so too.

385
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:29,366
How long have you known Tian Tiande?

386
00:30:29,366 --> 00:30:31,633
Does it matter how long we have known each other?

387
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:33,245
Turns out we are still the same.

388
00:30:33,245 --> 00:30:35,650
Haven't you ever been with Tian Tiande?

389
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,354
No.

390
00:30:39,856 --> 00:30:42,104
It's my fault for not being brave.

391
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:45,000
Too full of myself.

392
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,100
In the end, I am nothing.

393
00:30:54,466 --> 00:30:56,745
You are not like a kid at all.

394
00:30:56,745 --> 00:30:58,333
What?

395
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,000
Kids only blames others for being bad.

396
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,333
They never blame themselves.

397
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:06,366
I'm really bad.

398
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,266
No, that's not what I mean.

399
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,954
- I mean...
- I understand.

400
00:31:09,954 --> 00:31:12,100
I know what you meant.

401
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,666
Tian Tiande and I

402
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:18,266
get along like brothers.

403
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,400
There is already

404
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,366
no way that we can become a couple.

405
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:32,266
But... I can still be best friends with her.

406
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,400
I feel very lucky.

407
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,766
If you could be braver at that time,

408
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:02,000
it might not have turned out like this.

409
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,533
Right?

410
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:06,933
I won't lose then.

411
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:09,566
You never thought about winning.

412
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:11,800
How could you lose?

413
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,210
[Wei Lai Aviation]

414
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:13,033
What happened?

415
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,633
Why is my head full of him?

416
00:33:34,533 --> 00:33:36,766
What's the situation?

417
00:33:40,466 --> 00:33:42,400
Oh no, my leg!

418
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,666
Oh no, I don't feel it anymore. It's broken!

419
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:49,966
Oh, the car went over.

420
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:50,689
My god!

421
00:33:50,689 --> 00:33:53,533
Hey, stop faking the accident. I didn't even hit you.

422
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:55,800
It went over, it did!

423
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,366
I can't feel it anymore.

424
00:33:57,366 --> 00:33:59,265
No feeling. It hurts.

425
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:01,766
If there is no other way, I'll take you to the hospital.

426
00:34:01,766 --> 00:34:05,700
I still have pigs and sheep at home. How can I have time?

427
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:09,466
Let me think of a way for you.

428
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:11,466
What about this? Give me 10,000 Yuan.

429
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,851
I'll let you go. Hey!

430
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:13,925
You can't leave without paying.

431
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:15,725
I will... if you go. Who is that?

432
00:34:17,333 --> 00:34:19,900
He hits a pregnant woman.

433
00:34:19,928 --> 00:34:23,033
My triplets! Lao Da, Lao Er, stop crying!

434
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:24,435
Lao San is calling me, too!

435
00:34:24,435 --> 00:34:25,600
Mommy will protect you all.

436
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,566
Stay here. You can't run.

437
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,533
My husband is a lawyer.

438
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,500
You not allowed to run away!

439
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,966
Hurry up and don't run!

440
00:34:31,966 --> 00:34:33,933
Don't run, hey!

441
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:36,433
Everyone, come and have a look!

442
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,100
You are...

443
00:34:47,766 --> 00:34:50,366
Dang, dang.

444
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,952
You are really good.

445
00:34:58,518 --> 00:34:59,841
Thank you for your help today.

446
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:03,733
Oh, it's okay, those people need to be taught some lessons.

447
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,800
I didn't expect you to be such an energetic person.

448
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,933
People call me little crab.

449
00:35:08,933 --> 00:35:10,233
I'm already very reserved.

450
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:14,814
When I was in high school, I was undefeated.

451
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:16,666
I was great! I was also the class monitor.

452
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:19,200
So, everyone listened to me.

453
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,766
I finally know why Su Mu likes you?

454
00:35:57,766 --> 00:35:58,646
Why?

455
00:35:58,646 --> 00:36:00,842
Because you can bring him happiness.

456
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:04,566
No, I think it's because of my beauty.

457
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:08,633
Do you know?

458
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,165
Su Mu used to be a particularly boring person in life.

459
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:12,900
But your life is full of colors.

460
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,100
So his life is also full of colors now.

461
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,600
Thank you, Sister Hui Zi.

462
00:36:33,966 --> 00:36:35,600
Have a seat.

463
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,033
I have good news for everyone today.

464
00:36:43,033 --> 00:36:44,706
The previous problems have been solved.

465
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:46,466
The latest safety report shows that

466
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:49,106
our aircraft has no problems at all.

467
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,109
Those Japanese companies have nothing to say.

468
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:54,213
The safety instructions that Su Mu made in half an hour are impeccable.

469
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:55,466
Of course, they have nothing to say.

470
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:57,200
He is a genius.

471
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,000
Yes, I also think your conditionis getting better and better.

472
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,966
Is it because you're dating?

473
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:12,133
Of course, it must be.

474
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:16,176
I think Tian Tiande is a girl who helps people to relax when you look at her.

475
00:37:16,176 --> 00:37:18,466
She just did me a big favor today.

476
00:37:18,466 --> 00:37:22,226
She taught the person who tried to fake an accident a lesson.

477
00:37:22,226 --> 00:37:25,033
She is a person full of energy.

478
00:37:25,766 --> 00:37:28,133
Yes, she is.

479
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,484
I also chatted with her for a long time today.

480
00:37:31,484 --> 00:37:34,033
I have never stopped laughing.

481
00:37:34,033 --> 00:37:35,366
I like her a lot.

482
00:37:35,366 --> 00:37:36,966
Me too.

483
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,133
Hey, stop showing off here.

484
00:37:43,133 --> 00:37:46,133
Yes, you change to another person after getting into a relationship.

485
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:48,426
Showing off at all times.

486
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:53,466
Oh, by the way, the partner wants to meet Su Mu in Beijing.

487
00:37:53,466 --> 00:37:55,966
To make the final decision.

488
00:37:55,966 --> 00:37:58,148
Why must it be Su Mu?

489
00:37:58,148 --> 00:37:59,545
Can he communicate with those businessmen?

490
00:37:59,545 --> 00:38:00,953
I will go.

491
00:38:00,953 --> 00:38:03,766
Didn't you say that I changed to another person?

492
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:05,633
I can go.

493
00:38:08,166 --> 00:38:10,700
Hey, you have to depart tonight.

494
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,933
Okay.

495
00:38:11,933 --> 00:38:14,433
I'll leave if there is nothing else now.

496
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:16,800
I have to tell Tian Tiande.

497
00:38:21,898 --> 00:38:24,359
His condition now... let me go with him.

498
00:38:30,866 --> 00:38:33,666
Please come again.

499
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:40,733
Mu Mu, get me another bowl.

500
00:38:50,315 --> 00:38:54,922
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

501
00:38:54,922 --> 00:38:57,640
♫ Recalling the sea breeze ♫

502
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,910
♫ brushing against our faces ♫

503
00:38:59,914 --> 00:39:03,278
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

504
00:39:03,278 --> 00:39:06,194
♫ Inadvertently ♫

505
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:11,514
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

506
00:39:11,514 --> 00:39:18,431
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

507
00:39:19,343 --> 00:39:25,264
♫ Can always protect you ♫

508
00:39:26,353 --> 00:39:32,466
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

509
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:36,519
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

510
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:43,434
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

511
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:52,910
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

512
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:59,741
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

513
00:39:59,741 --> 00:40:07,664
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

514
00:40:07,664 --> 00:40:14,604
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
