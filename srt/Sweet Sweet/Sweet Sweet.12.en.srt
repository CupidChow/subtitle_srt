♫ I can't help ♫

23
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:56,587
The mountain hut I decorated, Su Mu offered to return half to me.

24
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:58,815
I know he wants OIld Gao to help,

25
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:02,915
but my heart is still beating fast uncontrollably.

26
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:08,278
When one's lucky, one can't seem to escape the good luck.

27
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:10,306
I'll send you back.

28
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:12,478
Here.

29
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:16,430
But when he wiped the dirt on my face…

30
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,796
- He smiled so sweetly.
- Done.

31
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:22,346
Oh, what on earth is going on?

32
00:02:32,115 --> 00:02:35,195
Oh, what's going on?

33
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:37,184
I'm out of inspiration.

34
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:42,331
Hey, Su Mu.

35
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:45,334
Make me some ice cream.

36
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:52,399
You see, firstly, how many times have I made ice cream for you?

37
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:57,168
Secondly, we don't know when Old Gao will come.

38
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:59,309
My empty stomach…

39
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:02,531
I'm afraid I can't take the liquor.

40
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:30,206
What are you doing? You have to separate them.

41
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:32,315
Add two more.

42
00:03:33,153 --> 00:03:37,724
Whisk well, the egg whites must be separated evenly.

43
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:43,784
Stir well, stir well, stir again.

44
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:47,881
Stir well.

45
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:50,737
Not enough cream, add a little bit more.

46
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:53,426
Too much, slightly less.

47
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:54,968
Too little, a little bit more.

48
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,615
Okay, almost done.

49
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:58,796
Add some sugar.

50
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:01,787
Add some more sugar.

51
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:03,903
Stir it. Put it in while stirring.

52
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:06,396
Evenly, okay. That's okay.

53
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:08,746
Enough. A spoonful is enough.

54
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:10,528
How do I do this actually?

55
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:14,193
Just… it's good just like this.

56
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:17,049
Bring it over when you're done.

57
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:12,056
I wonder when will Old Gao will come.

58
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:16,334
Why don't… you go out and have a look?

59
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:18,034
That's true.

60
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:29,657
Why did he ask me to come out and have a look?

61
00:05:29,657 --> 00:05:32,646
He finds me annoying and got rid of me.

62
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:06,787
Don't move.

63
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:54,953
What should I do?

64
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:01,853
Change into this.

65
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,940
Why is his reaction so quick?

66
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:28,459
Or is my reaction too slow?

67
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:30,703
No.

68
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:33,803
I'm the smart type.

69
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:36,074
I'm very clever.

70
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:39,543
I know.

71
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:44,611
He is weird and is different from humans on earth.

72
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,453
It smells so good.

73
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:12,974
I went for wool and come back torn.

74
00:09:12,974 --> 00:09:15,096
How unlucky.

75
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,853
Still busy with work?

76
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:49,909
Thank you for lending me your clothes.

77
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:54,256
Here, have a grape.

78
00:10:00,496 --> 00:10:04,511
Let me tell you. Eat more fruits. They're good for your health.

79
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:07,564
You can't eat ice cream all the time, it'll hurt the stomach.

80
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:10,165
I will only make you ice cream at night from now onwards.

81
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:13,600
During the day, it's bad for you to eat ice cream on an empty stomach.

82
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,990
Here, have one.

83
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:24,312
Yes, that's right.

84
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:28,665
Go get busy,
I'm going to entertain myself.

85
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:50,656
- Hello.
- Where are you?

86
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,049
I went to the hospital to change my dressing. What's wrong?

87
00:10:54,049 --> 00:10:55,812
Where is Su Mu's studio on the hills?

88
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:57,927
- I'll find him in a bit.
- On Xing Yue Mountain's Peak.

89
00:10:57,927 --> 00:10:59,750
I'm going to find him later. Do you want to come along?

90
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,578
No need. Let me call him.

91
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,924
Okay then, I'll hang up.

92
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:13,791
- Do you have to stick to me like this?
- Of course.

93
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:16,212
Okay, I'll listen to you.

94
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:18,568
Okay, let's go to the movies later then.

95
00:11:18,593 --> 00:11:20,940
I can't today. I have something to do today.

96
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,053
I will come to see you tomorrow.

97
00:11:23,053 --> 00:11:25,328
Didn't you say, you will listen to me?

98
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:28,693
Be good. Let's go.

99
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:37,965
- Hey?
- Are you in the studio?

100
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:39,368
Then I will find you in a while—

101
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:42,365
Hello?

102
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,646
The number you dialed is unavailable.

103
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:01,338
Who is that? Old Gao?

104
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:03,406
Look what you did.

105
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,331
So… Sorry.

106
00:12:08,331 --> 00:12:11,912
But isn't your phone waterproof?

107
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:16,385
It's okay. I'll take care of it for you.

108
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:35,136
- What are you doing?
- I'm helping you to repair your phone.

109
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:38,193
Just leave this for one day.

110
00:12:38,193 --> 00:12:40,365
One day?

111
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:45,210
It's really long, but that is okay. I still have a way.

112
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:52,493
Are you sure this is fine?

113
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:56,037
Of course, I am the king of life wisdom.

114
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:59,865
Unlike you. Little "noob" in life.

115
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:07,037
I have to find a place to dry this for you.

116
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:17,459
This is fine.

117
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,568
- I'll fix it.
- Can you repair cell phones?

118
00:13:26,568 --> 00:13:28,931
No electrical items have malfunctioned in my hands.

119
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:30,759
Why didn't you say it earlier then?

120
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:34,921
It seems someone is coming.

121
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:37,115
It should be my sister.

122
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,436
- Your sister?
- It was she who called.

123
00:13:50,436 --> 00:13:53,099
Then I'll have to hide quickly.

124
00:13:59,031 --> 00:14:00,480
Why are you nervous about seeing my sister?

125
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,180
The last time she saw us like that. This time she sees me in your clothes.

126
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:06,391
She will misunderstand. I need to hide.

127
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:12,028
- Su Mu.
- Why did you come?

128
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:14,318
- To see you.

129
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:17,256
The environment is good here.

130
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,993
Beautiful scenery.

131
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:23,037
Shall I move in to live with you?

132
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:26,976
Why?

133
00:14:26,976 --> 00:14:29,261
You don't welcome me?

134
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:32,118
Okay, move in then.

135
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:33,446
I was just teasing you.

136
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:35,818
I'm not as free as you.

137
00:14:35,818 --> 00:14:38,596
There are a lot of things waiting for me at the company.

138
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:42,073
The decoration is pretty girly.

139
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:44,599
Doesn't seem like your style.

140
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,028
Wan Yanyi made it.

141
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:51,575
Then I understand.

142
00:14:51,575 --> 00:14:53,456
He is quite girly.

143
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:55,316
By the way, what's the matter with your phone?

144
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:57,371
Why can't I get through?

145
00:14:57,371 --> 00:14:59,503
It got wet.

146
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:01,818
Then I'll get you a new one.

147
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:11,881
Hang on…

148
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:17,640
Don't tell me you read some sort of encyclopedia

149
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,093
and put your phone in the rice?

150
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:27,396
I'm not that stupid.

151
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:31,849
Okay, I placed the order already.

152
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:35,659
So, how's the progress?

153
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:38,824
Gao Bo has been here. So, there shouldn't be any problem.

154
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:42,487
That's good. Don't stress yourself out.

155
00:15:42,487 --> 00:15:44,118
Take your time.

156
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:46,671
This time, thanks to Hui Zi's help.

157
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:48,531
Without her,

158
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:52,085
we would have to pay Liu Tai the liquidated damages for months.

159
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:55,787
Everything is nice here but it's just too hot.

160
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,660
Don't eat so much ice cream. I'm worried that you'll become dependent on it.

161
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:08,568
After this… I don't think I'll need it anymore.

162
00:16:21,684 --> 00:16:24,472
By the way, does the girl still come to make you ice cream?

163
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:26,059
Yes.

164
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:31,918
This girl looks cute, sensible, and attentive.

165
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:35,215
Although she looks a little silly.

166
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:37,812
But judging from the way she solves problems,

167
00:16:37,812 --> 00:16:40,497
she is quite a thoughtful person.

168
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:45,440
Really?

169
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:58,930
Since you were young, you have never liked getting along with people,

170
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,346
especially girls.

171
00:17:00,346 --> 00:17:02,392
When you were with Hui Zi previously,

172
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:04,968
you kept making her angry.

173
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:08,415
Did I?

174
00:17:09,256 --> 00:17:11,712
Of course you don't think so.

175
00:17:11,712 --> 00:17:14,933
She has liked you for so long and you don't reciprocate.

176
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,359
Of course, she will get angry.

177
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:23,962
So in the future, in matters like this, you still have to be proactive.

178
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:29,603
That's right. What is your relationship with that girl?

179
00:17:30,193 --> 00:17:32,343
She just makes ice cream.

180
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:35,303
- That's all? Nothing else?
- There is.

181
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,102
What is it?

182
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,946
I-live-opposite-her, she-lives-opposite-me type of relationship.

183
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:46,074
I know she lives opposite you.

184
00:17:46,074 --> 00:17:50,153
Forget it. I'll ask her myself another day.

185
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,387
- Why would you look for her?
- I'll help you ask her.

186
00:17:54,387 --> 00:17:57,693
Ask her why she wants to make you ice cream.

187
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:07,599
You can ask now.

188
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:15,838
I was just teasing you. I'm just worried you won't get along with girls.

189
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:17,503
I'm afraid you don't know anything.

190
00:18:17,503 --> 00:18:19,840
You must tell the girl clearly if there's anything.

191
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,984
Don't let people misunderstand.

192
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:23,706
Understood.

193
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:27,828
Look at you, there's ice cream on your shirt.

194
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:29,481
Be careful.

195
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:32,346
I came here just to see how you were doing.

196
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:34,696
It looks pretty good, so I'll go first.

197
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,849
I'll send you out.

198
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:41,228
How come you don't know how to have a conversation?

199
00:18:41,228 --> 00:18:43,033
And don't know how to take care of girls.

200
00:18:43,033 --> 00:18:45,746
You should read more books on learning how to deal with emotions,

201
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:47,668
or love and relationship types.

202
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,453
Don't stay in the room all day and night to work, all right?

203
00:18:53,974 --> 00:18:55,445
Whose clothes are these?

204
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:58,718
Judging from the size, looks like a girl's.

205
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:03,515
Okay, pretend I didn't say anything just now.

206
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:05,340
I'm leaving.

207
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:26,506
Why did you kiss me again just now?

208
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:30,212
Who told you to move my ice cream?

209
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,836
You don't need it anymore, right?

210
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:33,965
Then, why are you still eating it?

211
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,997
I just said I don't need it to relieve stress.

212
00:19:36,997 --> 00:19:39,109
I didn't say I don't want it.

213
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:43,174
You… Previously, you didn't say a word.

214
00:19:43,174 --> 00:19:46,300
Now, you can really talk. Blame me?

215
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,965
Look. My clothes are stained by you.

216
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:52,171
Didn't you dirty my clothes, too?

217
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:56,523
- What's the matter? You want me to wash your clothes?
- Yes.

218
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:58,559
No, I won't wash it for you.

219
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,984
Put it back on.

220
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:02,783
Don't take it off. I won't wash it for you.

221
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,053
I'm sorry, please continue.

222
00:20:09,053 --> 00:20:10,849
Continue what?

223
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:15,693
I wanted to help him take off his clothes so I could wash it.

224
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:18,318
- I thought...
- What did you think?

225
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:21,366
I thought you were going to do laundry.

226
00:20:25,287 --> 00:20:26,803
Have a seat.

227
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,920
What are you doing here?

228
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,462
What can I do here? To look for you.

229
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,028
I ran into your sister just now

230
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,990
and she told me you live here alone.

231
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,328
Did she not see her?

232
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:43,768
She hid.

233
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:46,096
Hide? Why does she want to hide?

234
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:48,834
How do I know why she hides?

235
00:20:51,771 --> 00:20:53,731
How long have you guys been sneaking around?

236
00:20:53,731 --> 00:20:56,349
Who's sneaking around?

237
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:59,740
She's afraid that my sister will misunderstand.

238
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,129
Then, why are you not afraid of me misunderstanding?

239
00:21:12,787 --> 00:21:14,104
When I come here the next time,

240
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:15,949
should I bring two of everything?

241
00:21:15,949 --> 00:21:17,881
- Yes.
- No.

242
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,506
Before I come here the next time, do I need to call in advance?

243
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,231
- Yes.
- No.

244
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:30,985
Who is in charge between the two of you?

245
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:32,709
- He is.
- She is.

246
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:44,365
Why is this bed changed to a double bed?

247
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,414
I haven't been here for a few days and there are big changes.

248
00:21:58,381 --> 00:22:02,507
Did you hide under the bed… or on the bed?

249
00:22:02,507 --> 00:22:05,018
Step aside.

250
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:06,506
I say, Su Mu,

251
00:22:06,506 --> 00:22:08,849
your changes have been big recently.

252
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:11,162
Shouldn't you like a girl like Hui Zi?

253
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:13,500
Gentle, intellectual, dignified,

254
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,330
and a bit reliant.

255
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,087
Yes.

256
00:22:26,768 --> 00:22:28,840
Isn't she like that?

257
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,359
When were you blind?

258
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,984
Don't care about me.

259
00:22:36,381 --> 00:22:38,981
What are you doing here?

260
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:40,634
Firstly, I came here to see how you were.

261
00:22:40,634 --> 00:22:43,343
Secondly, I want to introduce a friend to you.

262
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:46,027
You know I don't like making friends.

263
00:22:46,027 --> 00:22:47,890
This person is different, he is my buddy.

264
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,406
He's the one who helped me beat Liu Tai.

265
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:51,943
I want to introduce you to each other.

266
00:22:51,943 --> 00:22:53,499
I'm not going.

267
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:56,934
Don't worry, Li Di is different.

268
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:58,474
Who are you talking about?

269
00:22:58,474 --> 00:23:00,090
What does that have to do with you?

270
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:03,334
- What name did you say just now?
- Li Di.

271
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:04,414
Ah, I know him.

272
00:23:04,414 --> 00:23:05,693
We are quite close.

273
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:07,252
Why is everyone your friend?

274
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,787
Really. He rides a motorbike, right?

275
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:11,484
He's your friend because he rides a motorbike?

276
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:14,489
Is he tall and handsome and loves to laugh?

277
00:23:14,489 --> 00:23:18,302
And he loves sports and plays baseball, right?

278
00:23:19,553 --> 00:23:21,068
Then…

279
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,506
Then what?

280
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:25,037
Let's go.

281
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,421
I thought you didn't want to go?

282
00:23:26,421 --> 00:23:28,678
Who said I wasn't going?

283
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:37,868
Understood.

284
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:45,199
The scenery is really good.

285
00:23:45,199 --> 00:23:47,819
You must be happy living here every day, right?

286
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,859
Did you… lock the door just now?

287
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:53,332
Weren't you the last to come out?

288
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,434
Did you lock it?

289
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,584
I forgot.

290
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,328
Are you stupid?

291
00:23:58,328 --> 00:23:59,740
You're stupid.

292
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,365
I'm smart.

293
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:02,602
Childish.

294
00:24:02,602 --> 00:24:04,377
You are childish! You are the most childish,

295
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:06,693
you painted me like a kitten just now.

296
00:24:20,496 --> 00:24:23,418
- Li Di.
- De De!

297
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:25,468
It's really you. I thought it was just the same name.

298
00:24:25,468 --> 00:24:26,646
Why are you here?

299
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:29,056
I came with them.

300
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:32,268
I knew it. Someone who rides a motorbike with the same name and he's nosy,

301
00:24:32,268 --> 00:24:34,224
Who else can it be?

302
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,628
You even know Brother Yi?

303
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:38,146
Okay, let me introduce him.

304
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:39,246
This is Su Mu.

305
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:41,937
He's my good brother and also my colleague.

306
00:24:41,937 --> 00:24:44,974
This is Li Di, my buddy who is very righteous.

307
00:24:44,974 --> 00:24:46,574
This…

308
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:49,305
Both of you already knew each other.

309
00:24:50,287 --> 00:24:52,881
How did you two meet?

310
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,053
Enemies are destined to meet.

311
00:24:58,053 --> 00:25:00,218
No discord, no concord.

312
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:04,584
Both of you seem to have some stories.

313
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:08,283
How did you meet each other then?

314
00:25:08,283 --> 00:25:09,869
- They are cohabitating.
- Cohabitating?

315
00:25:09,869 --> 00:25:13,631
What? We are neighbors who live in the same neighborhood.

316
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:16,968
Then, why didn't you tell me before?

317
00:25:16,968 --> 00:25:18,230
There are so many neighbors.

318
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,600
How can I tell you one by one?

319
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,196
You never asked me either.

320
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:23,272
Yes, yes.

321
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,036
Her good neighbor is also my good neighbor.

322
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:26,912
Let's order, right?

323
00:25:26,912 --> 00:25:28,484
Let's order.

324
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:30,084
Okay.

325
00:25:31,834 --> 00:25:33,309
I have looked at the menu for you.

326
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:36,834
Let's order a crayfish, fried pig's intestines with sauce,

327
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:39,639
chopped pepper fish head, and stir-fried broccoli.

328
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:40,849
These are all your favorites.

329
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:42,846
Order another shredded chicken, your favorite.

330
00:25:42,846 --> 00:25:44,702
- Shredded chicken.
- Okay.

331
00:25:44,702 --> 00:25:47,015
Let me show you something.

332
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:48,915
This…

333
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:52,346
- Oh my goodness, did you grab it?
- Yes.

334
00:25:52,346 --> 00:25:55,140
Tickets for your favorite Clayton; meet and greet.

335
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,974
Tomorrow… Tomorrow you go.

336
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:59,537
- It's a promise.
- Why didn't you tell me earlier?

337
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:01,135
I wanted to surprise you.

338
00:26:01,135 --> 00:26:03,615
Who knows I would see you today?

339
00:26:03,615 --> 00:26:06,171
You two… are very close.

340
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:07,693
Of course.

341
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:08,599
That's okay then.

342
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,943
You did not hit Liu Tai for no reason.

343
00:26:12,365 --> 00:26:13,849
This guy...

344
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:17,705
during our company banquet, bullied Tian Tian.

345
00:26:17,705 --> 00:26:20,890
Su Mu got into a conflict because of this.

346
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,806
He is the one who bullied Tian Tian?

347
00:26:23,806 --> 00:26:25,794
You got injured because of him?

348
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:27,277
And you told me you fell down?

349
00:26:27,277 --> 00:26:30,128
Just ignore this kind of person in the future.

350
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:33,103
- Do you feel better?
- I'm fine.

351
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:35,449
I just can't stand so many of them,

352
00:26:35,449 --> 00:26:38,124
bullying Brother Yi alone.

353
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:44,806
By the way, aren't you neighbors?

354
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:48,212
Why did you go to their company's banquet?

355
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:50,562
We are not just neighbors.

356
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:59,421
What is your relationship then?

357
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:04,930
Business partner.

358
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:09,521
We provided them ice cream and desserts.

359
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:12,137
Right.

360
00:27:12,137 --> 00:27:14,457
Su Mu specially asked me to find them.

361
00:27:14,457 --> 00:27:17,021
So, we worked together.

362
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:21,093
Then, I have to thank you.

363
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,208
By the way, our baseball team has a new girl.

364
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:29,515
Do you want to go back and play?

365
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,814
Okay, I haven't been there for a long time.

366
00:27:31,814 --> 00:27:34,624
Here are the dishes. Let's talk while eating.

367
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:52,749
What's the plan? Shall we change places?

368
00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:56,108
It's okay, Tian Tian and I have to play baseball later.

369
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:59,203
By the way, didn't you say you want to play with me the last time?

370
00:27:59,203 --> 00:28:01,612
- Let's go together.
- Okay.

371
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:03,718
- Su Mu, do you want to go?
- No way.

372
00:28:03,718 --> 00:28:05,618
Come, our baseball team is amazing.

373
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:08,191
You haven't seen me play. I'll show you my skills.

374
00:28:08,193 --> 00:28:11,268
What's so nice about girls playing baseball?

375
00:28:12,121 --> 00:28:16,312
Come on. If you don't go, I won't help you with that matter.

376
00:28:16,312 --> 00:28:18,296
- What's the matter?
- None of your business.

377
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,256
Okay?

378
00:28:22,796 --> 00:28:24,396
Okay.

379
00:28:27,224 --> 00:28:29,534
Okay, I'll call a cab. We all drank.

380
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:31,042
There's no need for that, it's near.

381
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,818
Just ride a bike.

382
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:36,043
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

383
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:43,515
How far is it?

384
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:45,456
Ten minutes.

385
00:28:45,456 --> 00:28:47,734
Let's compete and see who reaches first.

386
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:48,896
What's the point?

387
00:28:48,896 --> 00:28:50,342
I'll definitely win.

388
00:28:50,342 --> 00:28:53,333
Not necessarily, Su Mu loves riding bicycles.

389
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:55,124
He even rides to the office.

390
00:28:55,124 --> 00:28:56,415
Okay, let's compete then.

391
00:28:56,415 --> 00:28:58,765
Why compete? How childish.

392
00:28:58,765 --> 00:29:01,584
Okay, let's compete.

393
00:29:01,584 --> 00:29:03,740
- Three. Two.
- Childish.

394
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,365
One.

395
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:19,109
Slow down.

396
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,037
I thought you could go fast?

397
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:30,421
I don't want to go fast.

398
00:29:42,806 --> 00:29:44,665
Didn't I say I'd be number one?

399
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:46,212
You are amazing!

400
00:29:46,212 --> 00:29:48,068
Where are they?

401
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:51,043
There they are, slowly.

402
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:01,509
Am I stupid?

403
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:10,000
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

404
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,830
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

405
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,330
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

406
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,903
♫ Inadvertently ♫

407
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:26,700
♫ Dreams were not fulfilled at that time ♫

408
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:32,830
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

409
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:40,330
♫ Can always protect you ♫

410
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:47,530
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

411
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:51,460
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

412
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:58,400
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

413
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,960
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously in the night sky ♫

414
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:14,900
♫ Those innocence and helplessness are given
to this evening breeze ♫

415
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:22,760
♫ You must have faith that we can be together with a smile ♫

416
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:29,700
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
