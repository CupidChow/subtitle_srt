27
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:53,866
I always thought that I was quite a lucky girl.

28
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:56,866
But that guy and his staring face

29
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,700
jinxed me with some kind of black magic

30
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,666
when he barged into my life.

31
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:05,400
He's turned it all upside down.

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,066
I feel like he and I are like two headphone cables,

33
00:02:11,066 --> 00:02:13,427
inexplicably tangled and inseparable.

34
00:02:13,427 --> 00:02:15,717
It's all gotten so messy.

35
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:36,955
Pervert!

36
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,620
Don't move!

37
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,056
How dare you climb into my house at daybreak?

38
00:02:51,056 --> 00:02:54,359
Morgue or police station, make your choice!

39
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,734
You should admit when you've done wrong.

40
00:02:57,734 --> 00:02:59,403
Eyes up!

41
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,013
Don't want to move? Fine.

42
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:06,365
I'll count to three
and then the knife goes in your chest.

43
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:09,739
One…

44
00:03:10,251 --> 00:03:11,865
Two…

45
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:25,766
No worries, I have more.

46
00:03:31,946 --> 00:03:35,211
No way… It can't be you…

47
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,298
Why did you come to my house? How did you get in?

48
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,078
Explain yourself! Otherwise, you're going to the police station!

49
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:52,470
No way…

50
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,933
1503?

51
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:58,394
You live next door?

52
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,122
When did you move in?

53
00:04:01,122 --> 00:04:03,966
Why do you want to live next door?

54
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:07,664
What are you up to? Tell me honestly.

55
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,433
Did you do it on purpose?

56
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:13,139
Are you looking for trouble?

57
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,633
Don't move!

58
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:17,851
Go back the way you came. Go!

59
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:25,252
Hey! Who said you can go that way? This is my house!

60
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:27,206
Do you want me to compensate you? Tell me.

61
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:28,825
I'll compensate you, whatever the amount.

62
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:30,698
Hey, are you trying to con me?

63
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,131
Say something. Don't disturb me every day like this.

64
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:36,493
Do you have a split personality? A psychological problem?

65
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:38,373
How much money? Eh…

66
00:04:38,373 --> 00:04:40,332
Don't go. I'll compensate you.

67
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:42,317
What's the matter?

68
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,503
- What's this?
- Don't you understand?

69
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:47,466
The girl is reluctant to let the boy go.

70
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:49,630
She wants him to accompany her.

71
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:51,800
Rookie mistake.

72
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,028
If your girlfriend asks you to stay with her, just stay put.

73
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,506
You too. If you want your boyfriend to stick around, speak nicely.

74
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,469
No knives.

75
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:03,320
- But it's not that.
- What isn't what?

76
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:06,660
Anyway, a tiff between lovers is fine,

77
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,264
but don't disturb your neighbors.

78
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:10,769
Exactly. Limit the noise.

79
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:13,706
Let's not meet again.

80
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:15,211
Let's go.

81
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,530
All fine here. Just a young couple having fun.

82
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:23,491
Look! Isn't this embarrassing?

83
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:24,985
How can I show my face in the future…

84
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,566
Hey, don't just walk away!

85
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:30,173
Stop! Do you want me to compensate you or not?

86
00:05:30,173 --> 00:05:32,092
What's wrong with you?

87
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:33,629
Do you want me to compensate you?

88
00:05:33,631 --> 00:05:35,825
Crazy!

89
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:43,319
What kind of person does that?

90
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,498
Hey, Mu Mu, what's the matter?

91
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:08,431
I forgot to bring the keys to open up. When are you coming by?

92
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:11,000
Uh, I'll clean myself up and head right over.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,066
- Okay.
- Oh right, Mu Mu!

94
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:15,709
Listen to this. It's super creepy.

95
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,233
This morning, the staring guy came to my house again.

96
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,375
Why did he do that?

97
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,380
Did he follow you home?

98
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,156
I thought so initially.

99
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:26,408
But it turns out he's now living next door.

100
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,770
Isn't it creepy?

101
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,061
Isn't the house next door empty?

102
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:33,642
Yes, right. I don't know why he moved here suddenly.

103
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:35,805
You'll have to pay attention then.

104
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:40,111
Recently your horoscope predicts something big is coming.

105
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:43,300
S-Something big? Don't scare me.

106
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,045
Don't be afraid. You just have to figure out his star sign.

107
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:52,831
When you get here I'll try to analyze it for you.

108
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:55,122
Oh… okay.

109
00:06:55,122 --> 00:06:57,033
Bye.

110
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,618
His star sign…

111
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,392
Meeting him brought me so much bad luck.

112
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:39,164
Although we've broken up, I still have feelings for you.

113
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:41,466
I'd never…

114
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:45,080
Asshole!

115
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,304
Hey, Su Mu!

116
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,873
I don't blame her… I spoiled her.

117
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:03,439
Hey, how are you today?

118
00:09:05,198 --> 00:09:08,400
Seems like you're still stressed.

119
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,966
I need to bring you to relax.

120
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:15,300
Ah… Mr. Wang, have you come here from the pool?

121
00:09:15,302 --> 00:09:17,107
Yes, yes.

122
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:21,100
Mr. Wang, did you run here?

123
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,025
Right.

124
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:39,000
Careful. What's going on?

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,652
Careful.

126
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,331
Watch it, watch it. Ah…

127
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,260
Push…

128
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,848
It broke down?

129
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:50,498
Yes.

130
00:09:50,498 --> 00:09:52,466
I ran into him as soon as I went out.

131
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,868
It broke down on me not long after.

132
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:56,804
Things always come in threes.

133
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,077
Good things, bad things, meals in the day.

134
00:09:59,077 --> 00:10:00,798
The number of times you've met him,

135
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,266
is now at the magic number.

136
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,366
You've even had supper.

137
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:07,731
Well, so what can I do to solve it?

138
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:12,400
I don't think anything has been written about how to dispel negative energies.

139
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,531
Hey, it's okay. I'll go in later and check it out for you.

140
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,533
Don't worry.

141
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,830
I wouldn't have come if my parents were here.

142
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,318
If I can't fight it, don't tell me I can't hide from it.

143
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:25,899
It's useless, as stated in your horoscope.

144
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:29,450
What will be, will be.

145
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,767
He will definitely be there in the future… waiting for you.

146
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:38,127
My future? I'd rather not have one.

147
00:10:57,312 --> 00:11:00,550
Hey! What is it this time?

148
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,186
Are you getting anxious again?

149
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,327
But why could you suddenly speak yesterday?

150
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:12,166
Did the ice water alleviate it?

151
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,712
Or maybe…

152
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:20,303
I heard that there's a new psychiatrist's office where we can smash all our hangups.

153
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:21,823
You can overcome anything!

154
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:23,058
I'm also very depressed recently.

155
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:26,450
Let's go and vent together. Together…

156
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,670
[Modern Sweet, Sweet Ice Cream]

157
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:21,900
I'd like… one hundred ice creams.

158
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,587
One hundred? Can you finish them?

159
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,114
I'll return them if I can't.

160
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,670
- Making trouble?
- What's wrong with making trouble?

161
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,464
How dare you make trouble.

162
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:40,598
Senior Sister.

163
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:43,073
Nice to meet you, upperclassman!

164
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:45,533
Your new shop has opened and we're here to help.

165
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,188
Okay, that's enough. We've got lots of orders from that big company.

166
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:52,231
Perfect timing then! Bring these across the street for us.

167
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:55,666
- Okay.
- Okay, no problem. Let's go.

168
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,779
- Mia.
- What's the matter?

169
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,079
Su Mu…

170
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,485
I think he's back to not speaking.

171
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,626
Why?

172
00:13:07,626 --> 00:13:08,933
Wasn't he okay yesterday?

173
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:10,421
I don't know either.

174
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:13,118
Maybe something has happened since then.

175
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,116
That shouldn't be.

176
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:19,400
He moved into our old place.

177
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,664
It's very quiet there.

178
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:24,887
I think we should find him a psychiatrist.

179
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:28,800
Why don't we wait for Hui Zi's friend to get back?

180
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,833
As for other doctors, he certainly wouldn't want to go.

181
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,364
His sickness… He's been like this for several years.

182
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:36,360
He's never gotten treatment.

183
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,896
It's all relieved by drinking iced water.

184
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,048
How did he suddenly get so much better yesterday?

185
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,943
Could it have been the ice cream?

186

Ice cream?

187
00:13:58,065 --> 00:14:00,615
Can ice cream relieve anxiety?

188
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:01,882
Hey, I'm not sure either.

189
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,864
Why don't we buy one for him to try?

190
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:06,800
He likes cold foods.

191
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,498

199

You, go. Hurry up, go.

200

Hello, sir. Welcome.

Why did he order again?

210
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,245
To give it a try, I guess?

211

Here's your "Sweet Sweet."

Hey. He has a lot of money.

Or maybe finding you?

- Hmm?
- …my guess is

260
00:19:56,133 --> 00:19:58,670
that he's a total Gemini.

261
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,866
A Gemini and your sign are mutually counteracting.

262

No, there is.

Let me tell you.

267
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,256
For a Gemini and your sign,

268
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,633
mutual growth is greater than mutual counteraction.

00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:51,466
What's wrong?

332
00:25:10,689 --> 00:25:14,887
Exhausted after work and my bike breaks down.

333
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:17,172
How do I fix this?

334
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:29,495
Big surprise.

335
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,515
What are you doing? Always appearing out of nowhere, you're scaring me.

336
00:25:37,515 --> 00:25:40,035
Can you just stay away from me?

337
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,517
D-D-Don't break it…

338
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:50,722
As long as he treats you well, he can even reverse your bad luck.

339
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,556
For a Gemini and your sign,

340
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:01,600
mutual growth is greater than mutual counteraction.

341
00:27:01,602 --> 00:27:05,169
Provided that you follow him.

342
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:06,664
Just following him, right?

343
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:10,066
No problem, I get to avoid looking at his weird face.

344
00:27:18,414 --> 00:27:19,766
Hey, one of the lovers.

345
00:27:19,766 --> 00:27:20,830
It's nothing like that!

346
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:23,058
Don't quarrel, be good!

347
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:51,898
How can I follow him though?

348
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,200
He's so strange.

349
00:27:55,931 --> 00:27:58,206
Let's talk about it then.

350
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,858
Oh, hey, Mom!

351
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,580
Darling, hi! We've arrived!

352
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,433
Hey, let me tell you, this hotel is so opulent!

353
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:17,802
Have a look! Have a look!

354
00:28:17,802 --> 00:28:19,864
How are you? Are you back home safe?

355
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:23,364
Look, I just got home. It was crazy busy at the shop today.

356
00:28:23,366 --> 00:28:25,401
Fortunately, Li Di and the others helped.

357
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:26,933
Oh, that's great!

358
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:29,833
What's so good? You left to go on holiday with Dad.

359
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:33,066
I've arranged a candlelight dinner tonight.

360
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:37,000
Dad, can you stop thinking of your wife and think about me for once?

361
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,214
Is that possible?

362
00:28:38,214 --> 00:28:40,398
All right, darling. We have to go now.

363
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,319
Time to go for dinner. Bye-bye!

364
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,717
Okay, bye.

365
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,085
Could it be that it's really because of her?

366
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,466
What is this?

367
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:46,900
I guess I'm hungry.

368
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:07,733
The delivery is pretty fast.

369
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,700
You again?

370
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,538
What are you doing?

371
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,813
I want you.

372
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,630
♫ In the season I got to know you ♫

373
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:40,500
♫ Recalling the sea breeze brushing against our faces ♫

374
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,960
♫ Maybe it was the best part ♫

375
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,813
♫ Inadvertently ♫

376
00:31:46,813 --> 00:31:52,160
♫ Dreams weren't fulfilled at that time ♫

377
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:58,800
♫ You just barged into my sight ♫

378
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,130
♫ I can always protect you ♫

379
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:13,044
♫ But I miss you so much from the bottom of my heart ♫

380
00:32:13,044 --> 00:32:17,030
♫ This is the most precious memory ♫

381
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:23,300
♫ Meeting you in the late summer ♫

382
00:32:26,537 --> 00:32:33,537
♫ Fireworks raise their heads gorgeously into the night sky ♫

383
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:40,430
♫ That innocence and helplessness is given
to this evening breeze ♫

384
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:48,209
♫ You must have faith that we can be together, smiling ♫

385
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:53,930
♫ You and I cannot live with goodbyes ♫
