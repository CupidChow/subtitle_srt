This is my fourth time meeting that mute, staring weirdo.

26
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:55,231
From the moment he showed up, all my troubles began.

27
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:57,300
My name is Tian Tiande.

28
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,800
I'd always been a beautiful girl, and lucky as a four-leaf clover, too.

29

I love painting and playing baseball.

00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:06,636
My dream is to build an extraordinarily beautiful house.

31
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:09,100
I grew up in a loving family.

32
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,200
My parents run an ice cream shop.

33
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,366
Though small, it's filled to the brim with my family's love.

34
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:21,633
I've lived in this palatial home since I was a kid, too.

35
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:26,266
I never thought that a glimmering pearl like me

would be crushed to dust by him on that fateful day.

Sorry to make you all wait.

38
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:24,296
Our current aircraft design complies with international design standards.

We've only deviated by 0.02.

40
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:32,865
However, I've chosen to cancel this conference.

41
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,550
I'll need a week to devise a new plan with zero deviation.

42
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,693
My product must be perfect.

This is so Su Mu.

Mr. Zhou Mei says he's very interesting and that he's willing to give him time.

Thank you! I'm so sorry for the delay.

46
00:05:07,366 --> 00:05:10,733
Exactly how Su Mu expects people to react.

47
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,500
He's the only engineer here who dares to act like that.

48
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,216
Yeah, I'd never dare. He's a real pro.

Super cool!

What is the condition now?

51
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:43,266
Wind speed is six meters per second. The moving speed is 30 kilometers per hour.

52
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:45,833
Chip transmission is normal and is ready for testing.

53
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,300
You can start the interference program. Pay attention when analyzing the data.

I know, I'm already on my way.

All right, be careful!

58
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,900
Of course, I will! Anyway, I'm on my bike. I have to go.

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,531
Bye-bye!

60
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,509
Interference has started, data chip transmission is unaffected.

61
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,300

It looks like an aircraft.

What are you doing with this?

00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:59,783
It looks like photographic equipment. You have been following her…

92
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:01,779
Are you trying to take creepshots of her?

- Yes…
- It might be a creepshot…

106
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:47,841
This is a drone, nothing unusual. No camera installed.

107
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:52,600
But I don't think it was on the market yet. The transmission lock light is on.

108
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,522
It might have encountered some interference and locked itself.

109
00:09:55,524 --> 00:09:59,923
Hey, guy, you tracked its position and came to unlock it. Right?

110
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:04,500
- Oh…
- So, it stands to reason that

111
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,366
whoever smashed his drone

112
00:10:06,366 --> 00:10:09,200
should compensate him for the damage.

113
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,640
It wasn't creepshots.

00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:43,597
So, I'll be with you for the first half of the year.

164
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:46,400
No, we're not at all disappointed

165
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,466
that you failed the exam or that you want to retake it.

166
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:52,741
But the part about… wanting to stay with us…

167
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:56,333
don't rush your decision.

168
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,513
Well…You've been with us for more than twenty years.

169
00:14:01,513 --> 00:14:03,933
Together, day and night.

170
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,600
Your dad and I… have been looking forward to a two-person setup.

171
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,166
So you're blaming me?

172
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:11,900
She doesn't blame you for this.

173
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,333
But we were sure you'd pass the exam.

174
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,135
So our plans for the future didn't include you.

175
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:18,415
What plans?

176
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:21,952
A few weeks ago, your mother got us two tickets

177
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:24,399
to eight different countries in Southeast Asia;

178
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,697
a luxurious two-person tour package.

179
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:28,998
Two-person? Eight countries?

180
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:31,200
The shop is nearly squared away.

181
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,433
Your dad and I are going now to buy some travel essentials.

182
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,171
Daughter. Mu Mu. We're leaving now.

183
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:37,433
All right.

184
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:39,810
Yes, take care…

185
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,747
Oh, right.

186
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:47,086
Later, remember to hang up the signboard when you leave.

187
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,957
Aren't you overthinking it?

188
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:24,649
What's going on?

189
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:37,800
How did you find this place?

190
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,192
Why are you acting so shady!

191
00:15:42,118 --> 00:15:44,280
Hey, don't go in!

192
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:48,015
Help!

193
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:51,014
How am I hanging?

194
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:53,341
Help!

195
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:55,539
Help!

196
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,162
Hey! Big Brother! Big, Big Brother...

197
00:15:57,162 --> 00:15:59,043
Help me! Lend me a hand!

198
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:00,900
I'm hanging here.

199
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,607
Lend me a hand!

200
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,187
Okay?

201
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,733
Thank you!

202
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:10,703
Thank you!

203
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:16,533
Hey, are you a psycho?

204
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,412
Come back here!

205
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,400
Help!

206
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,366
What are you doing?

207
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:27,753
I got stuck.

208
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,130
[Future Tech: Wei Lai Aviation]

209
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,140
I heard today's flight test was a failure.

210
00:16:32,142 --> 00:16:33,412
The drone fell.

211
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:35,666
Really? What happened then?

212
00:16:35,666 --> 00:16:37,364
Hey, look!

213
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:38,733
Mr. Wang looks anxious.

214
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:41,698
He must be looking for a way to solve this.

215
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,285
Darling, I'm very busy.

216
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:47,812
I'm not lying to you.

217
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,333
I'm in the United Kingdom, yeah.

218
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,031
I'll definitely buy you the bag.

219
00:16:53,033 --> 00:16:55,066
And the shoes, too! I'll get you a pair.

220
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:57,433
And I'll be back soon to give them to you, okay?

221
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,575
All right, darling, I have to go now. Bye!

222
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:02,766
Hey, Su Mu. How did it go?

223
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:05,795
Hey, say something. What's the current situation?

224
00:17:05,795 --> 00:17:08,166
It's all over. Look at how down he is.

225
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,523
Nah, it's nothing.

226
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:12,366
He's a real genius. No machine can challenge him.

227
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:16,425
Why are you so careless today? Are you okay?

228
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:17,824
I…

229
00:17:19,766 --> 00:17:22,766
Hey, Mu Mu. What did that person do just before?

230
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:26,205
He left when he saw the shop was closed. Maybe he wanted ice cream.

231
00:17:26,205 --> 00:17:27,634
Did he say anything?

232
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:30,033
Not a word.

233
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,660
He keeps appearing out of nowhere.

234
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,797
Who? Do you know him?

235
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:38,022
He was the one who made me fall into the muddy ditch

236
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:39,719
and then, just before, he was the reason I got stuck.

237
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:42,687
That mute, staring weirdo!

238
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:45,540
He was easy on the eyes, though.

239
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,500
Sister, don't you see what I'm saying?

240
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,790
I know.

241
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,372
He inhibits you.

242
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,495
Inhibits me?

243
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:56,900
I'll explain.

244
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,764
Mercury has been retrograde for you recently,

245
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:02,279
meaning a person fated to meet you will appear.

246
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:06,098
This person will either help you survive the retrograde smoothly

247
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,566
or he will get you into big trouble.

248
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,800
So… what should I do?

249
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,866
If you want to meet him,

250
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:15,900
you need to try hard

251
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,237
not to be alone with him!

252
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:22,254
Otherwise, you'll be miserable.

253
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:27,066
Whatever, I need an ice cream to cool me down.

254
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:32,817
So that's the problem.

255
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,736
I didn't save the transmission data in time.

256
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,393
What should we do?

257
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:43,393
The chip is missing.

258
00:18:51,066 --> 00:18:52,966
However, according to your formula,

259
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,300
the deviation is about 0.02.

260
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,931
Although it's not completely to your standard,

261
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:59,633
it did meet the standards for the international consortium.

262
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,231
As long as we limit interference,

263
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:04,673
it's absolutely fine to go ahead with it.

264
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,456
All right… I got it.

265
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,598
Go back to your work.

266
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,870
I need to meet the client.

267
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:27,833
Get a glass of iced water for Su Mu.

268
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,614
No problem.

269
00:19:37,683 --> 00:19:40,836
What? He's stopped speaking again?

270
00:19:40,836 --> 00:19:42,481
He hasn't been like this for a while.

271
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,300
It seems that recent pressure has gotten to him.

272
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,866
He's already socially anxious.

273
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:49,333
He'll get like this if he's overstimulated or panicked.

274
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,200
We've got to help him relax.

275
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,902
Is he in any trouble?

276
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:58,276
I do not know.

277
00:19:58,276 --> 00:20:00,575
He started going over the data as soon as he came back.

278
00:20:00,577 --> 00:20:02,643
He didn't say a word.

279
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,726
When will he come out of it?

280
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:12,576
Generally, he drinks iced water to calm himself down.

281
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:15,190
But it takes at least two or three days, usually.

282
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,300
And it does look more serious this time.

283
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,866
Hey, why are you scurrying around?

284
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:30,566
Su Mu needs his ice water.

285
00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:33,047
Right, it is hot today.

286
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:36,831
- Hey, how about ice cream? We can get takeaway.
- Just what I was doing.

287
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:39,136
- Thanks!
- No prob.

288
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,043
Hello. I'm sorry, we're not yet open for business.

289
00:20:48,043 --> 00:20:50,870
The company right across the street? I'm sorry, we can't.

290
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,640
We are still…

291
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,130
Uh… hello? Sure, we can send it over.

292
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,570
What would you like?

293
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:02,610
Okay… B1503, Wei Lai Aviation?

294
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,765
Okay, no problem. We'll be right over!

295
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,828
Um, okay! Goodbye!

296
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:11,344
What are you doing? We aren't ready yet.

297
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:15,664
We've got the extra stuff. And it's a good sign of getting orders before we open. I'll deliver it.

298
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:17,454
All right then.

299
00:21:17,454 --> 00:21:19,260
Bye-bye!

300
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:23,233
Let go!

301
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:25,155
Why are you here?

302
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:28,610
Since you won't come to me, I have to come to you.

303
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,630
Why don't you come to see me?

304
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:33,470
I've been really busy lately.

305
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,141
Busy?

306
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:37,379
Busy dating other girls?

307
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,273
Yes!

308
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:46,900
Didn't we make it very clear? We're dating, but I have my own life and you have yours.

309
00:21:46,985 --> 00:21:51,166
I don't control you, you don't control me either.

310
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:55,900
I like you very much! But it doesn't mean that I belong to you.

311
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,100
What do you like about me?

312
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:03,020
Asshole!

313
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:10,800
Well… how was that? Feeling better now?

314
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,600
Not at all!

315
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,147
It's empty.

316
00:22:20,266 --> 00:22:22,133
Jerk!

317
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:24,966
Jerk!

318
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:29,909
What is going on?

319
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:32,143
Oh, just great…

320
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,900
Only one ice cream left.

321
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,800
But it was worth it.

322
00:22:44,894 --> 00:22:47,624
Su Mu, the meeting is on the 18th floor.

323
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,487
Uh oh!

324
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,973
Why are you here?

325
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:35,148
What are you doing?! What are you doing?

326
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:45,618
Why are you eating my ice cream?

327
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:14,208
Um, what's your zodiac sign? Gemini?

328
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:17,483
What do you really want?

329
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:20,433
Do you want me to compensate you? You can call me!

330
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:25,992
Or you can give me a price, so that I know what to expect. Okay?

331
00:24:42,203 --> 00:24:45,592
He must be a Gemini. He is too unpredictable.

332
00:24:45,592 --> 00:24:48,392
What kind of person does that?

333
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:02,942
Let's get to the meeting.

334
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,810
Strange.

335
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,909
This is just great… Now I've got no ice cream.

336
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:14,545
Still… Why is he here?

337
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:18,266
Is he following me?

338
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:22,989
Or maybe he works here?

339
00:25:23,833 --> 00:25:27,966
I can't be that unlucky. Ah!

340
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:30,442
No way! Here it is again!

341
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:32,914
Help!

342
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:35,664
- Where's the ice cream?
- The elevator broke.

343
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,620
- I guess they were too lazy to deliver it.
- Forget it! Maybe tomorrow, then!

344
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,030
Forget it! Maybe tomorrow, then!

345
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,979
Su Mu, how are you? Feeling better?

346
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:49,766
Oh, yeah. I'm feeling more relaxed now. I'm less anxious.

347
00:25:49,766 --> 00:25:53,864
I lost the chip but I'll get it re-tested soon.

348
00:25:53,864 --> 00:25:57,440
I know if it's not 100% perfect you won't agree to launch.

349
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,530
Is one week enough? If not, just go slow. Hui Zi spoke with Shen Hai.

350
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,160
They're willing to wait for you.

351
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:07,359
I said I only need a week.

352
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,900
Do you want to relocate to another office? I want to give you more quiet to work.

353
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,800
No, it's not good if others know about it. And anyhow, I'm going to test out on Mt. Xingyue soon.

354
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:24,169
All right… Well, we're rarely in our second home.

355
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:29,098
You move in there. It'll be quieter and more convenient.

356
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:34,368
- I'll send you there later, then?
- Okay.

357
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,437
Where have you been?

358
00:26:58,437 --> 00:27:01,370
You were totally right. I'm so unlucky!

359
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,430
I got trapped in the elevator.

360
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:07,400
You do really seem unlucky lately.

361
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,070
It was all because I ran into that staring weirdo. He even ate my ice cream.

362
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,900
Then when he got out of the elevator, the elevator broke down.

363
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,938
You have to stay away from him!

364
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:18,866
Hey, let's go!

365
00:27:18,866 --> 00:27:21,669
What? Go where?

366
00:27:28,566 --> 00:27:31,466
There's nothing for it then. It's time for a drink.

367
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:37,323
Come on, let's go! If we don't hurry, he might pop up again!

368

[Modern Sweet, Sweet Ice Cream]

370
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,200
- Is he back?
- I have sent him back, yes. Rest assured, the investors remain confident.

371
00:28:10,264 --> 00:28:13,649
Tell him to do the test without worrying. No stress.

372
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah… For the time being, I've asked him to move to my Xingyue villa. It's more quiet there.

373
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,266
But his problem still requires a solution.

374
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:27,474
Listen, I know a psychiatrist, coming back from Northern Europe soon. How about giving it a try?

375
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:30,612
Good! I'll send him there when the time comes.

376
00:28:30,612 --> 00:28:32,537
Okay, let's meet up to chat soon.

377
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:36,101
Good. Anyway, talk later. Bye-bye!

378
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,830
Why are you here?

379
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,590
Are you in a daze? Get in.

380
00:28:58,066 --> 00:29:01,400
So many things happened after you met.

381
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,233
He must be a very important person in your life, right?

382
00:29:05,233 --> 00:29:09,233
A person to ruin your life.

383
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:12,466
Do you think he's your soulmate?

384
00:29:12,466 --> 00:29:15,137
How could that be?

385
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:17,383
That mouth…

386
00:29:19,032 --> 00:29:21,529
Those eyes…

387
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:23,790
That smile…

388
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,301
How was it?

389
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:30,400
Not bad.

390
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:39,400
You know, thinking about it… people around you, except for that guy Li Di, who's also a man,

391
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,400
I haven't seen any men around you yet. Have you ever been in love?

392
00:29:44,464 --> 00:29:48,953
Of course! I'm an old veteran of love!

393
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,946
And you?

394
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:52,879
I…

395
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:55,390
I've had my fair share.

396
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,785
I'm sure, I'm sure.

397
00:29:57,785 --> 00:29:59,055
- Mu Mu.
- Hm?

398
00:29:59,057 --> 00:30:01,500
What kind of guy do you hope to meet?

399
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:05,659
One who's… reliable.

400
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,133
and loves me.

401
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:08,773
What about you?

402
00:30:09,866 --> 00:30:11,500
Me?

403
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,633
I want to find one

404
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:16,227
who'll watch the stars with me.

405
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:31,146
Okay, you go have a bath. I'll take care of it.

406
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:54,558
Why are you still up, Mom?

407
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:57,151
I'm leaving tomorrow, I have to wash your clothes.

408
00:30:57,153 --> 00:30:58,633
And this too.

409
00:30:58,633 --> 00:30:59,862
Wash it yourself!

410
00:31:00,266 --> 00:31:01,728
Okay.

411
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:05,351
You smell like alcohol.

412
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:07,118
Who did you drink with?

413
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,933
I drank some with Mu Mu.

414
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:12,434
It's not safe for girls to go out and drink at night.

415
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:13,707
Yeah, I got it.

416
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:16,500
Hurry and get to bed. I have a plane to catch tomorrow.

417
00:31:19,932 --> 00:31:21,398
What's this?

418
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:25,760
That house has been empty for several years.

419
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,600
Someone's finally inside?

420
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,733
Looks like…

421
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:32,384
Looks like what? Get to bed!

422
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,196
I've stocked everything you need.

423
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:11,898
If you need anything else, I'll have someone bring it to you tomorrow.

424
00:32:12,924 --> 00:32:14,533
Dry your hair.

425

And don't feel too much pressure.

426
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,065
Got it?

427
00:32:20,034 --> 00:32:21,790
I'll leave now.

428
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,966

What are you doing, Mom?

431
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:04,002
We're leaving for our flight.

432
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:05,598
You sleep till noon every day.

433
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,267
Look how messy this room is!

434
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:08,966
What kind of girl are you?

435
00:33:08,966 --> 00:33:11,474
Hurry up and get ready!

436
00:33:11,474 --> 00:33:14,600
Daughter, hurry up! The shop is open today.

437
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,798
Mu Mu will be in trouble if she's alone.

438
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,845
Go help her!

439
00:33:17,847 --> 00:33:20,564
Oh and don't forget to clean the drain after washing.

440
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:21,993
Your hair will plug it up.

441
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:24,143
Oh, and something's wrong with the shower head,

442
00:33:24,145 --> 00:33:25,700
remember to get someone to fix it!

443
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,498
Got it!

444
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,533
Don't be a bad girl!

445
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:33,000
Oh, bye-bye.

446
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,066

447
00:33:42,066 --> 00:33:44,700
